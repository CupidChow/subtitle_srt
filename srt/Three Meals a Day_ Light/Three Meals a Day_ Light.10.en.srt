00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:09,224
(It will be boiled after adding
all of the prepared vegetables)

181
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:12,063
(The hot fire is paired
with Yeolmoa)

182
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:13,584
I think it's boiling.

183
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:16,144
(Scorched rice is boiling
within a split second)

184
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:17,584
Okay. I'm coming.

185
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,464
Okay. Fine.

186
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,264
It's boiling well.

187
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,464
I think it's cooked.

188
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:27,823
(This scorched rice has
a very savory smell)

189
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:29,344
Okay.

190
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,624
(He removes the scorched rice
that is ready)

191
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,744
(And places doenjang jjigae
on the brazier)

192
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:41,704
The color is different than
the one you made before.

193
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:42,464
Why?

194
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:45,504
I think it was redder before.

195
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:47,584
This looks cleaner.

196
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:49,384
No, it will turn red soon.

197
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:50,664
Really?

198
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:52,664
(Adding chili powder)

199
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:54,784
(It is turning red)

200
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,943
We made this using that broth.

201
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,384
- The bone broth?
- Yes.

202
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,304
(They use the bone broth
in many ways)

203
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:05,943
We are going to finish
everything up.

204
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,224
Do you know that there are
no chilies left there?

205
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:10,224
(They used up the vegetables
from the patch too)

206
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:11,624
That looks good.

207
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,664
(Once the stew is boiling)

208
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:17,384
(Add chives)

209
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:18,704
(If you add chives
to doenjang jjigae,)

210
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,464
(it will reduce the saltiness
and add more texture to the stew)

211
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,864
(Checking)

212
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:30,144
- Tofu?
- Pass me the tofu.

213
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:32,904
(Haejin is
the ever-ready assistant)

214
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:37,984
(Add tofu that is a must-have
ingredient in doenjang jjigae)

215
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:40,544
(Petty trick)

216
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:43,624
(Cover it with a lid and
let it boil)

217
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,384
We can remove that from heat
in a bit.

218
00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:49,184
(Waiting)

219
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:53,784
(Doenjang jjigae is ready)

220
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:55,344
Set up the frying pan.

221
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:58,664
(The final dish is fried egg)

222
00:11:59,144 --> 00:12:01,864
Honey, please get me those eggs.

223
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:08,504
(Transporting the precious eggs)

224
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:17,704
(He carefully breaks the eggs)

225
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:22,984
(Chef Cha's white sunny side up)

226
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:24,224
(Haejin just watches him)

227
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,504
I want mine to be fully cooked.

228
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:28,464
What?

229
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:30,504
Fried egg.

230
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,304
Okay. Let's do that.

231
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:34,464
(Today, Chef Cha will cook
according to Haejin's preference)

232
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:38,144
(He breaks the yolk)

233
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:41,024
(Flip it)

234
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:45,464
(Both sides of the eggs
are cooked completely)

235
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:50,504
(This is Haejin's' favorite)

236
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:53,664
(Completely cooked fried eggs
are ready)

237
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:55,344
I'll serve our rice now.

238
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:56,704
Yes.

239
00:12:57,264 --> 00:13:00,784
(While Haejin is serving rice)

240
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:03,904
(Seungwon scoops out
doenjang jjigae)

241
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:08,744
(Lots of ingredients too)

242
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:13,144
Let's put it over there.

243
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:20,224
(Savory scorched rice)

244
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:26,264
(Haejin's favorite
fully-cooked fried eggs)

245
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,424
(Stir-fried kimchi from
their first day here)

246
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:32,424
(Chef Cha's quick chives geotjeori
made with available ingredients)

247
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:34,344
(Stir-fried fern)

248
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:37,424
(Doenjang jjigae made from
rich bone broth too)

249
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:42,664
(Their final meal at Mount Jiri
is ready)

250
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:48,624
Bon appetit.

251
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:52,864
(He starts with scorched rice)

252
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:55,984
Do you want a plate?

253
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,464
(Haejin must've been craving
fully-cooked fried eggs)

254
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:02,824
Just wait.

255
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:07,224
(He gets plates)

256
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:08,584
Let's eat.

257
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:11,824
(It's time to enjoy
their final meal)

258
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:15,104
I haven't had this kind of
fried eggs in a long time.

259
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:16,264
Why?

260
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:18,584
(Seungwon loves half-cooked eggs.
Haejin loves cooked eggs)

261
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:21,984
(Even Seungwon who enjoys
half-cooked eggs)

262
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:24,584
(And Haejin who loves
completely cooked eggs)

263
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,744
(Both are enjoying
this delicious meal)

264
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:31,224
(He tastes
their doenjang jjigae too)

265
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:33,944
This is delicious.

266
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,744
Eating the stew on its own
tastes good too.

267
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:46,824
- You used that?
- Our broth.

268
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,784
The broth
made a lot of difference.

269
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:50,024
Right?

270
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:52,864
We ate using this broth 3 times.

271
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,984
What did we make? Gom...

272
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:56,504
We made rice cake soup.

273
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:59,224
(Rice cake soup, budae jjigae,
and doenjang jjigae)

274
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:02,424
We finished everything up
to make those dishes.

275
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:04,144
- We did.
- Right?

276
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:08,184
(They know how to use what
they have to cook)

277
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:12,224
(From the stir-fried kimchi
from their first day here)

278
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,304
(to the stir-fried fern
made on their last day)

279
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:18,584
(He eats chives geotjeori too)

280
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:24,824
(Familiar, homey, and tasty 3
Meals A Day signature breakfast)

281
00:15:28,544 --> 00:15:29,944
That was a good meal.

282
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,784
The doenjang jjigae...

283
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:34,264
What about it?

284
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:37,304
It has always been good.

285
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:41,344
(The feeling of fullness
from familiarity)

286
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:45,944
(After enjoying
their satisfying breakfast)

287
00:15:46,304 --> 00:15:50,384
We just have to pack our things
after our meal, right?

288
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:53,624
(All they have to do
is to clean up)

289
00:15:57,144 --> 00:15:58,224
Put the clean ones over there?

290
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:00,424
For now, after we clean them...

291
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,624
But...

292
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:04,384
(They are still arguing
until the last moment)

293
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:06,304
Can't we leave them here?

294
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,824
(They come to an agreement)

295
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:13,264
(They quietly start
to do the dishes)

296
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:24,784
(They are almost done
with cleaning up)

297
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:30,504
(The things that they've used
together all this time)

298
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:35,304
(They are returned
to their original places)

299
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:41,944
(Everything looks like how they
were when they first arrived)

300
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:51,144
(They put their fun memories
behind and get ready to leave)

301
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:53,264
We spent a lot of good times here.

302
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:55,944
Thank you for everything.

303
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:02,104
(They leave this 3 Meals House
in Mount Jiri)

304
00:17:12,384 --> 00:17:16,944
(Journey of '3 Meals A Day Light'
ends after 3 months)

305
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:20,664
(Not long after
the hot summer ends)

306
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:26,264
(One afternoon in late fall)

307
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:34,544
(Seungwon is waiting as
he arrived very early)

308
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:37,184
I heard you watched that.

309
00:17:37,863 --> 00:17:39,064
Where did you go?

310
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,064
Cheongju.

311
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,623
(Seungwon went to Cheongju to
watch Haejin in a play)

312
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:44,904
I wouldn't have gone if
they held it in Seoul)

313
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,824
Why would I do that?

314
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:49,664
Why not?

315
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:51,304
It wouldn't look like
something great.

316
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:56,704
(He needs his effort to
go there be known)

317
00:17:56,824 --> 00:18:00,064
(While they are going through
the theory of friendship)

318
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:01,304
Hello.

319
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:03,544
(Here comes the one who
manifests his friendship)

320
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:04,824
Nice!

321
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:06,104
You look good!

322
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:07,224
Great!

323
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:10,744
(Haejin appears with
a more modern look)

324
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,504
(He is somewhat different from
when he was in 3 Meals House)

325
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:16,863
- What is this?
- What?

326
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:19,824
(Similar look)

327
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:22,344
Even our inner shirt is similar.

328
00:18:22,464 --> 00:18:24,024
Wonderful.

329
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,264
This is what I usually wear.

330
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:28,944
(Chat of city men)

331
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:30,623
You have to dress up like this.

332
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:31,984
The issues with this is that

333
00:18:32,104 --> 00:18:34,704
people will keep on telling me
to become an actor.

334
00:18:36,904 --> 00:18:40,824
(The reaction of those around him
is not easy for him to handle)

335
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:43,984
(Now we know the reason
he is under-dressed)

336
00:18:44,104 --> 00:18:46,704
Your hair looks good too.

337
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:48,224
You let your hair grow.

338
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,504
I did.

339
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:52,863
Your hair at the back is long.
This is the shaggy cut.

340
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:55,464
Yes. Shaggy cut.

341
00:18:57,744 --> 00:18:59,504
I was about to call it Lion King.

342
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:04,464
(The shooting starts on a high
note thanks to Haejin's style)

343
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:07,424
Have you heard about
this morning show's concept?

344
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:09,304
I heard it's like
'Morning Corner.'

345
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:10,623
Run in while waving.

346
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:14,064
(Today's shooting concept
is a morning talk show)

347
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:16,304
(To suit a morning talk show)

348
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:20,623
(We are preparing the studio
for the shoot)

349
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:24,304
(Today, the staff
will become their audience)

350
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,863
Let's do this.

351
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:29,863
(The cast head to the studio)

352
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:33,704
You're like a New Yorker who
enjoys his coffee.

353
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:37,304
I want some coffee.

354
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:43,464
(With Haejin who is like
a true city man)

355
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:47,064
(On the way to the studio)

356
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:50,984
Hello.

357
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:55,064
(Despite knowing the concept)

358
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:56,704
We have an audience?

359
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:12,128
(Very proactive)

360
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:14,168
What is this?

361
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:15,368
I can't believe this.

362
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,328
(The first time we're having
an open concept for this show)

363
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:21,808
(Prowling out of embarrassment)

364
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,648
Stand there.

365
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:25,208
You have to come out
when I call for you.

366
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,288
(We are not filming
'3 Meals A Day' now)

367
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:30,408
(They have to follow the host)

368
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:32,728
This is so embarrassing.

369
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:35,568
(The guests are on stand-by)

370
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:50,688
(We Love Cooking, We Love People)

371
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:52,768
Hello to all of our viewers
from everywhere.

372
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,848
This is a well-known show.

373
00:20:55,247 --> 00:21:00,368
I have invited the two cast
members of '3 Meals A Day Light'.

374
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,968
We will now spend some time

375
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,728
to know about their cooking
philosophy, life journey

376
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,128
and much more.

377
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,368
Let's welcome both our emcees.

378
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:13,528
(Today's guests)

379
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,088
Hello.

380
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:19,288
(Actor Yoo Haejin,
Actor Cha Seungwon)

381
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:21,208
You look more handsome in person.

382
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:22,768
Thank you.

383
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:25,088
I was surprised.

384
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,208
Nice to meet you.

385
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,007
This is my first time being
in a studio for this show.

386
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:32,968
Viewers from all over Korea

387
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:36,328
have been waiting to listen
to stories about '3 Meals A Day.'

388
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:40,088
But somehow these are all
familiar faces.

389
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:43,608
(The viewers for today
look like their production crew)

390
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:44,928
I met all of them before.

391
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:47,968
The probability of becoming part
of our audience is 1 to 1,000.

392
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:49,408
Yes!

393
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:51,688
They look very familiar.

394
00:21:51,808 --> 00:21:54,448
That's not true.
They just look alike.

395
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:57,608
'3 Meals A Day' received
a lot of attention this season

396
00:21:57,728 --> 00:21:59,128
and is about to wrap up.

397
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:02,888
I would like to ask Haejin
how he feels

398
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:04,648
about this season.

399
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:07,048
It was extremely hot.

400
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:10,168
It was very hot.

401
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,888
We haven't had this show
for quite some time.

402
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:16,448
So I was reminded of
our old days.

403
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,888
I enjoyed my time on this show.

404
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:20,608
Seungwon, please share
how you feel as well.

405
00:22:20,728 --> 00:22:23,848
If there is something that
I actually wish for,

406
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:28,288
it is for us to have higher
viewer rating for this season.

407
00:22:28,408 --> 00:22:31,007
That would make me very happy.

408
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:32,888
Sorry but

409
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:36,208
a complaint was given to
the Communications Commission.

410
00:22:36,328 --> 00:22:39,608
Producer Jang Eunjeong and
Writer Choi Jaeyeong said

411
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:43,728
they'll quit being on this team if
you keep calling them so often.

412
00:22:44,768 --> 00:22:45,928
He would just call and ask,

413
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:47,648
'Jaeyeong, how is
the viewer rating?

414
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,648
Eunjeong,
is the editing going well?'

415
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,768
'Jaeyeong, did we achieve
our target viewer rating?'

416
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:56,968
'Perhaps if we talk about
the capital and all of Korea,

417
00:22:57,088 --> 00:22:58,528
our rating would increase.'

418
00:22:58,648 --> 00:23:01,728
It's because he loves this show.

419
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,168
I doubt he can fix this habit.

420
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:05,968
Even when he acts in movies...

421
00:23:06,088 --> 00:23:07,728
He has been like this
since he was young?

422
00:23:07,848 --> 00:23:09,768
He's still acting this way
at this age.

423
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:12,088
He is always progressing.

424
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,288
When I hear him talk,

425
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,487
he goes 'sizzle, sizzle.'

426
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:17,768
- He sizzles like oil.
- The human oil.

427
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:20,487
He is the human cooking oil
that sizzles.

428
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,208
- He loves this show.
- Yes, that's true.

429
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:28,528
I believe people around you
would say something too.

430
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:30,048
Maybe your family members.

431
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:32,168
The way this show goes is funny.

432
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,848
Yet, he still acts
as the host nonchalantly.

433
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:38,848
(Even actors find it hard
to act in this skit)

434
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:41,648
This system is so weird.

435
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:44,528
I'm thinking of this whole studio
as a stage.

436
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:47,208
Yes, this is.

437
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,368
Reaction from people around me...

438
00:23:49,487 --> 00:23:52,487
The best reaction
I received so far

439
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:57,168
is when Haejin added kimchi
to the masterpiece

440
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:58,928
that I made.

441
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:02,048
I got hit because of that.

442
00:24:02,168 --> 00:24:05,048
(Kimchi incident left a strong
impact from the first episode)

443
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:08,408
(When they were preparing
their first meal in Pyeongchang)

444
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,728
I'll get another two chilies.
Let's make it spicier.

445
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:14,968
(While Chef Cha was away
for a moment)

446
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:17,088
It'll be nice to add kimchi to it.

447
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:20,528
(Haejin added kimchi to
the gochujang jjigae)

448
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:24,168
Why did you add kimchi here?

449
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,768
I only added a bit.

450
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:28,328
I don't want to cook.

451
00:24:28,448 --> 00:24:30,888
(The first case when Chef Cha
decided to stop cooking)

452
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:32,768
Come here.

453
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:37,208
(Thankfully, with their chemistry
as friends for 10 years)

454
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:42,247
- I thought it'd taste better.
- Why did you add kimchi?

455
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,528
(Happy ending)

456
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,768
You added kimchi
while I was away.

457
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:53,928
It would've been bad if
I didn't add kimchi to it.

458
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:56,808
It's because we wouldn't have
any main topic to talk about.

459
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,247
You definitely gave us
a big topic to talk about.

460
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:00,968
Honestly, at that time...

461
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:07,007
(Why is there a mosquito
in the studio?)

462
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:11,808
Since we have
a large audience today,

463
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:15,528
those watching on TV

464
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:19,648
would not be able to imagine
how our dishes tasted.

465
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,728
Today, I'll make gochujang jjigae.

466
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:26,728
You can taste the gochujang jjigae
that I make.

467
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:28,247
Our audience right here?

468
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:30,448
Then taste the one with kimchi.

469
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:31,768
(The audience suddenly has
to judge the taste)

470
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:33,568
Taste how it is.

471
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:35,368
Yes, we look forward to that.

472
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,248
For that, we have prepared...

473
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:40,768
I think this whole situation
right now is funny.

474
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:42,808
Get back to your senses.

475
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:45,448
Okay, we have to do that.

476
00:25:45,888 --> 00:25:47,888
How could you be so
immersed in your role?

477
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:51,128
(Production crew of this show:
Play the role as the audience)

478
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:53,848
You make me focus too.

479
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:56,368
(The amazing act by the staff
help these actors to focus too)

480
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,728
We have prepared this corner
for you.

481
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,968
This is the first dish.

482
00:26:00,488 --> 00:26:03,448
'If Only Kimchi was Not Added
to the Dish Back Then.'

483
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:05,248
That is the first corner.

484
00:26:05,368 --> 00:26:06,808
Please start making
gochujang jjigae.

485
00:26:12,248 --> 00:26:14,648
(1st Corner: If Only Kimchi was
Not Added to the Dish Back Then)

486
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:17,088
(Into the Gochujang Jjigae)

487
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,088
We're making gochujang jjigae.

488
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:22,768
So, we obviously need
to add gochujang.

489
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:27,008
I will also add salted shrimp
to increase the umami flavor.

490
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:30,248
This was what I heard
back in those days.

491
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:35,768
Instead of only adding gochujang
to gochujang jjigae,

492
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,488
we should add soybean paste too.

493
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:40,448
Actor Kang Sung-jin was the one
who told me about it.

494
00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:41,768
(Hmm)

495
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:44,968
If we add 2 spoons of gochujang
and 1 spoon of soybean paste,

496
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:46,248
the dish becomes tastier.

497
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:48,488
That's what I heard.

498
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,728
Seongjin can make it that way.

499
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,728
I shouldn't have brought that up.

500
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:59,168
Then I will add some soybean
paste.

501
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:01,408
Let me try doing that.

502
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:05,128
These three and
where is the salted shrimp?

503
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,048
It's at the back.

504
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,808
The audience...

505
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,968
Our audience knows
where the items are at.

506
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:15,848
These are the base ingredients
to make this dish.

507
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:22,088
(Gochujang, salted shrimp,
soybean paste, chili powder)

508
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,808
Sorry to interrupt you
but can I ask a question?

509
00:27:24,928 --> 00:27:25,848
Chef Cha.

510
00:27:25,968 --> 00:27:28,608
Are you sure those are all
we need?

511
00:27:29,168 --> 00:27:31,048
We need more than these.

512
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:34,088
When we watched you cooking
at 3 Meals House,

513
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:36,448
you added something white
and many more...

514
00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:39,888
You cannot bring out
the umami taste with just these.

515
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:42,048
In order to make it taste richer,

516
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:45,768
we need something that we usually
call MSG.

517
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:47,208
We need that magic powder.

518
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,648
Is it this thing?

519
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,728
The beautiful circular item?

520
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:52,768
(Beautiful circle)

521
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,448
Yes, you are right.

522
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:59,168
We need that to perfect our dish.

523
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:03,768
There are people who dislike it.

524
00:28:03,888 --> 00:28:06,928
But there are many other
ingredients that are worse.

525
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:08,968
Such as?

526
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,648
Eating habits and such.

527
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:13,408
As an example,
eating a lot late at night.

528
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:16,208
(I see)

529
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:17,448
You have to work hard.

530
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:19,648
(The staff, no, audience
forgot their role)

531
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:24,688
Do you have an A4 paper?

532
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:28,808
(Haejin gets a paper and pen)

533
00:28:29,728 --> 00:28:32,448
(He starts
to write something down)

534
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:39,408
These are what we need to add
to gochujang jjigae.

535
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:45,528
Squash, onion, potatoes
and mushroom.

536
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:48,088
A bit of oyster mushroom.

537
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:51,488
Spicy chili and red chili
to add color to the dish.

538
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:53,048
Those are all we need.

539
00:28:53,168 --> 00:28:55,368
The most important thing
is we add pork

540
00:28:55,488 --> 00:28:57,328
to gochujang jjigae, don't we?

541
00:28:57,448 --> 00:28:58,408
So for the pork...

542
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,248
- Shall I get it for you?
- Yes.

543
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:03,768
I mentioned that we need
pork shoulder for this.

544
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:07,568
Is this pork shoulder?

545
00:29:07,688 --> 00:29:09,768
(The guest is farsighted)

546
00:29:09,888 --> 00:29:11,048
I'm sorry, but even I...

547
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,608
(The emcee is the same too)

548
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:14,128
Yes, this is pork shoulder.

549
00:29:14,248 --> 00:29:15,088
Pork shoulder.

550
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,448
It's pork shoulder.

551
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:20,408
Today, I will start

552
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:23,408
by stir-frying the pork
before adding the rest.

553
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,968
(Ah)

554
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:29,768
(He gives direction to get
better audience reaction)

555
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,928
(That is why he needed
the paper and pen)

556
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:34,728
As I mentioned earlier,

557
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,168
we need two onions.

558
00:29:38,848 --> 00:29:42,368
Next is two potatoes.

559
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:44,888
(I see)

560
00:29:45,008 --> 00:29:46,448
(Output)

561
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:49,848
We need Cheongyang chilies
to make it spicy.

562
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:51,568
So we'll add around 3.

563
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:55,008
I will also add around
2 red chilies too.

564
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,928
Those are what I will add
to this dish.

565
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:01,968
We need Welsh onions too.

566
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:04,568
Everything has been cleaned.

567
00:30:04,688 --> 00:30:05,568
Amazing.

568
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:07,368
Where is the garlic?

569
00:30:07,488 --> 00:30:08,488
They must've minced them too.

570
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:10,408
Do we have garlic
that has been pounded?

571
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:14,048
- At the back.
- I was anxious just now.

572
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:17,008
Minced garlic.

573
00:30:17,488 --> 00:30:20,768
These are all the basic
ingredients that we need.

574
00:30:21,248 --> 00:30:23,288
Right now, Chef,

575
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,088
since time is passing,

576
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:26,688
shall I boil water?

577
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:28,488
No, we don't need to do that
right now.

578
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,968
Right?

579
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:34,048
We don't need to boil water.
For now...

580
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,048
We need to prepare
the ingredients?

581
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:38,048
We have to cut
the vegetables first.

582
00:30:43,848 --> 00:30:46,048
This is how I do it.

583
00:30:46,568 --> 00:30:48,128
I always put them in a bowl.

584
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,088
I put the ones that I have
cut in a bowl.

585
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:52,688
They look like avocado
when they've been cut.

586
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:56,928
And potatoes...

587
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,648
You seem to cut the potato
in random sizes.

588
00:31:02,768 --> 00:31:05,248
Cutting vegetables in cubes
makes the stew

589
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:07,448
tastier, doesn't it?

590
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:09,288
Yes, that's right.

591
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:11,968
If we add kimchi...

592
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:16,888
Do you have specific measurement

593
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,928
or does it depend
on how you feel that day?

594
00:31:19,048 --> 00:31:20,368
It changes all the time.

595
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:22,488
- You follow your heart?
- Yes.

596
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,328
I'm not a professional chef.

597
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:27,768
I learned how to cook
not in the conventional way.

598
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:31,688
So, that's why I just add
what I want. Onion.

599
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,088
The most important ingredient in
gochujang jjigae is onion.

600
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,528
Yes, you used a lot of onions.

601
00:31:35,648 --> 00:31:38,048
It's because onion
gives it the sweet flavor.

602
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:40,008
Some people don't add
sugar at all

603
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:43,448
and only get the sweetness
out of onions.

604
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,688
I don't do that.

605
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:47,488
So you use sugar?

606
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:50,008
Yes, I do.

607
00:31:50,128 --> 00:31:53,128
However, you don't have to
if you don't want to.

608
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:54,768
Just put in lots of onions.

609
00:31:54,888 --> 00:31:56,688
If you add lots of onion,

610
00:31:56,808 --> 00:31:58,968
you have to let the stew
simmer for a long time.

611
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:02,208
You have to simmer it
for a long time

612
00:32:02,928 --> 00:32:04,888
until the onions are soft.

613
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,728
What about you?

614
00:32:06,848 --> 00:32:11,088
However, I don't do that.
I just add sugar.

615
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:16,568
It's because I cook in a way
best suited for '3 Meals A Day.'

616
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,928
We have to eat and
clean up quickly.

617
00:32:20,728 --> 00:32:24,008
Only then we will be able
to drink. Right?

618
00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:28,048
Since I have to be quick,
I don't follow that method.

619
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:30,448
We have prepared the makgeolli
that you enjoyed in Pyeongchang.

620
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:32,208
Really?

621
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:34,608
Do you want some?

622
00:32:34,728 --> 00:32:37,608
Pyeongchang makgeolli.
Drinking while shooting...

623
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:43,208
I'm sorry. That's my bad.

624
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,928
We have to stick to the rules.

625
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:48,528
We heard that you are someone
who is thorough.

626
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:51,968
Red chilies too.

627
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:54,288
This is added just to add color.

628
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:56,368
But

629
00:32:57,168 --> 00:33:00,728
do red chilies only add color
and nothing else?

630
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:03,568
It doesn't have
any special taste to it.

631
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:05,248
It is not spicy?

632
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:06,768
No, it isn't.

633
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:09,208
It's just...

634
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:11,408
Would you like to eat one piece?

635
00:33:11,528 --> 00:33:13,968
Why don't you eat one
since it is not spicy?

636
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:16,048
Red chili?

637
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:17,528
Why must you do that?

638
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:22,048
- It's bland, isn't it?
- No, it isn't.

639
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,368
Is it spicy?

640
00:33:28,648 --> 00:33:29,768
Hey...

641
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:34,528
Please try this.

642
00:33:35,368 --> 00:33:36,728
Try this.

643
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:41,768
Red chilies...

644
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:45,128
I guess it is not just
to add colors.

645
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:48,288
It has taste too.

646
00:33:48,408 --> 00:33:50,808
The Welsh onions too.

647
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:53,488
Have some water, Chef.

648
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:56,728
It doesn't take long
to prepare everything.

649
00:33:56,848 --> 00:34:00,808
However, why does it take
ages when you're out there?

650
00:34:00,928 --> 00:34:05,608
We have to harvest, wash
and mince everything.

651
00:34:06,168 --> 00:34:10,568
That is all we have to do
to prepare the vegetables.

652
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:12,208
This is how they look.

653
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:16,808
(I see)

654
00:34:16,928 --> 00:34:20,248
Just add as much meat
as you want.

655
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:22,248
- What cut is that?
- Pork shoulder.

656
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:24,048
It is quite lean.

657
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:25,648
Since Haejin

658
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:28,248
does not enjoy greasy food,

659
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:30,648
I would usually choose

660
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,848
pork shoulder instead of belly.

661
00:34:32,968 --> 00:34:35,728
You consider the preferences of
those eating with you too?

662
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:37,128
Definitely.

663
00:34:37,248 --> 00:34:39,368
That is what cooking is about.

664
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:44,648
For the meat...
Since we're cooking that much,

665
00:34:44,768 --> 00:34:45,688
I will use this much meat.

666
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:48,768
Please don't say
this and that much.

667
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:51,928
This is the amount suitable
for three servings.

668
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,248
- Stir-fry it first?
- Yes, that's right.

669
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:56,568
Let me stir-fry the meat.

670
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,448
When we watched episode 1,

671
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:03,048
we saw that you just added
everything without measuring.

672
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:04,208
That's because

673
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:08,848
we can only drink if we eat
and clean up quickly.

674
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:10,607
You wanted to be quick?

675
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:12,448
Just stir-fry this.

676
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,208
Actually, the right way is
to stir-fry the meat.

677
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:17,848
- Without oil?
- Yes, that's right.

678
00:35:17,968 --> 00:35:20,048
Won't it stick to the pan?

679
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:22,448
It's because it releases fat.

680
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:24,728
So don't stir-fry this
for too long.

681
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:30,208
Are you not going to season it?

682
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,127
No, we will just stir-fry
the meat just like that.

683
00:35:34,168 --> 00:35:36,008
Okay. Now, water.

684
00:35:37,248 --> 00:35:38,928
You pour in much more water
than I expected.

685
00:35:39,048 --> 00:35:40,448
Yes, this much is enough.

686
00:35:40,568 --> 00:35:43,968
(Pour just this much water as you
can add more later)

687
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:46,888
This is the amount for
three servings.

688
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:49,568
Add this much gochujang.

689
00:35:49,688 --> 00:35:52,488
(Add this much gochujang)

690
00:35:54,648 --> 00:35:56,648
Add around two spoonfuls.

691
00:35:56,768 --> 00:36:00,248
Add two spoons of gochujang.
Around this much.

692
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:04,288
You're now making stew.

693
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:06,648
Actually, there is something

694
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:09,127
that Haejin has yet to do.

695
00:36:09,248 --> 00:36:11,008
But I did get it right
at the end of the show.

696
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:15,928
50 percent polished rice

697
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,648
goes very well with stews.

698
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:19,648
We have a rice cooker.

699
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:23,528
(Even today, he has to face
50 percent polished rice)

700
00:36:32,488 --> 00:36:35,008
Excuse me but it looks like
you are unsure now.

701
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:37,008
Are you nervous?

702
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:40,208
Why do I feel small in front of
50 percent polished rice?

703
00:36:46,568 --> 00:36:48,768
Do you cook
50 percent polished rice

704
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:50,248
back at home too?

705
00:36:50,368 --> 00:36:51,368
Yes.

706
00:36:51,488 --> 00:36:56,688
I cook brown rice and
50 percent polished rice at home.

707
00:36:57,168 --> 00:37:00,928
Brown rice alone
is a bit hard to swallow.

708
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:05,648
(Haejin carefully
measures the amount of water)

709
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:11,008
(While he lets the rice cook)

710
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:13,087
Add chili powder.

711
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:17,048
(Seungwon continues to cook
gochujang jjigae)

712
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:22,248
One spoon of soybean paste that
Haejin mentioned earlier.

713
00:37:22,368 --> 00:37:25,728
(Use instinct to measure others
but just 1 spoon of soybean paste)

714
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:31,408
(Add all cut vegetables)

715
00:37:32,408 --> 00:37:34,888
It's nice to cook using
a gas stove.

716
00:37:36,008 --> 00:37:38,328
The stew will be ready
in a moment.

717
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:43,688
Add this much minced garlic.

718
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,048
This much minced garlic.

719
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:47,648
(The audience writes down
his recipe)

720
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:51,448
Don't add too much salted shrimps.

721
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:54,568
- Just this much.
- This much salted shrimp.

722
00:37:55,248 --> 00:37:57,688
(Don't add too much salted shrimp.
Just add this much)

723
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,888
I mentioned this earlier,
didn't I?

724
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:02,688
You don't have

725
00:38:02,808 --> 00:38:06,248
to beat yourself up too much
because of this.

726
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,808
(Add enough MSG
without feeling guilty)

727
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:13,448
The important ingredient for
gochujang jjigae is black pepper.

728
00:38:13,568 --> 00:38:16,488
Add this much black pepper.

729
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,288
For sugar...

730
00:38:19,968 --> 00:38:21,168
This much.

731
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,808
This much.

732
00:38:26,368 --> 00:38:29,848
(Add about this much sugar)

733
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:30,648
This much.

734
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:33,288
Can the audience ask a question?

735
00:38:33,408 --> 00:38:37,368
It's a question from Lee Woojeong
from Geoje Island.

736
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:42,848
'You can cook efficiently thanks
to Haejin of the Equipment Team.

737
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:47,648
Which item that he made,
made you most satisfied?'

738
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:49,968
Up until today?

739
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:52,087
No, only in this season.

740
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:54,288
I didn't make that many.

741
00:38:54,408 --> 00:38:59,448
Yeolmoa, Mulmoa, JABAJO.

742
00:38:59,568 --> 00:39:02,168
Honestly, for me it's Yeolmoa.

743
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:05,528
I think it's Yeolmoa.

744
00:39:05,648 --> 00:39:08,968
When compared with Kangryeokhya,

745
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:12,448
Kangryeokhya gets 80 points
while Yeolmoa gets 98 points.

746
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:15,168
That is how efficient
I think it is.

747
00:39:18,848 --> 00:39:20,248
It was sold out on
home shopping channels.

748
00:39:20,368 --> 00:39:21,648
(Yoo-gyver whose items were
sold out on Jukguldo too)

749
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:25,568
(He gives life to the brazier
that was hidden in the store)

750
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:30,087
(to save everybody from
the pain of fanning the fire)

751
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:32,008
This is hard to use, isn't it?

752
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:36,368
(He started with
a small wooden bench)

753
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:40,848
(DIY everything they need)

754
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:47,288
(Yoo-gyver is in charge of
infrastructure at 3 Meals House)

755
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:48,848
What are you making right now?

756
00:39:48,968 --> 00:39:51,127
You actually make everything?

757
00:39:51,928 --> 00:39:54,688
(In this season, he showed us
his 10 years' experience)

758
00:39:55,368 --> 00:39:57,768
(He came up with JABAJO
in Jukguldo)

759
00:39:58,968 --> 00:40:02,528
(He attaches that right away
at all houses they went to)

760
00:40:02,648 --> 00:40:05,968
Since we have JABAJO...

761
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:08,048
- It's more comfortable, right?
- JABAJO.

762
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:12,968
(JABAJO can be used nationwide)

763
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:14,768
This is what I drew.

764
00:40:16,168 --> 00:40:19,688
(The seasoning table looks better
with Youngwoong's touch)

765
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:22,168
(He puts it down)

766
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:27,328
(Sad Chef Cha is suffering
because of his long legs)

767
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:29,048
Just use this.

768
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,568
(He made sure the height
is perfect for Chef Cha)

769
00:40:32,968 --> 00:40:35,648
This is amazing.

770
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:36,848
Right?

771
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:40,648
(The item that showed
Yoo-gyver's attentive side)

772
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:44,168
No.

773
00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:47,127
Haejin created this too.

774
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:50,888
He made it.

775
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:54,127
(The start of innovation, Mulmoa)

776
00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:57,087
If we're doing the dishes
while seated like this...

777
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,368
(Push it gently)

778
00:40:58,488 --> 00:41:01,087
(Water gushing out)

779
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:04,968
(You no longer hurt
your waist while doing the dishes)

780
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:11,368
(It was an item that assists
with doing the dishes)

781
00:41:11,488 --> 00:41:13,087
That is Bulmoa and
this is Mulmoa.

782
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,368
That's Yeolmoa.

783
00:41:16,168 --> 00:41:19,648
(The efficiency looks like it is
the best item of this season)

784
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:24,168
(Yeolmoa, the historical start)

785
00:41:25,048 --> 00:41:27,328
It's not boiling at all.

786
00:41:27,848 --> 00:41:31,728
(Those days when they go crazy
just looking at the fire)

787
00:41:32,568 --> 00:41:36,607
(It is known as the item that
gathers the fire)

788
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,368
(It shows extraordinary usage
from the very first day)

789
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:42,127
(The fire is so big)

790
00:41:42,808 --> 00:41:46,008
(Brazier that makes them not
intimidated by Michelin chefs)

791
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:49,768
(The item that allows him
to cook Chinese cuisine too)

792
00:41:49,888 --> 00:41:52,488
The fire...

793
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:53,848
It's good?

794
00:41:53,968 --> 00:41:55,648
It's amazing.

795
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:58,248
When did you make this, Haejin?

796
00:41:58,368 --> 00:42:01,808
He has amazing innovative items.

797
00:42:02,368 --> 00:42:05,087
(He proved his name)

798
00:42:05,848 --> 00:42:09,488
(It is black from fire)

799
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,448
The smell...

800
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:13,168
I can smell it now.

801
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:16,208
Then, the fire...

802
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:19,448
We have to let it simmer now.

803
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:20,448
Why?

804
00:42:20,568 --> 00:42:23,008
Then it will become thick.

805
00:42:23,127 --> 00:42:25,528
It's best
when the vegetables are soft.

806
00:42:25,648 --> 00:42:28,008
Actually, we just have
to let it simmer.

807
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:30,008
If it takes a long time,

808
00:42:30,127 --> 00:42:31,848
can we start making
the second dish?

809
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:34,288
- Yes.
- While the stew boils...

810
00:42:34,808 --> 00:42:35,488
The second dish?

811
00:42:35,607 --> 00:42:37,607
This is the name of
the second cooking corner

812
00:42:37,728 --> 00:42:39,328
The name is

813
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:42,808
'If Only I Caught It Back Then.'

814
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:47,928
(Second corner's name:
If Only I Caught It Back Then)

815
00:42:48,048 --> 00:42:49,448
If only.

816
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:50,488
What is that?

817
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:52,127
That is the title.

818
00:42:52,248 --> 00:42:53,728
Back in Chuja Island...

819
00:42:53,848 --> 00:42:55,048
Bigfin reed squid?

820
00:42:55,168 --> 00:42:56,448
We failed to capture any.

821
00:42:57,048 --> 00:42:58,448
Bigfin reed squid.

822
00:42:58,568 --> 00:42:59,568
We did?

823
00:42:59,688 --> 00:43:00,728
We bought them.

824
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:02,328
(Excited)

825
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:04,648
This is bigfin reed squid?

826
00:43:04,768 --> 00:43:06,008
(Wow)

827
00:43:06,127 --> 00:43:08,208
We need to show this

828
00:43:08,328 --> 00:43:10,087
to our viewers.

829
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,688
(Anticipating)

830
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,368
(How does it look?)

831
00:43:15,048 --> 00:43:17,408
(It's open)

832
00:43:18,008 --> 00:43:19,288
(A squid that they didn't
get to see in Chuja Island)

833
00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:21,127
(It is bigger than ordinary squid)

834
00:43:21,248 --> 00:43:23,048
(and looks similar to cuttlefish
but without the bone)

835
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:24,568
They look like cuttlefish.

836
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:26,248
So this is bigfin reed squid?

837
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:28,488
(Wow)

838
00:43:28,888 --> 00:43:30,008
This is not cuttlefish?

839
00:43:30,127 --> 00:43:32,328
I don't know either.
I've never seen this before.

840
00:43:32,448 --> 00:43:34,208
This is the bigfin reed squid.

841
00:43:34,328 --> 00:43:35,848
I don't see
any reed pattern on it.

842
00:43:35,968 --> 00:43:36,728
Here it is.

843
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:37,848
That looks like reed?

844
00:43:37,968 --> 00:43:38,888
That's the reed-like shape?

845
00:43:39,008 --> 00:43:40,048
This one?

846
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:41,808
Yes. They are black.

847
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:43,808
- That's ink.
- I think that's the ink.

848
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,888
How many did you buy?

849
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:50,448
Did you buy the biggest?

850
00:43:51,408 --> 00:43:54,008
(The black stains are the ink)

851
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:56,448
(The white ones
are the reed pattern)

852
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:58,448
Since we didn't get
to catch any,

853
00:43:58,568 --> 00:44:00,848
we don't know how they look.

854
00:44:00,968 --> 00:44:02,648
Did you come up with what dish

855
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:04,768
you'd like to cook with it
if you caught any?

856
00:44:05,568 --> 00:44:06,848
Squids like this

857
00:44:06,968 --> 00:44:08,607
taste best when eaten raw.

858
00:44:08,728 --> 00:44:11,528
(Bigfin reed squid tastes best
as sashimi according to Chef Cha)

859
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:12,808
Is this fresh from today?

860
00:44:12,928 --> 00:44:14,728
Yes. We got it this morning
from Noryangjin.

861
00:44:14,848 --> 00:44:17,087
We need to get these
from Noryangjin.

862
00:44:18,768 --> 00:44:22,008
Does it mean we don't have to
catch it at Chuja Island?

863
00:44:22,488 --> 00:44:24,848
I don't know how to clean this

864
00:44:24,968 --> 00:44:27,328
as I have never done it before.

865
00:44:27,688 --> 00:44:30,488
But we have to clean this.

866
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:33,448
(Chef Cha's method of
cleaning squid will be revealed)

867
00:44:33,568 --> 00:44:36,648
I can do this using a knife.

868
00:44:36,768 --> 00:44:40,248
But I'll just cut this part
with a knife.

869
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:43,607
(Cut the middle part of the squid
with a knife or scissors)

870
00:44:43,728 --> 00:44:45,607
Cut it like this.

871
00:44:46,288 --> 00:44:48,968
Grab the tentacles
and remove it like this.

872
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,688
(Grab the tentacles and
remove the innards too)

873
00:44:53,288 --> 00:44:55,288
(Fascinated)

874
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:57,368
This is the skin.

875
00:44:57,488 --> 00:44:59,648
We need to remove the skin.

876
00:44:59,768 --> 00:45:02,688
(Remove the skin that is located
inside of the body)

877
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:06,528
The reason we remove the skin

878
00:45:06,648 --> 00:45:09,328
is because we can't eat it.
It's tough.

879
00:45:10,448 --> 00:45:12,127
That looks clean.

880
00:45:12,248 --> 00:45:14,127
Let's just eat the body
and not the tentacles.

881
00:45:14,248 --> 00:45:17,528
Why not? I can just cut this part.

882
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,208
(Cut the innards
connected to the tentacles)

883
00:45:19,328 --> 00:45:20,288
Just cut it like this.

884
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:22,848
Can you see this?

885
00:45:22,968 --> 00:45:23,848
These are the teeth.

886
00:45:25,168 --> 00:45:27,928
(He removes the teeth
between the tentacles too)

887
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:31,848
What will happen

888
00:45:31,968 --> 00:45:33,808
if you dip the tentacles
with gochujang?

889
00:45:37,408 --> 00:45:38,528
I think it'll be good.

890
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:40,768
That thought just crossed my mind.

891
00:45:41,328 --> 00:45:42,568
It's not a good idea, is it?

892
00:45:42,688 --> 00:45:43,248
No.

893
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:44,127
Okay.

894
00:45:44,568 --> 00:45:45,928
How do you remove this?

895
00:45:46,048 --> 00:45:47,448
You have to use this.

896
00:45:47,888 --> 00:45:49,127
Is that a tip?

897
00:45:49,248 --> 00:45:50,488
(Wow)

898
00:45:50,928 --> 00:45:52,528
Cotton gloves.

899
00:45:52,648 --> 00:45:53,888
You can easily remove it.

900
00:45:54,008 --> 00:45:55,648
This is an important tip.

901
00:45:55,768 --> 00:45:59,288
(You can remove the skin easily
using cotton gloves)

902
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:01,648
Then you can see the white flesh.

903
00:46:01,768 --> 00:46:03,408
After this...

904
00:46:03,968 --> 00:46:06,848
(The bigfin reed squid
has become white)

905
00:46:06,968 --> 00:46:09,448
Do this at the wings too.
See? They are coming out.

906
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:19,288
(Cut it into separate pieces
so it's easier to slice them up)

907
00:46:19,808 --> 00:46:21,448
I'm curious...

908
00:46:21,568 --> 00:46:22,248
(Surprised)

909
00:46:22,368 --> 00:46:23,928
- Why?
- Is this okay?

910
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:26,168
Yes. Let it be.

911
00:46:26,288 --> 00:46:27,448
How long are you
going to simmer this?

912
00:46:27,568 --> 00:46:28,528
I think it's disappearing.

913
00:46:28,648 --> 00:46:29,808
- What...
- Why would it disappear?

914
00:46:29,928 --> 00:46:31,288
It's turning into curry.

915
00:46:32,168 --> 00:46:33,368
That's how it's done.

916
00:46:33,488 --> 00:46:34,448
If you look at this,

917
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:36,448
you'll think the soup will thicken
and disappear.

918
00:46:36,568 --> 00:46:37,968
That's how you cook it.

919
00:46:38,528 --> 00:46:40,408
Also... Honey.

920
00:46:40,528 --> 00:46:42,607
Give me some water.

921
00:46:42,728 --> 00:46:43,888
Boil me some water.

922
00:46:44,008 --> 00:46:45,168
Boil water?

923
00:46:45,288 --> 00:46:47,288
- For blanching?
- We will blanch this.

924
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:48,087
Just the tentacles.

925
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,968
We should blanch the tentacles.

926
00:46:50,087 --> 00:46:51,728
Tip from Chef Cha.

927
00:46:51,848 --> 00:46:54,048
Don't have the tentacles raw.
Blanch them.

928
00:46:54,368 --> 00:46:55,448
(Tentacles are tougher
than the body)

929
00:46:55,568 --> 00:46:56,768
(So, it is best eaten after
being blanched than raw)

930
00:46:58,768 --> 00:47:01,008
They are not giving
many reactions now.

931
00:47:02,688 --> 00:47:04,008
Are you tired?

932
00:47:04,127 --> 00:47:05,208
You're exhausted?

933
00:47:05,328 --> 00:47:05,968
You're tired?

934
00:47:07,568 --> 00:47:09,368
Your reactions are different
than when we first started.

935
00:47:09,488 --> 00:47:10,408
I told you to do a good job.

936
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:11,168
You're different.

937
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,408
(Haejin puts the pot of water
on the stove)

938
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:20,248
Let me taste
this gochujang jjigae.

939
00:47:20,368 --> 00:47:21,888
You have to let it simmer
until it's thick like this.

940
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:22,648
This is right.

941
00:47:22,768 --> 00:47:24,648
How thick must it be?

942
00:47:24,768 --> 00:47:26,688
But it'll be better if you
let it simmer longer.

943
00:47:26,808 --> 00:47:27,368
(Hesitant)

944
00:47:27,488 --> 00:47:28,808
I think the spoon for me
to taste is the other one.

945
00:47:31,568 --> 00:47:33,448
This is ready.

946
00:47:34,048 --> 00:47:34,768
That's done.

947
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:36,568
Done.

948
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:38,368
Just add a bit of black pepper.

949
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:42,048
(He said it is done but
he adds black pepper)

950
00:47:42,168 --> 00:47:44,248
Just a bit of black pepper.
Hold on.

951
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:45,328
I think...

952
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:46,568
This is Cheongyang chili, right?

953
00:47:47,848 --> 00:47:51,087
(He adds Cheongyang chilies)

954
00:47:52,728 --> 00:47:53,728
(Shocked)

955
00:47:53,848 --> 00:47:54,288
Why?

956
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:55,288
It's not cooked.

957
00:47:57,488 --> 00:47:59,288
You failed again at cooking
50 percent polished rice?

958
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:00,728
What's the matter?

959
00:48:00,848 --> 00:48:01,368
Isn't that cooked?

960
00:48:01,488 --> 00:48:02,448
No, it isn't.

961
00:48:02,768 --> 00:48:04,808
I know after stirring it.

962
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:05,728
What's the matter?

963
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:08,648
Shall I taste this much?

964
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,127
I think it's slightly uncooked.

965
00:48:14,008 --> 00:48:15,048
That's hot.

966
00:48:15,168 --> 00:48:17,048
Shouldn't we just let it cook
with the steam?

967
00:48:17,168 --> 00:48:17,808
It's tasty.

968
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:18,808
Let's say that it's cooked.

969
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:20,008
We have to cook it a bit longer?

970
00:48:20,127 --> 00:48:21,528
Just a bit more.

971
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:23,568
Why? Is it good?

972
00:48:23,688 --> 00:48:25,288
I think it's good though.

973
00:48:25,408 --> 00:48:27,568
However, Haejin thinks it has
to cook a bit longer.

974
00:48:28,568 --> 00:48:29,688
That's because of my attitude.

975
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:31,008
I want everything to be perfect.

976
00:48:31,968 --> 00:48:35,087
(The perfectionist is always
suffering)

977
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:39,408
(He is still not done
cutting the squid)

978
00:48:39,768 --> 00:48:41,048
There is still a lot to do
after catching squid.

979
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,087
It requires lots of work.

980
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:44,248
Yes. Squid requires
a lot of attention.

981
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:46,648
I might've still complained
even if we'd caught it.

982
00:48:46,768 --> 00:48:49,528
It's because we have to eat
quickly to get a drink.

983
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:52,087
We need to eat quickly.

984
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:53,968
You did remove a lot.

985
00:48:55,848 --> 00:48:56,928
(Now, the squid looks white)

986
00:48:57,048 --> 00:48:58,168
Boil some water.

987
00:48:58,288 --> 00:48:59,688
Let's blanch only this.

988
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:03,168
(He checks on
the gochujang jjigae now and then)

989
00:49:04,888 --> 00:49:06,448
During these moments,

990
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,048
I should start cleaning up.

991
00:49:09,328 --> 00:49:10,928
You naturally find your spot.

992
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,488
I know that this is my job.

993
00:49:13,127 --> 00:49:15,728
While fishing at Chuja Island,
you caught goldstriped amberjack.

994
00:49:15,848 --> 00:49:16,808
Do you remember that moment?

995
00:49:16,928 --> 00:49:17,368
Yes, I do.

996
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:21,768
When we went to the ocean
with you,

997
00:49:21,888 --> 00:49:23,288
unlike what we expected,

998
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:25,768
Seungwon caught a fish
earlier than you did.

999
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:27,728
I see.

1000
00:49:27,848 --> 00:49:29,607
Seungwon caught a fish.

1001
00:49:29,728 --> 00:49:32,768
Seungwon, when you caught
your first fish in your life,

1002
00:49:32,888 --> 00:49:34,808
were you wary

1003
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:36,768
about Haejin?

1004
00:49:36,888 --> 00:49:37,648
I was.

1005
00:49:37,768 --> 00:49:38,568
Really?

1006
00:49:38,688 --> 00:49:40,368
I was being wary.

1007
00:49:40,488 --> 00:49:42,488
Don't you think I got way better?

1008
00:49:43,808 --> 00:49:45,288
I think I improved a lot.

1009
00:49:45,408 --> 00:49:46,248
Let's watch him again.

1010
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:48,848
Did he improve?

1011
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:50,448
Let's take a look.

1012
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,607
(This is how shows were
30 years ago)

1013
00:49:55,728 --> 00:49:57,648
You were very happy.

1014
00:49:57,768 --> 00:49:59,008
I don't think I was very happy.

1015
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:00,048
You were ecstatic.

1016
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:02,288
That's not true.

1017
00:50:03,288 --> 00:50:06,328
(This was when the trio
went fishing at Chuja Island)

1018
00:50:06,728 --> 00:50:08,368
(Seungwon was the first person
to catch a fish)

1019
00:50:08,488 --> 00:50:09,968
You caught one? You did?

1020
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:14,728
(He has caught
a goldstriped amberjack)

1021
00:50:15,248 --> 00:50:17,768
I can't believe that
I managed to catch this.

1022
00:50:18,688 --> 00:50:20,648
How does it feel to catch that?

1023
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:24,448
It felt very heavy.

1024
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:26,488
(Chef Cha was very excited
because of the fish)

1025
00:50:27,168 --> 00:50:30,408
(He suddenly starts to hum)

1026
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,688
(He shares how he feels
without being asked)

1027
00:50:32,808 --> 00:50:34,328
Fishing is fun when
we get to catch something.

1028
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,848
(He even shows the V hand sign)

1029
00:50:38,968 --> 00:50:42,208
(Fact: He was ecstatic)

1030
00:50:42,328 --> 00:50:44,808
(Haejin looked very upset)

1031
00:50:45,448 --> 00:50:48,248
The fish shouldn't have
let me catch it.

1032
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:50,328
(He blames the fish
as he is being cornered)

1033
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:52,888
That fish shouldn't have
been caught by me.

1034
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:55,968
I would like to ask this question
to Haejin.

1035
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:58,648
You're an expert when it comes
to fish pots

1036
00:50:58,768 --> 00:50:59,368
and

1037
00:50:59,488 --> 00:51:00,968
you were very confident.

1038
00:51:01,088 --> 00:51:02,848
You told us that,
'This is the spot'

1039
00:51:02,968 --> 00:51:04,648
and tossed three fish pots.

1040
00:51:04,768 --> 00:51:07,648
How did you feel when you find out
that the fish pots were empty?

1041
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:08,608
I was upset.

1042
00:51:08,728 --> 00:51:11,408
Your feelings when Seungwon
caught a fish first.

1043
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:14,248
Which of those two situations
upset you more?

1044
00:51:14,368 --> 00:51:15,888
Fish pot...

1045
00:51:16,008 --> 00:51:19,368
And how you felt when Seungwon
caught the fish first.

1046
00:51:19,488 --> 00:51:20,448
It's the latter.

1047
00:51:22,528 --> 00:51:24,488
(Jeez)

1048
00:51:24,928 --> 00:51:26,528
My presence? Something like that.

1049
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:27,568
You felt smaller?

1050
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:28,448
Yes, very.

1051
00:51:28,568 --> 00:51:30,248
'What if I don't get any?'

1052
00:51:30,368 --> 00:51:32,048
It's because this is your job.

1053
00:51:32,168 --> 00:51:33,128
Yes.

1054
00:51:33,728 --> 00:51:35,888
When you were in Chuja Island,
Kim Namgil stayed with you

1055
00:51:36,008 --> 00:51:37,888
for 3 days and 2 nights.

1056
00:51:38,008 --> 00:51:41,008
Please send a message to Namgil
who worked hard with you.

1057
00:51:41,128 --> 00:51:43,048
Namgil. Yes...

1058
00:51:44,608 --> 00:51:45,648
Excuse me, Seungwon.

1059
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:46,808
This is a video message.

1060
00:51:46,928 --> 00:51:48,288
When I say 'cue,'

1061
00:51:48,408 --> 00:51:50,168
please look at the camera.

1062
00:51:50,288 --> 00:51:51,248
Are you ready?

1063
00:51:51,368 --> 00:51:52,808
Where should I look at?

1064
00:51:52,928 --> 00:51:53,768
Yes. Ready.

1065
00:51:54,768 --> 00:51:55,528
Cue.

1066
00:51:55,648 --> 00:51:56,768
Yes, Namgil.

1067
00:51:58,288 --> 00:52:03,048
Thank you for joining us
despite the hot summer.

1068
00:52:03,168 --> 00:52:06,488
Thanks to you,
we never stopped laughing.

1069
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:08,408
You worked very hard
and made things fun for us.

1070
00:52:08,528 --> 00:52:10,728
Thank you very much.

1071
00:52:10,848 --> 00:52:12,008
Go away, doggy!

1072
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:15,168
(This is exactly like the video
you'd see from hometowns)

1073
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:16,968
From the hometown...

1074
00:52:17,808 --> 00:52:20,288
And coincidentally,
the drama you are in airs

1075
00:52:20,408 --> 00:52:22,568
at the same time as our show.

1076
00:52:25,328 --> 00:52:26,968
Don't act all out. Thank you.

1077
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:29,688
Also...

1078
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:32,688
You'll start making
the final dish?

1079
00:52:32,808 --> 00:52:34,368
I'll make the last one now.

1080
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:37,488
The final dish is the dish
that you made in Mount Jiri

1081
00:52:37,608 --> 00:52:40,648
that made a lot of people drool.

1082
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:42,168
It's black pork!

1083
00:52:42,288 --> 00:52:48,328
(Third corner: Black pork)

1084
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:51,368
Black pork from back then?
It was delicious.

1085
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:54,848
Here are the ingredients
needed for the final dish.

1086
00:52:54,968 --> 00:52:56,328
It's black pork from Mount Jiri.

1087
00:52:56,448 --> 00:53:00,328
What recipe will you share with
our audience using black pork?

1088
00:53:01,088 --> 00:53:03,768
It's something that
I make often.

1089
00:53:03,888 --> 00:53:05,048
(Slurping)

1090
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:06,808
Spicy stir-fried pork.

1091
00:53:08,888 --> 00:53:11,568
Many people are curious about
this dish.

1092
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,848
Spicy stir-fried pork?

1093
00:53:12,968 --> 00:53:16,048
It looks good and tastes good too.

1094
00:53:16,848 --> 00:53:18,448
Even if we try that dish

1095
00:53:18,568 --> 00:53:21,248
at various restaurants,
yours is still good.

1096
00:53:21,768 --> 00:53:23,288
When it comes
to spicy stir-fried pork,

1097
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,648
some would make it
using gochujang.

1098
00:53:25,768 --> 00:53:26,968
That is fine.

1099
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:29,088
However, I don't use gochujang.

1100
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:30,128
You don't use it at all?

1101
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,248
Not at all.

1102
00:53:32,368 --> 00:53:33,768
I only use soy sauce
and chili powder.

1103
00:53:33,888 --> 00:53:34,848
That's how you made it
all these time?

1104
00:53:34,968 --> 00:53:36,208
Yes, that's right.

1105
00:53:36,328 --> 00:53:37,048
That's my original way.

1106
00:53:37,168 --> 00:53:38,488
What difference is there between

1107
00:53:38,608 --> 00:53:40,648
using chili powder and gochujang?

1108
00:53:40,768 --> 00:53:43,728
If you use gochujang, the sauce

1109
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:45,728
will become spicy.

1110
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:46,848
The sauce?

1111
00:53:46,968 --> 00:53:49,128
Yes. It becomes watery.

1112
00:53:49,248 --> 00:53:53,048
Without gochujang,
it is more matte...

1113
00:53:53,168 --> 00:53:54,448
The water is boiling.

1114
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:56,368
You can just put these in.

1115
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:00,848
(Add tentacles into boiling water)

1116
00:54:01,968 --> 00:54:04,168
(Boiling)

1117
00:54:04,568 --> 00:54:06,248
(In the meantime)

1118
00:54:07,488 --> 00:54:10,728
(Chef Cha prepares to make
spicy stir-fried pork)

1119
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:12,768
Let's cook this much.

1120
00:54:12,888 --> 00:54:14,448
I saw this back then too

1121
00:54:14,568 --> 00:54:17,328
but black pork from Mount Jiri
is more scarlet.

1122
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,528
Just let this boil?

1123
00:54:20,648 --> 00:54:21,368
That?

1124
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:23,608
(Gochujang jjigae
is still boiling)

1125
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:25,608
Just let it boil for a while.

1126
00:54:25,728 --> 00:54:27,888
Just let it boil until you think
it is too thick?

1127
00:54:28,008 --> 00:54:29,568
This is boiling a lot.

1128
00:54:31,488 --> 00:54:32,568
That is a nutritious meal.

1129
00:54:33,248 --> 00:54:35,488
(The nutritious meal that
is boiling so much)

1130
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:39,448
If they have family members
coming home at 6PM,

1131
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:40,408
they have to cook at 4PM.

1132
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:41,728
You have to prepare
making it in advance.

1133
00:54:41,848 --> 00:54:43,768
It has to be left to boil
earlier.

1134
00:54:45,128 --> 00:54:47,688
I'll season the meat for now.

1135
00:54:48,528 --> 00:54:51,448
(Chef Cha's spicy stir-fried pork
recipe will be revealed)

1136
00:54:52,808 --> 00:54:56,048
(Ingredients used to season
the meat)

1137
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:59,328
(Soy sauce, black pepper, minced
garlic, sesame oil, cooking wine)

1138
00:54:59,448 --> 00:55:01,848
Let's start with soy sauce.

1139
00:55:01,968 --> 00:55:04,048
This much soy sauce.

1140
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:05,088
This much.

1141
00:55:07,568 --> 00:55:10,808
This much and black pepper.

1142
00:55:10,928 --> 00:55:13,808
Sprinkle this much.

1143
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:20,248
Next is the garlic
that was minced.

1144
00:55:20,368 --> 00:55:22,088
Around one spoonful.

1145
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:24,608
It's best to add a bit more.
Just like this.

1146
00:55:24,728 --> 00:55:25,968
You just follow your instinct.

1147
00:55:26,768 --> 00:55:29,368
Then, pour in a bit of sesame oil.

1148
00:55:29,488 --> 00:55:30,888
This much.

1149
00:55:31,008 --> 00:55:32,168
Let it pour.

1150
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,848
To get rid of the gamey smell,

1151
00:55:36,968 --> 00:55:41,288
add this much cooking wine.

1152
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:42,568
Is that wine to be drunk in
the day or cooking wine?

1153
00:55:42,688 --> 00:55:43,768
Cooking wine.

1154
00:55:45,048 --> 00:55:47,208
You have to be accurate.

1155
00:55:47,328 --> 00:55:51,568
(If not, you might end up
getting drunk from cooking wine)

1156
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:53,408
Massage everything like this.

1157
00:55:56,288 --> 00:55:57,048
Done.

1158
00:55:58,408 --> 00:56:01,248
(The meat has been seasoned)

1159
00:56:02,288 --> 00:56:04,208
You can turn off the heat
for that now.

1160
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:04,968
Okay.

1161
00:56:05,088 --> 00:56:07,288
(Finally, the heat to boil
gochujang jjigae is turned off)

1162
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:09,808
Gochujang jjigae is ready.

1163
00:56:09,928 --> 00:56:11,808
This question comes with a prize.

1164
00:56:11,928 --> 00:56:14,008
I'll ask you now.

1165
00:56:14,128 --> 00:56:16,048
Which among these

1166
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:19,368
is the best food made by Seungwon
that I would like to try?

1167
00:56:19,888 --> 00:56:22,648
(Cheering excitedly)

1168
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,848
There are four options.
The one who gets it right

1169
00:56:25,968 --> 00:56:27,808
will be given a prize.

1170
00:56:27,928 --> 00:56:30,808
Number 1. Yuringi and naengmyeon.

1171
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:33,568
2. Young radish kimchi.

1172
00:56:33,688 --> 00:56:37,128
3. Doenjang jjigae and
spicy stir-fried pork.

1173
00:56:37,248 --> 00:56:40,208
4. Fish and chips.

1174
00:56:40,328 --> 00:56:42,568
All I do is peel garlic
but I'm sweating bullets.

1175
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:45,848
(During this summer, he sweated
a lot despite just peeling garlic)

1176
00:56:45,968 --> 00:56:47,728
Starting the fire makes it feel
real that I'm on this show.

1177
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,888
(Starting the fire in the brazier
at 3 Meals House)

1178
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:53,528
We used to have time
to rest back then.

1179
00:56:54,568 --> 00:56:56,928
(They need more help as
it was just the two of them)

1180
00:56:57,048 --> 00:56:58,408
Shall I use that brazier
to boil water?

1181
00:56:58,528 --> 00:56:59,968
Yes, you can.

1182
00:57:00,088 --> 00:57:01,288
I will do this.

1183
00:57:01,408 --> 00:57:02,608
So you can do something else.

1184
00:57:02,728 --> 00:57:03,368
Put this on the table.

1185
00:57:03,488 --> 00:57:04,768
(He is already waiting)

1186
00:57:05,568 --> 00:57:08,968
(Despite saying they need more
help, they work well together)

1187
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:09,728
Let's do it together.

1188
00:57:09,848 --> 00:57:11,528
No, that's fine.

1189
00:57:12,368 --> 00:57:13,648
It's tasty because it's crunchy.

1190
00:57:14,528 --> 00:57:15,368
It's because of the fire.

1191
00:57:16,648 --> 00:57:18,248
It won't taste like this if
the fire is not strong.

1192
00:57:19,608 --> 00:57:21,048
You don't have to do that.
I'll do that.

1193
00:57:21,168 --> 00:57:24,208
(Seeing their friendship and
22 meals together make us cry)

1194
00:57:27,888 --> 00:57:30,488
(They prepared 49 types
of food for their 22 meals)

1195
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:35,648
(What is the food that viewers
want to eat most among all those?)

1196
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:41,088
(Candidate 1:
Yuringi and naengmyeon)

1197
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:44,168
(You can never say no
to food that is in season)

1198
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:47,928
(We can feel how refreshing this
naengmyeon is by looking at it)

1199
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:52,728
(And Chef Cha's high ambition of
making yuringi after 10 years)

1200
00:57:53,648 --> 00:57:55,968
(Candidate 2: Young radish kimchi)

1201
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:59,728
(Chef Cha adds ingredients
by following his intuition)

1202
00:57:59,848 --> 00:58:01,768
I made this with confidence.

1203
00:58:03,568 --> 00:58:05,848
(This has never been a failure)

1204
00:58:06,968 --> 00:58:08,008
I want to eat this
mixed with rice.

1205
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:11,808
(Candidate 3: Doenjang
jjigae and spicy stir-fried pork)

1206
00:58:12,768 --> 00:58:16,688
(It is fried on high heat and
looks very delicious)

1207
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:20,368
(Spicy stir-fried pork
that smells smokey)

1208
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:26,128
(Appetizing doenjang jjigae with
ingredients cut into big pieces)

1209
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:32,808
(Candidate 4: Fish and chips)

1210
00:58:37,568 --> 00:58:40,848
(Made of goldstriped amberjack
which they freshly caught)

1211
00:58:41,608 --> 00:58:45,208
(Another new dish of this season)

1212
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:50,648
(This flavor confuses them whether
they're in Chuja Island or London)

1213
00:58:50,888 --> 00:58:53,368
What are we supposed to guess?

1214
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,808
Which among those
is the food made by Chef Cha

1215
00:58:55,928 --> 00:59:00,208
that our viewers would like
to eat the most?

1216
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:04,328
We sent that question and
the food with the highest votes

1217
00:59:04,448 --> 00:59:05,368
is one of those.

1218
00:59:05,488 --> 00:59:06,328
What could it be?

1219
00:59:06,448 --> 00:59:07,208
What is it?

1220
00:59:07,328 --> 00:59:07,968
Me.

1221
00:59:08,088 --> 00:59:08,888
Go ahead, Haejin.

1222
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,328
Number 3.

1223
00:59:11,448 --> 00:59:13,568
Number 3. Doenjang jjigae
and spicy stir-fried pork.

1224
00:59:13,688 --> 00:59:14,248
Sorry.

1225
00:59:14,368 --> 00:59:16,528
You're not supposed to choose
what you want to eat the most.

1226
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:18,768
It's what the viewers want.

1227
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,768
- Me.
- Okay.

1228
00:59:19,888 --> 00:59:21,048
Number 1.

1229
00:59:21,168 --> 00:59:23,368
Yuringi and naengmyeon.

1230
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:24,968
Seungwon.

1231
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:26,088
I'll put our answer aside.

1232
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:28,368
I'd like to ask
Seungwon's opinion.

1233
00:59:28,488 --> 00:59:29,608
I think that's the answer.

1234
00:59:29,728 --> 00:59:30,928
Yuringi and naengmyeon?

1235
00:59:31,048 --> 00:59:31,968
Yes.

1236
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:34,248
Excuse me.
Sorry but the audience...

1237
00:59:34,368 --> 00:59:35,128
- Okay.
- Okay.

1238
00:59:35,248 --> 00:59:36,008
Please be more sincere
in answering.

1239
00:59:36,128 --> 00:59:38,008
But I have to slice this.

1240
00:59:38,488 --> 00:59:40,848
I will now announce the answer.

1241
00:59:41,608 --> 00:59:45,728
Did they manage to guess

1242
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,648
the audience's preference?

1243
00:59:47,768 --> 00:59:48,568
The answer is...

1244
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:04,348
Among the listed 10 dishes,

1245
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:07,388
this food received 24 percent
of the votes received.

1246
01:00:07,508 --> 01:00:08,868
The votes were cast
by our actual viewers?

1247
01:00:08,988 --> 01:00:10,948
- Yes, we did a survey.
- 1,500 people participated in it.

1248
01:00:11,068 --> 01:00:11,988
Really?

1249
01:00:13,628 --> 01:00:14,668
The food is...

1250
01:00:16,108 --> 01:00:17,948
Congratulations!
It's yuringi and naengmyeon!

1251
01:00:19,668 --> 01:00:21,548
(Congratulations)

1252
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:22,948
Congratulations.

1253
01:00:23,068 --> 01:00:24,428
Congratulations.

1254
01:00:24,948 --> 01:00:27,268
(Gift for those who gave
the correct answer)

1255
01:00:27,948 --> 01:00:30,188
(Your black pork)

1256
01:00:30,308 --> 01:00:32,308
(Giggling)

1257
01:00:33,148 --> 01:00:37,028
(The number 1 meal by Chef Cha
that viewers wanted to eat)

1258
01:00:37,588 --> 01:00:42,428
(Yuringi and naengmyeon)

1259
01:00:42,548 --> 01:00:43,868
Please hold this for me.

1260
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:45,988
(A new dish made by)

1261
01:00:46,108 --> 01:00:47,948
(Chef Cha with his heart
and soul after 10 years)

1262
01:00:49,868 --> 01:00:52,948
(Chef Cha puts a lot of importance
in making the chicken crunchy)

1263
01:00:54,748 --> 01:00:58,188
(Pour slurry in to make it
crunchier)

1264
01:01:00,988 --> 01:01:02,548
(The dish has to be flipped often
and cooked on high heat)

1265
01:01:02,668 --> 01:01:04,268
(to make sure that the outside
is cooked and crunchy)

1266
01:01:04,388 --> 01:01:06,068
These are fried perfectly.

1267
01:01:06,188 --> 01:01:07,188
They look delicious.

1268
01:01:09,108 --> 01:01:10,148
Fire...

1269
01:01:11,148 --> 01:01:11,948
Amazing.

1270
01:01:13,348 --> 01:01:14,148
Okay.

1271
01:01:14,988 --> 01:01:19,868
(Chef Cha gets the texture that
he wants thanks to Yeolmoa)

1272
01:01:21,068 --> 01:01:24,228
(They are fried perfectly
and make a crunch sound)

1273
01:01:25,588 --> 01:01:28,068
(Chicken that was fried
to perfection)

1274
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:30,748
(is cut into bite-sized pieces)

1275
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:34,348
(They are placed on a plate
of lettuce and onion)

1276
01:01:35,188 --> 01:01:37,748
(Delicious-looking yuringi
is perfected)

1277
01:01:37,868 --> 01:01:40,548
(with colorful and bright
toppings)

1278
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,948
Okay. Alright.

1279
01:01:46,588 --> 01:01:50,988
(An excellent new dish that
is delicious and beautiful)

1280
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:53,868
(Naengmyeon with ice cubes
that accompanies the yuringi)

1281
01:01:55,188 --> 01:01:57,868
(This is the perfect dish)

1282
01:01:57,988 --> 01:02:00,828
(to help us get rid of heat)

1283
01:02:06,428 --> 01:02:09,468
(Naengmyeon tastes even better
when eaten at the hot porch)

1284
01:02:11,588 --> 01:02:12,348
Is it okay?

1285
01:02:12,468 --> 01:02:13,908
It's refreshing and good.

1286
01:02:14,028 --> 01:02:14,868
Delicious.

1287
01:02:20,828 --> 01:02:23,028
(Slurping the naengmyeon soup
with ice cubes)

1288
01:02:23,548 --> 01:02:26,308
(This flavor makes them forget
about the scorching heat)

1289
01:02:26,428 --> 01:02:28,068
You should eat these together.

1290
01:02:28,188 --> 01:02:29,348
The chili is spicy.

1291
01:02:30,108 --> 01:02:34,148
(This is Haejin's first time
to eat yuringi)

1292
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:36,868
(Yummy)

1293
01:02:37,748 --> 01:02:38,988
It's great because of
how crunchy it is.

1294
01:02:40,348 --> 01:02:44,188
(He loves it
as soon as he bites it)

1295
01:02:44,988 --> 01:02:47,228
(Magical yuringi that is loved by
both Haejin and the viewers)

1296
01:02:47,348 --> 01:02:49,068
The sauce is delicious.

1297
01:02:52,388 --> 01:02:53,228
Actually,

1298
01:02:53,348 --> 01:02:55,788
while we're talking, Chef Cha...

1299
01:02:58,828 --> 01:03:02,468
(Chef Cha is focused on preparing
bigfin reed squid sashimi)

1300
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:05,628
I can tell right away
that it is chewy.

1301
01:03:06,268 --> 01:03:09,428
(The bigfin reed squid sashimi
sticks to the plate)

1302
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:10,508
Have you had this before?

1303
01:03:10,628 --> 01:03:12,348
No, I haven't.

1304
01:03:12,468 --> 01:03:13,588
All squid are the same, anyway.

1305
01:03:15,908 --> 01:03:18,828
However, I can feel how chewy
the texture is as I slice it.

1306
01:03:18,948 --> 01:03:19,548
Right?

1307
01:03:19,668 --> 01:03:22,268
It's chewy. Not tough.

1308
01:03:22,388 --> 01:03:24,388
I think this squid is chewy.

1309
01:03:26,308 --> 01:03:28,788
Look at how it sticks
to the plate. Amazing.

1310
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:30,908
This looks like cod tartare.

1311
01:03:34,788 --> 01:03:37,308
(The tentacles are cooked too)

1312
01:03:37,428 --> 01:03:39,068
Scoop that out of
the boiling water now.

1313
01:03:40,308 --> 01:03:41,548
Why did it get bigger?

1314
01:03:42,988 --> 01:03:44,108
This is so big.

1315
01:03:47,388 --> 01:03:49,268
This looks delicious too.

1316
01:03:49,388 --> 01:03:50,908
Look at how plump that is.

1317
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:55,068
You don't have to cut everything.
Just prepare enough for us to eat.

1318
01:03:55,188 --> 01:03:57,868
I think I should slice everything.

1319
01:03:57,988 --> 01:03:59,268
I don't want you to be tired.

1320
01:03:59,388 --> 01:04:01,308
It is but that's how things are.

1321
01:04:01,428 --> 01:04:02,948
(He's someone who faces
reality square in the eyes)

1322
01:04:03,068 --> 01:04:04,228
Or shall I do it?

1323
01:04:05,788 --> 01:04:06,308
Shall I?

1324
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:08,108
You want to slice this?
Can you do it?

1325
01:04:08,228 --> 01:04:09,588
Well, I can just give it a try.

1326
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:11,468
- Okay.
- But don't criticize me.

1327
01:04:11,588 --> 01:04:12,348
What?

1328
01:04:12,468 --> 01:04:13,508
Don't criticize me.

1329
01:04:13,628 --> 01:04:15,188
I'll do it myself.

1330
01:04:15,308 --> 01:04:17,268
You have to do it like this.
Look at this closely.

1331
01:04:17,388 --> 01:04:18,068
Look.

1332
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:21,308
You can do it easily
if you slice it diagonally.

1333
01:04:21,428 --> 01:04:22,668
It doesn't have to be too thin.

1334
01:04:22,788 --> 01:04:23,508
Okay.

1335
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,828
First. Hold it.

1336
01:04:29,028 --> 01:04:29,988
(Hmm)

1337
01:04:31,068 --> 01:04:32,108
(Oh)

1338
01:04:32,228 --> 01:04:34,348
It doesn't slip
and you can slice it easily.

1339
01:04:35,668 --> 01:04:38,228
Squid is usually very slippery.

1340
01:04:39,788 --> 01:04:42,948
I like how it feels to slice it.

1341
01:04:43,068 --> 01:04:43,748
For real.

1342
01:04:43,868 --> 01:04:45,828
Sorry but seeing you hold a knife

1343
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:47,108
reminds me of something.

1344
01:04:47,228 --> 01:04:48,188
'Public Enemy?'

1345
01:04:49,188 --> 01:04:51,348
(Somehow, a knife suits him well)

1346
01:04:51,468 --> 01:04:52,628
Mr. Yoo Haejin...

1347
01:04:54,028 --> 01:04:56,268
While he prepares the sashimi,

1348
01:04:56,388 --> 01:04:57,948
I will make
spicy stir-fried pork.

1349
01:04:58,068 --> 01:05:00,868
Okay. He will now begin
to cook the meat

1350
01:05:00,988 --> 01:05:02,228
that he has seasoned.

1351
01:05:02,348 --> 01:05:03,588
(Wow)

1352
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,588
It's very chewy.

1353
01:05:07,228 --> 01:05:08,988
I can tell just by touching.

1354
01:05:09,108 --> 01:05:11,588
Can we taste that?

1355
01:05:12,628 --> 01:05:15,388
Chef. If you don't mind,
can you please taste one

1356
01:05:15,508 --> 01:05:17,988
and share with our audience
how it tastes?

1357
01:05:18,108 --> 01:05:19,068
You should eat it.

1358
01:05:20,948 --> 01:05:21,588
You eat it.

1359
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:22,148
Me?

1360
01:05:22,268 --> 01:05:23,228
Yes, you try that.

1361
01:05:24,868 --> 01:05:26,188
You should have one.

1362
01:05:30,388 --> 01:05:31,588
(Amazed)

1363
01:05:32,548 --> 01:05:33,868
This is so delicious. Try it.

1364
01:05:36,668 --> 01:05:37,348
Try it.

1365
01:05:40,508 --> 01:05:42,508
(Yummy)

1366
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:44,508
This is very tasty.

1367
01:05:44,628 --> 01:05:45,148
For real.

1368
01:05:45,268 --> 01:05:46,108
It's so good.

1369
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,068
It's your first time trying this?

1370
01:05:49,748 --> 01:05:51,388
(Eyes wide open)

1371
01:05:54,628 --> 01:05:56,028
It tastes like I am chewing milk.

1372
01:05:56,148 --> 01:05:58,308
The juice is very savory.

1373
01:05:58,428 --> 01:05:59,828
This is very different
from other squid.

1374
01:05:59,948 --> 01:06:01,188
That's why it's precious.

1375
01:06:03,428 --> 01:06:05,468
What I'll do next

1376
01:06:05,588 --> 01:06:07,188
is to cook spicy stir-fried pork.

1377
01:06:07,308 --> 01:06:10,468
What vegetables do we add
to spicy stir-fried pork?

1378
01:06:10,588 --> 01:06:11,748
For this dish,

1379
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:13,708
- we need onion.
- Onion.

1380
01:06:13,828 --> 01:06:17,548
Next is 2 or 3 spicy chilies.

1381
01:06:17,668 --> 01:06:20,148
Then, minced garlic.

1382
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:22,068
Next is Welsh onion.

1383
01:06:22,188 --> 01:06:23,988
Next

1384
01:06:24,108 --> 01:06:26,068
is some oyster mushroom.

1385
01:06:26,188 --> 01:06:27,588
This is not a must, is it?

1386
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,428
- No.
- We don't have to add mushrooms?

1387
01:06:29,548 --> 01:06:31,788
No. You don't have to add those
if you don't have them.

1388
01:06:31,908 --> 01:06:33,268
Today,

1389
01:06:33,388 --> 01:06:34,828
I'll add some perilla leaves.

1390
01:06:36,468 --> 01:06:38,508
I'll add some perilla leaves
into the spicy stir-fried pork

1391
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:40,468
to make it more fragrant.

1392
01:06:40,588 --> 01:06:42,548
Okay. Done.

1393
01:06:44,628 --> 01:06:49,148
(Slice sesame leaves
to make it more fragrant)

1394
01:06:50,068 --> 01:06:52,268
(Onion)

1395
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:54,468
(Oyster mushrooms)

1396
01:06:54,588 --> 01:06:56,748
(Cheongyang chili)

1397
01:06:57,348 --> 01:07:00,108
(Slice Welsh onion too)

1398
01:07:00,988 --> 01:07:03,388
You slice it into big pieces.

1399
01:07:03,988 --> 01:07:06,228
We don't have to be stringent with
cutting these ingredients, right?

1400
01:07:06,348 --> 01:07:07,708
Yes, that's right.

1401
01:07:07,828 --> 01:07:11,148
I am now done with
preparing the vegetables.

1402
01:07:11,268 --> 01:07:12,708
Now, I will start cooking

1403
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:13,868
spicy stir-fried pork.

1404
01:07:14,788 --> 01:07:18,188
(Ignite fire at the stove)

1405
01:07:19,148 --> 01:07:20,308
Okay. Add meat first.

1406
01:07:22,468 --> 01:07:23,148
Here we go.

1407
01:07:23,268 --> 01:07:26,588
(Add seasoned meat into
the heated pan)

1408
01:07:27,348 --> 01:07:30,068
(Stir-fry them on high heat)

1409
01:07:31,068 --> 01:07:33,428
(Once the meat
has turned golden brown)

1410
01:07:34,908 --> 01:07:37,868
(Add vegetables and stir-fry them)

1411
01:07:40,668 --> 01:07:42,748
(After some time,
cook using low heat)

1412
01:07:43,748 --> 01:07:45,508
(Chili powder)

1413
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,308
(Oligosaccharide)

1414
01:07:47,908 --> 01:07:50,308
(After adding chili powder and
oligosaccharide to your liking,)

1415
01:07:50,428 --> 01:07:52,988
(stir-fry everything
until the color changes)

1416
01:07:55,508 --> 01:07:58,868
You just added chili powder
and oligosaccharide, didn't you?

1417
01:07:58,988 --> 01:07:59,748
Yes.

1418
01:08:01,388 --> 01:08:02,308
Let's let it cook a bit longer.

1419
01:08:07,388 --> 01:08:10,428
It's getting watery because
of the vegetables.

1420
01:08:10,548 --> 01:08:12,868
The fire is weaker than Yeolmoa.

1421
01:08:14,388 --> 01:08:18,348
This dish would be cooked
by now if we used Yeolmoa.

1422
01:08:18,868 --> 01:08:20,668
(Grinning)

1423
01:08:23,948 --> 01:08:26,148
This smells great.

1424
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:27,588
That is done.

1425
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:29,428
Spicy stir-fried pork is ready?

1426
01:08:29,548 --> 01:08:31,468
It's done.

1427
01:08:31,588 --> 01:08:33,668
Three dishes will be ready
once you plate them.

1428
01:08:33,788 --> 01:08:35,868
We will eat all three right now?

1429
01:08:35,988 --> 01:08:38,068
Do we have lettuce?

1430
01:08:38,188 --> 01:08:39,148
It's right here.

1431
01:08:40,108 --> 01:08:41,788
Lettuce.

1432
01:08:41,908 --> 01:08:42,628
Why? What about this?

1433
01:08:42,748 --> 01:08:43,948
There was the incident
with Haejin too.

1434
01:08:44,068 --> 01:08:44,748
Lettuce? Why?

1435
01:08:44,868 --> 01:08:45,668
(Ah)

1436
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,268
Haejin, please wash the lettuce.

1437
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:51,028
Do we have vinegar?

1438
01:08:54,068 --> 01:08:56,468
The lettuce. My goodness.

1439
01:08:56,588 --> 01:08:57,668
That was the funniest.

1440
01:08:57,788 --> 01:08:59,028
The lettuce turned into old rags.

1441
01:08:59,148 --> 01:09:02,068
I can never forget
that facial expression.

1442
01:09:02,188 --> 01:09:04,268
Why was the water colored?

1443
01:09:04,388 --> 01:09:06,308
How did that happen?

1444
01:09:08,988 --> 01:09:10,548
It looks like the vegetables...

1445
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:12,347
(He plates spicy stir-fried pork
over the lettuce)

1446
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:13,588
That looks good.

1447
01:09:16,988 --> 01:09:18,748
That looks wonderful.

1448
01:09:18,868 --> 01:09:22,108
Do we have that too?

1449
01:09:22,228 --> 01:09:23,908
That thing...

1450
01:09:24,028 --> 01:09:25,068
How did you know?

1451
01:09:25,188 --> 01:09:26,028
I've been working with you
for 10 years...

1452
01:09:26,148 --> 01:09:28,268
Yes. That's right. Good job.

1453
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:35,387
(The final cherry on top
is sesame seeds)

1454
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:37,468
Therefore...

1455
01:09:38,347 --> 01:09:39,268
That is the second dish.

1456
01:09:39,387 --> 01:09:41,908
All three dishes are ready.

1457
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,268
(The memorable meal on
'3 Meals A Day' is complete)

1458
01:09:49,108 --> 01:09:51,588
(A variety of memorable dishes)

1459
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:54,228
(flash through our minds)

1460
01:09:54,347 --> 01:09:56,028
Why did you add kimchi to this?

1461
01:09:56,148 --> 01:09:59,028
(The star of
gochujang kimchi jjigae)

1462
01:09:59,148 --> 01:10:02,387
(that got the attention
of the whole nation)

1463
01:10:02,988 --> 01:10:05,868
(Today, just as Chef Cha wants)

1464
01:10:05,988 --> 01:10:09,068
(this is the original
gochujang jjigae without kimchi)

1465
01:10:09,908 --> 01:10:12,268
(The one they failed to meet
despite waiting for a long time)

1466
01:10:12,387 --> 01:10:14,508
I'm curious about
bigfin reed squid.

1467
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:15,948
I'm curious too.

1468
01:10:17,468 --> 01:10:23,268
(Finally, they get to meet
bigfin reed squid today)

1469
01:10:24,268 --> 01:10:28,028
(Grill black pork belly of
Mount Jiri on the lid)

1470
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:33,868
(The day they wrapped the meat
in the lettuce from the patch)

1471
01:10:34,428 --> 01:10:37,628
(They can't forget the taste they
had at the slopes of Mount Jiri)

1472
01:10:38,628 --> 01:10:44,028
(Today, we get new Mount Jiri's
spicy stir-fried black pork)

1473
01:10:45,148 --> 01:10:48,068
(The must-have item in a meal
at '3 Meals A Day')

1474
01:10:48,188 --> 01:10:51,188
(Savory 50 percent polished rice)

1475
01:10:51,988 --> 01:10:54,347
Let's have some.

1476
01:10:54,988 --> 01:10:57,188
It feels weird to not have
drinks with this.

1477
01:10:57,307 --> 01:10:59,347
I never drink on shows.

1478
01:10:59,828 --> 01:11:02,788
(They even have welcome makgeolli
prepared as well)

1479
01:11:03,148 --> 01:11:06,347
Thank you so much for being
on this show. Bon appetit.

1480
01:11:06,468 --> 01:11:08,347
(They start their meal while
looking back at the past)

1481
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:12,628
(Taking a bite of spicy
stir-friend Mount Jiri black pork)

1482
01:11:13,387 --> 01:11:15,268
(Haejin takes two pieces
of lettuce)

1483
01:11:16,148 --> 01:11:19,748
(Two pieces of pork too)

1484
01:11:25,228 --> 01:11:25,948
Is it good?

1485
01:11:26,588 --> 01:11:27,708
The spicy stir-fried pork...

1486
01:11:27,828 --> 01:11:29,108
It's good, isn't it?

1487
01:11:29,228 --> 01:11:30,748
This is very delicious.

1488
01:11:30,868 --> 01:11:32,668
This rice is really good.

1489
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:33,708
The rice is perfect.

1490
01:11:33,828 --> 01:11:34,948
I can't believe how this rice...

1491
01:11:35,068 --> 01:11:36,988
If we add 3 cups of rice,

1492
01:11:37,108 --> 01:11:38,948
we need to add 4 cups of water.

1493
01:11:39,068 --> 01:11:40,668
Always add another cup of water.

1494
01:11:40,788 --> 01:11:43,268
You started to cook this rice
well since you have that.

1495
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:45,188
The rice cooker is amazing.

1496
01:11:48,268 --> 01:11:50,387
This is so good.

1497
01:11:51,188 --> 01:11:53,628
(Finally, they taste
the bigfin reed squid)

1498
01:11:55,588 --> 01:11:56,908
How did you catch this?

1499
01:11:59,068 --> 01:12:01,908
How do you catch a sea bream?

1500
01:12:02,028 --> 01:12:04,108
Back at Jukguldo...

1501
01:12:04,228 --> 01:12:05,108
You need

1502
01:12:05,228 --> 01:12:06,788
to get rid of that obsession.

1503
01:12:06,908 --> 01:12:08,148
Obsession?
That I have to catch something?

1504
01:12:08,268 --> 01:12:09,588
The thought that when something
bites the bait, it's a sea bream.

1505
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:13,668
When something bites the bait,
it's a sea bream.

1506
01:12:15,868 --> 01:12:17,668
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

1507
01:12:17,788 --> 01:12:19,307
I can go crazy easily.

1508
01:12:19,428 --> 01:12:20,548
(Finally, he understands)

1509
01:12:20,668 --> 01:12:22,668
- My goodness.
- Don't be obsessed.

1510
01:12:22,788 --> 01:12:25,628
- When you put it in...
- I relax when I cast my pole.

1511
01:12:25,748 --> 01:12:27,508
So why did you say that?

1512
01:12:27,628 --> 01:12:28,588
(Sorry)

1513
01:12:29,948 --> 01:12:32,908
(This is what Haejin sees)

1514
01:12:33,028 --> 01:12:36,148
(Crunchy kimchi)

1515
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:40,028
(Yummy)

1516
01:12:40,828 --> 01:12:41,988
Even the kimchi is tasty.

1517
01:12:43,828 --> 01:12:45,068
I...

1518
01:12:45,188 --> 01:12:46,268
Not bad.

1519
01:12:46,387 --> 01:12:47,188
What is?

1520
01:12:47,307 --> 01:12:49,387
When you mix gochujang jjigae
with kimchi,

1521
01:12:49,508 --> 01:12:50,788
it doesn't taste bad.

1522
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,628
Really?

1523
01:12:53,028 --> 01:12:54,788
You should have gochujang jjigae
with kimchi.

1524
01:12:54,908 --> 01:12:55,908
The taste is not bad at all.

1525
01:12:56,028 --> 01:12:56,788
I'll pass.

1526
01:12:58,347 --> 01:12:59,908
Add a piece of kimchi to
a spoon of gochujang jjigae.

1527
01:13:00,028 --> 01:13:02,188
(He tries this combination
as if he's being forced to)

1528
01:13:03,548 --> 01:13:04,748
(Yum)

1529
01:13:05,307 --> 01:13:06,868
(His preferences never change)

1530
01:13:07,347 --> 01:13:10,428
I think this season was great.

1531
01:13:10,548 --> 01:13:12,068
Except for the heat.

1532
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:13,307
Yes.

1533
01:13:14,347 --> 01:13:15,468
Youngwoong...

1534
01:13:15,588 --> 01:13:20,068
I think I saw that he had
a concert at a stadium.

1535
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:22,628
I suddenly

1536
01:13:22,748 --> 01:13:24,307
can't believe that someone

1537
01:13:24,428 --> 01:13:27,307
who had that stadium full
was with us.

1538
01:13:27,428 --> 01:13:29,068
Being just the two of us

1539
01:13:29,188 --> 01:13:30,748
does make the show light.

1540
01:13:30,868 --> 01:13:32,548
That means we will have
difficult days too.

1541
01:13:33,788 --> 01:13:35,788
Our standing position
is a bit weird.

1542
01:13:36,668 --> 01:13:37,548
No, a bit more.

1543
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:38,108
Hey.

1544
01:13:38,228 --> 01:13:40,188
You better decide
on one position right away.

1545
01:13:40,307 --> 01:13:41,748
Where do you want it to be?
Point right now.

1546
01:13:41,868 --> 01:13:44,588
(As expected, they get into
a fight all day long)

1547
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:46,307
We have to do it first
and see how it goes.

1548
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:49,068
Even if it means we have
to break our backs.

1549
01:13:49,188 --> 01:13:53,468
(They get to spend happy times
together after a long time)

1550
01:13:53,588 --> 01:13:56,828
(The one that makes
these kind of moments better)

1551
01:13:56,948 --> 01:13:58,347
Our guest has arrived.

1552
01:13:58,468 --> 01:14:00,548
(They received
four surprise guests)

1553
01:14:01,068 --> 01:14:04,028
(First guest is Lim Youngwoong)

1554
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:07,068
(Second guest is Kim Goeun)

1555
01:14:07,188 --> 01:14:10,228
(Third guest is Kim Namgil)

1556
01:14:10,347 --> 01:14:11,948
(Fourth guest)

1557
01:14:12,068 --> 01:14:14,268
(Uhm Taegoo)

1558
01:14:14,387 --> 01:14:15,828
You're no longer a guest now.

1559
01:14:15,948 --> 01:14:18,228
(The four of them spent time
with them like family)

1560
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:19,628
I'm mentally prepared for this.

1561
01:14:19,748 --> 01:14:20,988
(The first guest was mentally
prepared to come here)

1562
01:14:21,108 --> 01:14:22,628
(Lim Youngwoong is ready
to be a helping hand)

1563
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:23,708
Shall I do that?

1564
01:14:23,828 --> 01:14:25,548
I'm confident when it comes
to sawing.

1565
01:14:25,668 --> 01:14:27,068
(He is full of ambition
from the very start)

1566
01:14:27,188 --> 01:14:28,468
I have been working

1567
01:14:28,588 --> 01:14:29,948
with a furniture factory
since I was young.

1568
01:14:30,828 --> 01:14:32,868
(Wow)

1569
01:14:32,988 --> 01:14:34,108
(Slipping)

1570
01:14:34,228 --> 01:14:35,108
Lim...

1571
01:14:35,228 --> 01:14:36,628
This is very crooked.

1572
01:14:36,948 --> 01:14:39,668
(Unlike his ambitions, the result
of his work is dissatisfactory)

1573
01:14:39,988 --> 01:14:41,548
I think it's been more than
10 minutes since

1574
01:14:41,668 --> 01:14:42,468
I started peeling garlic.

1575
01:14:42,588 --> 01:14:43,668
However, I am not done
with even one.

1576
01:14:43,788 --> 01:14:45,307
(He was unable to peel
garlic either)

1577
01:14:45,428 --> 01:14:50,228
(Despite his clumsiness,
he is very passionate)

1578
01:14:50,347 --> 01:14:51,387
(Panting)

1579
01:14:55,668 --> 01:14:56,468
(Wow)

1580
01:14:57,028 --> 01:14:58,668
(Youngwoong eats a lot as
he has worked hard too)

1581
01:14:58,788 --> 01:15:00,468
I can't stop eating
because the food is delicious.

1582
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:03,307
(The next guest eats a lot too)

1583
01:15:03,428 --> 01:15:07,028
(Kim Goeun is someone
who loves tasty food)

1584
01:15:07,828 --> 01:15:10,268
(She eats curry with kkakdugi)

1585
01:15:10,387 --> 01:15:12,468
I ate so much.

1586
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:14,868
(She's not just good at eating)

1587
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:16,228
If we have to pressurize this,

1588
01:15:16,347 --> 01:15:18,268
we can just put a big stone
on the lid.

1589
01:15:18,387 --> 01:15:20,347
(Here comes the smart worker)

1590
01:15:20,468 --> 01:15:22,468
(Because of her smartness)

1591
01:15:22,588 --> 01:15:23,307
(Hmm)

1592
01:15:23,428 --> 01:15:23,988
Try this.

1593
01:15:24,307 --> 01:15:26,268
(The 50 percent polished rice
is a success)

1594
01:15:26,387 --> 01:15:27,668
- Goeun!
- Yes.

1595
01:15:27,788 --> 01:15:29,588
Just onion and potatoes...

1596
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:31,628
(All of the requests given to her)

1597
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:32,548
(were done without any errors)

1598
01:15:32,668 --> 01:15:34,948
You need to have someone
who is buckled down.

1599
01:15:35,068 --> 01:15:35,828
You know what I mean?

1600
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:38,588
(With Haejin)

1601
01:15:38,988 --> 01:15:42,868
(That is how they create the best
innovative item, Yeolmoa)

1602
01:15:42,988 --> 01:15:45,668
Things are much better
with you helping out.

1603
01:15:45,788 --> 01:15:47,268
It would've been bad
if you hadn't come here.

1604
01:15:47,387 --> 01:15:48,588
(Goeun is a gem-like person
in 3 Meals House)

1605
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:49,908
Just let those be.

1606
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:52,268
(The passionate guest is an
enthusiastic dish-washer)

1607
01:15:52,387 --> 01:15:55,068
(King of doing the dishes,
Kim Namgil)

1608
01:15:55,188 --> 01:15:59,268
I did lots of part-time jobs
before including doing the dishes.

1609
01:15:59,628 --> 01:16:01,668
(This guest that have a lot of
knowledge about doing the dishes)

1610
01:16:01,788 --> 01:16:04,828
(He is obsessed when
something smells strong)

1611
01:16:04,948 --> 01:16:07,307
- You used up all squeezed lemon?
- Yes, I did.

1612
01:16:07,908 --> 01:16:11,228
(He uses lemon to get rid
of the strong smell)

1613
01:16:11,668 --> 01:16:12,988
You're doing that again?

1614
01:16:13,108 --> 01:16:14,788
The smell is still there.

1615
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:16,468
Namaste.

1616
01:16:16,588 --> 01:16:18,188
I shouldn't turn into Haejin.

1617
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,307
(This guest got used to
everything faster than others)

1618
01:16:20,428 --> 01:16:21,828
Since I know them very well,

1619
01:16:21,948 --> 01:16:24,068
I don't feel
like I'm a guest here.

1620
01:16:24,188 --> 01:16:27,108
I feel like I've always been
a part of the team.

1621
01:16:27,228 --> 01:16:28,948
(No matter what the others do)

1622
01:16:29,068 --> 01:16:32,068
(Namgil was always by their side)

1623
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:32,708
(Giggle)

1624
01:16:32,828 --> 01:16:33,588
(Turning around)

1625
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:34,948
(Still asleep)

1626
01:16:35,068 --> 01:16:37,508
(Namgil left a lot of
happy energy at 3 Meals House)

1627
01:16:37,628 --> 01:16:38,468
Heart.

1628
01:16:40,268 --> 01:16:41,908
(At this unfamiliar 3 Meals House)

1629
01:16:42,468 --> 01:16:44,108
(The only place where
he can rely on)

1630
01:16:44,828 --> 01:16:47,068
(All Taegoo had was
his favorite pillar)

1631
01:16:47,548 --> 01:16:48,268
Taegoo.

1632
01:16:49,307 --> 01:16:50,228
(Giggling)

1633
01:16:50,347 --> 01:16:52,548
(Taegoo has changed a bit)

1634
01:16:52,668 --> 01:16:54,868
(Mulmoa is right in front
of Taegoo's lips)

1635
01:16:54,988 --> 01:16:56,108
That looks like a microphone.

1636
01:16:58,228 --> 01:17:00,068
- Did you feel that?
- I didn't feel it at all.

1637
01:17:00,188 --> 01:17:01,108
Neither did I.

1638
01:17:01,228 --> 01:17:02,948
I thought I would feel something.

1639
01:17:03,068 --> 01:17:05,508
(He was so relaxed that he could
even lie with a straight face)

1640
01:17:05,628 --> 01:17:07,108
Here you go.

1641
01:17:07,228 --> 01:17:11,028
(He is a smart guest who gets
what is needed right away)

1642
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,148
Taegoo, what do you like?

1643
01:17:13,268 --> 01:17:15,108
I'm like a robot.

1644
01:17:15,228 --> 01:17:16,188
I have cavities.

1645
01:17:18,188 --> 01:17:19,347
I... No, that's fine.

1646
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,588
Come on. Say it.

1647
01:17:21,508 --> 01:17:23,068
Actually,

1648
01:17:23,188 --> 01:17:24,508
before coming here,

1649
01:17:24,628 --> 01:17:25,668
I brushed my teeth.

1650
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:28,268
(Embarrassed)

1651
01:17:28,387 --> 01:17:29,188
I'm sorry.

1652
01:17:29,307 --> 01:17:31,828
(The awkward moments
are forgotten)

1653
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:35,908
(and Taegoo spent lots of
happy times with them)

1654
01:17:36,028 --> 01:17:37,108
Isn't that Kwangsoo?

1655
01:17:37,228 --> 01:17:38,428
We're here to buy potatoes.

1656
01:17:38,548 --> 01:17:42,508
(Kwangsoo and Kyungsoo who
gave them a surprise visit)

1657
01:17:42,628 --> 01:17:45,188
We filmed at three places.

1658
01:17:45,307 --> 01:17:47,228
Which was your favorite?

1659
01:17:47,347 --> 01:17:48,428
I love going to the mountain.

1660
01:17:49,668 --> 01:17:50,268
Going up Mount Jiri?

1661
01:17:50,387 --> 01:17:51,828
Yes, I loved that.

1662
01:17:51,948 --> 01:17:54,307
You shouldn't lie on TV shows.

1663
01:18:06,488 --> 01:18:08,728
My favorite was going
to the mountain.

1664
01:18:08,848 --> 01:18:10,608
I prefer mountains over oceans.

1665
01:18:11,447 --> 01:18:12,328
The ocean...

1666
01:18:12,447 --> 01:18:14,528
There's no place for us
to run to.

1667
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:16,968
But that's not how it is
at the mountains.

1668
01:18:17,088 --> 01:18:20,688
Chuja Island would've been great
if it wasn't hot.

1669
01:18:22,168 --> 01:18:23,968
The ocean is very refreshing.

1670
01:18:25,928 --> 01:18:29,128
The waves continue to crash.

1671
01:18:29,248 --> 01:18:31,728
It sounds refreshing like soda.

1672
01:18:31,848 --> 01:18:34,728
The peak where
the pavilion is located at.

1673
01:18:34,848 --> 01:18:35,608
Right? You know
that place, right?

1674
01:18:35,728 --> 01:18:36,528
You liked that?

1675
01:18:36,648 --> 01:18:37,768
There's something
about that place.

1676
01:18:37,888 --> 01:18:40,248
I think it would be wonderful
to run there right now.

1677
01:18:42,248 --> 01:18:44,288
(This summer was very hot)

1678
01:18:45,048 --> 01:18:46,768
(They went up the mountain)

1679
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:48,568
(Crossed the ocean)

1680
01:18:50,128 --> 01:18:54,808
(They arrived at three
3 Meals House)

1681
01:18:55,128 --> 01:18:57,008
There is no shade at all.

1682
01:18:57,768 --> 01:18:59,888
(The common trait
of all these houses)

1683
01:19:00,248 --> 01:19:01,128
It's hot.

1684
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:04,248
(No shade)

1685
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:05,928
(Thinking hard)

1686
01:19:06,048 --> 01:19:07,447
The handle is hot now.

1687
01:19:07,768 --> 01:19:09,367
(There was no shade
at Mount Jiri either)

1688
01:19:09,928 --> 01:19:11,568
(All of their houses are places
without any shade)

1689
01:19:11,688 --> 01:19:13,568
It's amazing.

1690
01:19:13,688 --> 01:19:16,008
If we sit at the porch
when the weather is hot,

1691
01:19:16,128 --> 01:19:17,008
we get annoyed.

1692
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:19,128
That will cause a lot of
arguments and trouble.

1693
01:19:19,248 --> 01:19:20,608
I hate that.

1694
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:23,648
(They found a shaded place
to start their outing)

1695
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:26,328
(They go out when it's hot)

1696
01:19:26,447 --> 01:19:29,168
(They had makguksu instead of
being in front of the hot brazier)

1697
01:19:32,488 --> 01:19:35,168
(This time, they are in the car
instead of in their house)

1698
01:19:35,288 --> 01:19:37,728
(Healing with
cooling air-conditioner)

1699
01:19:37,848 --> 01:19:40,728
(They even go shopping
since they're out)

1700
01:19:41,248 --> 01:19:43,848
(Summer is hot but is the season
to enjoy the ocean)

1701
01:19:45,568 --> 01:19:48,488
(This time, they avoid
the heat by going in the ocean)

1702
01:19:49,928 --> 01:19:53,528
(The time to forget about the heat
by being in the cool ocean)

1703
01:19:53,648 --> 01:19:56,128
(They even rode a boat
to have fun on the ocean)

1704
01:19:57,088 --> 01:19:59,608
(Even the fishing novice,
Seungwon)

1705
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:02,048
(And fishing expert, Mr. Ocean)

1706
01:20:02,168 --> 01:20:05,528
(The thrill that makes them
forget the heat)

1707
01:20:06,288 --> 01:20:07,888
Nice.

1708
01:20:09,248 --> 01:20:12,528
(They forget the heat completely
by being on the ocean)

1709
01:20:12,848 --> 01:20:14,168
Why am I

1710
01:20:14,288 --> 01:20:15,248
excited?

1711
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:17,528
I don't really love mountains.

1712
01:20:17,648 --> 01:20:19,248
Let's walk slowly.

1713
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:25,288
(The one who hates to sweat
began to run)

1714
01:20:27,848 --> 01:20:31,048
(Mount Jiri has the charm
of making Seungwon run)

1715
01:20:31,168 --> 01:20:33,648
(They arrived at the peak
after struggling)

1716
01:20:33,768 --> 01:20:35,728
(Scenery that clears their minds)

1717
01:20:36,568 --> 01:20:40,328
(View of Mount Jiri makes
them forget about the heat)

1718
01:20:40,447 --> 01:20:41,728
It was exciting

1719
01:20:41,848 --> 01:20:43,168
to run up there.

1720
01:20:44,008 --> 01:20:46,568
(Haejin who ran up Mount Jiri)

1721
01:20:47,088 --> 01:20:49,128
(Pyeongchang)

1722
01:20:49,248 --> 01:20:51,008
(Chuja Island)

1723
01:20:51,128 --> 01:20:53,088
(Mount Jiri)

1724
01:20:54,048 --> 01:20:56,688
(He continues to jog despite
changing their location)

1725
01:20:56,808 --> 01:20:59,848
The good thing about running is
that I get to see this place.

1726
01:21:00,528 --> 01:21:04,688
(Haejin goes on his morning jog
to enjoy 3 Meals House)

1727
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:09,128
(Haejin's favorite course)

1728
01:21:10,248 --> 01:21:13,608
(A refreshing view.
Running course in Chuja Island)

1729
01:21:14,848 --> 01:21:18,447
(When his breath gets short)

1730
01:21:19,168 --> 01:21:22,848
(It's the place to enjoy
a vast view)

1731
01:21:23,407 --> 01:21:26,768
(This is the best spot
as chosen by Haejin)

1732
01:21:26,888 --> 01:21:28,928
The views

1733
01:21:29,048 --> 01:21:31,768
from all angles are breathtaking.

1734
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:34,768
Look at the sun rising.

1735
01:21:35,088 --> 01:21:37,128
Today, how are we going

1736
01:21:37,248 --> 01:21:38,288
to avoid the sun again?

1737
01:21:40,447 --> 01:21:44,008
(They went to the mountain and
ocean during the hot summer)

1738
01:21:44,848 --> 01:21:48,848
(They enjoyed summer
at various places)

1739
01:21:49,648 --> 01:21:53,208
(They made new memories)

1740
01:21:54,008 --> 01:21:56,248
After we are done shooting,

1741
01:21:56,367 --> 01:21:58,088
we always listen to
Haejin's PL.

1742
01:21:58,208 --> 01:21:59,168
What is PL?

1743
01:21:59,288 --> 01:22:01,447
- Playlist.
- Playlist.

1744
01:22:01,568 --> 01:22:03,447
You listen to your playlist
when you do the dishes.

1745
01:22:03,568 --> 01:22:06,328
You listen to a lot of songs
by JANNABI.

1746
01:22:06,447 --> 01:22:07,608
Oohyo.

1747
01:22:07,728 --> 01:22:10,288
You also listen to many
old pop songs too.

1748
01:22:10,407 --> 01:22:11,968
And recent ones too.

1749
01:22:12,088 --> 01:22:13,968
Your interest in music is wide.

1750
01:22:14,088 --> 01:22:15,728
Yes, definitely.

1751
01:22:16,447 --> 01:22:18,848
(He enjoys all genres)

1752
01:22:18,968 --> 01:22:24,048
(Which song would you recommend
for today, our last meeting?)

1753
01:22:24,168 --> 01:22:26,367
That song would be perfect.

1754
01:22:28,367 --> 01:22:30,688
Bam, bam, bam. Bam, bam, bam.

1755
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:34,248
(The song that we hear after
our time at karaoke is over?)

1756
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:37,328
It would be fun to wrap up
this show with that song.

1757
01:22:37,447 --> 01:22:39,328
Let's meet again next time.

1758
01:22:39,447 --> 01:22:41,367
(Just like the lyrics,
let's meet again in the future)

1759
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:43,848
- Good job.
- Good job.

1760
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:46,128
You did great.

1761
01:22:46,248 --> 01:22:47,648
Good job.

1762
01:22:49,688 --> 01:22:52,447
This is our 10th year
anniversary special.

1763
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:54,208
You've been working on
this show for 10 years.

1764
01:22:54,328 --> 01:22:55,528
When we first started this show

1765
01:22:55,648 --> 01:22:58,848
10 years ago, we started
with just the two of you too.

1766
01:22:58,968 --> 01:23:03,568
Did Seungwon change
as compared to back then?

1767
01:23:03,688 --> 01:23:05,447
I'm the same.

1768
01:23:05,568 --> 01:23:07,928
He has become this much kinder.

1769
01:23:09,608 --> 01:23:11,928
But during this season,

1770
01:23:12,048 --> 01:23:15,728
on our first episode
in Pyeongchang,

1771
01:23:16,688 --> 01:23:18,367
I realized that he hadn't change.

1772
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:21,447
(He never changes)

1773
01:23:22,968 --> 01:23:24,367
In general,

1774
01:23:24,488 --> 01:23:26,728
he just became a bit kinder.

1775
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,888
As compared to before?

1776
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:30,008
Was he even grumpier
10 years ago?

1777
01:23:30,128 --> 01:23:32,048
(I don't even want to talk
about it)

1778
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:33,608
Stop it right now.

1779
01:23:33,728 --> 01:23:35,928
If not, I wouldn't have left home.

1780
01:23:36,048 --> 01:23:37,728
(The reason for Haejin
always being outdoors)

1781
01:23:37,848 --> 01:23:39,728
You said that this show
started with just us.

1782
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,128
As for me,

1783
01:23:41,248 --> 01:23:43,407
for better or for worse,

1784
01:23:43,528 --> 01:23:46,568
to me, he is someone who
I could rely on well.

1785
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,128
We went to Nogodan Peak,
didn't we?

1786
01:23:51,447 --> 01:23:53,728
I saw him from the back.

1787
01:23:53,848 --> 01:23:55,768
He looked big.

1788
01:23:57,008 --> 01:23:59,848
Why are you talking about
something positive right now?

1789
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:01,768
Back at Manjae Island,

1790
01:24:01,888 --> 01:24:03,888
he looked

1791
01:24:04,008 --> 01:24:06,328
kind of small.

1792
01:24:06,447 --> 01:24:07,928
For various reasons.

1793
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:10,128
For many reasons,

1794
01:24:10,248 --> 01:24:13,088
I feel that now is much better
as compared to the past.

1795
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:16,447
What would you tell Haejin
from back then?

1796
01:24:16,568 --> 01:24:17,968
Let's work together well.

1797
01:24:19,528 --> 01:24:20,288
Haejin from back then?

1798
01:24:20,407 --> 01:24:23,208
Yes, I'd tell him that we
should get along well.

1799
01:24:23,888 --> 01:24:26,048
What would you tell
Seungwon from back then?

1800
01:24:28,728 --> 01:24:29,928
Let's get along.

1801
01:24:34,848 --> 01:24:37,367
You argue every day.

1802
01:24:37,488 --> 01:24:41,447
What is the reason you stayed
together for 10 years?

1803
01:24:41,568 --> 01:24:44,168
Just like what I mentioned before,

1804
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:47,008
we are close to one another
in a way that people don't know.

1805
01:24:47,128 --> 01:24:50,568
I doubt I would be on this show
if it was someone else.

1806
01:24:50,688 --> 01:24:53,808
We go to a new place every time.

1807
01:24:53,928 --> 01:24:57,648
I feel some excitement when
I get to travel with him.

1808
01:24:57,768 --> 01:24:59,768
I was excited like I was
going out on a picnic.

1809
01:24:59,888 --> 01:25:01,248
My heart fluttered.

1810
01:25:01,367 --> 01:25:04,208
Although we fought now and then,

1811
01:25:04,328 --> 01:25:06,848
that was the reason
I'm still on this show.

1812
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:08,728
(Yet they have been together
for the past 10 years)

1813
01:25:10,248 --> 01:25:12,208
It felt like I went on a picnic.

1814
01:25:13,328 --> 01:25:15,648
We would fight one another...

1815
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:21,968
It's like we're pretending
to be cold-hearted.

1816
01:25:22,088 --> 01:25:24,928
That is the kind of warmth
we had.

1817
01:25:25,048 --> 01:25:26,968
I bet everybody knows now,

1818
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:29,528
honestly,

1819
01:25:29,648 --> 01:25:32,128
cooking in this hot weather

1820
01:25:32,248 --> 01:25:33,568
is not easy at all.

1821
01:25:33,688 --> 01:25:35,288
Yet, he made it tasty.

1822
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:37,407
I'm grateful to him for
things like that.

1823
01:25:37,528 --> 01:25:39,808
This is what I'm
very grateful about to him.

1824
01:25:39,928 --> 01:25:41,447
I think it was in Pyeongchang.

1825
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:45,128
The wok was very heavy.

1826
01:25:45,248 --> 01:25:47,288
I thought I was about to drop it.

1827
01:25:47,407 --> 01:25:49,168
Then he suddenly held it.

1828
01:25:52,168 --> 01:25:54,168
I was very thankful for that.

1829
01:25:54,288 --> 01:25:56,008
Back then,

1830
01:25:56,128 --> 01:25:57,928
I made many mistakes.

1831
01:25:59,848 --> 01:26:03,008
So I wanted to make it up
to you in any way I could.

1832
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:05,848
No, that's not it.

1833
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:09,888
I'm grateful
for things like that too.

1834
01:26:10,128 --> 01:26:13,128
It's been a while since
we spent time just the two of us.

1835
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,048
Yes.

1836
01:26:15,648 --> 01:26:19,488
(Just them going out on a picnic
for the first time in a long time)

1837
01:26:19,608 --> 01:26:21,128
Look at the pine tree
behind the house.

1838
01:26:21,248 --> 01:26:22,088
It's beautiful.

1839
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,688
- It's not cooked, is it?
- No, it isn't.

1840
01:26:23,808 --> 01:26:26,407
I told you that you need
to add more water.

1841
01:26:26,528 --> 01:26:27,648
- Earlier, you told me to stop.
- No.

1842
01:26:27,768 --> 01:26:30,328
(Arguing each time they meet
is part of their life)

1843
01:26:31,048 --> 01:26:32,648
(As soon as Seungwon's
slippers broke)

1844
01:26:33,048 --> 01:26:35,367
(Haejin immediately gets him
a new pair)

1845
01:26:35,488 --> 01:26:37,488
(That was how Haejin was)

1846
01:26:37,608 --> 01:26:39,407
Thank you.

1847
01:26:44,168 --> 01:26:46,288
(It's okay even if
the wok is heavy from now on)

1848
01:26:46,407 --> 01:26:48,808
(It's because I have a friend
who is always by my side)

1849
01:26:48,928 --> 01:26:50,728
(It's because they're together)

1850
01:26:50,848 --> 01:26:53,208
(The moments when they
rely on one another)

1851
01:26:53,328 --> 01:26:54,447
Honey.

1852
01:26:54,568 --> 01:26:56,008
You're sweating again.

1853
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:56,848
Me?

1854
01:26:56,968 --> 01:26:57,888
(He expressed his worries first)

1855
01:26:58,008 --> 01:26:58,608
It's okay.

1856
01:26:58,728 --> 01:27:00,928
I'm being cautious so that
I don't sweat.

1857
01:27:01,048 --> 01:27:03,048
(While they are joking around
with one another)

1858
01:27:03,407 --> 01:27:04,928
I don't eat kimchi stew that
has pork in it.

1859
01:27:05,048 --> 01:27:06,728
Neither do I. I don't like that.

1860
01:27:06,848 --> 01:27:08,248
I usually only add pork.

1861
01:27:08,928 --> 01:27:11,128
(For Haejin who does not fancy
pork and kimchi stew)

1862
01:27:11,248 --> 01:27:14,648
(He adds tuna instead of pork
for Haejin)

1863
01:27:14,768 --> 01:27:20,128
(He makes kimchi stew
with lots of fish cakes)

1864
01:27:20,248 --> 01:27:21,968
That looks good.

1865
01:27:22,928 --> 01:27:24,288
Let me see.

1866
01:27:26,648 --> 01:27:35,528
(Perhaps that's the reason they
could spend time together)

1867
01:27:37,168 --> 01:27:41,447
(This is the end of the picnic
that they started before)

1868
01:27:43,048 --> 01:27:48,128
(They look forward to the new
journey that comes as a surprise)

1869
01:27:51,488 --> 01:28:00,048
(Thank you for loving
'3 Meals A Day Light')

1870
01:28:00,168 --> 01:28:02,288
To the one who starts
the fire...

1871
01:28:08,168 --> 01:28:09,367
You just lie down?

1872
01:28:12,088 --> 01:28:14,447
- Finally, you're a person.
- Really?

1873
01:28:17,648 --> 01:28:18,888
Don't say a word.

1874
01:28:22,608 --> 01:28:23,447
Be quiet for a moment.

1875
01:28:32,088 --> 01:28:33,088
That's how it is.

1876
01:28:42,088 --> 01:28:44,008
It was just a nightmare.

1877
01:28:50,928 --> 01:28:53,367
I think we get to meet again
faster than expected.

1878
01:29:00,528 --> 01:29:02,447
You didn't even miss any spot.

1879
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:06,888
Will we get something?

1880
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:11,608
Done.

1881
01:29:11,728 --> 01:29:13,288
Do it like this?

1882
01:29:15,447 --> 01:29:16,248
What is that?

1883
01:29:48,848 --> 01:29:50,328
- Did you feel that?
- Not at all.

1884
01:29:53,288 --> 01:29:55,888
Until I could eat...

1885
01:30:09,568 --> 01:30:10,488
Good job.

1886
01:30:10,608 --> 01:30:11,568
Good job.

1887
01:30:11,688 --> 01:30:12,728
I enjoyed the meal.

1888
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:30,328
(10th year anniversary special,
