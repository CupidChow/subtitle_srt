1
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,137
- That was really hard.
- It was.

2
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,014
Let's win with a landslide victory.

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,282
- We will.
- Of course.

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,118
Seeing how we all played as Aces,
we have a well-balanced team.

5
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,311
Who was the Ace yesterday?

6
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:20,563
- Jung-min.
- Space perception.

7
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,823
- We all got to be Aces.
- That's right.

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,124
We have a killer team.

9
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,593
Let's win this thing!

10
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:27,904
Let's win! We'll win!

11
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,531
We are KU
Let's go! Let's fight! Let's win!

12
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:34,034
Let's go

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,304
And defeat Team SNU

14
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:40,833
- Let's do this.
- We've got this.

15
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:44,921
- We can totally win today.
- Of course.

16
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,423
So let's just enjoy ourselves.

17
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,842
But at the same time,
we can't let our guard down.

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,095
Wasn't KU originally named after
a dynasty that fell?

19
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:54,889
SNU will win.

20
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,225
Here we go!

21
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,770
- Let's focus.
- Let's go!

22
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,271
Let's do this!

23
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,820
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League.

24
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,281
Seoul National University,

25
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,991
Yonsei University,

26
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,659
Korea University,

27
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,160
KAIST,

28
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,121
POSTECH,

29
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:20,999
and Harvard University.

30
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,502
Students from these six elite schools
battled it out with their wits.

31
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,546
Out of these six schools,
Team SNU and Team KU

32
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,133
are the only two teams
that have made it to the finals.

33
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:37,065
FINALS
3 ROUNDS OF MAIN MATCHES

34
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,332
Three games?

35
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,852
Whoever wins two games first wins.

36
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,146
The members of the winning team
will be awarded ten million won each,

37
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,707
totaling 40 million won in scholarships.

38
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,490
Which team will triumph

39
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,617
in the battle of wits
among the top universities?

40
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:00,621
Let the Elite League finals begin.

41
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:01,747
Let's go!

42
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,082
Korea University!

43
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,834
- For the nation!
- For the nation!

44
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:06,627
- SNU!
- For independence!

45
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:15,386
I knew we needed to have
a go-getter spirit to win this game.

46
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,680
- Sixty...
- He's a legend in the math department.

47
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:19,431
MATH AFICIONADO
TEAM KU'S DONG-KYU

48
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,226
- It's 18, 89, and 152.
- That is correct.

49
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,856
We don't need to share everything.
Let's keep at least one undisclosed.

50
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,649
SHARP STRATEGIST
TEAM KU'S JUNG-MIN

51
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,484
- The answer is 587.
- That is correct.

52
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:31,944
- The answer is 62.
- That is correct.

53
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:35,322
KING OF MEMORIZATION
TEAM KU'S SEUNG-MIN

54
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,824
He's really good.

55
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,450
You made all the right choices!

56
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,080
Okay, I'll be the team's golden baby.

57
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,931
The left corner
will be our point of reference.

58
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,499
GOLDEN BABY
TEAM KU'S JI-SOO

59
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:49,536
The fourth person who got it right
is Lee Ji-soo from Team KU.

60
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,881
2ND PLACE IN 300

61
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,173
1ST PLACE IN SIGNAL INVESTIGATION

62
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,134
1ST PLACE IN FIND MY PERSONALITY TYPE

63
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,615
GREAT COORDINATION AND AMAZING TEAMWORK

64
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,178
Team KU may be the strongest team here.

65
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,661
A WELL-BALANCED TEAM
Korea University!

66
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:01,473
- For the nation!
- For the nation!

67
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,719
I'm sure we will win.

68
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,106
Here's your question.

69
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,160
That was fast.

70
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,613
The first person who got it right
is Jung Hyun-bin from Team SNU.

71
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,239
SUPERLATIVE MIND
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN

72
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,198
Can I guess the hidden number?

73
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,284
- I'll go with 1163.
- You answered correctly.

74
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,702
Master of Prime Numbers.

75
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:24,080
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin
has connected five stones.

76
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:25,664
I'll go down, right, and up.

77
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,808
- You win one point.
- He's so good.

78
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,144
You'll experience
the might of Korean education.

79
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,838
WELL-EARNED BRAVADO
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-SEOK

80
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,314
Is it me? You should pick me.

81
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,983
Song Hyun-seok answered correctly.

82
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,984
I'm the king!

83
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,687
So if you place an X to the right,
he won't be able to block you.

84
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,014
GENIUS STRATEGIST
TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN

85
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,266
I'll move the dice right, down, and left.

86
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,893
You win one point.

87
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,603
I have the answer.

88
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:48,787
Do you want to team up?

89
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:50,898
BOLD NEGOTIATOR
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-MIN

90
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,366
You're considering it, right?

91
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,734
Do you plan on comparing cards?

92
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:58,614
OUTSTANDING PLAYERS WITHOUT EQUALS
...is from Team SNU.

93
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:02,201
TEAM SNU IS THE BEST AT PLAYING TACTICALLY

94
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,369
- Victory is SNU's!
- Victory is SNU's!

95
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,590
Victory is SNU's.

96
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,927
All the numbers point to our victory.

97
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,986
ELITE LEAGUE

98
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,404
The first main match is...

99
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,951
"It is 500."

100
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,789
Team SNU seemed pretty confident.

101
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,749
It only bolstered my desire to win.

102
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,835
The first main match is

103
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,670
Formula Vaults.

104
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,882
- "Formula Vaults"?
- It must be a calculation game.

105
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,051
If it's calculations,
we have a definite edge.

106
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,760
- Right.
- We'll do well.

107
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,221
In Formula Vaults,

108
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,307
you will be asked
to unlock 28 locks with a 4-digit code

109
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,061
TARGET NUMBER: 540
and create the target number.

110
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:13,105
Before the match begins,
each team will select two members.

111
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:17,151
One member will memorize the codes,
and the other will create a formula.

112
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:18,944
One for memorization
and the other for formulas.

113
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,279
You two should team up.

114
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,532
When the match begins,
the player in charge of memorization

115
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,911
will be given 5 minutes
to memorize 28 codes.

116
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:30,039
They will then be given
ten minutes to unlock the locks.

117
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,709
Once they retrieve the number cards
and the operator cards from the vaults,

118
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,296
they will hand them over
to the player in charge of the formula.

119
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:40,041
The vaults contain 2 sets of number cards
ranging from 1 to 10

120
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,610
and additional operator cards
including square roots, parentheses,

121
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,381
factorials, and exponents,
which will be provided in sets of two.

122
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:49,650
- Did she say two sets?
- Yes.

123
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,978
That's 28 cards in total.

124
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:54,814
- My head is spinning.
- Players in charge of the formula

125
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:59,193
will use the 28 cards from the vaults
and the provided 4 operator cards

126
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:02,696
to create a formula
for the target number within five minutes.

127
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,034
You will be given
three target numbers for each round.

128
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,247
The first to create a formula
for the target number wins one point.

129
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,498
TARGET NUMBER: 540

130
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,582
It's not so bad.

131
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,251
I feel pretty confident.

132
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,131
You may not create two-digit numbers
with the cards you obtained.

133
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,425
However, you may use
the number cards more than once.

134
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,187
The game consists of three rounds,

135
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:28,655
and the team
that wins five points first wins.

136
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:32,143
My input will be invaluable
if we're given large numbers.

137
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,437
Memorization and calculation
are areas I excel in,

138
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,689
so I was pretty happy.

139
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:41,652
Both teams,
please prepare for the first main match.

140
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,569
Let's go.

141
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:44,905
Good luck.

142
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,640
- Let's go!
- Good luck!

143
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:50,661
Let's decide who will handle the formula.

144
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,538
Any volunteers?
I don't think I should do it.

145
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,498
You should go
since the first round is important.

146
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,917
Memorizing codes in the first round
will be hard, so I'll go first.

147
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,461
Do-hyun is good with formulas,
so he'll handle that for the first round.

148
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,722
I'm bad at memorizing things,
so you do that for the second round,

149
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,057
and I'll handle the formula.

150
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,525
Let's see how it goes,
and then decide on the third round.

151
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,762
Hyun-bin was confident
in his memorization skills,

152
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:12,099
which made me hopeful
that we would do well in this game.

153
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:16,520
We also decided that I would be in charge
of the formula for the first round.

154
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,647
- Dong-kyu's our best bet for the formula.
- Obviously.

155
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:19,706
He'd be best at it.

156
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,650
Seung-min should take
the memorization part.

157
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:22,776
Are there 28 codes?

158
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:26,155
We determined that memorizing the codes
for the first round would be important.

159
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,882
Seung-min has shown
great performance in that area,

160
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,911
so we entrusted him
with memorization for the first round.

161
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:36,456
What do you feel more comfortable with?

162
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,293
You need to take on
what you think you're better at.

163
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:42,380
Dong-kyu is really good
at making formulas for large numbers.

164
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,298
We knew the numbers
would grow larger each round,

165
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,550
so we decided
that I'd play in the first round,

166
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,761
and Dong-kyu would play
in the second round.

167
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,596
Tell me what you need.

168
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,933
If you tell me what you need,
I'll prioritize memorizing that.

169
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,893
I need 1, 2, 3, factorial, and exponent.

170
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,895
I also need either a 5 or a 10.

171
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,772
Don't we need all the prime numbers?

172
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,107
Prime numbers? 2, 3, 5, and 7?

173
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,110
My goal is to retrieve 14 different cards.

174
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:08,072
I think we actually have
a shot at winning this game.

175
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,160
What worries me most
is how difficult this is going to be.

176
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,870
The numbers are going to get larger.

177
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,748
Tell me what I should prioritize.

178
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,633
I'll go for the number cards first.

179
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,794
Get as many number cards
as you can from 1 to 6.

180
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,438
We need seven too.

181
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,504
You're right.

182
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,132
You can't replace it
with any other number.

183
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,507
- So numbers 1 to 7?
- Yes.

184
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,634
I'll target these first.

185
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,970
I need parentheses and exclamation marks.

186
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:32,138
I mean, factorials.

187
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:33,722
I also need exponents.

188
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:36,100
- These are next in line?
- Right.

189
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,186
I wanted to retrieve
at least one of each number card.

190
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,025
For the operator cards, I prioritized
factorials, parentheses, and exponents.

191
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:46,652
I'll do my best.

192
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,863
Your time is up.

193
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,067
Both teams,
please gather at the Main Hall.

194
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,785
Let's go. In three.

195
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,004
- Victory is SNU's!
- Victory is SNU's!

196
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:59,798
- Korea University!
- For the nation!

197
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,250
- For the nation!
- For the nation!

198
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:20,560
You can do it.

199
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:30,530
Players for the first round,
please step forward.

200
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:31,947
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

201
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,449
- You've got this.
- Let's go.

202
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,367
Let's do this.

203
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,951
TEAM SNU'S PLAYERS FOR ROUND 1

204
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:38,329

TEAM KU'S PLAYERS FOR ROUND 1

206
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,501
MEMORIZATION: SEUNG-MIN
FORMULA: JUNG-MIN

207
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,632
My goal is to get as many codes as I can.

208
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,394
Good luck.

209
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:02,403
Even if Hyun-bin is a formidable player,
there's no reason to be intimidated.

210
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,523
I just need to stay calm
and memorize the codes.

211
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,110
28 CODES AND 28 CARDS

212
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:21,330
TIME TO MEMORIZE: 5 MINUTES

213
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,831
FORMULA VAULTS

214
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:34,051
The codes for Formula Vaults
will now be revealed.

215
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:41,016
CODES FOR FORMULA VAULTS

216
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,544
You have three minutes.

217
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:15,843
You have one minute.

218
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,806
You have ten seconds.

219
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,519
Your time is up.

220
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,312
TIME TO MEMORIZE CODES IS UP

221
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,147
Your time is up.

222
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,234
You now have ten minutes

223
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:35,762
to unlock the vaults
with the codes you have memorized.

224
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:41,902
Please...

225
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,632
I thought it'd be too challenging

226
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,593
to memorize all four digits of the codes.

227
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:59,761
So I just memorized the first three digits

228
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:03,824
and rotated the dial
to find the last digit.

229
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:12,567
TEAM KU'S SEUNG-MIN
NUMBER OF OPEN VAULTS: 7

230
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,583
- He's good. He opened ten already.
- Good job.

231
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,689
NUMBER OF OPEN VAULTS
TEAM KU: 7, TEAM SNU: 12

232
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,889
You have five minutes.

233
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:43,531
I tried to find a connection
between the number cards and the codes

234
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:45,933
when I memorized the codes to the vault.

235
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,852
If I couldn't find a connection,
I just relied on memory.

236
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,771
Look at him go.

237
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,481
You have three minutes.

238
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:58,512
NUMBER OF OPEN VAULTS
TEAM KU: 9, TEAM SNU: 16

239
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,551
I couldn't believe my eyes,
and I wondered if he was human.

240
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:06,078
It seemed like his brain
was twice the size of mine.

241
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,922
Start arranging the cards.

242
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,604
- Do you have the code for factorials?
- Sure.

243
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:37,985
Look at all their cards.

244
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:39,720
That's incredible.

245
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:52,333
I memorized the codes
that were easier for me to remember

246
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,668
and unlocked those first.

247
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:56,136
And in the process
of unlocking those locks,

248
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,589
I forgot the ones
that were harder to memorize.

249
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,261
You have two minutes.

250
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:08,140
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN
SECURES ONE MORE NUMBER CARD

251
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,586
He's amazing.

252
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:16,357
- How is he doing that?
- I love you!

253
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,901
I trust Hyun-bin with my life.

254
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,111
- I know.
- If my kid gets sick, I'll go to him.

255
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,116
How many cards did he get
in the first round alone?

256
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,667
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN OBTAINS
THE FACTORIAL CARD DO-HYUN REQUESTED

257
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,715
We need factorials,
but we haven't got any yet.

258
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:49,098
TEAM KU'S SEUNG-MIN
HASN'T SECURED A SINGLE FACTORIAL CARD

259
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,673
- He did it.
- I love Hyun-bin.

260
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,824
He's insane.

261
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,326
Did he just open 19 vaults?

262
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:13,163
- There's a reason he got a perfect score.
- I'm naming my son after him.

263
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:18,018
I kept turning the dial,
hoping that I would unlock one more vault.

264
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,839
I told myself not to get phased.

265
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,227
FORMULA VAULTS

266
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,263
Your time to open the vaults is up.

267
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:32,466
TIME TO OPEN VAULTS IS UP

268
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:36,813
I unlocked a good many of them.

269
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:39,106
- They don't have that many cards.
- Okay.

270
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:46,947
FORMULA VAULTS
ACQUIRED CARDS

271
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:51,853
TEAM KU: 9
TEAM SNU: 19

272
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,665
Compared to Team SNU,

273
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:58,835
I failed to retrieve
a lot of the cards my team needed.

274
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,755
And I beat myself up for it.

275
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:06,592
We will now reveal the target number.

276
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,851
Here is your target number.

277
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,978
The target number is 133.

278
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,782
The target number is 133.

279
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:26,403
TARGET NUMBER: 133
TEAM SNU'S CARDS

280
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,576
You have five minutes.

TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN'S ANSWER

282
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,339
That works.

283
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:48,609
TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN'S ANSWER

284
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:49,677
That is correct.

285
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:52,145
CORRECT

286
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,313
What's he doing?

287
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:56,099
TEAM KU: 0, TEAM SNU: 1
Are we on Steel Troops or what?

288
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:57,977
That scared me.

289
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:04,358
I also thought of
2 to the power of 7 plus 5,

290
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,894
but I didn't have the cards for 2 or 5.

291
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,784
We will now reveal the next target number.

292
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,371
The target number is 0.9375.

293
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:18,581
TARGET NUMBER: 0.9375

294
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,041
It's 0.9375...

295
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:24,678
The target number is 0.9375.

296
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,014
Doesn't it equal 9375/10000?

297
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,640
With 80 as the denominator...

298
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:38,601
- With 10000...
- That's 75/80, right?

299
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,477
- With 10000...
- It's 75/80.

300
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,429
We need 625/10000.

301
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:45,357
And 625 equals 5 to the power of 4.

302
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,610
Then it's 1 over 2 to the power of 4.

303
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:51,196
We can get the target number
with 1 minus 1 over 2 to the power of 4.

304
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,540
- It's--
- But he doesn't have two.

305
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:54,283
Right. Then he could use four...

306
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:55,943
He doesn't four either.

307
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:58,830
TEAM KU DOESN'T HAVE
THE NUMBER CARDS THEY NEED

308
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:00,205
Two to the power of four.

309
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,131
He's so fast at calculation.

00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:23,187
TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN'S ANSWER

311
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,355
Please...

312
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:34,573
- What did he come up with?
- Did he get it right?

313
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,052
TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN'S ANSWER

314
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,119
That is correct.

315
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,873
CORRECT

316
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,167
I realized it would be hard
for us to win this round.

317
00:18:46,694 --> 00:18:49,063
TEAM KU: 0
TEAM SNU: 2

318
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,432
We will now reveal
the third target number.

319
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:57,179
Your target number is 1234.

320
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:59,440
TARGET NUMBER: 1234

321
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:10,902
TARGET NUMBER: 1234
TEAM SNU'S CARDS

322
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:13,654
I need 1296 minus 6 times 10...

323
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,931
Hurry up, Do-hyun.

324
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,280
TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN'S ANSWER

325
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,974
Your answer is being verified.

326
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,643
- Did he get it right?
- I'm sure he did.

327
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:47,438
- It's correct, right?
- I think that was his logic.

328
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:53,903
That is correct.

329
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,571
CORRECT

330
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,156
Let's go, Team SNU!

331
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:58,574
TEAM KU: 0
TEAM SNU: 3

332
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,575
Let's go, Team SNU!

333
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,370
You did great.

334
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,498
I can't believe
I used 6 to the power of 4.

335
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:07,917
- It equalled 1296.
- Really?

336
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:14,348
TEAM KU WASN'T ABLE TO COME UP
WITH A FORMULA FOR ALL 3 ROUNDS

337
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:20,262
That concludes
the first round of Formula Vaults.

338
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,765
Team SNU is in the lead.

339
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,192
ROUND 1
TEAM KU: 0, TEAM SNU: 3

340
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,061
It's hard to make formulas
without two and all the prime numbers.

341
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:30,106
- Two does play an important role.
- We also need factorial cards.

342
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,191
- You can't make big numbers.
- That's right.

343
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,526
I couldn't finish the formula.

344
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:37,504
Not having 2, 5, and 10
was a huge loss for us.

345
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:40,041
We should've secured
at least one set of numbers.

346
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,119
I couldn't get close to the target number.

347
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:48,791
I had nothing to say
because I knew it was all my fault.

348
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:52,252
Let's prioritize securing 2, 4, 5, and 10.

349
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:54,463
If we do that...

350
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:55,965
I was frustrated,

351
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,426
but we made it this far,
thanks to Seung-min.

352
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,471
We have to accept
that we all have our bad days.

353
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,974
But the game isn't over,
and Dong-kyu is up next,

354
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:06,333
so I'm still optimistic.

355
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:08,903
We've done our part.

356
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:11,605
When Seung-min
was struggling to unlock 2, 4, and 5,

357
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,732
you had unlocked all of them.
That was pretty sexy.

358
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,444
I think you're so cool.
You were so sexy out there.

359
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:18,946
I'll name my son after you.

360
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:24,910
The first round is always important,
so our goal was to win all three points.

361
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,246
It felt great to retrieve all those cards.

362
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,757
Do-hyun also did a great job
creating those formulas,

363
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:32,251
so winning 3 to 0 was really gratifying.

364
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,503
We gave it our best.

365
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:39,175
We will now begin
the second round of Formula Vaults.

366
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,887
- Good luck.
- Give me a high five.

367
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,472
Players for the second round,
please step forward.

368
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,517

371
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:58,069
I took deep breaths
as I set foot on the stage.

372
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:01,255
I was under a lot of pressure

373
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,491
because if I were to make
a mistake in my calculation,

374
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:09,030
the opposing team
would be one step closer to victory.

375
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:14,961
I knew I had to do well,
so it was really nerve-racking.

379
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,849
I think I get how Ji-soo felt
after the chess game.

380
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,352
That doesn't make any sense.

381
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,487
I have no words.

382
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:35,148
Hyun-bin collected way too many cards.

383
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,196
The codes for Formula Vaults
will now be revealed.

384
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:44,448
You have five minutes to memorize them.

385
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,001
CODES FOR FORMULA VAULTS

386
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:09,765
Your time is up.

387
00:23:09,857 --> 00:23:11,684
TIME TO MEMORIZE CODES IS UP

388
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,863
You have ten minutes to open the vaults.

389
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,319
He's unlocking it.

390
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:31,620
My goodness...

391
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:41,688
Hyun-seok looks relaxed now.

392
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:45,509
He's hilarious.

393
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,136
He's trying to get screen time.

394
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:55,169
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-MIN UNLOCKS THE LAST LOCK

395
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,856
- He unlocked all the vaults.
- He did.

396
00:23:58,939 --> 00:23:59,940
He got them all.

397
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:01,984
Did he get all of them?

398
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,028
- I guess.
- He unlocked it all.

399
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:10,918
TEAM SNU NOW HAS ALL THE CARDS

400
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,304
TEAM SNU UNLOCKED ALL 28 VAULTS

401
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:55,495
Ji-soo memorized a lot.

402
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:05,798
I prioritized the cards
that my team needed the most.

403
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:09,343
I focused on the factorials
and the numbers we didn't have.

404
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,947
So my strategy was to memorize
the codes for all ten vaults.

405
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:15,308
She got all the numbers.

406
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:18,978
We really need the factorial card.

407
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,064
I'm sure she knows the codes.

408
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:28,654
When I asked Dong-kyu
what he needed the most,

409
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,832
he told me it was factorial cards.

410
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,477
TEAM KU'S JI-SOO
TRIES TO OBTAIN A FACTORIAL CARD

411
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:51,635
I needed to remember the code.

412
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:13,740
- She unlocked both factorial cards.
- Well done!

413
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:15,575
Ji-soo unlocked quite a few.

414
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:17,245
Yes, she did.

415
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:20,214
NUMBER OF REMAINING CARDS FOR TEAM KU: 10
That's her ninth card.

416
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:23,551
And then...

417
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:33,135
How are you doing that?

418
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:34,595
She secured more cards than I did.

419
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:36,514
She unlocked ten cards.

420
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:41,143
NUMBER OF REMAINING CARDS FOR TEAM KU: 9

421
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:44,272
If we go to the third round,
should I do the formulas, or should you?

422
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:45,772
Do it if you're up for it.

423
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:47,567
I was able to come up
with formulas quickly.

424
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:48,576
You should do it.

425
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,917
I wish we could compete
on equal footing this time.

426
00:26:57,184 --> 00:26:58,619
Dong-kyu would win then.

427
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,290
Your time is up.

428
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,752
Players in charge of memorization,
please return to your seats.

429
00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:08,729
It's up to you now.

430
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:15,052
- You did great.
- You did far better than me.

431
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:17,888
Good job.

00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:25,687
No one can stop Dong-kyu
when he has a whole set of numbers.

435
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,399
- Did I get both factorial cards?
- You did.

436
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:36,616
We will now reveal the target number.

437
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:44,865

Dong-kyu is really fast.

442
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:09,607
Find an approximate number first.

443
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:19,867
Damn it.

444
00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:35,683
Damn...

445
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,552
Your answer is being verified.

00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:39,487
TEAM KU'S DONG-KYU'S ANSWER

447
00:28:41,656 --> 00:28:43,432
- That is correct.
- I knew it!

448
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:47,495
CORRECT

449
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,772
As Team KU completed
the formula for the target number first,

450
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,650
TEAM KU: 1, TEAM SNU: 3
they win one point.

451
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:59,323
Hyun-seok, look for square numbers.

452
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:01,492
- I am!
- He should use the decimal system.

453
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,870
We should stop.
We shouldn't put too much pressure on him.

454
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:06,622
Dong-kyu is fast.

455
00:29:06,706 --> 00:29:08,082
- What?
- Dong-kyu is just fast.

456
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:12,587
If Dong-kyu won all three points,

457
00:29:12,653 --> 00:29:15,673
we'd be losing
despite the upper hand we have.

458
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,633
That just put a lot of burden on me.

459
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:24,223
We will now reveal the next target number.

460
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:28,869

00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:38,412
That means...

466
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,453
He's fast. Dong-kyu is really fast.

TEAM KU'S DONG-KYU'S ANSWER

472
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:34,001
He made a mistake.

473
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,961
He subtracted 24 instead of 14.

474
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:38,715
That is incorrect.
Team SNU has three seconds.

475
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:39,923
IF THE FORMULA IS WRONG,

476

477
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:43,927
I don't have another two.

478
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:45,429
Your time is up.

479
00:30:45,513 --> 00:30:47,306
Both teams may submit their answers.

480
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:50,184
I got flustered
and didn't know what to do next.

481
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,602
I don't have three either.

482
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:01,862
No, hold on.

483
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:06,734
What is he doing?

484
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,370
I need to take this out.

485
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:23,050
Hyun-seok was faster.

486
00:31:26,587 --> 00:31:28,806
Team SNU rang the bell first.

487
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,558
- Your answer is being verified.
- Fourteen...

TEAM SNU'S HYUN-SEOK'S ANSWER

489
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,109
- I think that's correct.
- Does that make 1990?

490
00:31:41,778 --> 00:31:42,737
That is correct.

491
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,072
CORRECT

492
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,240
All right.

493
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,208
- His expression, though.
- What's with that look?

494
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:50,578
- Why did he make that face?
- I thought he got it wrong.

495
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:52,204
I thought it was wrong.

00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:09,513
We will now reveal the next target number.

500
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:13,183
The target number is 78125.

501
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:15,269

00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:42,129
Is that it?

507
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,668
- That is correct.
- There we go!

508
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,346
As Team KU completed
the formula for the target number first,

509
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:51,906
TEAM KU: 2, TEAM SNU: 4
they win one point.

510
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,223
There he goes again.

511
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,809
He's my teammate, but still...

512
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:56,769
He's something else.

513
00:32:58,011 --> 00:32:59,438
How does he even know that?

514
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:02,483
A respectable math major
should have squared numbers memorized.

515
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:08,155
I haven't lost my touch,
and since we're playing on my turf,

516
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:11,033
I was able to show them
that they shouldn't mess with me.

517
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,360
That was fantastic.

518
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:19,099
I felt horrible
for messing this up for my team.

519
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,586
Dong-kyu will play in the third round,
so we can't let our guard down.

520
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:28,075
Team SNU has 4 points,
and Team KU has 2 points.

521
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:31,721
We will now begin the third round

522
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:33,547
of the main match, Formula Vaults.

523
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:37,434
Players for the third round,
please step forward.

524
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:45,325
TEAM KU'S PLAYERS FOR ROUND 3
MEMORIZATION: JI-SOO

525
00:33:45,401 --> 00:33:48,905
TEAM KU'S PLAYERS FOR ROUND 3
FORMULA: DONG-KYU

526
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:51,498
TEAM KU'S PLAYERS ARE THE SAME AS ROUND 2

527
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,283
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

528
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,327
TEAM SNU'S PLAYER FOR ROUND 3
FORMULA: HYUN-BIN

529
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:56,495
- You can do it!
- Thanks.

530
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,508
TEAM SNU OBTAINED ALL THE CARDS,
SO THEY WILL PROCEED WITH 1 PLAYER

531
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:13,804
I told myself not to get so nervous
and that this wasn't a big deal.

532
00:34:14,254 --> 00:34:18,017
Hyun-bin may be good at everything,
but so is Dong-kyu.

533
00:34:20,436 --> 00:34:23,606
Being a math major does make a difference.

534
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,983
But I'm sure Hyun-bin will do fine.

535
00:34:27,468 --> 00:34:30,038
The codes for Formula Vaults
will now be revealed.

536
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,540
CODES FOR FORMULA VAULTS

537
00:34:37,495 --> 00:34:41,215
That's 1463, 9431, and 5374.

538
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:43,083
Your time is up.

539
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:47,964
One, four, six, three...

540
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,885
That's done.

541
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:07,483
Ji-soo got all the cards.

542
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:10,862
All right. Let the best man win.

543
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:13,322
It's down to who is better
at creating formulas.

544
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:20,955
Well done.

545
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:23,624
I knew I could rely on Dong-kyu.

546
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,419
I was determined
to prove myself with my performance.

547
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:32,299
I knew I had to win the third round.

548
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:34,927
Let's do this.

549
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:37,221
I'll do my best and leave no regrets.

550
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:46,914
BOTH TEAMS HAVE 28 CARDS

551
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:52,361
Dong-kyu isn't an easy opponent.

552
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:54,697
He was really fast.

553
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,024
Dong-kyu isn't going to lose.

554
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:01,462
TEAM SNU WILL WIN FORMULA VAULTS
IF THEY GET 1 MORE POINT

555
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:04,916
We will now begin the third round.
Here's your target number.

556
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,794
The target number is 4805.

557
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:12,423
That's 4805...

558
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:23,392
This should do it, right?

559
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:31,525
TARGET NUMBER: 4805

560
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:49,543
- Keep calm.
- Hurry up.

561
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:53,213
That looks a little odd. It's 300...

562
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:05,726
Please...

563
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:16,737
He did it. Ring the bell.

564
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:18,672
Ring the bell.

565
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:24,787
Team SNU's answer is being verified.

566
00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:28,874
Your answer is being reviewed.

567
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,219
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN'S ANSWER

568
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:35,714
Your answer is being reviewed.

569
00:37:40,527 --> 00:37:41,762
That is correct.

570
00:37:42,396 --> 00:37:43,530
That is correct.

571
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:45,307
CORRECT

572
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:49,020
As Team SNU completed
the formula for the target number first,

573
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:50,729
TEAM KU: 2, TEAM SNU: 5
they win one point.

574
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:55,860
As Team SNU earned five points first,
the victory goes to Team SNU.

575
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,196
TEAM SNU WINS FORMULA VAULTS,
THE 1ST ROUND OF THE FINALS

576
00:37:58,278 --> 00:37:59,780
You didn't have to move the cards up.

577
00:38:01,582 --> 00:38:04,218
He wasted his time
by moving the cards to the top row.

578
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:06,662
You could say it's a habit that I have.

579
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:10,290
I feel compelled
to write formulas in a single line.

580
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:14,128
It was totally unnecessary
and it cost us the game,

581
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:16,964
so I felt terrible about it.

582
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:23,137
The first round
really sets the tone of the game,

583
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:27,391
so I was very happy
that we won the first round.

584
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:30,144
I just hope we do well
in the second round too.

585
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,280
FINALS
TEAM KU VS TEAM SNU

586
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:35,582
TEAM KU: 0, TEAM SNU: 1

587
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:44,825
We felt pressured to win the second round.

588
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:49,455
My team is in a precarious position,
so we have to win no matter what.

589
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:52,666
We've never been big
on winning by a huge margin.

590
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,211
That's right.
We always go for the dramatic win.

591
00:38:55,962 --> 00:38:57,238
Let's do this.

592
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,173
I'm okay either way.

593
00:38:59,257 --> 00:39:02,009
If we win, the game will be over.
If we lose, we can play another round.

594
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:06,180
The second main match is

595
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:08,515
Exit Strategy.

596
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,434
It must be a strategy game.

597
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:15,773
Is it "exist" or...

598
00:39:16,232 --> 00:39:19,568
The board has 4 entrances and 1 exit,

599
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,529
and all contestants
will become pieces on the board.

600
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,409
Two from each team
will enter the board as starting players.

601
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:31,247
The four starting players
must all pick a different entrance

602
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:34,334
STARTERS MAY NOT USE THE SAME ENTRANCE
and enter from all four entrances.

603
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:37,962
The remaining players may enter
through any entrance of their choice.

604
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,379
REMAINING PLAYERS MAY USE ANY ENTRANCE

605
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:42,842
Once a player enters the board,
the only way out is through the exit.

606
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:46,470
EXIT

607
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:50,933
Players may move
in a straight line on their turn.

608
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:55,980
They must stop
if they encounter an obstacle or a person.

609
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,233
- We can use players as obstacles.
- That'd be key.

610
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:03,570
Only two players per team
may enter the board.

611
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,106
2 PLAYERS MAX PER TEAM

612
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:08,242
Once a player exits the board,

613
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:10,870
a player from the same team may enter.

614
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:12,288
It's the same as yutnori.

615
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,581
You win when all your pieces
finish the circuit.

616
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:18,319
The two teams will take turns
to move their pieces.

617
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,588
The team that has all four players
exit the board first wins the game.

618
00:40:21,655 --> 00:40:22,548
RESULTS
LOSE, WIN

619
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:24,175
It's a space perception game.

620
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:26,677
TEAM KU'S SPACE PERCEPTION ACE, JUNG-MIN

621
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,229
We need to block them.

622
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:30,806
Yes, but we also need
to exit the board as quickly as possible.

623
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:35,311
We will roll the dice
to determine which team goes first.

624
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:38,731
Team SNU, please step forward.

625
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:46,906
TEAM KU, TEAM SNU

626
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:49,950
TEAM SNU GOES FIRST, TEAM KU GOES SECOND
Team SNU will go first.

627
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,285
Even luck is on your side.

628
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:54,663
Both teams,
please prepare for the second main match.

629
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:56,416
You have ten minutes
to discuss your strategy.

630
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,043
We need to think about it
the other way around.

631
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:02,088
We have to think of ways
to reach the exit.

632
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,630
We have to start from the exit.

633
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:05,549
Exactly. So the ways to reach the exit...

634
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,720
I think we need to start from the exit.

635
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,306
We should memorize
the possible routes from the exit.

636
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,185
We'll try to get to that route
no matter where we start.

637
00:41:16,269 --> 00:41:19,113
The first thought I had
was that a lot hinged on the obstacles

638
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,107
- that were near the exit.
- Totally.

639
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,525
We should consider
the obstacles near the exit.

640
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:27,363
OBSTACLES, ENTRANCES, AND EXITS
HAVE NOT BEEN DISCLOSED YET

641
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,324
What strategies could we use?

642
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:34,262
I bet they'll come up with something.

643
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:36,622
Their brains work a lot faster than ours.

644
00:41:37,123 --> 00:41:39,625
I'm sure we can beat them
if we face them head-on.

645
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,377
- We have it in us to win.
- I agree.

646
00:41:41,461 --> 00:41:43,796
I'm nervous, but I think we'll win.

647
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:48,134
You saw how we outplayed them earlier,
so don't get intimidated.

648
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,428
Your time is up.

649
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:53,180
On the way out,
check where the obstacles are.

650
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:55,682
- Victory is SNU's!
- Victory is SNU's!

651
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:57,952
Both teams,
please gather at the Main Hall.

652
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:00,271
- Should we do it outside?
- Check that out.

653
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:01,272
What?

654
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:10,030
EXIT

655
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,908
Everyone is marking the obstacles.

656
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:23,919
You will be given three more minutes
to discuss your strategy.

657
00:42:24,962 --> 00:42:28,966
EXIT

658
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:31,218
- Do-hyun, check the first entrance.
- What?

659
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:33,012
- Check the first entrance.
- It'll take the longest.

660
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:34,322
TEAM SNU LOOKS FOR THE SHORTEST ROUTES

661
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:38,058
TEAM KU ALSO LOOKS FOR THE SHORTEST ROUTES
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

662
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:41,979
And that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

663
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:46,192
THE SHORTEST ROUTE FROM EACH ENTRANCE

664
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:50,154
ENTRANCE 1: 11 MOVES

665
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:53,949
ENTRANCE 2: 9 MOVES

666
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:57,036
ENTRANCE 3: 9 MOVES

667
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,413
ENTRANCE 4: 9 MOVES

668
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:01,665
Starting players for each team,
please step onto the stage.

669
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:16,055
Team SNU's first player,
please choose an entrance.

670
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:26,648
The other starting players
may not use the first entrance.

671
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,776
What's going on?

672
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:31,571
If Hyun-bin chose a short route,

673
00:43:31,645 --> 00:43:33,697
all we could do was chase after him.

674
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:36,658
So I knew they had a plan
the moment he chose the first entrance.

675
00:43:37,351 --> 00:43:39,887
It depends on where the obstacles are.
I'm the first to go in, right?

676
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:43,757
I could act as a screen,
and you guys could race to the exit.

677
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:47,211
Or we could all race to the exit.

678
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:49,046
We'll have to see the board first,

679
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,132
but that's why I wanted you
to come in later.

680
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:53,734
Plan A is to race to the exit,
and Plan B is to use a screen.

681
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:54,802
We have two game plans.

682
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:58,347
The first is to race to the exit.
The second is for me to act as a screen.

683
00:43:58,439 --> 00:43:59,640
- You'll act as a screen.
- Right.

684
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,892
Choose the first entrance
and block the way here.

685
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:03,436
If you stand here,

686
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,730
Do-hyun and I could choose
the second entrance

687
00:44:06,814 --> 00:44:08,816
and exit the board in a few moves.

688
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:12,453
THE REMAINING PLAYERS CAN EXIT THE BOARD
USING THEIR TEAMMATE IN 3 MOVES

689
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:14,738
- Pick the first entrance.
- Your time is up.

690
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:17,699
Choose entrance 3 or 4
and try to reach the exit quickly.

691
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:21,262
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN
CHOOSES ENTRANCE 1 TO ACT AS A SCREEN

692
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:24,081
Team KU, please choose an entrance.

693
00:44:28,636 --> 00:44:31,088
The other starting players
may not use the second entrance.

694
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,924
It's Team SNU's turn.

695
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:35,009
It's Team KU's turn.

696
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:36,844
1: HYUN-BIN, 2: JUNG-MIN
3: DONG-KYU, 4: HYUN-MIN

697
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,146
ENTRANCE SELECTION COMPLETE

698
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:40,431
The first player,

699
00:44:40,515 --> 00:44:43,484
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please make your move.

700
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,937
ENTRANCE 1
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN MOVES

701
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,192
Team KU, please make your move.

ENTRANCE 2
TEAM KU'S JUNG-MIN MOVES

703
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:57,298
Team SNU, please make your move.

704
00:44:57,365 --> 00:44:59,033
ENTRANCE 4
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-MIN MOVES

705
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:00,535
Team KU, please make your move.

706
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,737
ENTRANCE 3
TEAM KU'S DONG-KYU MOVES

707
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,084
RED: JUNG-MIN, DONG-KYU

708
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,919
BLUE: HYUN-BIN, HYUN-MIN

709
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:15,466
Hyun-bin, go to the right.
I need you two to listen to me.

710
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,884
I got this.

711
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,802
Hyun-min needs to go left.

712
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:21,222
- One, two, three,
- One, two, three,

713
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:23,015
- four, five, six,
- four, five, six...

714
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:24,684
- seven, eight, nine.
- That's it.

715
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:29,564
It felt odd to share
each other's strategy.

716
00:45:29,647 --> 00:45:31,857
I think we have the same idea.

717
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:34,276
They must be planning to use a screen.

718
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,611
They know our strategy.

719
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:40,533
Team KU, please make your move.

720
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,080
TEAM KU'S JUNG-MIN MOVES

721
00:45:46,372 --> 00:45:49,291
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-MIN MOVES

722
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,211
RED: DONG-KYU, JUNG-MIN

723
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:54,296
BLUE: HYUN-BIN, HYUN-MIN

724
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,131
Wait. He'll exit the board in three moves.

725
00:45:56,624 --> 00:45:58,759
Jung-min can leave in four moves.

726
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:00,561
One, two, three, and four.

727
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:04,432
Team SNU's strategy
was for Hyun-bin to move around the board

728
00:46:04,532 --> 00:46:08,603
and act as a screen
to create the shortest route to the exit.

729
00:46:08,669 --> 00:46:14,191
What they had failed to anticipate
was that we could use him as a screen too.

730
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:20,406
JUNG-MIN

731
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:23,158
CAN EXIT THE BOARD IN 2 MOVES

732
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:26,036
Hyun-bin and Hyun-min, listen up.

733
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,748
Did our plans change?
Just tell us what changed.

734
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:32,543
- It hasn't yet, but--
- Don't say anything then.

735
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:34,211
I just want you to know that it could.

736
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:37,298
I already know that,
so tell me when it does.

737
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,217
Team SNU's Park Hyun-min,
please make your move.

738
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:43,971
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-MIN MOVES

739
00:46:44,722 --> 00:46:47,349

please make your move.

TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN MOVES

742
00:46:55,015 --> 00:46:57,359
Team KU's Kim Jung-min,
please make your move.

743
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:58,986
I'll move this way...

744
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:01,405
- I can exit the board, right?
- Sure.

745
00:47:02,864 --> 00:47:04,116
JUNG-MIN

746
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,703
CAN EXIT THE BOARD

747
00:47:06,786 --> 00:47:08,788
I'll think about what to do
once he leaves,

748
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:10,540
- so just make your move.
- Okay.

749
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,375
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-MIN MOVES

750
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:13,751
- He moved, right?
- Yes.

751
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:16,086
Team KU's Lee Dong-kyu,
please make your move.

752
00:47:17,046 --> 00:47:19,298
Think about which entrance you'll use.

753
00:47:19,382 --> 00:47:20,466
Already on it.

754
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,777
If Hyun-bin stays there,

755
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:25,054
you can come in
and leave the board in three moves.

756
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:26,597
Keep your eyes open.

757
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:31,018
If Hyun-bin stays in this area,
we'll use one of these entrances.

758
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:33,312
- Entrance 1 or 2.
- We'll use him as a screen.

759
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:35,523
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please make your move.

760
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:37,817
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN MOVES

761
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:40,152
Team KU's Kim Jung-min,
please make your move.

762
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:43,531
You have ten seconds.

763
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:45,408
- I'll exit the board.
- Leave the board.

764
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,745
Team KU's Kim Jung-min
has exited the board.

765
00:47:48,828 --> 00:47:50,246
TEAM KU'S JUNG-MIN EXITS THE BOARD

766
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:53,374
Team SNU's Park Hyun-min,
please make your move.

767
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:55,543
- Hyun-min, stick to the initial plan.
- Go with plan A.

768
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:02,508
Team KU's Lee Dong-kyu,
please make your move.

769
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:04,134
I'll just move as planned.

770
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:07,513
I think Dong-kyu should take
the initial route we planned.

771
00:48:07,597 --> 00:48:10,307
You can just go forward. That's it.

772
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:12,268
TEAM KU'S DONG-KYU MOVES

773
00:48:15,479 --> 00:48:17,898
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please make your move.

774
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:20,276
A new player is going to enter the board.

775
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:21,360
- I know.
- Okay.

776
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:31,788
Hold on. This won't work.

777
00:48:32,705 --> 00:48:34,373
HYUN-BIN

778
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:36,709
TEAM KU

779
00:48:36,793 --> 00:48:40,296
TEAM KU CAN EXIT THE BOARD IN 3 MOVES
BY USING HYUN-BIN AS A SCREEN

780
00:48:40,797 --> 00:48:42,757
- It won't work.
- You have 30 seconds.

781
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:44,508
It won't?

782
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:46,552
In that case, go up and then down.

783
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:49,597
- Should I just move back and forth?
- Sounds good.

784
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:55,645
Why is he coming this way?

785
00:48:56,562 --> 00:48:57,605
Hold on.

786
00:48:57,705 --> 00:49:00,149
You guys can come in
through the second entrance.

787
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:03,486
Hyun-bin can only move left and right
if we block his path.

788
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:06,113
Let's block him
and eliminate the variable.

789
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:10,493
TEAM KU'S 3RD PLAYER
JI-SOO CHOOSES ENTRANCE 2

790

Team SNU's Park Hyun-min,
please make your move.

791
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,584
Hyun-min, make your way out.

792
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:25,007
Team SNU's Park Hyun-min
has exited the board.

794
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:31,171

795
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,766
It's your turn, Hyun-bin.

796

TEAM SNU'S 3RD PLAYER
DO-HYUN CHOOSES ENTRANCE 1

800
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:59,041
Let's pick up the pace
so Team SNU doesn't have time to think.

801
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:01,335
No. Just move.

802
00:50:01,736 --> 00:50:02,670
TEAM KU'S DONG-KYU MOVES

803
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:06,799
They're racing to the exit.
We need to stop them.

804
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:09,552
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please make your move.

805
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:15,850
Team KU's Lee Ji-soo,
please make your move.

806
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,019

Team KU's Lee Dong-kyu,
please make your move.

808
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:24,734
- Should I exit?
- Dong-kyu, leave the board.

809
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:26,026
Go!

810
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:28,153
TEAM KU'S DONG-KYU EXITS THE BOARD
Come this way.

811
00:50:28,571 --> 00:50:31,899
NUMBER OF PLAYERS WHO EXITED THE BOARD

812
00:50:31,991 --> 00:50:34,660
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please make your move.

813
00:50:34,744 --> 00:50:37,337
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN MOVES

814
00:50:38,005 --> 00:50:40,140

TEAM KU'S JI-SOO MOVES

816
00:50:42,919 --> 00:50:45,128

TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN MOVES

818
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:49,967
Team KU's Chae Seung-min,
please enter the board.

819
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:52,636
When I move here, leave the board.

820
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,263
- You want me to exit?
- Yes.

821
00:50:54,354 --> 00:50:55,389
That'd be quicker.

822
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:56,766
What about Hyun-seok?

823
00:50:56,857 --> 00:50:58,809
He'll have to take the shortest route.

824
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:00,494
- So we're both leaving the board?
- Yes.

825
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:02,396
- That'd be quicker.
- What's your next move?

826
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:05,315
- I'll move here, and you'll leave.
- All right. I'll leave.

827
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,167
I made my move.

828
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:08,778
TEAM SNU REVISES THEIR STRATEGY

829
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:11,113
FROM USING A SCREEN
TO EVERYONE LEAVING THE BOARD

830
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:12,907
Let's finish it off.

831
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,951
I don't get what Team SNU is doing.

832
00:51:15,043 --> 00:51:17,177
Let's just stick to what we discussed.

833
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:18,537
Team KU's Lee Ji-soo,

834
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:19,914
- please make your move.
- I'll go there.

835
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:21,290
Okay. Come this way.

836
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:25,720
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun,
please make your move.

837
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:29,632
Team KU's Chae Seung-min,
please make your move.

838
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,928
We're ahead of them.

839
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,891
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please make your move.

840
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:42,770
Team KU's Lee Ji-soo,
please make your move.

841
00:51:44,814 --> 00:51:47,525
TEAM KU'S JI-SOO
GOES BACK TO WHERE SHE CAME FROM

842
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:49,652
10 MINUTES AGO
Dong-kyu will leave the board.

843
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:52,071
If Ji-soo goes back and forth,

844
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:54,573
I could leave the board
in a couple of moves.

845
00:51:54,657 --> 00:51:56,325
- Do you see the spot next to the exit?
- Yes.

846
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:58,552
- You can go there once Hyun-bin moves.
- Okay.

847
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:03,591
If you continue to move up and down,
I could use you to exit the board.

848
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:08,829
SEUNG-MIN CAN EXIT IN 5 MOVES
USING JI-SOO AS A SCREEN

849
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:11,674
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please make your move.

850
00:52:12,842 --> 00:52:15,636
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN EXITS THE BOARD

851
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,930
Team KU's Lee Ji-soo,
please make your move.

852
00:52:20,975 --> 00:52:23,895
JI-SOO ACTS AS A SCREEN FOR SEUNG-MIN

853
00:52:24,177 --> 00:52:25,938
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun,
please make your move.

854
00:52:26,022 --> 00:52:29,516
We can just make a run for it using you.
The timing is perfect.

855
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:33,529
- They can't even chase after us.
- No. They need at least nine moves

856
00:52:33,612 --> 00:52:35,656
- because they don't have a screen.
- Exactly.

857
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,242
- All that's left--
- Hold on. Is this the right call?

858
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:40,661
Hold on. Is this the right call?

859
00:52:40,745 --> 00:52:42,454
Is there any way we can stop them?

860
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:44,331
There's no way they can stop us.

861
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,250
- We're taking turns.
- They can't block me.

862
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,835
Their team can't block us.

863
00:52:47,919 --> 00:52:50,337
SEUNG-MIN EXITS THE BOARD

864
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:52,423
JI-SOO

865
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:55,885
ALL PLAYERS FROM TEAM KU
CAN EXIT THE BOARD IN 5 MOVES

866
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:59,814
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-SEOK
HASN'T ENTERED THE BOARD YET

867
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,059
IT'LL BE DIFFICULT
FOR TEAM SNU TO TURN THE TABLES

868
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,685
Is there nothing we can do?

869
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,272
We need to think of something.

870
00:53:09,607 --> 00:53:12,860
Is there another way?
Look. That's 1, 2, 3, 4 moves.

871
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:14,695
Can we stop them in four moves?

872
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:16,488
Is there no way?

873
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:22,787
I could sense our victory
even before Seung-min entered the board.

874
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,081
We had two players
who already exited the board.

875
00:53:25,164 --> 00:53:29,209
The moment Jung-min made his exit,
I could tell we had a decent shot.

876
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:33,338
Jung-min used me as a screen
before my teammates did.

877
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:35,449
That was when I knew something was wrong.

878
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:39,137
We hadn't considered Ji-soo
blocking Hyun-bin's path when he moved up.

879
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:42,181
So Ji-soo blocking Hyun-bin's path

880
00:53:42,255 --> 00:53:45,977
turned the tide in Team KU's favor.

881
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:50,022
I think the defining moment of the match

882
00:53:50,106 --> 00:53:53,192
was when we took advantage
of their screen.

883
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:55,502
Team KU's Chae Seung-min,
please make your move.

884
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:57,196
- Just leave the board.
- I should, right?

885
00:53:57,905 --> 00:53:59,198
TEAM KU'S SEUNG-MIN EXITS THE BOARD

886
00:53:59,473 --> 00:54:00,574
Good job.

887
00:54:00,658 --> 00:54:02,710
TEAM KU'S JI-SOO EXITS THE BOARD

888
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:04,954
Team KU's Lee Ji-soo has exited the board.

889
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:06,038
TEAM KU WINS EXIT STRATEGY

890
00:54:06,122 --> 00:54:07,247
The game is over.

891
00:54:09,683 --> 00:54:12,170
Guys, gather around me.
Why do you look dejected?

892
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:13,587
- I'm fine.
- I'm not dejected.

893
00:54:13,671 --> 00:54:16,757
This is all my fault
for not making the right call earlier.

894
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:18,676
You all did a good job.

895
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:20,511
We're all excellent players,

896
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:22,680
so let's show them
what we can do in the third round.

897
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:24,398
We are the finalists.

898
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:26,350
- That's right!
- Let's do our best in the third round.

899
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:28,102
- Okay.
- I didn't like our chances at first.

900
00:54:28,186 --> 00:54:29,436
It's all about the energy.

901
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,313
That loss will take a huge toll on them.

902
00:54:31,405 --> 00:54:33,649
- But--
- But this win is huge for us.

903
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:36,944
The finals for Elite League,
the brainpower survival challenge.

904
00:54:37,028 --> 00:54:40,698
The score is tied 1 to 1
between Team SNU and Team KU.

905
00:54:40,781 --> 00:54:42,250
FINALS
TEAM KU: 1, TEAM SNU: 1

906
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:49,165
BOTH TEAMS FACE
THE LAST MATCH OF THE FINALS

907
00:54:49,257 --> 00:54:52,626
It was a great opportunity
to show them the tides have turned.

908
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:54,545
We'll survive no matter what.

909
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:58,757
We can still pull through.

910
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,384
We go to Seoul National University.

911
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:02,636
Which is the best university in Korea?
It's SNU.

912
00:55:02,736 --> 00:55:03,637
We can still win.

913
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,267
Let's enjoy the journey.

914
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,111
It's about time we skinned the tiger.

915
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,653
No game is favorable to just one team.

916
00:55:19,737 --> 00:55:20,988
We can overcome anything.

917
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:22,489
- And the tide's shifted for us.
- Right.

918
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,368
Winning Team SNU will be poetic justice.

919
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:35,970
The third main match is...

920
00:55:38,256 --> 00:55:39,807
Spot the Hidden Pattern.

921
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:41,134
SPOT THE HIDDEN PATTERN

922
00:55:41,217 --> 00:55:43,677
- There we go.
- We got this.

923
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,805
- What is that?
- It's rather vague.

924
00:55:47,982 --> 00:55:50,517
- There we go.
- We got this.

925
00:55:50,584 --> 00:55:54,322
Right before the third round,
we all agreed to say things like,

926
00:55:54,388 --> 00:55:58,234
"We got this,"
when the game was announced.

927
00:55:58,326 --> 00:56:00,569
And Team SNU looked at us
when we said those lines.

928
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:03,697
TEAM SNU IS VISIBLY AGITATED
BY TEAM KU'S MIND GAME

929
00:56:05,499 --> 00:56:06,867
In Spot the Hidden Pattern,

930
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:09,996
you will be presented with a board
filled with arrows facing four directions.

931
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,915
The team that finds
the most target patterns wins.

932
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:17,337
I see.

933
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:21,132
The target pattern

934
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:24,010
will consist of 4 arrows
and will be on a 2 by 2 square.

935
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:28,055
You will be asked
to find the target pattern

936
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:30,975
on a board that has 10 columns and 8 rows.

937
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,193
TARGET PATTERN

938
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,563
The target pattern
could be placed in an upright position

939
00:56:36,663 --> 00:56:38,274
or in a rotated position.

940
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:40,109
ALL 4 ARE A MATCH

941
00:56:40,193 --> 00:56:41,986
I see.

942
00:56:43,271 --> 00:56:44,780
This is going to be hard.

943
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:47,033
Inversions of any kind,

944
00:56:47,116 --> 00:56:50,036
whether horizontal or vertical,
will not count as a match.

945
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:51,787
INVERTED PATTERNS ARE NOT A MATCH

946
00:56:51,879 --> 00:56:53,747
Players will take turns

947
00:56:53,847 --> 00:56:56,834
and will be given
ten seconds to give an answer.

948
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:58,752
Once a target pattern is identified,

949
00:56:58,852 --> 00:57:02,131
players will call out
the coordinates for the top left tile.

950
00:57:02,215 --> 00:57:05,926
For example,
the target pattern can be seen in B3.

951
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,469
ANSWER: B3

952
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:10,056
You will gain one point
for a correct answer,

953
00:57:10,131 --> 00:57:12,516
and you will lose one point
for a wrong one.

954
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:17,104
You will also lose a point
for naming a coordinate already mentioned.

955
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:18,398
-1 POINT FOR A REPETITIVE ANSWER

956
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:21,108
If you fail to answer,
your points will remain unchanged,

957
00:57:21,192 --> 00:57:23,361
but your opponent will take their turn.

958
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:28,157
Once you have determined
that there are no more matches,

959
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:29,783
you must call out, "Game over."

960
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:30,993
GAME OVER

961
00:57:31,085 --> 00:57:32,920
If there are no other matches,

962
00:57:32,987 --> 00:57:35,873
the player that called out "Game over"
will receive three points,

963
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:37,750
and that round will end.

964
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,496
But if there is a match left on the board,
the player will lose two points.

965
00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:49,437
Your opponent will then take their turn,

966
00:57:49,503 --> 00:57:51,180
and the match will be resumed.

967
00:57:52,373 --> 00:57:54,275
You may call out, "Game over,"

968
00:57:54,342 --> 00:57:57,044
within five seconds
of giving a correct answer.

969
00:57:57,678 --> 00:58:00,898
I realized that calling
the game would be critical.

970
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:03,025
We have to say, "Game over."

971
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:04,985
This game will consist of six rounds,

972
00:58:05,086 --> 00:58:07,696
and a new target pattern
will be provided for each round.

973
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,408
The board will be exchanged
before the fourth round.

974
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:11,992
BOARD EXCHANGE

975
00:58:12,093 --> 00:58:14,245
All rounds will be played one-on-one,

976
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:18,082
and all players must take turns
to compete in the first four rounds.

977
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:21,001
Anyone can play in the 5th or 6th round.

978
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:23,629
After completing the six rounds,

979
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:26,257
the team with the highest points
will be named the winner.

980
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,975
SPOT THE HIDDEN PATTERN

981
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:31,612
We will decide
who goes first by rolling the dice.

982
00:58:33,147 --> 00:58:36,892
Representatives of each team,
please step forward and roll the dice.

983
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:38,352
Go ahead, Hyun-bin.

984
00:58:38,453 --> 00:58:40,354
- I'll go.
- Team SNU, please step forward.

985
00:58:48,463 --> 00:58:49,822
I rolled a two.

986
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:52,032
Team SNU rolled a two.

987
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:54,534
It doesn't matter who goes first.

988
00:58:55,328 --> 00:58:56,745
The first player has an advantage.

989
00:58:57,305 --> 00:58:59,206
Team KU, please step forward.

990
00:58:59,507 --> 00:59:00,574
Go, Ji-soo.

991
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:06,380
I rolled a five.

992
00:59:06,464 --> 00:59:08,548
Team KU rolled a five.

993
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,217
It's all right.

994
00:59:10,818 --> 00:59:13,053
- Team KU will start off the game.
- Great.

995
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,888
Things are working in our favor.

996
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:17,266
Both teams,
please prepare for the main match.

997
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,642
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

998
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,644
Good luck.

999
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:21,979
I like our odds.

1000
00:59:23,498 --> 00:59:24,465
Goodness.

1001
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:28,869
Here's what you need to know
at the end of the game.

1002
00:59:29,487 --> 00:59:32,281
If you know how many matches are left,

1003
00:59:32,365 --> 00:59:35,284
and the remaining number is two,
you shouldn't answer.

1004
00:59:35,368 --> 00:59:38,913
Team KU has to give
the second-to-last answer

1005
00:59:39,013 --> 00:59:40,498
for us to say, "Game over."

1006
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:41,581
That makes sense.

1007
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,334
They'd get 1 point
while we'd get 4 points.

1008
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,002
We'd get three extra points.

1009
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:45,920
You're right.

1010
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:47,838
That's one point to consider.

1011
00:59:48,464 --> 00:59:50,425
Here's the first thing I considered.

1012
00:59:50,508 --> 00:59:52,510
If I know there's one match left,

1013
00:59:52,593 --> 00:59:54,387
I have to give an answer

1014
00:59:54,462 --> 00:59:57,598
and say, "Game over" to win four points.

1015
00:59:57,698 --> 01:00:00,351
But if I know there are two matches left,

1016
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:02,970
I should let Team KU
give the second-to-last answer

1017
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:08,442
so that I can give the last one
and say, "Game over" to win three points.

1018
01:00:08,526 --> 01:00:11,779
If the remaining number of matches is odd,
you should give an answer.

1019
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:13,948
If it's even,
you should let the opponent answer.

1020
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:15,824
What round would you like to play?

1021
01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:16,984
It doesn't matter to me.

1022
01:00:17,084 --> 01:00:18,453
Do you feel confident about this?

1023
01:00:20,588 --> 01:00:22,890
I can't really say
that I feel confident...

1024
01:00:23,357 --> 01:00:24,625
What about you?

1025
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:28,262
Things rarely worked out for me
whenever I expressed confidence.

1026
01:00:28,337 --> 01:00:31,340
No one's going to blame you if we lose,
so just be confident.

1027
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:34,235
But we are in the finals...

1028
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:41,775
- Why don't we have a trial run?
- Okay.

1029
01:00:42,477 --> 01:00:43,685
What's our target pattern?

1030
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:45,020
I'll draw it for you.

1031
01:00:47,106 --> 01:00:48,107
Here we go.

1032
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:57,992
TEAM SNU PLAYS A PRACTICE GAME

1033
01:01:10,421 --> 01:01:11,839
Is anyone good at this game?

1034
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:15,176
This doesn't require a lot of thinking.

1035
01:01:15,926 --> 01:01:17,052
I doubt there's a strategy.

1036
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:18,979
Right. You just have to find the patterns.

1037
01:01:19,046 --> 01:01:20,181
Here's an idea.

1038
01:01:20,615 --> 01:01:23,643
Let's focus on the parts
that are more recognizable

1039
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:25,561
like two arrows
pointing in the same direction...

1040
01:01:25,645 --> 01:01:27,054
Or two facing opposite directions.

1041
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:29,440
Or two arrows
pointing in opposite directions.

1042
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,325
That will be our guide.

1043
01:01:31,392 --> 01:01:33,902
This is easy to recognize and so is this.

1044
01:01:34,195 --> 01:01:35,404
What about the order?

1045
01:01:35,488 --> 01:01:37,906
- It's all about the momentum.
- It is important.

1046
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,783
The first round is super important.

1047
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:41,619
I bet their first player is Hyun-seok.

1048
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:42,744
- What?
- Hyun-seok will play first.

1049
01:01:42,828 --> 01:01:44,622
- I think it will be Hyun-bin.
- Really?

1050
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:47,166
The moment the game was explained,
he seemed confident.

1051
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:50,294
It felt like he was saying
he was really good at this

1052
01:01:50,378 --> 01:01:51,753
and could play all three rounds.

1053
01:01:51,845 --> 01:01:53,506
- I'm not scared of him.
- No.

1054
01:01:54,048 --> 01:01:57,017
As long as Hyun-bin
doesn't go on a rampage in round one...

1055
01:01:57,092 --> 01:01:58,594
- We can stop him.
- We can.

1056
01:01:58,678 --> 01:02:00,429
He could play three rounds.

1057
01:02:00,513 --> 01:02:01,597
That doesn't matter.

1058
01:02:01,681 --> 01:02:04,559
We'll see how it goes
and send in our best player.

1059
01:02:04,642 --> 01:02:05,859
- Right.
- So that's not an issue.

1060
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:11,065
The biggest threat for us is Hyun-bin.

1061
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:15,110
I expected him
to compete in the first round.

1062
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,613
Who wants to play first?

1063
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:23,703
We need someone
who is confident they'll win.

1064
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:25,538
Do you feel that way, Seung-min?

1065
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:29,917
I can't say I'm totally confident,
but I'm about 60 to 70 percent sure.

1066
01:02:30,543 --> 01:02:31,460
You should do it then.

1067
01:02:31,552 --> 01:02:32,720
- Play in the first round?
- Yes.

1068
01:02:33,954 --> 01:02:35,297
Is it too much of a burden?

1069
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,325
Your time is up.

1070
01:02:41,662 --> 01:02:43,097
- Let's do our thing.
- Shall we?

1071
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:45,433
We can do this. Just be confident.

1072
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:46,475
On three.

1073
01:02:46,567 --> 01:02:48,519
- Victory is SNU's!
- Victory is SNU's!

1074
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:49,437
Korea University!

1075
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,105
- For the nation!
- For the nation!

1076
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:01,482
- Believe in yourself.
- Okay.

1077
01:03:01,574 --> 01:03:03,618
Believe in yourself and the team.

1078
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:05,703
Prove yourself with your actions.

1079
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:07,162
They look pretty glum.

1080
01:03:08,122 --> 01:03:09,248
It's going to be fine.

1081
01:03:09,707 --> 01:03:11,375
We have it in us to defeat them.

1082
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:14,002
I believe in you more than in myself.

1083
01:03:14,094 --> 01:03:15,337
You will do great.

1084
01:03:17,097 --> 01:03:20,134
Players for the first round,
please step onto the stage.

1085
01:03:21,093 --> 01:03:22,678
- Good luck.
- You've got this.

1086
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:25,139
TEAM SNU'S PLAYER FOR ROUND 1
DO-HYUN

1087
01:03:25,431 --> 01:03:26,724
It wasn't Hyun-bin.

1088
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:30,478
When I found out it wasn't Hyun-bin,
I felt like we had a chance at winning.

1089
01:03:30,544 --> 01:03:33,781
TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN
VS TEAM KU'S JUNG-MIN

1090
01:03:38,193 --> 01:03:40,780
DAY 4, RELAY MATCH

1091
01:03:40,862 --> 01:03:43,591
TEAM KU'S JUNG-MIN WON THE MATCH

1092
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:47,662
FORMULA VAULTS
THE MAIN MATCH OF THE FINALS

1093
01:03:47,745 --> 01:03:51,165
TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN WON THE MATCH

1094
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:55,670
THESE TWO ARE NOW FACING
A THIRD MATCH AGAINST ONE ANOTHER

1095
01:03:55,936 --> 01:03:59,340
I was confident
because my opponent wasn't Hyun-bin.

1096
01:04:00,574 --> 01:04:03,052
We decided to have Do-hyun
play in the first round

1097
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:06,847
as he seemed to understand the game best
during the strategy meeting.

1098
01:04:07,581 --> 01:04:10,476
My goal was
to prove myself beyond a doubt.

1099
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:13,563
I think they'll play in that order
starting with Dong-kyu.

1100
01:04:14,555 --> 01:04:16,190
- I agree.
- Right?

1101
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,559
This isn't a game
Dong-kyu feels confident in.

1102
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:20,260
The same goes for Ji-soo.

1103
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:23,322
- I trust him.
- He's going to win no matter what.

1104
01:04:23,406 --> 01:04:25,199
Prove yourself with your actions.

1105
01:04:25,266 --> 01:04:26,667
Jung-min will beat him.

1106
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,247
We will now reveal the target pattern.

1107
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:38,295
TARGET PATTERN FOR ROUND 1

1108
01:04:38,379 --> 01:04:40,815
TEAM KU'S JUNG-MIN GOES FIRST
Team KU's Kim Jung-min.

1109
01:04:44,351 --> 01:04:45,636
You have five seconds.

1110
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,638
It looks the same when rotated.

1111
01:04:53,093 --> 01:04:56,105
Your time is up.

1112
01:04:57,565 --> 01:04:59,442
WHEN YOU TIME OUT,
YOUR OPPONENT WILL GET A TURN

1113
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:00,818
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun.

1114
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:08,367
You have five seconds.

1115
01:05:11,278 --> 01:05:12,747
My answer is B6.

1116
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:16,125
DO-HYUN'S ANSWER: B6

1117
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:17,084
That is incorrect.

1118
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:18,795
I see.

1119
01:05:18,878 --> 01:05:20,421
TEAM SNU: -1, TEAM KU: 0
You lose a point.

1120
01:05:20,504 --> 01:05:21,714
Sorry?

1121
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:23,299
- He got it wrong.
- He did.

1122
01:05:25,626 --> 01:05:26,886
Team KU's Kim Jung-min.

1123
01:05:29,388 --> 01:05:32,099
My answer is E4.

1124
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:36,896
JUNG-MIN'S ANSWER: E4

1125
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:39,064
Team KU's Kim Jung-min, that is correct.

1126
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:41,275
TEAM SNU: -1
TEAM KU: 1

1127
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:42,568
He did well.

1128
01:05:43,944 --> 01:05:48,415
Five, four, three, two, one.

1129
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,327
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun.

1130
01:05:51,686 --> 01:05:53,420
My answer is E9.

1131
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:57,207
DO-HYUN'S ANSWER: E9

1132
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:58,501
Your answer is E9.

1133
01:05:59,794 --> 01:06:00,795
That is correct.

1134
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:02,713
Five, four,

1135
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:05,566
TEAM SNU: 0, TEAM KU: 1
three, two, one.

1136
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:09,345
- Team KU's Kim Jung-min.
- My answer is G1.

1137
01:06:09,428 --> 01:06:10,346
Your answer is G1.

1138
01:06:10,437 --> 01:06:13,850
JUNG-MIN'S ANSWER: G1

1139
01:06:13,941 --> 01:06:14,942
That is correct.

1140
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,727
Five, four,

1141
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:19,522
TEAM SNU: 0, TEAM KU: 2
three, two, one.

1142
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:23,400
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun.

1143
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:27,488
My answer is G6.

1144
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:28,989
Your answer is G6.

1145
01:06:29,523 --> 01:06:30,700
That is correct.

1146
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:32,292
- Five, four--
- Game over.

1147
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:34,203
- Game over.
- Four--

1148
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:40,459
Game over.

1149
01:06:44,705 --> 01:06:47,424
That is correct.
You win three bonus points.

1150
01:06:47,508 --> 01:06:48,425
TEAM SNU: 4
TEAM KU: 2

1151
01:06:49,844 --> 01:06:51,679
TEAM SNU IS LEADING WITH 2 POINTS

1152
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:52,680
That was cute.

1153
01:06:52,747 --> 01:06:54,807
- Great job.
- We all saw how well you did.

1154
01:06:54,891 --> 01:06:57,017
I have to admit that Do-hyun is good.

1155
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,352
- You did well.
- But still...

1156
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:00,354
- You did great.
- It's okay.

1157
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:04,149
If the remaining number of matches is odd,
you should name one.

1158
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:05,776
If it's even, give up your turn.

1159
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,595
You did a great job.

1160
01:07:08,571 --> 01:07:09,906
I'm so proud of you.

1161
01:07:09,989 --> 01:07:11,824
They seem to be using a different method.

1162
01:07:11,908 --> 01:07:13,492
Yes, but I prefer ours better.

1163
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:15,202
They have a different approach.

1164
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:17,413
He only found them
because the pattern was easy.

1165
01:07:17,705 --> 01:07:19,582
Exactly. The pattern was too simple.

1166
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:21,041
Jung-min told us to focus

1167
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:24,253
on the white areas
when looking for patterns.

1168
01:07:24,344 --> 01:07:27,381
He said it would be
easier and faster that way.

1169
01:07:27,464 --> 01:07:28,591
So I used that approach,

1170
01:07:28,682 --> 01:07:30,634
SPOT THE PATTERN USING THE WHITE AREAS
and it worked.

1171
01:07:30,718 --> 01:07:33,888
You have enough time,
so try to leave an even number of matches.

1172
01:07:33,988 --> 01:07:35,305
An even number?

1173
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:37,307
My answer is G1.

1174
01:07:37,758 --> 01:07:38,768
Your answer is G1.

1175
01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:41,896
He should've let Do-hyun go
to win the game.

1176
01:07:44,097 --> 01:07:48,068
It was stressful
because if we lost the second round,

1177
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:49,862
they would take the momentum.

1178
01:07:50,204 --> 01:07:52,239
I had to win this round no matter what.

1179
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:55,492
Hyun-min, relax. You'll do fine.

1180
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,286
Just show them what you got.

1181
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:00,122
I was afraid that one small slip-up

1182
01:08:00,214 --> 01:08:03,042
could bring my team
the dishonor of being runner-up.

1183
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:08,965
Players for the second round,
please step onto the stage.

1184
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:11,801
TEAM SNU'S PLAYER FOR ROUND 2

01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:15,883
I kept second-guessing myself,
and that's when I started to panic.

Your time is up. Team SNU's Park Hyun-min.

That is correct.

1236
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:24,418

TEAM KU: 6

1238
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:27,371
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

1239
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:29,207
I think I got a little confused.

1240
01:11:29,289 --> 01:11:30,624
- It's fine. You did great.
- I'm sorry.

1241
01:11:30,724 --> 01:11:32,043
You only lost by one point.

1242
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:34,670
That's it. Let's play this way.

1243
01:11:37,498 --> 01:11:39,633
Were you eyeing the bonus points?

1244
01:11:39,717 --> 01:11:41,219
Was that what you were going for?

1245
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:44,680
To be honest,
I couldn't find the patterns.

1246
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:47,933
- But the answer was in the last two rows.
- It was.

1247
01:11:48,017 --> 01:11:51,478
I realized that he was
working his way down.

1248
01:11:51,562 --> 01:11:55,816
I knew I had to catch up quickly.

1249
01:11:55,883 --> 01:11:58,318
So I waited until I was sure I had it.

1250
01:11:58,385 --> 01:11:59,528
- Four--
- Game over!

1251
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,655
My focus was to be
the one that ended the game.

1252
01:12:01,722 --> 01:12:02,857
That is correct.

1253
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:08,495
If you had found a pattern in the middle,
he might have won the game.

1254
01:12:08,913 --> 01:12:09,956
So well done.

1255
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:11,832
SPOT THE HIDDEN PATTERN

1256
01:12:11,932 --> 01:12:14,585

TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN
VS TEAM KU'S JI-SOO

1264
01:12:30,651 --> 01:12:32,812
The game mostly depended
on individual skills,

1265
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:35,656
and I was pretty confident I'd win.

1266
01:12:36,149 --> 01:12:38,943
I was questioning
whether I'd do well or not.

1267
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:41,962
So I kept thinking
about ways to secure a victory.

1268
01:12:50,604 --> 01:12:52,498
We will now reveal the target pattern.

Game over.

HYUN-SEOK CALLS GAME OVER

1393
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:30,104

01:19:38,713 --> 01:19:39,905
You were fantastic.

1398
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:43,743
I calmly scanned the board
and called it when I was sure.

1399
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:45,786
- Okay.
- I knew you'd pull it off.

1400
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,455
I didn't think there'd be just two.

1401
01:19:47,555 --> 01:19:50,224
I also thought there'd be more.

1402
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:53,085
I was going to call it
when it was my turn.

1403
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:54,878
That's too bad.

1404
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:57,005

1405
01:19:57,097 --> 01:19:58,840
I think Do-hyun will play this round.

1406
01:20:00,334 --> 01:20:01,602

1409
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:08,016
I'm in the zone,

1410
01:20:08,108 --> 01:20:09,727
- so I'll play in the next round.
- Okay.

1411
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,895

Team SNU's Song Hyun-seok.

1427
01:21:13,374 --> 01:21:14,500
You have five seconds.

1428
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:18,045

HYUN-SEOK CALLS GAME OVER

1432
01:21:30,558 --> 01:21:32,226
Song Hyun-seok, that is correct.

1433
01:21:32,309 --> 01:21:34,019
I didn't expect this at all.

1434
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:38,608
Before the game,
we discussed that there could be

1435
01:21:38,691 --> 01:21:41,444
at least one round that had no matches.

1436
01:21:41,535 --> 01:21:45,573
So we told each other
to keep that in mind as we played,

1437
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:48,826
but I only realized there were no matches
when my turn was over.

1438
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:50,620
So I was upset I missed my chance.

1439
01:21:52,112 --> 01:21:54,749
I had looked over the board carefully,

1440
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:58,319
so I was quite certain when I called it.

1441
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:01,839
I was hoping
that Jung-min wouldn't notice.

1442
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:04,300
I desperately wanted him to time out.

1443
01:22:04,391 --> 01:22:06,803
It was a nerve-racking experience.

1444
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:10,473
SPOT THE HIDDEN PATTERN
TEAM KU: 7, TEAM SNU: 15

1445

TEAM KU'S PLAYER FOR THE FINAL ROUND
JUNG-MIN

1448
01:22:16,186 --> 01:22:19,189
I hope we're not putting
too much burden on Jung-min.

1449
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:22,234
He can do this.

1450
01:22:22,318 --> 01:22:23,694
Let's win this thing.

1451
01:22:23,778 --> 01:22:24,779
- Okay.
- Let's go!

1452
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:26,413
TEAM SNU'S PLAYER FOR THE LAST ROUND
HYUN-BIN

1453
01:22:26,848 --> 01:22:29,784
Since this was
the last match of the finals,

1454
01:22:29,884 --> 01:22:32,829
I wanted to end it
knowing that I gave it my all.

1455
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:36,824
But I wasn't happy with my performance,
so I decided to play again.

1456
01:22:39,694 --> 01:22:40,994
Go get them!

1457
01:22:42,763 --> 01:22:44,423
- You're going first, right?
- Yes.

1458
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:49,052

I understand.

1505
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:47,338
You were awesome.

1506
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:49,007
I thought you didn't call it on purpose.

1507
01:24:49,674 --> 01:24:51,133
We should've let them lose some points.

1508
01:24:51,225 --> 01:24:53,344
I know. That was our last line of defense.

1509
01:24:53,803 --> 01:24:55,554
When it comes to speedy judgment,

1510
01:24:55,629 --> 01:24:58,182

I met a lot of contestants
that were really smart and gifted.

1517
01:25:20,821 --> 01:25:24,834
And I was able
to prove myself among these people.

1518
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:28,087
On top of that,
I was happy that my team won.

1519
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:37,538
The winner of Elite League,
the brainpower survival challenge,

is Team SNU.

1521

01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,523
That scared me.

1523
01:25:47,615 --> 01:25:49,149

01:25:52,419 --> 01:25:54,405
- I caught it.
- I want some.

1525
01:25:55,073 --> 01:25:55,907
Good work!

1526
01:25:58,534 --> 01:26:00,160

1527
01:26:00,244 --> 01:26:01,629
We should all catch up sometime.

1528
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:03,915
We're buddies that were born in 2000.

1529
01:26:03,998 --> 01:26:06,166
- You were so cold to me.
- It's no one's fault.

1530
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:09,712
Going through the brutal match
of 300 on the first day

1531
01:26:09,804 --> 01:26:11,589
was the most memorable time for me.

1532
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:15,476
Let's say I can't solve a question.
What do I do then?

1533
01:26:15,542 --> 01:26:16,710
Just tell us.

1534
01:26:16,802 --> 01:26:18,470
Someone will help out then.

1535
01:26:18,554 --> 01:26:20,347
They'll help
and then get back to the questions.

1536
01:26:20,431 --> 01:26:21,482
You can do it, baby!

1537
01:26:21,548 --> 01:26:23,985
Okay, I'll be the team's golden baby.

1538
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,063
We got to show you
how impressive Team KU is,

1539
01:26:27,155 --> 01:26:28,689
so that made the past five days worth it.

1540
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:29,941
That's what I'm talking about!

1541
01:26:30,024 --> 01:26:31,817
Does that mean
we aren't doing the Deathmatch?

1542
01:26:31,901 --> 01:26:33,027
- We're done, right?
- We survived,

1543
01:26:33,094 --> 01:26:34,929
but it's a whole new day tomorrow.

1544
01:26:35,228 --> 01:26:38,666
This experience made me realize
how important teamwork is.

1545
01:26:39,241 --> 01:26:41,368
Our bond may be stronger
than the bond of a brother in arms.

1546
01:26:41,452 --> 01:26:43,412
JUNG-MIN ENLISTED IN OCTOBER
You haven't even served yet.

1547
01:26:43,504 --> 01:26:45,164
It was an invaluable experience.

1548
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:51,179
When would I get to connect
with students from other universities?

1549
01:26:51,963 --> 01:26:57,185
It was lovely to get to know
such great friends from my own university.

1550
01:26:58,019 --> 01:27:02,681
I was happy that my team
was able to participate in the finals.

1551
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:05,267
We can do anything if we're together.

1552
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:06,894
Unity gives us better odds of survival.

1553
01:27:06,978 --> 01:27:09,605
It isn't guaranteed.
It's just a possibility.

1554
01:27:10,031 --> 01:27:11,732
Team KU is amazing.

1555
01:27:12,984 --> 01:27:14,152
Korea University!

1556
01:27:14,234 --> 01:27:15,936
- For the nation!
- For the nation!

1557
01:27:16,236 --> 01:27:17,780
We're proud of our achievement here,

1558
01:27:17,863 --> 01:27:20,407
and we're ready to go back
to enjoy the rest of our time in school.

1559
01:27:21,308 --> 01:27:22,743
At least we beat Team Yonsei!

1560
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:24,495
And Team Harvard!

1561
01:27:25,037 --> 01:27:25,880
Did we?

1562
01:27:25,946 --> 01:27:26,947
We did.

1563
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:30,417
I'm just really...

1564
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:34,722
After I got accepted to medical school,
I think I lost my sense of purpose.

1565
01:27:34,788 --> 01:27:37,091
I just let time pass me by.

1566
01:27:38,467 --> 01:27:40,627
Team SNU shouldn't be asked
to leave on the first day.

1567
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,304
Let's avoid being sent home first.

1568
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:43,973
Did we get it?

1569
01:27:45,766 --> 01:27:46,600
We did it!

1570
01:27:50,905 --> 01:27:52,272
- Good work.
- Well done.

1571
01:27:52,356 --> 01:27:54,274
My teammates and I
spent five days together,

1572
01:27:54,341 --> 01:27:57,028
and we had a shared goal of winning.

1573
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:59,238
During this process,
I gained a lot of new experiences.

1574
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:03,818
I will cherish these moments
and wouldn't trade them for the world.

1575
01:28:04,618 --> 01:28:06,120
Guys, gather around.

1576
01:28:06,204 --> 01:28:07,788
We can do this. Our strategy is flawless.

1577
01:28:07,872 --> 01:28:08,923
Let's do this.

1578
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:11,709
I looked back on all our matches

1579
01:28:11,792 --> 01:28:15,087
and went over the problems we solved,

1580
01:28:15,163 --> 01:28:17,765
and I realized that we did really well.

1581
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:21,177
I don't have any regrets
for the five days I spent here.

1582
01:28:27,725 --> 01:28:29,685
- He got it right.
- He got it.

1583
01:28:29,777 --> 01:28:30,878
- I did?
- Sure.

1584
01:28:31,245 --> 01:28:32,646
He got it. We're okay now.

1585
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:35,566
Brilliant students from POSTECH,
KAIST, Yonsei University,

1586
01:28:35,649 --> 01:28:37,651
Korea University, and Harvard University

1587
01:28:37,735 --> 01:28:40,362
joined us for this amazing journey.

1588
01:28:40,454 --> 01:28:41,789
So I'm grateful to all of them.

1589
01:28:41,856 --> 01:28:42,790
On three.

1590
01:28:42,857 --> 01:28:44,533
- Go, Harvard, SNU!
- Go, Harvard, SNU!

1591
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:50,064
- You were being so real just now.
- You seem happy.

1592
01:28:50,164 --> 01:28:53,960
Meeting all these exceptional new friends

1593
01:28:54,043 --> 01:28:57,713
inspired me to live more passionately.

1594
01:28:58,214 --> 01:28:59,590
It was such a joy to be here.

1595
01:28:59,874 --> 01:29:01,467
- Victory is SNU's!
- Victory is SNU's!

1596
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:02,802
We made a promise

1597
01:29:02,885 --> 01:29:05,305
that the victory would be ours
from the start of the show.

1598
01:29:05,387 --> 01:29:07,265
So I'm happy
we were able to keep our word.

1599
01:29:07,347 --> 01:29:08,348
I'm glad we won,

1600
01:29:08,432 --> 01:29:11,552
and I'd just like to thank
my teammates for everything.

1601
01:29:11,986 --> 01:29:13,520
I'm going to clap the slate now.

1602
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,889
One, three, two.

1603
01:29:15,823 --> 01:29:17,024
- Thank you.
- "One, three, two"?

1604
01:29:17,091 --> 01:29:19,610
- That was a weird wrap-up!
- Thank you.

1605
01:29:19,693 --> 01:29:20,761
Thank you.

1606
01:30:38,147 --> 01:30:40,149
