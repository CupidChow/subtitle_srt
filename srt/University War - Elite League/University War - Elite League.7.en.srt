1
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,519
ELITE LEAGUE

2
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,111
I hope the game is fun and unique.

3
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,489
I'm so nervous.

4
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:31,999
I'm a wreck right now.

5
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,160
My heart is literally racing.
Check my pulse.

6
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:39,907
We said we were going to have fun,
so let's just enjoy ourselves.

7
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,959
That's right. Let's have fun.

8
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,586
They must be under a lot of pressure.

9
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,796
We just need to stay positive.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,965
If we want to win, we need to stay strong.

11
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,300
Today's main match

12
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,011
is Find My Personality Type.

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,846
What?

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,599
Do I have to find someone by myself again?

15
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:00,394
In Find My Personality Type,
players will exchange information

16
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,898
to deduce the personality types
of the opposing teams' players.

17
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,533
What?

18
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:12,907
Players will be assigned
a personality type among the 16 types

19
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:15,009
by choosing a card randomly.

20
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,328
I see.

21
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:20,915
Each player will be assigned
a unique personality type,

22
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,917
and this will not be revealed
to the other teams.

23
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:23,835
UNDISCLOSED

24
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,087
The only way to find out
the other players' personality types

25
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:30,174
is to exchange information
by comparing cards.

26
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,844
If two players agree to compare cards,

27
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:37,056
they will place their cards
on the table in front of the host.

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,433
The screen will then show

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,561
the number of letters
their personality types have in common.

30
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:45,606
The game will consist of 3 rounds,
each lasting 10 minutes.

31
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,775
The duration of the game
will total 30 minutes.

32
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,320
Each team must deduce
the opposing teams' personality types

33
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:54,715
and submit their answers
within these three rounds.

34
00:01:55,482 --> 00:02:00,538
Guessing the opponent's personality type
will grant your team one point.

35
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,002
At the end of the game,
the team with the highest number

36
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,838
of correct answers will survive.

37
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,532
The remaining two
will face the Deathmatch.

38
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,844
If a tie occurs,

39
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:17,638
the team that submits
their answers first will survive.

40
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,239
THE TEAM THAT SUBMITS FIRST SURVIVES

41
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,768
- We need to use logical reasoning.
- Right.

42
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:25,521
We all have a fair chance at winning.

43
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,148
I wonder what the benefit is.

44
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,193
The benefit for Team SNU,
the winner of Relay Match,

45
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,570
will now be revealed.

46
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,013
You may choose one player

47
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:36,074
and ask if they have
a certain personality type.

48
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,784
Your question will then be answered

49
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:40,494
with a yes or a no.

50
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,329
CHECK ONE PLAYER'S PERSONALITY TYPE

51
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,957
- That's huge.
- That's going to be helpful.

52
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,627
- That's big.
- They can earn a point with that.

53
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,004
We shouldn't use it at first.

54
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,296
Of course not.

55
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,474
We should use it
right before we submit our answers.

56
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,301
We can double-check
if we're not sure about someone.

57
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,429
Before we begin the game,

58
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,306
each player will pick a card
that has a personality type.

59
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,486
Each team's first player,
please come forward and pick a card.

60
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,430
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,951
I'm number one, so I chose the first card.

62
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,209
Don't let the others see.

63
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:31,712
Each team's second player...

64
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,248
Each team's third player...

65
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,096
Each team's fourth player,
please come forward and pick a card.

66
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,517
We chose the first four cards.

67
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,395
- We chose 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- That's 1, 2, 3, and 4.

68
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,939
- What did we pick?
- What's this?

69
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,816
Eleven, thirteen...

70
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,858
What did you pick?

71
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,195
- Okay. We're all set.
- What does yours say?

72
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,991
DO-HYUN: ENTJ, HYUN-MIN: ISFP
HYUN-SEOK: ESTJ, HYUN-BIN: ENFJ

73
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,576
JUNG-MIN: INTP, DONG-KYU: ISTP
JI-SOO: ESTP, SEUNG-MIN: ESFP

74
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,203
REMAINING CARDS: INTJ, ENTP, ESFJ, INFP

75
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,373
All players have been assigned
a unique personality type.

76
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,685
You will now be given
ten minutes to discuss your strategy.

77
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,088
...ten minutes to discuss your strategy.

78
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,189
Let's go.

79
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,757
Let's move!

80
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,228
Let's go inside.

81
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,805
We need to exclude
our personality types first.

82
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,807
Write everyone's names down.

83
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,310
We can eliminate it 1 by 1,
and we'll only use the board.

84
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,481
Writing down all the possibilities
under each player's name

85
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:37,611
and eliminating the personality types
with the information we have

86
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,072
is the most logical approach.

87
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,615
Are you writing it all down?

88
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,783
We need to hurry.

89
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,493
We can narrow it down from here.

90
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,371
We'll just erase the irrelevant ones.

91
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,083
We'll write all the possible types
for the eight players

92
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,460
and then erase the ones
that aren't applicable.

93
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,963
The possibilities are endless.

94
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,925
Let's compare one card
to narrow it down and go from there.

95
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:01,969
COMMON STRATEGY

96
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:03,679
1. EXCHANGE INFORMATION WITH OTHER TEAMS

97
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,015
2. ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITIES
THROUGH DEDUCTIVE REASONING

98
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,808
- I got ENTJ.
- I got ISFP.

99
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,934
You got ISFP?

100
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,878
- I picked ESTJ.
- Mine says ENFJ.

101
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,106
Hyun-min and I don't have
any letters in common.

102
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,107
This is good for us.

103
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,567
Hyun-min and I had

104
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,527
completely different personality types.

105
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,611
TEAM SNU'S STRATEGY

106
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,488
ENTJ AND ISFJ: 1 MATCH
ISFJ AND ISFP: 3 MATCHES

107
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,241
ENTJ AND ENFP: 2 MATCHES
ENFP AND ISFP: 2 MATCHES

108
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,243
It'd be best not to reveal

109
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,661
IT'S UNNECESSARY TO REVEAL BOTH CARDS
both our cards.

110
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,414
I'm going to stay here
and keep a low profile.

111
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,209
STRATEGY IS TO CONCEAL DO-HYUN'S CARD
I'll be the wild card.

112
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,753
Who has the same two letters as me?

113
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,047
You and I have two letters in common.

114
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,258
HYUN-SEOK AND HYUN-BIN SHARE 2 LETTERS

115
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,884
Okay, we'll pair up.

116
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,679
If Hyun-bin and Hyun-seok
compared cards with the same person,

117
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,347
we'd be able to find out

118
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:52,145
one or two letters
of that person's personality type.

119
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,562
We need everything you can get.

120
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:55,148
- I'll do all I can.
- We need 16 comparisons.

121
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,065
I know.

122
00:05:56,149 --> 00:06:00,360
If we compare as many cards as we can,
we'd be able to narrow it down.

123
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,029
TEAM SNU'S STRATEGY

124
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,031
MAKE AS MANY COMPARISONS TO GATHER INTEL

125
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:07,701
Then, we'll use the benefit
to confirm a player's personality type.

126
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,370
Once we have that information,

127
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:13,082
we can use deductive reasoning
to figure out the rest.

128
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,584
Your ten minutes is up.

129
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,005
You may now begin to exchange information.

130
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,257
Team KU won't cooperate later on,
so let's ask them first.

131
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:23,383
I have my concerns about Team Harvard.

132
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,678
They tend to be individualistic,

133
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:28,222
so they may not cooperate
if they think they have enough intel.

134
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:29,682
Let's ask Ray and David.

135
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,184
- I'll ask David.
- I'll ask Ray.

136
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,269
HYUN-SEOK AND HYUN-BIN
APPROACH TEAM HARVARD FIRST

137
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,062
I'll go first.

138
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:44,571
Ray and David,
would you like to compare cards?

139
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,573
Hold on. Give us a moment.

140
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:50,328
Why don't I compare with David
and Hyun-seok compare with Ray?

141
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,330
Please give us a moment.

142
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,248
TEAM HARVARD DENIES THE OFFER
Should we ask them?

143
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:55,749
- Do you want to compare cards?
- Yes.

144
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,917
- Okay.
- You two go ahead.

145
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:00,629
SNU'S HYUN-BIN AND KU'S JI-SOO
COMPARE CARDS

146
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,174
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin

147
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,093
and Team KU's Lee Ji-soo,
would you like to compare cards?

148
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:07,194
- Yes.
- Yes.

149
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,298
Please place your cards on the table.

150
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,019
Your cards have been compared.

151
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,937
1 MATCH
HYUN-BIN: ENFJ, JI-SOO: ESTP

152
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,901
In that case, she could be an ESTP.

153
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:23,911
That's one possibility.

154
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:28,115
HYUN-MIN'S PERSONALITY TYPE IS ELIMINATED
She could also be an INTP or an ISTJ.

155
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,449
JI-SOO: ESTP, INTP, ISTJ

156
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,286
KU'S JI-SOO AND SNU'S HYUN-BIN
1 MATCH

157
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,122
HYUN-BIN: ENFJ, ISFJ, INTJ, INFP

158
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,208
KU'S JUNG-MIN AND SNU'S HYUN-SEOK
COMPARE CARDS

159
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,419
- Would you like to compare cards?
- Yes.

160
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:42,796
Please place your cards on the table.

161
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,967
Good luck. May the best man win.

162
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,971
1 MATCH
Your cards have been compared.

163
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,806
- They also have one in common.
- Again?

164
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,684
KU'S JUNG-MIN AND SNU'S HYUN-SEOK
1 MATCH

165
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,477
SEUNG-MIN'S PERSONALITY TYPE IS ELIMINATED

166
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,397
HYUN-SEOK: ISFP, ENFJ, ESTJ

167
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,856
SNU'S HYUN-SEOK AND KU'S JUNG-MIN
1 MATCH

168
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,900
HYUN-MIN'S PERSONALITY TYPE IS ELIMINATED

169
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,819
JUNG-MIN: ENFP, INTP, INFJ

170
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,655
TEAM SNU LOOKS FOR PLAYERS
THEY CAN COMPARE CARDS WITH

171
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,116
Excuse me.

172
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,910
Excuse me.

173
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,578
You're considering it, right?

174
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,264
TEAM SNU TRIES TO COMPARE CARDS

175
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,399
- Do you plan on comparing cards?
- Yes.

176
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,167
Yes.

177
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:22,669
Do you want to compare cards now?

178
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,130
Are you up for it?

179
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:25,423
- Yes.
- All right.

180
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,884
5 MINUTES AGO
TEAM HARVARD DENIED TEAM SNU'S OFFER

181
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,188
- You don't want us to go first?
- That way...

182
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:46,794
If Team KU and Team SNU
compare their cards first...

183
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,364
We wanted to wait for them to go first
because it would give us more intel.

184
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,991
That was our initial game plan.

185
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:57,163
TEAM HARVARD WAITED TO SEE THE RESULTS
BETWEEN SNU'S HYUN-BIN AND KU'S JI-SOO

186
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:01,083
THEN THEY COMPARED
THEIR CARD WITH SNU'S HYUN-BIN

187
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:07,507
Please place your cards on the table.

188
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,092
3 MATCHES
Your cards have been compared.

189
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:14,013
- Three letters?
- He could be an ENFP.

190
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,349
So Hyun-bin must be 1 of these 4.

191
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:18,434
- He's 1 of these 4.
- That's right.

192
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:22,146
Since Hyun-bin and Ji-soo
have one letter in common,

193
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,897
we can narrow it down for Ji-soo.

194
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:26,233
LEVERAGE THE INFORMATION FROM OTHER TEAMS

195
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,277
- We need more data.
- Really?

196
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,004
- Should we?
- I'll go and compare cards.

197
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,155
Go for Ji-soo.

198
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,141
THEY TARGET KU'S JI-SOO,
WHO COMPARED WITH SNU'S HYUN-BIN

199
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,376
What do we do?

200
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,514
- Can I compare cards with Ji-soo?
- Should I? I'll just do it.

201
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,124
- Sure. We need their information.
- Are you sure?

202
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,667
- Thanks.
- Will you compare with us?

203
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,211
Sure. After I do it with Ji-soo.

204
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,795
KU'S JI-SOO AND HARVARD'S RAY
COMPARE CARDS

205
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,214
We're running out of time.

206
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,799
- Would you like to compare cards?
- Yes.

207
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,927
Please place your cards on the table.

208
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,267
Your cards have been compared.

209
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,809
2 MATCHES
JI-SOO: ESTP, RAY: ISTJ

210
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:02,520
That's two letters.

211
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:04,439
HARVARD'S RAY AND KU'S JI-SOO
2 MATCHES

212
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:05,940
DAVID'S PERSONALITY TYPE IS ELIMINATED

213
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,975
JI-SOO: ISFP, INTP, ESTP, ESFJ, ENTJ

214
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,945
Can I talk to you
before you go back inside?

215
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:11,904
Sorry?

216
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,280
Can I compare cards with David?

217
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,782
- One second.
- Either David or Janice.

218
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,786
Hyun-bin wants to compare cards
with either David or Janice.

219
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,621
- No, we can't.
- No?

220
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,915
In that case,
can I compare cards with Ray?

221
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,293
Ray's busy right now. I'm sorry.

222
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,727
So all three of you can't do it?

223
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,796
- I'll check with my teammates.
- Okay.

224
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:32,508
- Should I do it?
- No.

225
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,868
I won't do it.

226
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,388
Your cards have been compared.

227
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:42,017
Sky was being really cautious.
She didn't want to take any chances.

228
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:43,978
She didn't want to reveal our cards.

229
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,730
Your cards have been compared.

230
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,650
- Who did Ray compare cards with?
- We have an issue.

231
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,361
No one from Team Harvard
would come out of their base camp.

232
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,071
We were screwed.

233
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,948
That's just so...

234
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,243
Don't you want to know what I am?
Look into my eyes.

235
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,999
Team SNU's Park Hyun-min
and Team KU's Lee Ji-soo

236
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,708
have agreed to compare cards.

237
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,545
2 MATCHES
JI-SOO: ESTP, HYUN-MIN: ISFP

238
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,440
Your cards have been compared.

239
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,177
This is so annoying.
Why won't Team Harvard compare cards?

240
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,387
- What's this?
- It's Ji-soo's type.

241
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:19,430
Damn it.

242
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:20,764
- What's wrong?
- All three work.

243
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,808
- They all have two matches.
- How is that possible?

244
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,726
- That can't be.
- Even with my comparison?

245
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,522
HYUN-BIN'S COMPARISON
NARROWED DOWN JI-SOO'S TYPE TO 3

246
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,814
JI-SOO: ESTP, INTP, ISTJ

247
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,958
SNU'S HYUN-MIN AND KU'S JI-SOO
2 MATCHES

248
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:33,735
HYUN-MIN'S COMPARISON
FAILED TO YIELD NEW INFORMATION

249
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:36,364
- You have two minutes left.
- What a shame.

250
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:39,074
We just ended up giving Team KU
a lot of information.

251
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,910
- Ji-soo and Hyun-min have 2 in common.
- Ray also has 2, right?

252
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:43,745
TEAM KU'S INFORMATION

253
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,164
JI-SOO: 1 MATCH WITH HYUN-BIN

254
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,208
JI-SOO: 2 MATCHES WITH HYUN-MIN AND RAY

255
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,001
JUNG-MIN: 1 MATCH WITH HYUN-SEOK

256
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,419
Should I go and ask Sky?

257
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:51,629
- Hold on.
- Go ahead.

258
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:54,923
It's the same.

259
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,720
- Where are you going?
- Stop. Don't open the door.

260
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,265
- Would Sky be--
- Let's do that in the next round.

261
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:04,392
- The next round?
- Yes.

262
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,768
We'll leave the INFP here.

263
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:10,814
If Hyun-bin is an INFP...

264
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,903
Do you realize how much we're losing out
by refusing to compare cards?

265
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,864
Tell us what you think we need.

266
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:23,285
- We've only made two comparisons so far.
- Let's try ESFP.

267
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:24,203
What was that?

268
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:29,016
You're all being unreasonable.
We need to compare our cards.

269
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,672
Sky and Janice didn't want
to give out too much information.

270
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,507
They wanted to think things through

271
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:40,227
and compare cards later or not at all.

272
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,970
But David and I disagreed.

273
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,266
We couldn't deduce anything
because we had no information.

274
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:48,519
So we wanted to compare cards
with the other teams

275
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,979
to get some answers.

276
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:54,858
- Who is it?
- Come in.

277
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,569
Jung-min, let's compare cards.

278
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,280
Should I?
Ji-soo and I will do the comparisons.

279
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,448
You can go ahead.

280
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:05,327
KU'S JUNG-MIN AND HARVARD'S DAVID
COMPARE CARDS

281
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:07,705
We will compare your cards.

282
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,207
Team Harvard's David
and Team KU's Kim Jung-min,

283
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,376
please place your cards on the table.

284
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,256
2 MATCHES
Your cards have been compared.

285
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,925
- Who just went?
- Jung-min and David.

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,553
- Jung-min and David.
- Is Team Harvard avoiding us?

287
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,888
Our strategy isn't...

288
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,558
- Our strategy isn't working.
- I know. It's not going as planned.

289
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,560
I don't know what to do anymore.

290
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,354
Our plan was to obtain
the information as quickly as possible.

291
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:34,982
Then we were going to brainstorm
the possible outcomes

292
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,443
and eliminate
the irrelevant personality types.

293
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,570
We were positive our strategy would work.

294
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,865
It is what it is, so don't panic.

295
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,952
That concludes the first round.

296
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:49,413
ROUND 1 RESULTS

297
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,081
HYUN-BIN, JI-SOO: 1
HYUN-SEOK, JUNG-MIN: 1

298
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,333
HYUN-BIN, SKY: 3
JI-SOO, RAY: 2

299
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,876
JI-SOO, HYUN-MIN: 2
JUNG-MIN, DAVID: 2

300
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:56,379
We will now begin the second round.

301
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:58,214
- You didn't compare with anyone, right?
- No.

302
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,469
Sky, can you please
compare your card with mine?

303
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,471
Is Sky up for a comparison?

304
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:07,014
Do you want to do it with me?

305
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:07,941
- With you?
- Yes.

306
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:10,393
- You haven't done it yet, right?
- No. Let's do it.

307
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:11,394
Sure.

308
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,104
- Would you like to compare cards?
- Yes.

309
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,232
HARVARD'S JANICE AND KU'S JI-SOO
COMPARE CARDS

310
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,360
Is Sky going to compare cards?

311
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,238
I think she's busy, but I can ask her.

312
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,074
1 MATCH
Your cards have been compared.

313
00:14:27,702 --> 00:14:30,162
TEAM KU'S JI-SOO
1 MATCH WITH JANICE, 2 MATCHES WITH RAY

314
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:35,209
JI-SOO: INTP, ESTP, ENTJ

315
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,378
We need to adjust our strategy.

316
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,797
Let's target Team KU.
What about Dong-kyu and Seung-min?

317
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,299
Between the two of us,
whose card was revealed more?

318
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:43,300
I only did it once.

319
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,511
Then I'll ask Dong-kyu.
You should ask Seung-min.

320
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:46,512
Okay.

321
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:48,972
Seung-min, do you want to compare cards?

322
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,725
Do you want to compare cards, Dong-kyu?

323
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:51,726
What should I do?

324
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,686
It wouldn't hurt us.

325
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,023
We already shared a lot of information.
Let's just do it.

326
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,234
Compare your card with Hyun-bin's.

327
00:15:00,301 --> 00:15:02,570
- Do it with Hyun-bin.
- Let's go.

328
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,172
Let's compare cards, Seung-min.
Come on out.

329
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,642
Seung-min won't be comparing his card.

330
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:11,612
Keeping one card concealed
seemed strategically sound.

331
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:14,039
So that's why I didn't reveal my card.

332
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:15,583
Are you serious?

333
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:23,006
Seung-min won't reveal his card.

334
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,636
He's going to hold out until the end.

335
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,997
Damn. This is driving me crazy.

336
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:34,134
We failed to come up
with a bulletproof strategy.

337
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,637
So I was really mad at myself.

338
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,107
- Would you like to compare cards?
- Yes.

339
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:42,025
Please place your cards on the table.

340
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:55,289
- Is that the result?
- Your cards have been compared.

341
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:58,091
0 MATCHES
DONG-KYU: ISTP, HYUN-BIN: ENFJ

342
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,753
- Is that the result?
- Your cards have been compared.

343
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,229
Is it really?

344
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,299
This works for both of us.

345
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,467
Maybe we're meant to be.

346
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,635
We were both born...

347
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:09,219
BOTH HYUN-BIN AND DONG-KYU
WERE BORN IN 2000

348
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,888
- We were born in 2000.
- Did they plan this?

349
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:13,432
- Zero matches?
- They know now.

350
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:14,975
- Zero?
- But we also know.

351
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:17,561
This is huge.

352
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,816
Getting zero matches early on
can be quite significant

353
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:25,319
because this doesn't give
the third team much information.

354
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,822
But this gives the other two teams
a huge advantage.

355
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,892
Since we know for certain
one player's personality type,

356
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,411
we can narrow down the types
much more quickly with every comparison.

357
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:36,664
- Zero matches.
- Zero matches.

358
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:41,711
Shoot.

359
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:45,756
If we figure out what Ji-soo's type is...

360
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,967
TEAM HARVARD
TRIES TO USE DEDUCTIVE REASONING

361
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,719
If we know Hyun-bin's,
we'll know Dong-kyu's.

362
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:51,345
We need to compare cards with Ji-soo.

363
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:53,180
Sky! Ji-soo wanted
to compare cards with you.

364
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,728
JI-SOO AND HYUN-BIN
COMPARED CARDS IN ROUND 1

365
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,388
Ji-soo.

366
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:05,818
Would you like to compare cards with me?

367
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:06,961
Give me a second.

368
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,462
Hold on.

369
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,239
We have nothing to gain from Sky.

370
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,368
40 MINUTES AGO
There are 16 personality types,

371
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,579
and my team has four of them.

372
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:21,667
If you list the number of common letters
between each personality type,

373
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:25,212
you would get a number between 0 and 4.

374
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:27,982
0 MATCHES: 1 POSSIBILITY
You'd only get 1 case of 0 matches.

375
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,427
1 MATCH: 4 POSSIBILITIES
There'd be 4 cases of 1 match.

376
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:35,180
2 MATCHES: 6 POSSIBILITIES
Then there are 6 cases of 2 matches.

377
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:39,435
3 MATCHES: 4 POSSIBILITIES
Finally, 4 cases of 3 matches.

378
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:43,439
AVOIDING 2 MATCHES
WOULD HELP FIND THE SOLUTION QUICKLY

379
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:44,982
I knew using that chart

380
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,777
would help us determine
who we needed to compare with.

381
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,070
If we have one letter in common,

382
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,140
we can look for what we need
among these four.

383
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:56,878
Since there are 4 cases of 1 match,
we'd move to the row below.

384
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:59,038
It'd be 2, 2, 0, 2.

385
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,457
That means Seung-min
shouldn't compare his card.

386
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,793
- Right.
- We don't want two matches.

387
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:08,047
So we'll go one row down,
and that'll give us 1, 3, 3, 1.

388
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,025
It'd be better to go with that.
Do you get what I mean?

389
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,426
JUNG-MIN IS THE BETTER BET

390
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,345
- We'll compare cards 1 by 1.
- Okay.

391
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,513
TEAM KU'S STRATEGY

392
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,807
COMPARE CARDS WITH PLAYERS
BASED ON THE CHART

393
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,367
- If we want to do it with Sky--
- I should do it.

394
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:21,602
You're right.

395
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,896
SKY HAD 3 MATCHES WITH HYUN-BIN
We can narrow it down to two.

396
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,873
- Go for Team Harvard.
- Are you keeping notes?

397
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,859
JI-SOO WON'T BE ABLE TO NARROW IT DOWN

398
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:30,194
IT'D BE BETTER FOR SEUNG-MIN
TO COMPARE CARDS WITH SKY

399
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,947
Sky, do you want to do it with me?

400
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,349
No, I wanted to compare cards with Ji-soo.

401
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,578
- But...
- I haven't compared my card with anyone.

402
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:43,724
- All right then.
- I haven't done it yet.

403
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:46,126
Please place your cards on the table.

404
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,005
SEUNG-MIN AND SKY COMPARE CARDS
Your cards have been compared.

405
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:51,298
3 MATCHES
SEUNG-MIN: ESFP, SKY: ENFP

406
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,676
Let's compare cards, Seung-min.

407
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:57,137
- I need to talk to my team first.
- We have five minutes.

408
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,339
I'll be right here.

409
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,852
- Can I compare cards with Ray?
- I got two matches with him.

410
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:04,353
Are you up for it, Seung-min?

411
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,898
- Hold on. Give us ten seconds.
- I'll go ahead and do it.

412
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:08,515
JI-SOO HAD 2 MATCHES WITH RAY

413
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:12,453
IT'S FITTING FOR SEUNG-MIN
TO COMPARE CARDS WITH RAY

414
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,621
- Do it.
- Go ahead.

415
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,117
KU'S SEUNG-MIN AND HARVARD'S RAY
COMPARE CARDS

416
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,369
- Would you like to compare cards?
- Yes.

417
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,631
1 MATCH
Your cards have been compared.

418
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:25,041
Please retrieve your cards.

419
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:30,088
POSSIBLE CASES FOR RAY

420
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,134
RAY IS EITHER AN ENTJ OR AN ISTJ

421
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,719
Is anyone from Team Harvard up for it?

422
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:37,887
- I am.
- Okay.

423
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:41,181
No, wait.
Who should compare cards with him?

424
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,475
We shouldn't? All right.

425
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:48,064
Then who should do it?

426
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,317
- We're not going to do it.
- No one will?

427
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:56,405
- Your team won't compare cards with me?
- Sorry.

428
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:57,740
- I'm sorry.
- There's no one?

429
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,408
I think so. Sorry.

430
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,537
This is a pain in the neck.

431
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:07,750
Janice told her team
not to compare cards with me.

432
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,377
She told all of them not to do it with me.

433
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:12,013
I'm getting pissed off.

434
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:18,761
- Who should we ask? We need information.
- We need to compare with Ji-soo.

435
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,180
We need to compare with Sky and Ji-soo.

436
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,807
Ji-soo made the most comparisons.

437
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,558
1ST: SNU'S HYUN-BIN

438
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,935
2ND: HARVARD'S RAY

439
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,269
3RD: SNU'S HYUN-MIN

440
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,896
4TH: HARVARD'S JANICE

441
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,191
If we know hers,
we can eliminate a whole bunch.

442
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,902
Can I compare cards with Ji-soo?

443
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,170
- Hold on.
- It's David.

444
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,488
- Hold on.
- One second.

445
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,699
If you go, we're done for.

446
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:41,659
- Really?
- Yes.

447
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,119
So that's why he asked me.

448
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,879
Ji-soo, let's compare cards.

449
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:46,831
- With you?
- Don't you know a lot about my card?

450
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:50,517
- But we already know...
- We'll pass.

451
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:52,128
KU'S JUNG-MIN AND SNU'S HYUN-SEOK
1 MATCH

452
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,921
SEUNG-MIN'S PERSONALITY TYPE IS ELIMINATED

453
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:56,224
HYUN-SEOK: ISFJ, ENFJ, ESTJ

454
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,260
- Hyun-seok, why don't we compare cards?
- Me?

455
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:01,929
- Should I do it?
- Go ahead.

456
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,139
HYUN-SEOK AND DAVID
TRY TO COMPARE CARDS

457
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,807
- Hold on.
- David.

458
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,350
Do you want to compare cards with me?

459
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,020
If you say yes to him,
we'll let you compare with Hyun-seok.

460
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,729
Take it or leave it.

461
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:12,982
We'll only do it
if you compare with both of them.

462
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,984
You have one minute left.

463
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,944
- We need to hurry.
- What do you think?

464
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:19,613
- We'll throw in two people.
- They're making an offer.

465
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,574
If you want to do it with Hyun-seok,
you have to do it with me too.

466
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,203
TEAM SNU WANTS MORE INFORMATION
Hold on.

467
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,830
We don't have much time, so please hurry.

468
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,007
But think about it...

469
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,342
- We need it too!
- We have nothing.

470
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,553
We have nothing right now. Just hurry up.

471
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:48,893
You have 30 seconds left.

472
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,561
Would you like to compare cards?

473
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,579
Please place your cards on the table.

474
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:54,648
Your cards have been compared.

475
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,917
1 MATCH
DAVID: INFJ, HYUN-SEOK: ESTJ

476
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,318
You'll keep your word, right?

477
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,570
- Of course.
- No, stop.

478
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:00,487
I'll do it.

479
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:01,989
- But I said David.
- Stop.

480
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:03,908
- He wants David.
- You said it was two-on-two.

481
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,284
- No.
- We both wanted David.

482
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,660
- Both of you?
- That's right.

483
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:08,871
- I thought you meant two-on-two.
- I see.

484
00:22:08,955 --> 00:22:10,623
- We could do that too.
- All right.

485
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:11,799
Let's do that.

486
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:13,793
- Would you like to compare cards?
- Yes.

487
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,602
Team Harvard's Ray
and Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin

488
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,138
have agreed to compare cards.

489
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:19,966
Your cards have been compared.

490
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:21,275
1 MATCH
RAY: ISTJ, HYUN-BIN: ENFJ

491
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,843
Hyun-bin and Ray have one in common.

492
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,720
Can we please get more rounds?

493
00:22:24,804 --> 00:22:26,597
- We already know Hyun-bin's type.
- Right.

494
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,348
- That means Ray...
- It's one match, right?

495
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:30,392
We figured out Ray's personality type.

496
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:32,352
RAY IS EITHER AN ENTJ OR AN ISTJ

497
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,222
HE HAS 1 MATCH WITH HYUN-BIN

498
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,524
TEAM KU CAN DEDUCE THAT RAY IS AN ISTJ

499
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:40,360
- Please retrieve your cards.
- Hurry up, David.

500
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,280
- We're running out of time.
- Hurry.

501
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,739
That concludes the second round.

502
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,033
That concludes the second round.

TEAM HARVARD'S FINDINGS

512

NO CONFIRMED ANSWERS

513
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:10,099
We will now begin the third round
of Find My Personality Type.

514
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,893
Please place your cards on the table.

515
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:14,937
HARVARD'S DAVID AND SNU'S HYUN-BIN
COMPARE CARDS

516
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:18,941
3 MATCHES
DAVID: INFJ, HYUN-BIN: ENFJ

517
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:21,401
HARVARD'S RAY AND KU'S DONG-KYU
COMPARE CARDS

518
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,154
- Would you like to compare cards?
- Yes.

519
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:25,781
Team Harvard's Ray
and Team KU's Lee Dong-kyu...

520
00:23:25,865 --> 00:23:28,701
- Wait! What is Dong-kyu doing?
- Dong-kyu?

521
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,370
- What are you doing?
- Dong-kyu!

522
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:32,579
Take care of him.

523
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:36,959
3 MATCHES
Your cards have been compared.

524
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:39,753
- You didn't need to compare with Ray.
- You didn't.

525
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,839
We already know Ray's personality type.

526
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:43,549
- We do?
- Yes!

527
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:45,626
Why did you do that?

528
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:48,221
I just realized that we knew Ray's
when he compared with Team SNU.

529
00:23:48,304 --> 00:23:49,191
Exactly.

530
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:52,766
I ended up giving Team Harvard
and Team SNU more information,

531
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,269
which was a big mistake on my part.

532
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:07,614
THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT DONG-KYU'S CARD
It can be both.

533
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:08,949
What the heck?

534
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:11,018
Didn't Ji-soo give us more leads?

535
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:13,829
Ji-soo and Hyun-bin had
one match between them.

536
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:16,790
THEY NEED TO KNOW JI-SOO'S CARD
We have to find out if she's an I or an E.

537
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:18,792
David, compare your card with Ji-soo's.

538
00:24:19,226 --> 00:24:20,394
Go ask Ji-soo.

539
00:24:22,363 --> 00:24:24,798
Ji-soo, would you like
to compare cards with me?

540
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,633
Hey, do it with David.

541
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:27,801
David!

542
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,762
Hurry. We need to submit the answers.

543
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:32,139
If we know David's,
we'll know Hyun-seok's.

544
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,808
- Would you like to compare cards?
- Yes.

545
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:37,103
Team Harvard's David
and Team KU's Lee Ji-soo

546
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,687
have agreed to compare cards.

547
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:42,400
Your cards have been compared.
Please retrieve your cards.

548
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:46,421
He has zero matches with Ji-soo.

549
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,739
0 MATCHES
DAVID: INFJ, JI-SOO: ESTP

550
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,783
Then I don't need to do it
with Hyun-seok, right?

551
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:54,078
- Nice.
- That means David is an INFJ.

552
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,662
I have zero matches with Ji-soo.

553
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,373
- Then it's this.
- Right.

554
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:59,375
- But with Hyun-bin...
- She had one match.

555
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:01,085
- One match.
- We need answers now.

556
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,378
He's an ENFP.

557
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,504
Let's pin down Ji-soo's card.

558
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:07,716
- Ji-soo's card can tell us Janice's.
- Let's figure out her card then.

559
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,842
Let's go for Ji-soo.

560
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:11,887
TEAM SNU USES THEIR BENEFIT
TO CONFIRM IF JI-SOO IS AN ESTP

561
00:25:11,971 --> 00:25:13,597
- Your handwriting needs to be clear.
- ESTP.

562
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,615
Hurry up.

563
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:19,228
We'd like to use our benefit.

564
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,148
Team SNU will use their benefit.

565
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,985
- Please hurry.
- Hurry!

566
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:34,668
TEAM SNU HAS CONFIRMED
JI-SOO'S PERSONALITY TYPE

567
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,412
We got it right.

568
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:41,792
We got it right.

569
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,378
- We got it.
- We have it now.

570
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:45,545
We're all set.

571
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:48,341
- She's an ESTP.
- Seung-min and Janice are comparing.

572
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,010
Team Harvard's Janice
and Team KU's Chae Seung-min

573
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,552
have agreed to compare cards.

574
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:54,721
2 MATCHES
JANICE: ISFJ, SEUNG-MIN: ESFP

575
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:56,598
Your cards have been compared.

576
00:25:57,124 --> 00:26:00,520
You must submit
your answer sheet within the time limit.

577
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,690
- Hyun-bin is an ENFJ, right?
- Right.

578
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:09,403
- And Ray is an ISTJ.
- Ray.

579
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,405
- Did Do-hyun compare his card?
- No.

580
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:13,282
- We have no idea what he is.
- Moving on...

581
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:16,494
- What do we know about Sky?
- Sky had three matches with Seung-min.

582
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:19,038
- She also had three with Hyun-bin.
- So it's this...

583
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:21,916
- Three matches with Hyun-bin.
- And one match with Dong-kyu.

584
00:26:22,016 --> 00:26:23,792
- One with Dong-kyu.
- And three with me.

585
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:26,837
That means INFJ is eliminated.

586
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,297
- We eliminated INFJ.
- Right.

587
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:30,558
TEAM HARVARD'S BASE CAMP

588
00:26:30,624 --> 00:26:32,260
ANSWER SHEET FOR TEAM KU

589
00:26:32,343 --> 00:26:34,594
ANSWER SHEET FOR TEAM SNU
- Should this be ESTJ?

590
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:35,804
- Who's the ESTJ?
- INTP.

591
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,557
- Hyun-seok.
- Hyun-seok is an INTP?

592
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,225
No. Jung-min is an INTP.

593
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,310
- I'll put him down as INTP.
- Jung-min is an INTP.

594
00:26:41,394 --> 00:26:42,270
All right.

595
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:44,271
- We need to submit our answers.
- ESFP...

596
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:47,691
We went over Ji-soo and Ray's.
Ji-soo and Janice had one match.

597
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,902
Look at all those possibilities.

598
00:26:51,112 --> 00:26:52,863
We need to go through this quickly.

599
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:55,741
- It's not this one.
- We need to erase that.

600
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,826
- It isn't ISTJ either.
- Erase that one too.

601
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:00,496
Dong-kyu is an ISTP, the opposite of ENFJ.

602
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,165
Ji-soo had two matches with Ray.

603
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:07,627
We went over Ji-soo and Ray's.
Ji-soo and Janice had one match.

604
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:09,589
Look at the ratio between P and J.

605
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,466
- Do all these people have Js?
- Yes.

606
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:13,067
It's J, J, and then P.

607
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:14,760
- You have 20 seconds.
- They're all Js.

608
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,703
- It's a little odd.
- Let's go with ENFP.

609
00:27:16,804 --> 00:27:18,556
- You have 20 seconds.
- They're all Js.

610
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,641
- It's a little odd.
- Let's go with ENFP.

611
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,184
- Let's hand it in.
- Take it.

612
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:24,437
- How much time do we have left?
- We have 20 seconds.

613
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,230
We have 20 seconds.

614
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:33,695
- Hand it in first.
- Submit it.

615
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,656
1ST: TEAM KU
Team KU submitted their answers.

616
00:27:35,756 --> 00:27:37,533
2ND: TEAM HARVARD
Team Harvard submitted their answers.

617
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:40,744
I wondered what more I could do
to contribute to my team.

618
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:44,206
Then I remembered that submitting
the answer sheet first would break a tie.

619
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,916
So I ran for my life.

620
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:51,464
3RD: TEAM SNU
Team SNU submitted their answers.

621
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,709
That concludes the third round
of Find My Personality Type.

622
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:00,214
The final results will now be revealed.

623
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,120
Team KU scored...

624
00:28:10,608 --> 00:28:12,660
TEAM KU SCORED 5 POINTS
five points.

625
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,112
- Damn...
- Why are they starting from us?

626
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,597
- We submitted it first.
- Right.

627
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,299
I have a bad feeling about this.

628
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,249
Please...

629
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:28,626
Team Harvard scored...

630
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:37,385
TEAM HARVARD SCORED 5 POINTS
five points.

631
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:39,253
It's a tie.

632
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,348
It's a tie.

633
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,519
We have to do the Deathmatch.

634
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,730
- We did it!
- We're safe.

635
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:50,856
We can't be certain.

636
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,483
- We submitted it first.
- We did.

637
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,319
- Team SNU scored...
- Please...

638
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:11,352
TEAM SNU SCORED 3 POINTS
three points.

639
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:12,878
We did it!

640
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,601
The teams with the highest scores are

641
00:29:26,684 --> 00:29:28,310
- KU and Harvard.
- I'm glad we submitted it first.

642
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:32,481
However, as Team KU
submitted their answers first,

643
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:33,941
they are the winners.

644
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,444
TEAM KU PROCEEDS TO THE FINALS

645
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,446
We've won the main match a few times.

652
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:51,125
TEAM SNU'S ANSWERS

653
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,627
CORRECT:
DONG-KYU, JI-SOO, RAY

654
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,670
CORRECT: JI-SOO
WRONG: DAVID

655
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:58,924
JI-SOO WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF DAVID,
BUT TEAM SNU FAILED TO CATCH THAT

656
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,135
DURING ROUND 3
Harvard's David and KU's Lee Ji-soo

657
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:02,553
have agreed to compare cards.

658
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,973
DAVID AND JI-SOO
HAD THE OPPOSITE PERSONALITY TYPES

659
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,142
0 MATCHES

660
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:11,145
TEAM SNU MISSED THIS CRITICAL INFORMATION
The information was shared

661
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:14,273
while we were discussing things,
so we all missed it.

662
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:18,986
Team Harvard and Team SNU,
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

663
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:23,658
We weren't happy
that we placed second in the main match.

664
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:28,371
We need to move on
and not let negativity bring us down.

665
00:30:28,454 --> 00:30:31,791
So my focus is on the Deathmatch,
and I'm determined to win.

666
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:36,170
It was humiliating.

667
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:40,090
I felt lost and helpless.

668
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,511
As the oldest member,
I should've kept them grounded.

669
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:45,596
I should've been
the leader my team needed.

670
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,217
But I felt really bad
because I don't think I pulled my weight.

671
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:54,063
What's done is done,
so we're going to move on.

672
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,982
If the Deathmatch
is what we have to do to win the show,

673
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:58,693
we'll do it and win.

674
00:31:06,768 --> 00:31:08,578
DO-HYUN, HYUN-MIN, HYUN-SEOK, HYUN-BIN

675
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,425
- They must be so nervous right now.
- I know.

676
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:26,303
- I was really nervous yesterday.
- You can't let yourself be overwhelmed.

677
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,849
Today's Deathmatch is...

678
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:37,965
Rotate! Rock, Paper, Scissors.

679
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:39,983
What is that?

680
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:45,573
- Rotate?
- Rotate?

681
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:47,116
How do you rotate it?

682
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,493
In Rotate! Rock, Paper, Scissors,

683
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:54,123
you will roll a dice that has
two rocks, two papers, and two scissors.

684
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,293
You will then rotate
the dice on the board to win.

685
00:31:58,385 --> 00:31:59,545
Before the game begins,

686
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:04,592
the net of the dice will be shown
to the players for two minutes.

687
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:06,636
After that, it will not be displayed.

688
00:32:07,662 --> 00:32:11,307
The players and the dice's net
will be different for each round.

689
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:17,271
When a match begins,

690
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:21,342
the dice will be placed
at the top of the board.

691
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:26,405
Players will roll a dice
that only has the numbers 3, 4, and 5.

692
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:29,992
Then they will rotate the dice
according to the number they rolled.

693
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,719
3 MOVES

694
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:38,459
You may move the dice
in any of the four directions.

695
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:41,587
However, you may not move it back
to its previous position.

696
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:44,632
This is going to require skill.

697
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:49,303
Once the dice has reached its destination,

698
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:52,640
the side that touches the board
will determine the results.

699
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:55,559
If you win, you will receive one point.

700
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:57,102
If you lose, you will receive zero points.

701
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:59,613
If you lose, you will lose one point.

702
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:03,108
You'll be given 20 seconds for each turn.

703
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:05,786
If you fail to move the dice
within 20 seconds,

704
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:07,488
you will lose a point.

705
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,157
The game will consist of five rounds.

706
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:13,661
Whoever wins
four points first wins the round.

707
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,497
The team that wins
three rounds first wins the game.

708
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,503
I've been wanting
to play against Team Harvard,

709
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,213
and I'm positive we'll win.

710
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:27,049
SNU is the best university in the world.

711
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:31,094
A chance to beat
Harvard students won't come by often,

712
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,847
so I really want to beat them.

713
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:36,684
They're extremely on edge.

714
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:42,356
We placed second,
and Team SNU came in last.

715
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,985
That's a prime example
that even Team SNU isn't perfect.

716
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,988
So I'm confident that we will win.

717
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:53,701
Just watch. We'll show you why Harvard
is the world's number one university.

718
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:57,371
We're in a better place
than Team SNU at the moment,

719
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,373
so I'm sure we'll win the Deathmatch.

720
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:02,376
Harvard is the best university
in the world,

721
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:05,087
and we'll show you what the best can do.

722
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,258
I can't believe we have front-row seats

723
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,594
to the Deathmatch between SNU and Harvard.

724
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:16,223
- I want Team Harvard to win.
- I see.

725
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:17,558
That's what...

726
00:34:18,768 --> 00:34:20,269
That's what we want.

727
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,566
Facing Team SNU in the finals
might prove to be a challenge for us.

728
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:34,116
Before we begin,
we will decide who goes first.

729
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:38,037
The team that rolls
a higher number will get to go first.

730
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:40,748
Please roll the dice.

731
00:34:43,617 --> 00:34:45,461
TEAM SNU, TEAM HARVARD

732
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:46,378
Good job.

733
00:34:46,462 --> 00:34:50,299
We'll start the game
with Team SNU playing first.

734
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:53,928
Both teams,
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

735
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:55,997
Let's go inside.

736
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,351
Let's do this.

737
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,738
TEAM HARVARD'S STRATEGY

738
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:14,991
MOVING 3 SQUARES UP
If you move three squares up, it's this.

739
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,993
THE ONE BELOW THE SIDE FACING TOP

740
00:35:17,076 --> 00:35:18,586
If you move right, it's the one above.

741
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:21,205
MOVING 3 SQUARES TO THE RIGHT
If we go this way, it'll be this.

742
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:22,874
THE ONE TO THE LEFT OF THE SIDE FACING TOP

743
00:35:22,957 --> 00:35:24,208
MOVING 3 SQUARES IN 1 DIRECTION

744
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,419
WILL MAKE THE DICE LAND ON SIDES
THAT'S ADJACENT TO THE ONE FACING TOP

745
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:33,968
MOVING 4 SQUARES UP

746
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:37,137
MOVING 4 SQUARES TO THE RIGHT

747
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:38,806
MOVING 4 SQUARES IN 1 DIRECTION

748
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,809
WILL ROTATE THE DICE
BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION

749
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:48,566
THE DICE MAY BE THE SAME,

750
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:54,572
BUT THE POSITION AND DIRECTION
OF THE DICE WILL CHANGE THE DICE'S NET

751
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:07,468
We have to be able to picture
the dice in our heads,

752
00:36:07,534 --> 00:36:09,461
so instead of overcomplicating things,

753
00:36:09,536 --> 00:36:11,906
I decided to memorize the net of the dice.

754
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:16,010
This is insane.

755
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:20,180
Can anyone play this game
without panicking a little bit?

756
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:22,934
Once the dice rotates,
I'm sure I'll forget the net.

757
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:26,120
If you forget the net,
you'll blow the whole round.

758
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:27,021
I know.

759
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:29,107
I'm so glad we won the main match today.

760
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,901
- That's all I can say.
- We would lose if we played this game.

761
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,112
What are you drawing?

762
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:37,031
Is that the game board? Got it.

763
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:39,324
The starting point is over here.

764
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:42,661
DO-HYUN EXPLAINS HIS STRATEGY
Think of it this way.

765
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:44,605
All sides are marked with A, B, or C.

766
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:48,333
Rotating the dice three times to the right
is the same as going once to the left.

767
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,794
So this would be C'.

768
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,007
I assigned an alphabet to all six sides.

769
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:59,595
My plan was to find
and memorize the squares

770
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:02,014
that I know will have a certain outcome.

771
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:04,558
For example,
if we rotate the dice three times,

772
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:06,268
I'd move it up, right, and down.

773
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:10,230
That'd make the side facing the board
face the board again.

774
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:12,232
SQUARES WHERE 3 MOVES
WOULD MAKE A' FACE THE BOARD

775
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:16,487
Our plan was to memorize the squares
so that we could utilize it in the game.

776
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,540
SQUARES WHERE YOU CAN MAINTAIN
THE SIDE THAT FACES THE BOARD

777
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,617
Since you're the best,
you should play first.

778
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:25,663
I want to play first.

779
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:26,872
You can go first.

780
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:34,546
Your time is up.

781
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,635
We're going to win.

782
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:40,861
- We can do it.
- I know.

783
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:42,763
This is our chance
to beat Harvard students.

784
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:44,223
I know we have it in us.

785
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:47,235
I appreciate how hard
you all have worked so far.

786
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:48,186
On three.

787
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:50,104
- Victory is SNU's!
- Victory is SNU's!

788
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:52,648
- Victory is SNU's!
- Victory is SNU's!

789
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,399
Let's shout louder than them.

790
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:56,110
But I don't want to.

791
00:37:56,819 --> 00:37:58,779
I don't want to look like a copycat.

792
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,948
We'll win with grace.

793
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,992
"With grace"?

794
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:08,873
Both teams, please gather
at the Main Hall for the Deathmatch.

795
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,296
You'll experience
the might of Korean education.

796
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:18,166
Bring it on.

797
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:23,846
Let's spare the baby of the team
from the Deathmatch.

798
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:26,073
HYUN-MIN
SNU'S YOUNGEST MEMBER, ROUND 4 PLAYER

799
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,766
Let's finish it in three rounds.

800
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:31,353
Twenty seconds is a really long time.

801
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:34,690
If you relax, 20 seconds is enough time.

802
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:37,193
David will do great.

803
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:43,490
ROTATE! ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS

804
00:38:43,557 --> 00:38:45,201
The best university in the world is...

805
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:47,287
The best university in the world is...

806
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:48,462
- Harvard.
- SNU.

807
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:51,098
DEATHMATCH
TEAM HARVARD VS TEAM SNU

808
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:53,876
Players for round one,
please come forward.

809
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:57,404
- Good luck.
- You've got this.

810
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:05,813
TEAM HARVARD'S DAVID
VS TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN

811
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:16,356
I think Team Harvard might win.

812
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:18,400
- Why?
- It's really hard to tell.

813
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:20,945
I don't think Team SNU
is exceptionally good at this.

814
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:24,073
Just remember
the net of the dice, Hyun-min.

815
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:28,002
ROTATE! ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS

816
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:29,103
START

817
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:44,051
Rotate! Rock, Paper, Scissors. Round one.

818
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:45,928
We will now reveal

819
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,454
the dice.

820
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:50,324
NET OF THE FIRST DICE

821
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:21,088
I noticed that Team SNU
had some sort of strategy,

822
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:24,050
but I couldn't figure out what it was.

823
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:28,554
For this game,
we adapted Fleming's Left-Hand Rule.

824
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:31,724
The thumb would stand for scissors,
the middle finger for rock,

825
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:33,351
and the index finger for paper.

826
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:36,187
There's a point where the signs
are positioned at this angle.

827
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,271
TEAM SNU'S STRATEGY

828
00:40:37,338 --> 00:40:40,816
Once you find that point,
you just need to memorize

829
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:43,277
what's on the other side of each sign.

830
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:46,822
THIS MAKES IT EASY TO MEMORIZE THE NET
That's the trick. If the dice moves,

831
00:40:46,906 --> 00:40:48,448
you can move your hand

832
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:51,994
to mimic the dice's movement.

833
00:40:52,078 --> 00:40:54,414
That's why I kept moving my hand
while memorizing the net.

834
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:00,328
Hurry.

835
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:02,213
Make it.

836
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,399
Maybe I should do it.

837
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,008
TEAM KU MAKES A DICE

838
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,801
You have ten seconds.

839
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:11,722
Your time is up.

840
00:41:15,276 --> 00:41:18,604
We'll start with Team SNU.
Please roll the dice.

841
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,118
DO-HYUN HAS 5 MOVES

842
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:25,361
I rolled a five.

843
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:27,154
You rolled a five.

844
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:39,417
You have ten seconds.

845
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,753
I'll move the dice
down, down, down, down, and left.

846
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:44,297
Down.

847
00:41:44,964 --> 00:41:45,965
Down.

848
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:47,425
Down.

849
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:48,884
Down.

850
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:50,470
Left.

851
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:58,478
TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN WINS 1 POINT
You win.

852
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,687
TEAM SNU: 1
TEAM HARVARD: 0

853
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:03,441
How did he do that?

854
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:05,943
I won.

855
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:08,612
You win one point.

856
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:12,074
Team Harvard's David.

857
00:42:12,158 --> 00:42:14,576
TEAM HARVARD'S DAVID GOES NEXT
Please roll the dice.

858
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,330
DAVID HAS 5 MOVES

859
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:19,539
- I rolled a 5.
- You rolled a 5.

860
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:28,966
You have ten seconds.

861
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,554
You have five seconds.

862
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:37,391
Okay. I'll go right.

863
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:40,978
- Your time is up.
- Right...

864
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:43,147
DAVID LOSES 1 POINT FOR GOING OVER TIME

865
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,066
TEAM SNU: 1
TEAM HARVARD: -1

866
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:49,069
Twenty seconds went by
faster than I expected.

867
00:42:49,153 --> 00:42:51,655
So I was really flustered.

868
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:54,867
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun,
please roll the dice.

869
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,663
- I rolled a 3.
- You rolled a 3.

870
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:00,748
DO-HYUN HAS 3 MOVES

871
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:11,926
You have ten seconds left.

872
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:17,098
I'll move the dice right, down, and left.

873
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:19,434
Right.

874
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:21,060
Down.

875
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:22,853
Left.

876
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:26,815
You win one point.

877
00:43:27,525 --> 00:43:30,236
TEAM SNU: 2
TEAM HARVARD: -1

878
00:43:33,448 --> 00:43:35,657
Team Harvard's David,
please roll the dice.

879
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,120
DAVID HAS 3 MOVES
It's a 3.

880
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:40,621
You rolled a three.

881
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:51,006
You have ten seconds left.

882
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:56,762
Please move the dice up, right, and up.

883
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:58,139
Up.

884
00:43:58,722 --> 00:43:59,723
Right.

885
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:01,683
Up.

886
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:03,603
DAVID LOSES 1 POINT

887
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:05,313
You lose one point.

888
00:44:05,396 --> 00:44:10,485
TEAM SNU: 2
TEAM HARVARD: -2

889
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:15,114
- I rolled a 5.
- You rolled a 5.

890
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,039
- You have five seconds.
- I'll go right, up, left, left, and left.

891
00:44:24,123 --> 00:44:27,709
Right, up, left, left,

892
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:29,420
and left.

893
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:31,631
You lose one point.

894
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:33,132
TEAM SNU: 1
TEAM HARVARD: -2

895
00:44:34,342 --> 00:44:35,843
- You lose one point.
- He made a mistake.

896
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:37,678
I think he mistook that side as A'.

897
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:40,473
DO-HYUN GOT CONFUSED
He'll be fine.

898
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:42,141
This game is crazy difficult.

899
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:44,226
I know. This is the hardest game ever.

900
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,979
Team Harvard's David,
please roll the dice.

901
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:51,484
- I rolled a 4.
- You rolled a 4.

902
00:44:57,532 --> 00:45:00,701
I'll go down, right, right, and right.

903
00:45:02,495 --> 00:45:03,496
Right.

904
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:04,872
Right.

905
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:08,792
DAVID'S SCORE REMAINS UNCHANGED
It's a tie.

906
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:11,920
I realized memorization
wasn't working for me.

907
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:16,342
So I kept trying to come up
with a strategy so that I could win.

908
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:17,635
TEAM SNU: 1
TEAM HARVARD: -2

909
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:20,179
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun,
please roll the dice.

910
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:25,100
- I rolled a 4.
- You rolled a 4.

911
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:31,190
I'll go right, right, up, and up.

912
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:37,530
Right, right, up, and up.

913
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:41,242
DO-HYUN WINS 1 POINT
You win one point.

914
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:43,952
TEAM SNU: 2
TEAM HARVARD: -2

915
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:46,539
My team's strategy was to use our hands,

916
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,790
but at one point, I lost my place.

917
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:53,504
I needed to reset the dice,
so I drove it into a corner.

918
00:45:53,588 --> 00:45:55,130
I knew having it in the corner

919
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,425
would make it difficult
for David to score a point.

920
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:03,389
So my plan was to find my place
when the dice was being moved.

921
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:08,143
Team Harvard's David,
please roll the dice.

922
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:11,355
- I rolled a 5.
- You rolled a 5.

923
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:15,901
I'll go left, left,
down, right, and right.

924
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:19,947
You lose one point.

925
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,575
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun,
please roll the dice.

926
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:26,787
- I rolled a 3.
- You rolled a 3.

927
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:32,918
I'll go left, down, and right.

928
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:34,336
Right.

929
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:37,005
TEAM SNU: 3, TEAM HARVARD: -3
You win one point.

930
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:40,259
DAVID HAS 3 MOVES
It's a 3.

931
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:41,677
You rolled a three.

932
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:48,100
I'll go down, left, and left.

933
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:53,397
You lose one point.

934
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:56,150
TEAM SNU: 3
TEAM HARVARD: -4

935
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:02,448
1 MORE POINT AND TEAM SNU WINS
Kyung Do-hyun, please roll the dice.

936
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,745
- I rolled a 4.
- You rolled a 4.

937
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:18,631
I'll go up, up, left, and left.

938
00:47:19,048 --> 00:47:23,219
Up, up, left, and left.

939
00:47:33,354 --> 00:47:34,188
You win.

940
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:35,356
TEAM SNU: 4
TEAM HARVARD: -4

941
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,233
You win.

942
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:38,484
You earn one point.

943
00:47:38,568 --> 00:47:39,860
TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN WINS ROUND 1

944
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:43,197
It's all right.

945
00:47:43,906 --> 00:47:46,116
Don't worry about it.
It was hard, wasn't it?

946
00:47:47,076 --> 00:47:47,993
It's okay.

947
00:47:49,245 --> 00:47:52,122
I had the net memorized,

948
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:54,917
so I should've been able
to picture the dice moving,

949
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:56,711
but I couldn't do that.

950
00:47:57,587 --> 00:47:58,838
Was it hard to picture it moving?

951
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:01,257
I did memorize the net of the dice.

952
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:04,260
But I had to consider the board

953
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:06,679
and picture how the dice would move.

954
00:48:06,763 --> 00:48:10,349
I didn't have time to do both,
so I guessed the whole thing.

955
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,185
It's just not doable.

956
00:48:15,104 --> 00:48:16,021
Great job.

957
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,692
It's super difficult.

958
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:24,280
I knew my teammates believed in me

959
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:28,242
because they asked me
to play the first round.

960
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:32,037
So having that kind of support
helped me win the game.

961
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:33,790
Do-hyun is amazing.

962
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:36,500
He's really good.

963
00:48:36,584 --> 00:48:38,377
The winner of the first round

964
00:48:38,461 --> 00:48:41,338
of Rotate! Rock, Paper, Scissors
is Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun.

965
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:43,633
ROUND 1
TEAM SNU:1, TEAM HARVARD: 0

966
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:46,427
Good luck. You're going to win.

967
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:47,637
I can beat Hyun-seok.

968
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:51,432
We played a similar game this morning.

969
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:54,935
I solved it faster than him.

970
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:55,853
ACE SELECTION

971
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:58,105
6TH: JANICE, 7TH: HYUN-SEOK

972
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:02,610
During the Ace Selection,
Hyun-seok placed lower than I did,

973
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,696
so I was optimistic about winning.

974
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:09,408
When things got confusing,
I drove the dice into a corner.

975
00:49:09,492 --> 00:49:12,703
Even if you lose track,
you can find your place again.

976
00:49:12,787 --> 00:49:14,288
- It's--
- You can see it move.

977
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:15,331
Exactly.

978
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:20,795
The fact that we ended up
in the Deathmatch alone was upsetting.

979
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:24,381
I knew the odds were 50:50
no matter who our opponent was.

980
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:28,218
Players for round two,
please come forward.

981
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:29,762
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

982
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:33,557
- Good luck.
- You too.

983
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:36,936
Rotate! Rock, Paper, Scissors. Round two.

984
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:38,562
Team Harvard's Janice

985
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:41,398
will compete
against Team SNU's Song Hyun-seok.

986
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:43,400
TEAM HARVARD'S JANICE
VS TEAM SNU'S HYUN-SEOK

987
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:48,364
I'm confident that I can memorize it all.

988
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:52,368
My team has to win no matter what,
and I have to pull my weight.

989
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:56,288
We will now reveal the dice for round two.

990
00:49:57,373 --> 00:50:00,209
NET OF THE SECOND DICE

991
00:50:08,885 --> 00:50:11,846
Rock, paper, scissors...

992
00:50:13,072 --> 00:50:13,913
Scissors, rock...

993
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:15,975
Scissors...

994
00:50:20,604 --> 00:50:22,064
Scissors, rock, paper...

995
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,561
Rock...

996
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:25,401
This is paper...

997
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:27,695
I want Team Harvard
to win the second round.

998
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:28,821
Same here.

999
00:50:28,905 --> 00:50:31,365
Is it green, green, and yellow this time?

1000
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:32,825
- I already memorized it.
- Really?

1001
00:50:32,909 --> 00:50:36,078
You just need to memorize two pairs.

1002
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:38,915
If it's not the two, it's the other one.

1003
00:50:38,998 --> 00:50:40,416
So 2 rocks and 2 scissors?

1004
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,170
Team Harvard will start off
the second round.

1005
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:47,590
Team Harvard's Janice,
please roll the dice.

1006
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:49,008
Okay.

1007
00:50:50,426 --> 00:50:51,385
I rolled a three.

1008
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:53,554
JANICE HAS 3 MOVES

1009
00:50:53,637 --> 00:50:55,097
You rolled a three.

1010
00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:01,979

01:02:14,485 --> 01:02:15,502
You win one point.

1180
01:02:15,586 --> 01:02:16,654
TEAM SNU: 2
TEAM HARVARD: 0

1181
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:18,030
He's good.

1182
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:23,244
I caught on to Team SNU's strategy
while watching them play.

1183
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:27,289
There's a pattern you can follow
while focusing on the top side only.

1184
01:02:27,373 --> 01:02:30,959
If you understand this pattern,
you don't need to memorize the dice.

1185
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:35,214
After learning their strategy,
I knew how I was going to play the game.

1186
01:02:35,715 --> 01:02:38,300
IF SKY LOSES, RAY CAN'T PLAY THE GAME

1187
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:40,553
- I rolled a 4.
- You rolled a 4.

1188
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:41,637
SKY HAS 4 MOVES

1189
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:52,398
You have ten seconds.

1190
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:57,361
You have five seconds.

1191
01:03:01,365 --> 01:03:02,658
- I'll go--
- Your time is up.

1192
01:03:02,742 --> 01:03:04,159
SKY TIMED OUT

1193
01:03:04,243 --> 01:03:06,537
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please roll the dice.

1194
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:09,624
TEAM SNU: 2
TEAM HARVARD: -1

1195
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,668
- I rolled a 5.
- You rolled a 5.

1196
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:13,628
HYUN-BIN HAS 5 MOVES

1197
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:25,973
I'll go down, right, up, left, and left.

1198
01:03:26,432 --> 01:03:31,061
Down, right, up, left, and left.

1199
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:34,356
You win one point.

1200
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:37,443
TEAM SNU: 3
TEAM HARVARD: -1

1201
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:39,361
How is he doing that?

1202
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:42,948
I was rattled.

1203
01:03:43,491 --> 01:03:44,659
He's really good.

1204
01:03:46,786 --> 01:03:48,788
When it comes to one-on-one games,

1205
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:51,499
I'm confident I can win
regardless of who the opponent is.

1206
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,461
Team Harvard's Sky, please roll the dice.

1207
01:03:57,838 --> 01:03:59,256
SKY HAS 4 MOVES
You rolled a 4.

1208
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:03,511
You have ten seconds.

1209
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:13,521
Down, down, down, and right.

1210
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:16,399
You win one point.

1211
01:04:16,482 --> 01:04:18,234
SKY WINS 1 POINT

1212
01:04:18,442 --> 01:04:20,861
TEAM SNU: 3
TEAM HARVARD: 0

1213
01:04:21,529 --> 01:04:23,573
I knew I could do better,

1214
01:04:24,782 --> 01:04:27,326
but 20 seconds was a bit too short.

1215
01:04:27,535 --> 01:04:29,829
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please roll the dice.

1216
01:04:31,414 --> 01:04:33,457
- I rolled a 5.
- You rolled a 5.

1217
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,543
HYUN-BIN HAS 5 MOVES

1218
01:04:40,715 --> 01:04:43,718
I'll go right, up, left, down, and down.

1219
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:50,182
Right, up, left, down, and down.

1220
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,441
...and down.

1221
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:00,484
You win one point.

1222
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:01,569
TEAM SNU: 4
TEAM HARVARD: 0

1223
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:03,404
Good game.

1224
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:07,157
TEAM SNU WINS THE DEATHMATCH,
ROTATE! ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS

1225
01:05:10,828 --> 01:05:11,912
You were amazing.

1226
01:05:14,582 --> 01:05:18,795
Since Team KU was in a Deathmatch,
I was glad we got to experience it too.

1227
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:22,757
I'm confident we'll win the finals
no matter what the game is.

1228
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:24,592
What do we do?

1229
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:26,093
You did great.

1230
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:32,475
I was really confident in myself
up until the game started.

1231
01:05:32,558 --> 01:05:35,394
I thought memorizing this
would be a piece of cake.

1232
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:37,605
We failed to think out of the box

1233
01:05:37,688 --> 01:05:40,357
and ended up wasting our time
during the strategy meeting.

1234
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:45,905
The fourth team
to be eliminated from Elite League is

1235
01:05:46,614 --> 01:05:47,824
Team Harvard.

1236
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:53,329
It never feels good to lose.

1237
01:05:53,788 --> 01:05:56,624
I made a lot of mistakes,
so that was a tough pill to swallow.

1238
01:06:12,932 --> 01:06:15,225
I feel bad because it feels like
we're sending them home.

1239
01:06:17,436 --> 01:06:19,772
Team Harvard, please exit the grounds.

1240
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:33,076
In one of the interviews,
I said I wouldn't go home so easily.

1241
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:35,454
I'm very competitive,

1242
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:39,041
and I don't like it when my pride is hurt.

1243
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:42,211
So I was really upset when we lost.

1244
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:44,672
I know we could've done better.

1245
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:48,968
It was sad being eliminated
after such a disappointing performance.

1246
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:51,971
Based on what I knew
about the rigid education system here,

1247
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:54,557
I assumed Korean students
would lack creativity.

1248
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,892
...who can call a timeout.

1249
01:06:55,975 --> 01:06:58,978
But they turned out to be
very creative strategists.

1250
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:01,021
Although they were my competitors,

1251
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:04,274
I was really happy to meet
so many brilliant Koreans.

1252
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:05,484
He's a genius.

1253
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:12,199
This show introduced me
to a new group of friends.

1254
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:15,786
It was a very fruitful
and worthwhile journey.

1255
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:17,830
That was fun.

1256
01:07:23,002 --> 01:07:26,005
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League.

1257
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:27,673
Let the finals begin.

1258
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:32,094
We'll defeat Team SNU.

1259
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:33,804
Victory is SNU's.

1260
01:07:33,888 --> 01:07:35,264
In the end, Korea University will win.

1261
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:36,557
We won't lose to anyone.

1262
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,183
All the numbers point to our victory.

1263
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:41,020
We will beat Team KU
and win the show.

1264
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:44,064
He's insane.

1265
01:07:44,565 --> 01:07:45,983
He's amazing.

1266
01:07:46,734 --> 01:07:48,485
Dong-kyu is really fast.

1267
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:49,695
That's impressive.

1268
01:07:51,196 --> 01:07:52,990
No one can stop Dong-kyu.

1269
01:07:54,491 --> 01:07:56,118
- Hold on.
- You have to hold the fort.

1270
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:57,369
No. Just move.

1271
01:07:57,453 --> 01:07:59,371
Hold on. Is that the right call?

1272
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:01,499
You can do it.

1273
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:04,376
- Team KU...
- They shouldn't be allowed...

1274
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:05,837
Do we need to clap?

1275
01:09:09,901 --> 01:09:11,903
