1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,506
THE TOP 1% IN KOREA
PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY

2
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,927
A UNIVERSITY FAMED FOR QUALITY EDUCATION

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,428
We go to Seoul National University.

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,681
Which is the best university in Korea?
It's SNU.

5
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,266
True geniuses attend KAIST.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,102
I'll prove to you
that POSTECH is the best university.

7
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,898
Team Yonsei University
will crush everyone.

8
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,984
I'm confident that Team Korea University
will not be defeated by anyone.

9
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,282
THERE WILL BE NO POLITICS,
BETRAYALS, OR LIES

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,117
THE ONLY THING TO BE PUT TO THE TEST

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,328
IN THIS BATTLE OF MINDS
IS ONE'S INTELLIGENCE

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,788
Are they being serious?

13
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:38,998
Man, that's difficult.

14
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,710
How do we solve that?

15
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,044
It makes no sense.

16
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,588
Never in my wildest dreams...

17
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,215
I think this is it. That's right.

18
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,718
My gosh. He is so fast.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,971
He's a legend in the math department.

20
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,556
This competition is so fierce.

21
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,059
Gosh. What's he doing?

22
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,310
I think he's a genius.

23
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,604
It's unbelievable.

24
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,690
I'll go with J7, H9, and H13.

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,651
Oh, my gosh.

26
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:08,945
Seriously. What's with him?

27
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:09,946
We're just so good.

28
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,030
Yes!

29
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,990
You know what? I think we'll win.

30
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,621
THE RANKS OF PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES
ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE

31
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:19,705
We're unmatched.

32
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:22,500
Compared to KAIST,

33
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,294
POSTECH isn't as near as good.

34
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,796
We have to beat KAIST.

35
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,798
We'll have to do something about them.

36
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,716
We can't see the screen.

37
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,092
He took you for an easy mark.

38
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,055
They just lit a fire under me.
I want to win now.

39
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,556
This isn't right.
It goes against our deal.

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,516
We had a deal.

41
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:40,518
I'm having a breakdown already.

42
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,937
Is it fun for you?
I wanted to cry so badly.

43
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,648
We made a mistake somewhere.

44
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,984
But what choice do we have?
We have to win.

45
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:02,206
ELITE LEAGUE

46
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,335
Contestants of Elite League, welcome.

47
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,087
MAIN HALL

48
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,006
As a brainpower survival challenge,

49
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,341
Elite League has a simple set of rules.

50
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,095
The elite students
that go to the top universities in Korea

51
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,891
will form teams of four
to contend with other universities.

52
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,601
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP

53
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:24,854
Strategic moves
such as alliance or treachery...

54
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:25,771
TEAM POSTECH'S BASE CAMP

55
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,315
...are unnecessary here.

56
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,361
They will only contend
with their brainpower.

57
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,947
The winners
will proceed to the next challenge,

58
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,034
whereas the losers
may face potential elimination.

59
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,493
KAIST, POSTECH, YONSEI, KU, SNU

60
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:42,080
The one and only winning team

61
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,956
will be awarded a scholarship

62
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,251
of 40 million won in total,
10 million for each member.

63
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,588
With the glory of their schools at stake,

64
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,716
the contestants of Elite League
will bring out all they have.

65
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,470
Which university will claim
the victory in Elite League?

66
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,473
The competition starts now.

67
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,521
WHICH OF THE 5 TEAMS
WILL BE INTRODUCED FIRST?

68
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:08,522
What's this?

69
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:12,359
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

70
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,447
Hello.

71
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,866
I got into SNU twice after receiving
a perfect score on the CSAT.

72
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,953
I'm Jung Hyun-bin,
and I got into SNU Medical School in 2021.

73
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,705
I had four wrong answers
when I was admitted to the dental school.

74
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:27,458
I had perfect scores in all subjects
when I got into medical school.

75
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,043
PERCENTILE RANK: 100
GRADE: 1

76
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,670
I personally see myself as mentally tough.

77
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,923
I rarely get bogged down with mood swings.

78
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,467
I guess you could say
that I have nerves of steel.

79
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,639
- Hello.
- Hi.

80
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,058
- Hello.
- Hi.

81
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,811
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

82
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,272
With only one wrong answer on the CSAT,

83
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,775
I got into SNU's College
of Social Sciences with the highest score.

84
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,902
I'm Kyung Do-hyun,
and I started university in 2023.

85
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:57,029
I'm an economics major. Nice to meet you.

86
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,782
What's your major?

87
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,034
I study economics. I enrolled in 2023.

88
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,744
You enrolled in 2023?

89
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,664
- I study medicine. I enrolled in 2021.
- I see.

90
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,124
So you're older than me.

91
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,963
What's your personality type?

92
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,173
It's ISFP.

93
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,215
- ISFP?
- Yes.

94
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,092
- Mine is INTJ.
- I see.

95
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:21,303
- I hope other teammates are extroverts.
- I feel the same way.

96
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,222
I wish they'd come and break the ice.

97
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,576
- Hello.
- Hello.

98
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,370
- I see I'm the third to arrive.
- Yes.

99
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,538
It's nice to meet you.

100
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,417
Hi, I'm the sunshine
of the Electrical Engineering Department.

101
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,671
I'm Song Hyun-seok. I enrolled in 2022.
My major is electrical engineering.

102
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,589
In a nutshell,

103
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,675
I'm a true people person.

104
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,427
Why don't we speak casually?

105
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,888
Sure. Let's drop the honorifics.

106
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,140
- We'll be here for a while, after all.
- Sure.

107
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,099
- Let's.
- Sure.

108
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:09,060
- I'll just call you by your name.
- Okay.

109
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:11,937
- This is...
- Gosh, what?

110
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,189
- Hi.
- Hello.

111
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,773
Goodness. You're handsome.

112
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,111
I only picked up the books in grade 12
and was once ranked tenth from the bottom

113
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:22,489
before getting into SNU in 2023.
I'm Park Hyun-min. I major in psychology.

114
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,742
I'd never been academic

115
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,787
until I made up my mind
to get into SNU in grade 12.

116
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,580
I put my mind to it, and I got in.

117
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:34,168
I study psychology,
so I'll try to read others' minds.

118
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:35,711
- That's right.
- Can you do that?

119
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:38,214
- We'll win all the mind games.
- Let's make use of your studies.

120
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:40,507
I can read people's minds
just by looking at their eyes.

121
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:41,842
He's a total mind reader.

122
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,719
Who do you think
has the best shot other than us?

123
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:44,762
Other than us?

124
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,264
- Team KAIST?
- Right?

125
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,514
- KAIST.
- Team KAIST...

126
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:51,227
I bet the contestants from KAIST
all have the periodic table memorized.

127
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,401
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

128
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,237

00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,698
I'm an alumnus
of Korea Science Academy of KAIST.

130
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,534
I'm Heo Sung-bum. I entered KAIST
School of Computing in 2019.

131
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,287
I know I might come off as cocky,

132
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,207
but I think I was born a genius.

133
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:17,128
I've rarely seen people
whom I thought were smarter than me.

134
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,424
- Hello.
- Hello.

135
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:24,760

00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:26,929
Hi.

138
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:29,265
I graduated at the top of my class

139
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,601
from elementary, middle, and high school.

140
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:35,271
- How old are you?
- I'm 23.

141
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:36,772
- You're 23?
- And you?

142
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,274
- I'm 24.
- I see.

143
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:39,275
What's your major?

144
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,693
Business and Technology Management.

145
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:41,777
- BTM?
- That's right.

146
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,446
I was startled when I first saw him.

147
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,283
"I don't remember seeing
such a handsome guy on campus."

148
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:48,784
That's what crossed my mind first.

00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:00,296
I'm the recipient
of the KAIST's Presidential Scholarship

153
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,006
and the winner
of the College Math Competitions.

154
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,591
I was the president of KAIST
Mathematics Problem Solving Group.

155
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,802
I've been pursuing math
with all my heart for a decade.

156
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,721
I'm a sentimental mathematician,
Yang Jun-hyuk.

157
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,264
- President of the MPSG?
- President of the MPSG?

158
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:12,225
PRESIDENT OF KAIST
MATHEMATICS PROBLEM SOLVING GROUP

159
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,268
- I have my faith in you.
- Likewise.

160
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,354
- This is the guy.
- Tell me about it.

161
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,271
We have a shot.

162
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:20,024
When I heard he was the president of MPSG,
I shook his hand.

163
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,651
It was nice to have someone
who could solve all the math questions.

164
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:24,153
That's my only forte.

165
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:25,571
- I'm so relieved.
- Totally.

166
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,114
What? Who's this?

167
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:28,032
- Seo-yeon!

00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,075
Hey.

- Hello.
- Hi.

170
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,118
Do you know each other?

171
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,747
I was the top student
throughout my high school days.

172
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,082
I'm Choi Seo-yeon.

173
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,667
I entered KAIST in 2020,
and I study electrical engineering.

174
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,128
Since we're all acquainted now,

175
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:44,506
why don't we speak casually
and stop using honorifics?

176
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,799
- Can I?
- When solving the quizzes...

177
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,718
Sure. I might regret this later.

178
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:52,348
But I don't care about age
and whatnot, so it's okay.

179
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,058
Okay.

180
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:59,021
TEAM YONSEI

181
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:01,648
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP

182
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:08,364
What's your major?

183
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,950
I'm in dental school.

184
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,456
I found it difficult to start up
a conversation with her.

185
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,669
- Hello.
- Hello.

186
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,172
Should I get on my feet?

187
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:27,633
I get straight-A-pluses
and am a natural leader.

188
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,842
My name is Son Ju-hyung.

189
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:32,096
The key to tackling challenges
is to communicate well.

190
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,931
That's why I sat in the middle.

191
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,100
We're going to win no matter what.

192
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,184
That's right.

193
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,478
We're going to win,

194
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,272
and we must keep that in mind
as we go through this.

195
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,399
We can't achieve anything
without such determination.

196
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:45,734
I signed up for this
to beat Korea University.

197
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:47,611
Same here.

198
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,490
We have to stay in the game
until we knock them out.

199
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,159
I resat the CSAT during military service
to become a pharmacist.

200
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,329
I'm Kim Ki-hong. I entered Yonsei in 2023
and major in pharmacy.

I'm Park Na-yoon.
I'm a second-year pre-dentistry student.

203
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,627
I'm the only one that got
a perfect score on the pre-test.

204
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,754
I'm the top contestant
and the King of Mental Math.

My name is Cho Hyun-jun,
also known as Yonsei's Giraffe.

207
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,679
What is 42 times 67?

208
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,184
It's 2814.

209
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,061
I've rarely met people

210
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,813
who are better at math than me.

211
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:24,482
TEAM KU'S BASE CAMP

212
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,275
- What are your majors?
- I'm a math major.

213
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:27,776
- I was hoping there'd be one.
- Same here.

214
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,362
- Why, though?
- Hey, jinx.

215
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:32,865
I'm a math aficionado who admires Gauss.

216
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,784
With dreams of winning the Fields Medal,
I've even named myself Mr. DAFENGEP.

217
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,371
I'm Lee Dong-kyu. I entered KU in 2019,
and I study mathematics.

and P for Pythagoras.

226
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,008
They are all quite well-known, right?

227
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,177
Hi! Hello! Greetings!

Hello, I won more than 60 awards
in high school.

236
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,114
I'm Chae Seung-min. I entered KU in 2021,
and I major in statistics.

237
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,533
Don't tell me it's an all-male group.

238
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,326
GUY 1, GUY 2, GUY 3

239
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,661
It does seem that way.

240
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:23,040
I think our team could be
an all-male team.

241
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,625
Yes, it could be the case.

00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,468
- Do you know?
- Do you?

245
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,594
- I don't.
- No, I don't.

246
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,719
I don't either.

247
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,888
Everyone on our team is a bit old.

248
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,848
I know. I'm worried about it, too.

00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,274
I have an IQ of 151.

253
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,775
I graduated early
from Gyeongnam Science High School.

254
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,903
I'm Lee Hyun-soo. I entered POSTECH

259
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:19,805
- Hi.
- Hello.

260
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,140
- Hello.
- I knew it.

261
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,558
- Hi.
- Hello.

262
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:23,559
Welcome.

who dreams of being a physics teacher.

266
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,569
I'm the queen of the Physics Department.

267
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:35,530
My name is Lee Ji-soo,
and I entered KU in 2023.

268
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,031
It's great we have a physics major.

269
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,325
That's what I'm talking about.

270
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,410
We finally have a pure science major.

271
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:45,122
EVERYONE ENTERED THEIR BASE CAMPS

272
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:48,000
- Be the top of your class in high school.
- My gosh!

273
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,293
Oh, my goodness!

274
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:50,628
That startled me!

275
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:54,549
Be the top of your class in high school,
and you can get into KAIST.

276
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,467
Sure. Smart people attend SNU.

277
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:59,637
While model students go to SNU...

278
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,473
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP
While model students go to SNU,

279
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,726
true geniuses attend KAIST.

280
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,810
That's how I see it.

281
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:08,937
He sure is confident.

282
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,939
I love his attitude.

283
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,236
We can't help but mention
KAIST's rivalry with POSTECH.

284
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:18,780
TEAM POSTECH'S BASE CAMP

285
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,951
Geniuses go to KAIST,

286
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,870
and model students go to SNU.

287
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,372
As for POSTECH's students...

288
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,831
Well, I'm sure they have potential.

289
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:31,502
He's crazy.

290
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,838
I didn't even consider
applying to POSTECH.

291
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,049
Compared to KAIST,

292
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,719
POSTECH isn't as near as good.

293
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,596
TEAM POSTECH'S BASE CAMP

294
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,139
We must knock them out in the first round.

295
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:46,767
TEAM KU'S BASE CAMP
As for Korea University...

296
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,605
As for Korea University,
they're quite problematic.

297
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:53,399
My goodness.

298
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,443
Whenever we say "K University,"

299
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,571
people tend to think
it refers to Korea University.

300
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,117
I wish they'd call themselves
G University.

301
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,077
I wish they'd call themselves
G University.

302
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,370
That's unacceptable.

303
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,664
We need to teach Jun-hyuk a lesson.

304
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:11,833
I'm sure all the contestants
will agree with me on this point.

305
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,128
Team KAIST will win.

306
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,213
- Team KAIST will win.
- He's reaching.

307
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,465
Team KAIST is so cocky.

308
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,717
We have to beat KAIST.

309
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,385
That just ticked me off.

310
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:25,931
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP
Hello.

311
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,100
I was obviously accepted
by that school in Daejeon.

312
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,685
- What?
- "That school in Daejeon"?

313
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,063
POSTECH is far better than that school.

314
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,691
That's why I ditched it and chose POSTECH.

315
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,277
- "Ditched it"?
- He'll regret it later.

316
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,695
I feel bad for him.

317
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,322
PLEASE RANK ALL 5 UNIVERSITIES

318
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,448
POSTECH,

319
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,491
SNU,

320
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:44,825
Yonsei, and KU.

321
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,495
Do I have to continue?

322
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,040
We'll have to do something about them.

323
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:55,211
I might feel bothered
if we really were rivals...

324
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,463
- Totally. It barely stings.
- It doesn't sting at all.

325
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:00,508
Yonsei and KU
are in the same league, but...

326
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,051
Yes, they are. But...

327
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,221
I hope our footage plays before Yonsei's.

328
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:07,682
Can I start now?

329
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:09,475
Hi there.

330
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,643
It's Korea University.

331
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:12,687
Can I start now?

332
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:17,400
What's this?

333
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:18,984
What?

334
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,403
What is he doing?

335
00:14:22,697 --> 00:14:24,824
When it comes to mathematics,

336
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,992
I'm confident I'm second to none.

337
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,160
He's your rival.

338
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:29,161
Can you beat him?

339
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:31,163
I can take down any mathematics major.

340
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,083
I'd place Yonsei in the fifth place.

341
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,420
All it's famous for is its cream buns.

342
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,464
All it's famous for is its cream buns.

343
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:42,592
- But they sure do make quality bread.
- True.

344
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,220
Naturally, Yonsei would rank fifth
as the forever loser.

345
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,931
When they get sent home,

346
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:52,017
I'll record them with my own camera
and keep the footage forever.

347
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,394
...and keep the footage forever.

348
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,647
The video will cheer me up
whenever I feel down.

349
00:14:56,731 --> 00:15:00,735
I'll keep it as a snack for my soul
and enjoy it whenever I have a drink.

350
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:06,156
That's the spirit!

351
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:09,577
I might not win first place,
but I'm definitely going to beat them.

352
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,663
Let's watch Yonsei's.

353
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,915
Should anyone ask you
which university you'd like to attend,

354
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:18,043
no one in their right mind
would ever choose Korea University.

355
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,924
I think my team is going to win.

356
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,342
As for Team KU,

357
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,596
I don't particularly see them as a rival.

358
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,598
But I'd like a face-off with Team SNU.

359
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:34,059
I got into SNU and KAIST
but didn't choose to attend.

360
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,729
So you could say
they are outranked by Yonsei.

361
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,522
- What was that?
- So what's his major?

362
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:40,941
We'll just crush all the other teams.

363
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:46,029
His words are gibberish to me.

364
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,617
It's fun to watch all the rivalries
between the different universities.

365
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,286
- No one stands a chance against SNU.
- Totally.

366
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,871
I doubt Team SNU's footage is interesting.

367
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,372
Right. They don't have any rivals.

368
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:58,334
But true bookworms like them
might be bad at quizzes.

369
00:15:58,417 --> 00:15:59,960
- It's not the same thing.
- Right.

370
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:04,548
Hello. I got accepted
to both SNU and KAIST,

371
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:06,592
but I ditched KAIST for SNU.

372
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,010
With only one wrong answer on the CSAT,

373
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,513
I got into SNU's College
of Social Sciences with the highest score.

374
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,807
I got into SNU twice after receiving
a perfect score on the CSAT.

375
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,016
"A perfect score on CSAT"?

376
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,100
The CSAT?

377
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:17,269
- You got a perfect score?
- Yes.

378
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,690
I'm sure we'll win.

379
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,983
The team I'd like to face?

380
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,360
None comes to mind.

381
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,862
"If one asks of the future of our nation,

382
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:27,380
let them raise their heads
towards Gwanak."

383
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:28,405
That's a saying about SNU.

384
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:32,326
SNU is the only university
that deserves such a saying.

385
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,204
Since we've been the best in the country,

386
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:38,791
Team SNU will win the Elite League.

387
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,877
- They're all bland.
- I know.

388
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,507
Let's show them what we got.

389
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,133
We'll show them what we're made of.

390
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,135
You know what? I think we'll win.

391
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:54,139
Let's try to stay humble.

392
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:03,941
It's starting.

393
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,779
It's time.

394
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,535
The first game of Elite League...

395
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,585
is Ace Selection.

396
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:26,964
"Ace Selection"?

397
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,298
What is it?

398
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:32,970
Jeez, my heart is racing.

399
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:34,722
Calm down.

400
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,600
In the Ace Selection,

401
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,852
all teams will solve the same question.

402
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:43,773
Contestants that solve the question
will enter their answers on the tablet.

403
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,608
You'll see "O" for a correct answer

404
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,277
and "X" if you're wrong.

405
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:52,322
The first person to get it right
qualifies as the team's "Ace."

406
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,618
The Ace may open the door
and come out to the Main Hall.

407
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,121
Other than each team's Ace,

408
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,707
no other contestants
may come out to the Main Hall.

409
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:06,128
There can only be one Ace for each team.

410
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,255
The five Aces of the five teams

411
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:10,049
will contend in the Ace Match.

412
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,968
ACES OF TEAMS A, B, C, D, AND E

413
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:13,886
The first Ace Selection...

414
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,929
ACE SELECTION

415
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:16,514
...is Electronic Brain.

416
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,141
Electronic Brain is a game

417
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:23,938
where you'll be asked to do mental sums
of ten three-digit numbers on the screen.

418
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,149
You'll be our Ace, then.

419
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:31,278
Ever since I started learning math,
I was better at mental math than others.

420
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:32,905
THE ONLY ONE TO GET
A PERFECT SCORE ON THE PRE-TEST

421
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,657
I felt confident.

422
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,825
LEE DONG-KYU, TEAM KU

423
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,326
All it takes is calculation.

424
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:40,162
To all of you who feel confident
about your math skills,

425
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,958
I'll show you what it truly means
to be good at mathematics.

426
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,377
Compared to mathematics majors
of other teams,

427
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,462
I think I'll manage with flying colors.

428
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,256
I thought ten numbers weren't so bad.

429
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,466
I'm confident.

430
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:55,094
Then, now...

431
00:18:57,972 --> 00:19:00,140
let the Ace Selection begin.

432
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:03,227
ACE SELECTION
ELECTRONIC BRAIN

433
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,603
Here's your question.

434
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,443
That's 900, then 1000...

435
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:13,529
Jeez.

436
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,047
The first person who got it right...

437
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,593
TEAM KU

438
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,386
TEAM SNU

439
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,013
TEAM YONSEI

440
00:19:39,097 --> 00:19:40,848
TEAM KAIST

441
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:43,017
TEAM POSTECH

442
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,061
The first person who got it right

443
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,396
is from Team SNU.

444
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:49,107
...is from Team SNU.

445
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,276
It's Jung Hyun-bin.

446
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,822
THE 1ST PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
SNU, JUNG HYUN-BIN

447
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:01,368
Here's your question.

448
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,706
I calculated hundreds' digits,
tens' digits, and unit digits separately.

449
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,251
After that, I added them all together.

450
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,006
As long as I didn't make a mistake,
I was sure I'd get it right fast.

451
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:21,973
Gosh, that was fast.

452
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:28,270
Good luck!

453
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:32,858
He was unbelievably fast.

454
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:36,821
With him as a teammate,
I'm sure we'll definitely win.

455
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,198
He's here for a reason.

456
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,283
SNU is killing it, as expected.

457
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,995
I was blown away.

458
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,165
It felt great.

459
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,084
Everyone on the show is brilliant.

460
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:52,878
It was thrilling
to place first among them.

461
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,133
The second person who got it right...

462
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:03,722
TEAM POSTECH'S BASE CAMP

463
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:06,976
TEAM KU'S BASE CAMP

464
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,978
The second person who got it right...

465
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,646
TEAM KU

466
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,565
TEAM POSTECH

467
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,029
...is from Team POSTECH.

468
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:20,572
TEAM POSTECH

469
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,450
It's Sim Min-sub.

470
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,327
THE 2ND PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
POSTECH, SIM MIN-SUB

471
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,413
I thought I got the answer quite early.

472
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,290
It was a bit of a bummer
to be the runner-up.

473
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,045
The third person who got it right

474
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:36,547
is from Team KU. It's Chae Seung-min.

475
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,341
THE 3RD PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
KU, CHAE SEUNG-MIN

476
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:45,097
I was content
that I was within the top 15 percent.

477
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,350
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

478
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,979
The third person who got it right
is from Team KU.

479
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,148
It's Chae Seung-min.

480
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:59,611
I hear all these announcements
as I'm doing math in my mind.

481
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:02,489
Once I was affected, I kept slowing down.

482
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,455
It felt as if my heart kept sinking.

483
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:12,583
I kept getting distracted
whenever I heard the announcement.

484
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,630
ACE SELECTION
FIRST PLACE: TEAM SNU, JUNG HYUN-BIN

485
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:19,090
SECOND PLACE: TEAM POSTECH, SIM MIN-SUB

486
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:20,466
THIRD PLACE: TEAM KU, CHAE SEUNG-MIN

487
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,468
The fourth person who got it right...

488
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:25,138
TEAM YONSEI AND TEAM KAIST
DON'T HAVE THEIR ACES YET

489
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,024
...is from Team Yonsei.

490
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,567
...is from Team Yonsei.

491
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,822
TEAM YONSEI

492
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,324
It's Park Na-yoon.

493
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,910
THE 4TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
YONSEI, PARK NA-YOON

494
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:53,291
I'm not great with numbers.

495
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:56,794
I expected Hyun-jun
to get the answer first.

496
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:01,257
I submitted my answer
just about 15 seconds into the game.

497
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:04,844
What?

498
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:06,595
But I mistyped my answer.

499
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,603
The fourth person who got it right

500
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:17,148
is from Team Yonsei University.
It's Park Na-yoon.

501
00:23:28,868 --> 00:23:30,494
The fifth person who got it right...

502
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:33,831
NO ONE FROM TEAM KAIST
HAS GOTTEN THE ANSWER RIGHT

503
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,876
...is from Team POSTECH.

504
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,962
THE FIFTH PERSON TO GET THE ANSWER RIGHT
IS FROM TEAM POSTECH

505
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:41,714
It's Moon So-yul.

506
00:23:42,382 --> 00:23:45,467
Two people from my team made the top five.

507
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:47,678
That's what made me think
my team was great.

508
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,180
It boosted my confidence.

509
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:51,515
What's up with Team KAIST?

510
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,313
As time passed, I knew we were in trouble.

511
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,991
The sixth person who got it right

512
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:10,243
is from Team KAIST.

513
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:11,577
It's Heo Sung-bum.

514
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,954
THE 6TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
KAIST'S ACE HEO SUNG-BUM

515
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,252
I'm afraid it hurt KAIST's pride.

516
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:20,753
It was a shame.

517
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:24,840
Seeing a contestant
from Team KAIST join us last

518
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:28,468
reinforced my belief
that Team KAIST was the weakest team.

and Cho Hyun-jun.

527
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,032
Why am I so bad?

528
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:51,951
I'm having a breakdown already.

529
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,411
No. It's all right.

530
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,995
You don't have to be the Ace.

531
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:56,538
It's Choi Seo-yeon.

532
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:58,082

I can't believe I did it.

536
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:03,712
It's Lee Hyun-soo.

537
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,174
Doesn't that place our team on top?

538
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:12,638
TEAM POSTECH HAS THE HIGHEST AVERAGE RANK

539
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,557
This is mad. We're doing great.

540
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,810
- I'm so relieved.
- What will I do with the prize?

541
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,481
- They'll all target us now.
- I know.

542
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,731
- We did great.
- Next...

543
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:24,108
We're just so good.

544
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,567
What's going on? Seriously.

545
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:29,780

00:25:35,411 --> 00:25:36,496
Nice.

549
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,164
We won't be eliminated today.

550
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:39,373
- Right.
- We're doing well.

551
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,250

THE 17TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
KAIST, SO HYUN-JI

555
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:47,381
Good work.

556
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:48,632
You know how it is, right?

557
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:52,136
Those who were behind
rise to the top later.

558
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,804
Yes. That's how it is.

559
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,473
It's a sign that we'll win.

560
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:00,186
- It's all about perspective.
- It's okay.

561
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,229
It's Kim Jung-min.

562
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:04,440
THE 18TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
KU, KIM JUNG-MIN

563
00:26:04,524 --> 00:26:06,025
I kept getting a digit wrong.

564
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:09,278
Is everyone done? Who placed last?

565
00:26:11,447 --> 00:26:12,906
There are two people left.

566
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,201
TEAM YONSEI'S KIM KI-HONG
HASN'T SOLVED IT YET

567
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:17,412
NOR HAS TEAM KU'S LEE JI-SOO
This is bad.

568
00:26:17,495 --> 00:26:18,662
It's 2600...

569
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:20,915
This is bad. Seriously.

570
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,792
There goes their rivalry again.

571
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:26,295
Yonsei and KU
are battling out at the bottom.

572
00:26:31,384 --> 00:26:33,802
I couldn't let Team KU have one up on us.

573
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,304
I needed to win.

574
00:26:37,348 --> 00:26:38,640
I have to win.

575
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:41,727
Come on.

576
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:45,731
Then 331, 145...

577
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,782
Then 4305. It's 2,7...

578
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:03,665
And 3.

579
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,960
- Please let it be right.
- Hurry. Go.

580
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:10,339
You must get it right.

581
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,341
Please.

582
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,473
The 19th person who got it right...

583
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:21,976
We can't let them beat us.

584
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,520
Please.

585
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:25,980
Let's go.

586
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,944
The 19th person who got it right...

587
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,695
ACE SELECTION

588
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,907
THE 19TH PERSON OUT OF 20
TO GET THE ANSWER RIGHT

589
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:38,075
...is from Team KU.

590
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,619
It's Lee Ji-soo.

591
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,120
Way to go!

592
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,330
It's Lee Ji-soo.

593
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:43,998
Way to go!

594
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,293
Way to go!

595
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:52,085
The 20th person who got it right
is from Team Yonsei.

596
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:53,549
It's Kim Ki-hong.

597
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:54,842
This is humiliating.

598
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,135
THE 20TH PLACE
YONSEI, KIM KI-HONG

599
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:02,600
It is a shame,
but it was only the first game.

600
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,061
I can always win in other games.

601
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:08,147
I beat you.

602
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:10,732
ACE SELECTION

603
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:12,527
HYUN-BIN, MIN-SUB,
SEUNG-MIN, NA-YOON, SO-YUL

604
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,445
SUNG-BUM, HYUN-MIN,
JAE-YOON, HYUN-JUN, SEO-YEON

605
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:16,322
HYUN-SEOK, HYUN-SOO,
DONG-KYU, DO-HYUN, JUN-HYUK

606
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,115
JU-HYUNG, HYUN-JI,
JUNG-MIN, JI-SOO, KI-HONG

607
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,412
That concludes the Ace Selection.

608
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:25,956
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

609
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,250
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

610
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:30,711
Team POSTECH...

611
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,754
Team POSTECH's Sim Min-sub.

612
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,426
Team KU's Chae Seung-min.

613
00:28:39,512 --> 00:28:41,138
Team Yonsei's Park Na-yoon.

614
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:44,183
Team KAIST...

615
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,227
Team KAIST's Heo Sung-bum.

616
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:47,769
That's our handsome guy!

617
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,941
You've been selected as your team's Ace.

618
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,277
SNU, HYUN-BIN
POSTECH, MIN-SUB

619
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:56,654
KU, SEUNG-MIN
YONSEI, NA-YOON

620
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,572
KAIST, SUNG-BUM

621
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:02,034
The first Ace Match of Elite League...

622
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:05,996
CHECK YOUR PRIME NUMBERS

623
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,122
...is Check Your Prime Numbers.

624
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:08,999
PRIME NUMBER: A NATURAL NUMBER
WHOSE ONLY FACTORS ARE 1 AND ITSELF

625
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,125
"Check Your Prime Numbers"?

626
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:11,252
What was that?

627
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:13,128
Prime numbers are fun.

628
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:15,548
In this game,

629
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,426
a table filled with numbers
will be presented.

630
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,430
The contestant who finds
the most prime numbers wins.

631
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:25,266
The game will consist of three rounds.

632
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:28,060
And the range of numbers
will change every round.

633
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:29,353
RANGE: 160-200
9 PRIME NUMBERS

634
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:33,815
We have a good shot at this.

635
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:38,779
The contestants
will take turns of 30 seconds

636
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,448
to find prime numbers.

637
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,868
If you manage to find a prime number
during your turn,

638
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,161
you'll win one point.

639
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:50,332
You'll also be given a chance to name
another prime number during your turn.

640
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,335
No points will be deducted
even if you get it wrong,

641
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:55,921
but the chance
will be given to the opponent.

642
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,133
It's the same if you fail to answer
during your turn.

643
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:01,802
Your opponent will then take their turn.

644
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,515
The question mark
is the hidden prime number.

645
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,144
If you name the hidden prime number,
you'll win three points.

646
00:30:10,478 --> 00:30:12,396
One prime number
won't be shown in the table,

647
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,315
and that's the question mark.
It's worth three points.

648
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:15,857
- A prime number within the range?
- Sure.

649
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,109
I see.

650
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,112
The first to score six points

651
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:22,030
wins that round.

652
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:24,325
THE FIRST TO SCORE SIX POINTS
TAKES THE ROUND

653
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:28,621
The contestant
who wins two out of three rounds first

654
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:30,414
will win the Ace Match.

655
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:32,124
CHECK YOUR PRIME NUMBERS

656
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:36,170
In Ace Match,
the winner of the Ace Selection

657
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,921
gets to pick their opponent

658
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:40,424
for a one-on-one match.

659
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,973
The winning team of Ace Match

660
00:30:48,224 --> 00:30:51,352
will receive a benefit
they can use in the next game.

661
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:54,564
A benefit could help my team along.

662
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:56,440
I wanted to win no matter what.

663
00:30:57,817 --> 00:31:00,444
I needed to claim that benefit.

664
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:03,531
I sort of wished
that he'd choose me as his opponent.

665
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:09,370
I felt confident
about my calculation ability.

666
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,374
I had a clear strategy overall,

667
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:16,126
so I felt good about my chances.

668
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:18,212
It seemed doable.

669
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,005
I wasn't all that worried.

670
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:23,259
It's best to get picked at this stage.

671
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:24,802
That could work in our favor.

672
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:26,929
Hyun-bin will pick his opponent.

673
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,972
He needs to avoid the runner-up.
He seems good.

674
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,768
But then again, he might go for him.

675
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:35,563
THE 2ND PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
POSTECH, SIM MIN-SUB

676
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:38,023
I doubt he'll go for Team POSTECH.

677
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:39,525
Please.

678
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,361
It'll be best if we compete.

679
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:43,946
He'll get us the benefit.

680
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,574
Team SNU's Hyun-bin,

681
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,326
please name the Ace
you wish to play against.

682
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,204
TEAM POSTECH, SIM MIN-SUB
TEAM KU, CHAE SEUNG-MIN

683
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:54,915
TEAM YONSEI, PARK NA-YOON
TEAM KAIST, HEO SUNG-BUM

684
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:06,552
- Don't choose KAIST.
- Please name the Ace

685
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,678
you wish to play against.

686
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:09,597
Choose Team KAIST.

687
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,765
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

688
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:11,932
Go with Team KAIST.

689
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,351
Well...

690
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:22,526
Well...

691
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,862
SIM MIN-SUB, CHAE SEUNG-MIN,
PARK NA-YOON, HEO SUNG-BUM

692
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,072
I'll play against
Team Yonsei's Park Na-yoon.

693
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:29,241
HYUNBIN CHOOSES TEAM YONSEI'S PARK NA-YOON

694
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:33,788
The first thought that crossed my mind
was that he saw me as a lightweight.

695
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:36,749
He chose Team Yonsei. Not bad.

696
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,083
He can totally win this.

697
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,670
He'll obviously take the game.

698
00:32:40,753 --> 00:32:43,631
- I bet that was strategic.
- Sure. It's good to play it safe.

699
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,216
You don't want
to blow your shot at the benefit.

700
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,345
All the other contestants

701
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:52,556
had a background in engineering
or computer science.

702
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:55,685
I thought they'd have a knack for numbers.

703
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:59,980
Team SNU's Hyun-bin
and Team Yonsei's Na-yoon,

704
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,274
please make preparations
for the Ace Match.

705
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,698
Well done. You did your school proud.

706
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:10,783
Why did you pick Team Yonsei?

707
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,952
I preferred my chances against her.

708
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:15,872
- To be honest, KAIST seems formidable.
- Yes.

709
00:33:15,955 --> 00:33:17,456
It was Team KU or Team Yonsei.

710
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,375
- The rest seemed similar.
- Yes.

711
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:21,126
- Yonsei and KU are worse.
- Right.

712
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,545
Hyun-bin, let me ask.

713
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:24,463
- What was your strategy?
- How did you do the math?

714
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:26,966
I added all the hundreds,
then all the tens...

715
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,384
I did the same. You were just faster.

716
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,970
- He was just faster.
- That was it, then.

717
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,139
Can you calculate all the prime numbers?

718
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:35,265
- Yes.
- Up to 100?

719
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:36,392
Of course.

720
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:39,353
- He's on another level.
- I mean, I don't know them by heart.

721
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:40,980
- But you can tell...
- By looking.

722
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:43,440
Here's my game plan. I'd go first, right?

723
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,317
I'll try to end it as fast as I can.

724
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:46,777
Should we practice?

725
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:48,529
Shall we try numbers in the 400s?

726
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,823
How about 403? Isn't it a prime number?

727
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:52,199
No, it isn't.

728
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:53,492
It can be divided by 13.

729
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:55,786
- He's right.
- Yes, 13 is its factor.

730
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:57,037
We believe in you.

731
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,539
You have our full trust.

732
00:33:58,622 --> 00:33:59,999
It's become a cult for us.

733
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:02,001
- It's the Church of Hyun-bin.
- Yes.

734
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:04,086
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP

735
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,838
- Why did he pick us?
- I know, right?

736
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:07,631
- I didn't even rank last.
- I know.

737
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:09,759
He took you for an easy mark.

738
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:11,719
- It seems so.
- Go and prove him wrong.

739
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:13,971
He gave me the chance to do so.

740
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,056
How will you do this?

741
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,893
You only need to check as far as
the square root of the number.

742
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,520
Think about factorization.

743
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:24,398
All you need to check are numbers smaller
than the square root of that number.

744
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,442
Right. I get it.

745
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,194
Until you get to the four-digit numbers...

746
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:31,822
For example, 32 by 32 is 1024.

747
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,617
- Right. I get it.
- So...

748
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,536
For numbers below 1000,
try dividing them by 11, 13, 17, 19...

749
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:40,414
Then there's 23 and 29.
There are only 6 of them.

750
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:42,082
- Divide by those?
- Right.

751
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,876
There's 31 too. So 8 in total.

752
00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:47,087
- In the 30s range, there's 31.
- You're incredible.

753
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:48,714
It's 11, 13, 17, 19, and so on.

754
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:51,133
- We all have our expertise.
- Isn't 11 easy?

755
00:34:51,342 --> 00:34:53,135
Hold on. So 11, 13, 17...

756
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:56,221
Hyun-jun's really talented
when it comes to numbers.

757
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,808
I think I'll do better thanks to his help.

758
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,019
Is 4087 a prime number or not?

759
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,312
Try 4087.

760
00:35:03,855 --> 00:35:05,023
Is 4087 a prime number?

761
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:07,149
Well, it is...

762
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:08,400
- No, it's not.
- Why?

763
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:10,152
- Because it's 4096 minus 9.
- Yes.

764
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:11,236
Come again?

765
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,447
- So 4096 is...
- It's a power of some number.

766
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:16,408
- It's a power of 64.
- Right.

767
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:18,995
- And since 9 is 3 to the power of 2...
- It's simple algebra.

768
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:20,830
- A squared minus b squared.
- It's 61 times 67.

769
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:22,540
You're brilliant.

770
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,583
AS SUCH, 4087 IS NOT A PRIME NUMBER

771
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:27,211
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin

772
00:35:27,837 --> 00:35:29,505
and Team Yonsei's Park Na-yoon,

773
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,757
please go to the One-on-One Room.

774
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:33,676
In 3, 2, 1.

775
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:35,678
- Victory is SNU's!
- Victory is SNU's!

776
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:40,058
- We did our best.
- That's right.

777
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:43,310
We're ready. Good luck.

778
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:44,436
- Let's do this.
- Good luck!

779
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:06,458
Before we begin,
as Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin

780
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,586
was the winner of the Ace Selection,

781
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:11,338
he'll get to decide
whether to go first or last.

782
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:13,966
What is your choice?

783
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,134
I'll go first.

784
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:18,930
FIRST ATTACK: TEAM SNU, JUNG HYUN-BIN
SECOND ATTACK: TEAM YONSEI, PARK NA-YOON

785
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:21,223
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

786
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,310
GOOD LUCK, SNU'S ACE, HYUN-BIN

787
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:27,063
GOOD LUCK, HYUN-BIN
YOU'RE IN THE BEST FORM TODAY

788
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:28,188
NO PRESSURE, HYUN-BIN

789
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:29,440
She must be nervous.

790
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:30,983
She gets nervous easily.

791
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:32,818
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP

792
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:37,656
The numbers prepared for the first round
range from 500 to 570.

793
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,911
You'll have to find 9 prime numbers
with a time limit of 30 seconds.

794
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:44,204
CHECK YOUR PRIME NUMBERS, ROUND 1

795
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:47,041
Round one starts now.

796
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:50,878
I'll go with 523.

797
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,838
You chose 523.

798
00:36:52,922 --> 00:36:57,802
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN CHOSE 523

799
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,219
The number 523...

800
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:02,140
is a prime number.

801
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,351
Team SNU's Hyun-bin got it right.

802
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:08,062
Please choose another number.

803
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,899
I'll go with 509.

804
00:37:14,986 --> 00:37:17,279
Team SNU's Hyun-bin
found another prime number.

805
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:19,198
Please choose another number.

806
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:24,203
I'll go with 503.

807
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:25,287
You chose 503.

808
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:30,209
Team SNU's Hyun-bin got it right again.

809
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:31,877
Please choose another number.

810
00:37:33,004 --> 00:37:36,298
He kept choosing the numbers
that I wanted to choose, too.

811
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:37,925
That totally threw me off.

812
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:40,803
- He's on another level.
- He's really good.

813
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:42,763
Please choose another number.

814
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:44,431
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

815
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,892
- He's freaking good!
- Please choose another number.

816
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:49,187
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP
He already got one-third of them.

817
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:51,147
Please choose another number.

818
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,824
I'll go with 541.

819
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,034
You chose 541.

820
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:04,618
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN CHOSE 541

821
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,083
Team SNU's Hyun-bin
found another prime number.

822
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,835
Please choose another number.

823
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:14,086
I'll go with 547.

TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN CHOSE 547

825

You chose 547.

826
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:19,217
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN CHOSE 547

827
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:21,510
You chose 547.

828
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:27,058
Team SNU's Hyun-bin
found another prime number.

829
00:38:31,229 --> 00:38:33,522
Team SNU's Hyun-bin
found another prime number.

830
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:35,066
Please choose another number.

831
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,741
Can I try guessing the hidden number?

832
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,079
The hidden number?
He'll guess the hidden number?

833
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:53,459
THERE ARE STILL 3 MORE PRIME NUMBERS
OTHER THAN THE HIDDEN NUMBER

834
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:57,838
IF HE FAILS TO GET THE RIGHT ANSWER,
HIS TURN WILL BE OVER

835
00:38:57,922 --> 00:38:58,881
Please do.

836
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:00,967
My answer is 521.

837
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:03,886
- Did he say 521?
- Is that right?

838
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:10,810
You named 521 as the hidden number.

839
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:13,604
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN
NAMED 521 AS THE HIDDEN NUMBER

840
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:16,649
You named 521.

841
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:24,865
ROUND 1 COMES TO A CLOSE IF IT'S CORRECT

842
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:30,121
Team SNU's Hyun-bin is correct.

843
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:35,251
Team SNU's Hyun-bin wins this round.

844
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:39,922
I wanted to cry so badly.

845
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,341
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

846
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:44,093
- He did it!
- Team SNU's Hyun-bin is correct.

847
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:47,638
I think his brain is made up
of computer chips instead of neurons.

848
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:49,431
I think he really is a genius.

849
00:39:49,682 --> 00:39:50,683
This isn't good.

850
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:53,936
How did he guess 521?

851
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,562
- I bet that wasn't a guess.
- I suppose.

852
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:56,856
How did he get the hidden number?

853
00:39:56,939 --> 00:39:58,774
How did he do that? He's incredible.

854
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:01,277
- Master of Prime Numbers.
- "Master of Prime Numbers"?

855
00:40:01,361 --> 00:40:03,363
TEAM POSTECH'S BASE CAMP

856
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,616
I would've been brutally defeated
if I had been up there with him.

857
00:40:09,202 --> 00:40:12,038
Let us begin the second round
of Check Your Prime Numbers.

858
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:15,791
The numbers prepared for round 2
range from 1100 to 1180.

859
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:17,668
- That's ridiculous!
- No way.

860
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,003
It's gotten harder.

861
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,047
That's just...

862
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:22,631
They can't be serious.

863
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:26,426
The numbers prepared for round 2
range from 1100 to 1180.

864
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,972
You need to find 9 prime numbers
and have 30 seconds to do so.

865
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:31,098
CHECK YOUR PRIME NUMBERS, ROUND 2

866
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:35,019
Hearing that we're in the 1000s,
I felt my mind go blank momentarily.

867
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:36,520
But I tried to keep calm.

868
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:42,068
Team Yonsei's Park Na-yoon
will go first since she lost round one.

869
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:46,780
I thought I had a shot at this
since I got to go first.

870
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:55,331
I'll go with 1141.

871
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,666
TEAM YONSEI'S NA-YOON CHOSE 1141

872
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,085
You chose 1141.

873
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,299
You chose 1141.

874
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,430
It's not a prime number.

875
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:12,681
1141 IS A COMPOSITE NUMBER

876
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:13,974
This is really hard.

877
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:16,018
Round one wasn't so bad, but this...

878
00:41:16,352 --> 00:41:19,063
Team SNU's Hyun-bin
will now get to answer.

879
00:41:19,355 --> 00:41:21,648
Team SNU's Hyun-bin, please proceed.

880
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,750
I'll go with 1109.

881
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,710
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN CHOSE 1109

882
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:43,129
You chose 1109.

883
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:47,883
You chose 1109.

884
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:52,221
Team SNU's Hyun-bin answered correctly.

885
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:53,680
- Nicely done!
- Way to go!

886
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:55,433
Team SNU's Hyun-bin answered correctly.

887
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,435
- How did he do it? How?
- Gosh.

888
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:01,188
Team SNU's Hyun-bin answered correctly.

889
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:02,982
Please choose another number.

890
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:07,194
I'll go with 1107.

891
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:08,821
You chose 1107.

892
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:10,656
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN CHOSE 1107

893
00:42:14,452 --> 00:42:16,870
That was a wrong answer
from Team SNU's Hyun-bin.

894
00:42:16,954 --> 00:42:20,040
1107 IS A COMPOSITE NUMBER

895
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:22,918
That got me thinking,

896
00:42:23,002 --> 00:42:26,839
"So, I'm not the only one struggling.
I may still have a shot."

897
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:28,715
This is her chance.

898
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:31,802
Team Yonsei's Na-yoon, please proceed.

899
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:37,057
I'll go with 1103.

900
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:38,934
TEAM YONSEI'S NA-YOON CHOSE 1103

00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:40,552
You chose 1103.

902
00:42:40,635 --> 00:42:41,728
You chose 1103.

903
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,862
You're correct.
Please choose another number.

904
00:42:51,531 --> 00:42:53,907
You're correct.
Please choose another number.

905
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:06,003
You have five seconds.

906
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:11,050
Team Yonsei's Na-yoon, your time is up.

907
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:13,719
Team SNU's Hyun-bin will take his turn.

908
00:43:15,346 --> 00:43:18,474
- Team SNU's Hyun-bin will take his turn.
- She should've picked whatever.

909
00:43:18,558 --> 00:43:20,351
Team SNU's Hyun-bin, please proceed.

910
00:43:20,435 --> 00:43:23,687
We should've discussed strategy, too.
We only discussed solutions.

911
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:27,816
Team SNU's Hyun-bin, please proceed.

912
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:36,033
I'll go with 1117.

913
00:43:36,534 --> 00:43:37,743
You chose 1117.

914
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:40,913
Team SNU's Hyun-bin, you're correct.

915
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:42,623
Please choose another number.

916
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:45,834
I'll go with 1171.

917
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:47,503
You answered correctly.

918
00:43:47,587 --> 00:43:48,588
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

919
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,423
Who'd choose to go with that first?

920
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:52,049
- Is he a machine or what?
- He must be one.

921
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:54,343
Please choose another number.

922
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:59,848
I'll go with 1101.

923
00:44:00,391 --> 00:44:01,350
You chose 1101.

924
00:44:01,434 --> 00:44:02,560
TEAM SNU'S HYUN-BIN CHOSE 1101

925
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:03,561
That was a wrong answer.

926
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:05,480
I'll go with 1159.

927
00:44:05,563 --> 00:44:06,647
TEAM YONSEI NA-YOON CHOSE 1159

928
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,731
That was a wrong answer.

929
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:08,983
I'll go with 1121.

930
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,401
That was a wrong answer.

931
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,236
I'll go with 1137.

932
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:13,946
That was a wrong answer.

933
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:16,324
The time has run out
for Team SNU's Hyun-bin.

934
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:18,826
Team Yonsei's Na-yoon will take her turn.

935
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,457

00:44:36,344 --> 00:44:37,428
That's what I thought.

942
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:41,432

You chose 1169.

955
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:08,876
Team SNU's Hyun-bin,
that was a wrong answer.

956
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:13,548
Team Yonsei's Na-yoon will take her turn.

957
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:16,133
- I'll go with 1151.

00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:28,688
It's down to points now.

961
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,856
- Turning it around isn't possible.
- Eight prime numbers are out.

962
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:32,941
- Get the hidden number, and you win.
- Get it, and you win.

963
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:34,109
You guys are right.

964
00:45:34,276 --> 00:45:36,529
WITH A 2-POINT GAP BETWEEN THEM,

965
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:39,490

HIDDEN NUMBER WINS

973
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:30,666
Did he say 1163?

974
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:33,586
- Did you say 1163?
- Yes.

975
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,713
He went with 1163?

976
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:37,381
Surely not.

TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

Did you just see?

983
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:07,203
- I fell in love with him.
- I got goosebumps.

984
00:47:08,746 --> 00:47:10,498
She was no match for him.

985
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:14,126
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP

986
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:17,921
You answered correctly.
You got the hidden prime number.

987
00:47:18,631 --> 00:47:21,592
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

988
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:24,261
He deserved that win.

989
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,973
That concludes the Ace Match,
Check Your Prime Numbers.

990
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:32,061
I was happy that my team
would get the benefit

991
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:34,397
and thought I should prepare well
for the main match.

992
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:38,526
I felt determined to win the main match
even without the benefit

993
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:40,820
and felt an overwhelming sense
of responsibility.

994
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:46,158
All contestants, please gather
at the Main Hall for the main match.

995
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:55,459
I feel so nervous.

996
00:47:56,877 --> 00:47:58,170
My heart's thumping.

997
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,549
Not even the CSAT had me this nervous.

998
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,303
Be confident.

999
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:10,641
Things are just getting started.

1000
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:15,896
The first main match
of Elite League is 300.

1001
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:18,232
Did I just hear 300?

1002
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:19,400
What do they mean by 300?

1003
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:20,484
It's called 300?

1004
00:48:20,568 --> 00:48:21,694
Totaling up to 300?

1005
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:23,696
We'll have to make the sum 300.

1006
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,364
- I think so, too.
- Making 300.

1007
00:48:28,743 --> 00:48:29,910
In this game, 300,

1008
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:32,830
you'll be asked
to solve 300 math questions.

1009
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:35,499
The quickest team to do so wins the game.

1010
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:40,129
What?

1011
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,812

00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:46,009

1015
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:56,979
and you'll fill ten pages in total.

1016
00:48:58,021 --> 00:49:00,149
When you enter all 300 answers,

1017
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:02,401
you'll find out
the number of wrong answers.

1018
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:03,944
12 WRONG ANSWERS

1019
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:07,281
However, if you don't fill in
all 300 answers,

1020
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:09,659
you can't find out
the number of wrong answers.

1021
00:49:09,742 --> 00:49:11,201
NEED TO FILL IN ALL 300
TO CHECK NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS

1022
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:12,161
There's no time limit,

1023
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:14,455
and you can submit answers
as many times as you wish.

1024
00:49:14,538 --> 00:49:15,581
NO TIME OR ATTEMPT LIMIT

1025
00:49:15,665 --> 00:49:18,542
Stay focused
and work together on this game.

1026
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:22,171
The three teams who get to fix
all the wrong answers first will survive.

1027
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:23,506
3 TEAMS WILL SURVIVE

1028
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:26,300
The other two will face
the possibility of elimination.

1029
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:28,719
2 TEAMS MAY FACE ELIMINATION

1030
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,138
So 300 math questions?

1031
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:32,973
There are 300?

1032
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:35,476
- That's just so dumb.
- Tell me about it.

1033
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:36,686
It's a math day today.

1034
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:41,106
I felt immense pressure
to get my team through this game.

1035
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:44,485
I have skills in checking answers
from experience.

1036
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:46,570
I'm sure that'll give us the upper hand.

1037
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:49,699
All contestants,

1038
00:49:49,782 --> 00:49:53,494
please return to your base camps
and prepare for the main match.

1039
00:49:53,786 --> 00:49:55,579
- Let's talk about strategy.
- All right.

1040
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:57,707
Are you good at this? You must be, right?

1041
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,333
Well, I do feel confident.

1042
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,126
Calculation is my forte.

1043
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,212
I can do anything
so long as I can write things down.

1044
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:06,173
I thought it might be a team effort game.

1045
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:10,135
So, I thought we needed to build
strategies for the team.

1046
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:13,347
Think about this.

1047
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,182
One person does all the factorials.

1048
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:17,309
Let me elaborate.

1049
00:50:17,393 --> 00:50:19,061
If there are two questions
with factorials,

1050
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:21,397
having two people work on them
will be inefficient.

1051
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,692
- Let's have one person calculate.
- All right.

1052
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,110
That's 327--

1053
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,362
What? This is good.

1054
00:50:28,779 --> 00:50:31,574
My plan was that we'd have
some simple calculations

1055
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:35,244
like factorials and squared numbers
ready at hand.

1056
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:37,037
We could then use them if need be.

1057
00:50:37,747 --> 00:50:39,623
Do you know the answer
to 2 to the 10th power?

1058
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:40,708
It's 1024.

1059
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,459
- And 2 to the 15th power?
- The 15th power?

1060
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:44,921
That'd be 32768.

1061
00:50:45,004 --> 00:50:46,088
How do you know that?

1062
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:51,010
I knew he was smart,
but he sure is fast at calculations.

1063
00:50:51,886 --> 00:50:53,637
When I studied math as a young boy,

1064
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:55,598
I grasped concepts faster than others,

1065
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:58,017
and I could calculate faster than others.

1066
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,227
I thought I had a good shot at this.

1067
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,855
When we see the questions,

1068
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:05,691
let's each take 50 questions.

1069
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:08,444
And those who finished theirs first
work on the rest.

1070
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:10,070
- Sure.
- Those who finished quickly

1071
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:11,781
- will solve the other 100.
- The last to finish

1072
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:13,616
- should enter the first 200 answers.
- Okay.

1073
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:15,492
The other 3 will solve the 100 questions

1074
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:17,411
- and pass on the answers.
- Thirty-three questions each.

1075
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:18,704
Write that down.

1076
00:51:18,788 --> 00:51:20,331
I'll do questions 1 through 50.

1077
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:22,875
We'll be fine
if we perform as our usual selves.

1078
00:51:22,959 --> 00:51:23,960
Let's not lose our cool.

1079
00:51:24,043 --> 00:51:26,004
Will KAIST and POSTECH be good at this?

1080
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,797
No, we're better.

1081
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,841
Sure, we have the upper hand.

1082
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:31,843
- Our skills will see us through.
- Sure.

1083
00:51:31,968 --> 00:51:33,594
Consider it as one of the exams.

1084
00:51:34,762 --> 00:51:37,097
We only need to avoid
being the bottom two.

1085
00:51:37,473 --> 00:51:40,267
The most important thing
is not to rush things.

1086
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:41,936
It's vital that we make no mistakes.

1087
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,480
"Let's make sure
we get it right from the get-go."

1088
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:45,564
That's what I said.

1089
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:48,275
There will be a few difficult questions.

1090
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:49,652
- Leave them out.
- Okay.

1091
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:52,196
We can then solve them
and check the answers together.

1092
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:53,990
- All right.
- The factorial of 8 is...

1093
00:51:54,824 --> 00:51:55,867
That's 40320.

1094
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,159
It's 40320?

1095
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:01,747
Sung-bum has
this charismatic air around him.

1096
00:52:01,831 --> 00:52:03,041
That made me trust him.

1097
00:52:03,123 --> 00:52:06,418
Sung-bum is dependable.
I liked that about him.

1098
00:52:07,712 --> 00:52:09,380
Don't forget to write properly.

1099
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:12,008
Keep in mind that someone else
will input your answers.

1100
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:15,011
If we can't tell 9 and 0 apart,

1101
00:52:15,094 --> 00:52:16,387
that'll be a disaster.

1102
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,638
- Okay.
- That's true.

1103
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:19,015
It'd put us in a pickle.

1104
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,644
- Let's write answers on a separate paper.
- All right.

1105
00:52:23,728 --> 00:52:24,687
That's a good idea.

1106
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:26,898
Solve on this,
and write the answers on this.

1107
00:52:26,981 --> 00:52:28,273
- Answers only.
- And pass it to Hyun-soo.

1108
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:32,319
Distinguishing the right answers
from the wrong answers was my objective.

1109
00:52:32,403 --> 00:52:33,821
When you write down the answers,

1110
00:52:33,905 --> 00:52:37,324
- mark the answers you're unsure of.
- Great.

1111
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:45,249
I'm sure we'll do well,
but Hyun-jun's our star player.

1112
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:46,625
- In that case...
- So,

1113
00:52:46,709 --> 00:52:49,169
we have to make
the most out of his skills.

1114
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,254
That's right.

1115
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:51,797
Hyun-jun, forget about the rest

1116
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:53,758
- and focus on solving questions.
- Right.

1117
00:52:54,592 --> 00:52:56,677
I was assigned about 150 questions.

1118
00:52:56,761 --> 00:53:00,389
I thought we could make it
if I could solve them quickly.

1119
00:53:01,766 --> 00:53:03,450
Leave the questions that look difficult.

1120
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:04,810
Do the easy ones first.

1121
00:53:04,894 --> 00:53:07,521
So we can leave some for you?

1122
00:53:07,605 --> 00:53:09,941
I'll get the hang of things as I go.

1123
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:12,568
I even know the factorial values
almost by heart.

1124
00:53:12,902 --> 00:53:15,195
So we can skip things like
"9 times a factorial of 10,"

1125
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:17,115
- is that right?
- Yes, exactly.

1126
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:20,242
The optimal system for us goes like this.

1127
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:21,326
Two solve questions,

1128
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:22,369
one inputs answers,

1129
00:53:22,453 --> 00:53:24,455
and the other one will check the numbers.

1130
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:27,708
It seemed Ju-hyung had already figured out

1131
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:30,753
the most efficient system for our team

1132
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:32,171
and mapped out strategies.

1133
00:53:33,047 --> 00:53:35,174
I believe my role
is to assign my teammates

1134
00:53:35,257 --> 00:53:40,304
duties they can handle
most effectively with their given talents.

1135
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:42,598
If we stick to this system,

1136
00:53:42,681 --> 00:53:44,349
- we'll be fine.
- I'm nervous.

1137
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:45,851
Don't you worry, guys.

1138
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:49,521
- I'm so glad we have Hyun-jun.
- Me too.

1139
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,691
- I like Ju-hyung's system.
- I feel the same way.

1140
00:53:52,775 --> 00:53:54,526
This is my specialty, actually.

1141
00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:57,655
I'm very confident about our system.

1142
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:59,615
I believe we can even win this thing.

1143
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:02,409
So, the 30 questions...
Here's what I thought.

1144
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:04,703
Person A will solve the first ten.

1145
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,998
Person B will then solve the next 20.

1146
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:10,126
While Person A solves
and inputs the ten questions,

1147
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:11,710
- Person B will solve the next 20.
- Yes.

1148
00:54:11,794 --> 00:54:13,420
A will do 10, B will do 20,
C will do 30, and so on?

1149
00:54:13,504 --> 00:54:16,007
So, we'll scale up the number of questions
with inputting time in mind?

1150
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,050
- So who's doing what?
- I'm thinking.

1151
00:54:18,134 --> 00:54:20,219
What'd be the most time-efficient way?

1152
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:22,596
A good League of Legends player
would think that way.

1153
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,849
What would be the most efficient way?

1154
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:27,018
I don't want to do the Death Match.

1155
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:28,186
We can't lose.

1156
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:31,897
If we have a strategy
that boosts our teamwork,

1157
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:33,232
I think we can win.

1158
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:35,484
Let's say I can't solve a question.

1159
00:54:35,985 --> 00:54:36,986
What do I do then?

1160
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,030
Someone will help out then.

1161
00:54:39,113 --> 00:54:41,323
- Someone will help and get back to his.
- Okay.

1162
00:54:41,406 --> 00:54:44,035
The sample question had
a factorial of 15, right?

1163
00:54:44,118 --> 00:54:46,078
- Should I calculate it and make a memo?
- And square numbers.

1164
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:47,287
- Write down the factorial of 15.
- Memorize it?

1165
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:48,510
I know the factorial of 10.

1166
00:54:48,594 --> 00:54:51,167
- What is it?
- It's 3628800.

1167
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,292
It's unbelievable.

1168
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:53,919
He's a legend in the math department.

1169
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:57,548
I was majorly comforted
to have Dong-kyu on the team.

1170
00:54:57,798 --> 00:54:59,591
If all we need to do is calculation,

1171
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:01,719
the mental calculation is just a mindset.

1172
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:07,850
The main match, 300,

1173
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,768
will begin now.

1174
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,105
Don't get distracted and focus, okay?

1175
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,191
- Okay.
- Don't think of it as a game.

1176
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:18,360
All contestants,
please gather at the Main Hall.

1177
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,654
Let's go, guys. Don't forget your pens.

1178
00:55:20,738 --> 00:55:22,531
I'm an engineering student.
I do this all the time.

1179
00:55:23,032 --> 00:55:23,949
Let's go!

1180
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:28,788
CHECKING FORMULAS UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE

1181
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:32,750
- Let's go.
- ...please gather at the Main Hall.

1182
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:44,428
Oh, my. Hyun-bin.

1183
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:47,431
- What's this?
- Screens for the questions.

1184
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,100
This is how they'll show us the questions.

1185
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:56,398
We should move.

1186
00:55:56,482 --> 00:55:58,067
I know. I can't see from here.

1187
00:55:58,151 --> 00:55:59,152
Someone come here.

1188
00:55:59,235 --> 00:56:00,486
- Should I?
- I will.

1189
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:01,904
- All right.
- You will...

1190
00:56:01,988 --> 00:56:02,822
Right?

1191
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:04,865
TEAM SNU'S BUSY DECIDING
No, stand here.

1192
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:06,617
WHO SHOULD STAND WHERE
You and I should stand here.

1193
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,077
- Why me?
- Someone come here.

1194
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:09,536
- Really?
- I should go there.

1195
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,746
- All right.
- No, you should come here.

1196
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:11,831
I'll stand in the back.

1197
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:13,749
- You should move forward.
- Do you want to?

1198
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:15,335
- But...
- But then,

1199
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:16,460
- you'd block our view.
- Right.

1200
00:56:16,543 --> 00:56:17,544
- What?
- We need to see.

1201
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:18,838
- You'd block our view.
- Right.

1202
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:19,880
- What?
- We need to see.

1203
00:56:19,964 --> 00:56:20,923
We're blocking their view.

1204
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:22,842
- You're blocking our view.
- We can't see the screen.

1205
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:24,844
We can't see the screen on the left.

1206
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:28,722
- Who's getting in your way?
- Do I get in the way?

1207
00:56:28,806 --> 00:56:30,099
- No, you don't.
- You can stay there.

1208
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:35,355
Since SNU is well-known
as the best university,

1209
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:37,315
we can't help but keep an eye on them.

1210
00:56:39,984 --> 00:56:42,028
I reminded myself not to mind others.

1211
00:56:43,696 --> 00:56:45,114
The main match, 300,

1212
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:47,200
will begin.

1213
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:52,038
Let's keep calm, guys.

1214
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:54,707
It's okay, even if you get it wrong.

1215
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:55,624
Let's roll.

1216
00:56:57,168 --> 00:56:58,169
I feel so nervous.

1217
00:56:59,128 --> 00:57:00,087
We got this.

1218
00:57:00,171 --> 00:57:01,463
- That's right.
- Good luck.

1219
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:02,756
We can do this!

1220
00:57:03,216 --> 00:57:04,424
We got this.

1221
00:57:06,302 --> 00:57:09,847
Since Team SNU won
the benefit of a sneak peek,

1222
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:13,433
they'll be shown 5 questions
among the 300 first.

1223
00:57:14,227 --> 00:57:16,478
Just five questions
won't make a difference.

1224
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:20,566
They'll be given two minutes
to solve five questions.

1225
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,072
- This is ridiculous.
- Let's get to it.

1226
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:27,948
I'll take number five.

1227
00:57:28,032 --> 00:57:29,200
- Then I'll...
- I'll do number one.

1228
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:30,201
Well, then...

1229
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:33,204
SNEAK PEEK QUESTIONS

1230
00:57:42,963 --> 00:57:44,131
I'll take number two.

1231
00:57:45,091 --> 00:57:46,550
Let's see...

1232
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:47,843
Which one should I take?

1233
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:50,388
Which one? Number three?

1234
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,181
- You're doing number two, right?
- Yes.

1235
00:57:53,391 --> 00:57:55,017
So with 1113...

1236
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:57,019
- I'll just write down the answer.
- Okay.

1237
00:57:57,103 --> 00:57:58,396
- That's for number 3.
- That's 123.

1238
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:00,689
- So with 275460...
- Which one are you on?

1239
00:58:01,357 --> 00:58:02,482
You have one minute.

1240
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:08,239
Seeing how they're still huddled around
for just five questions,

1241
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:09,365
the questions must be tricky.

1242
00:58:09,449 --> 00:58:11,242
If a mere five questions
are taking them so long,

1243
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:13,327
the questions must be time-consuming.

1244
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:14,578
They must be.

1245
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:17,664
This is mental.

1246
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:19,792
It's just ridiculous.

1247
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:25,214
Did you solve number three?

1248
00:58:25,298 --> 00:58:26,340
- He did.
- Yes.

1249
00:58:26,424 --> 00:58:27,841
- That's 2754...
- I got number 4.

1250
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:29,051
- No, 27...
- How about number 5?

1251
00:58:29,135 --> 00:58:30,177
- It's solved.
- I got it.

1252
00:58:30,261 --> 00:58:31,804
I hope these are right.

1253
00:58:38,394 --> 00:58:40,229
Your time is up.

1254
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:42,315
Your time is up.

1255
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:44,484
Let's just trust that we got them.

1256
00:58:44,691 --> 00:58:45,692
The 300 questions...

1257
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:56,329

How do we solve that?

1266
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,337
They're just trying to mess with us.

1267
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,922
Seriously.

1268
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,258
Why is it so difficult?

1269
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:53,135
Three hundred questions
were a lot more than I thought.

1270
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:55,096
I was sweating bullets.

1271
00:59:58,558 --> 00:59:59,767
With a four...

1272
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:01,727
Below that...

1273
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:05,273
I was given paper and a pen
and told to solve 300 questions.

1274
01:00:05,356 --> 01:00:06,357
I thought, "Easy."

1275
01:00:06,441 --> 01:00:08,234
That's 70... And then 60...

1276
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:10,069
The only thing that came to mind

1277
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:12,447
was that I should solve the problems
while I'm still sharp.

Solving them was one thing,

1280
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,745
but cross-checking mattered more.

1281
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:22,831
Hyun-jun and I solved the questions
as quickly as possible...

1282
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:25,460
I need help with number 156.

1283
01:00:26,461 --> 01:00:27,711
- Number 156?
- Yes.

1284

What's 19 squared?

1285
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:36,011
It's 361.

1286
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:38,180

I'm not sure if I got that right.

Guys, I've finished the questions
150 through 200.

1298
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:02,973
- Okay.
- You're super fast.

1299
01:02:03,057 --> 01:02:04,099
Give it to me.

1300
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:05,226
I'll get to it later.

1301
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:06,768
- I'll go from number 201.
- Okay.

1302
01:02:07,353 --> 01:02:09,271
Could you solve number nine, Hyun-bin?

1303
01:02:09,355 --> 01:02:10,523
Help me out with number nine.

1304
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:11,982
- I just need help with that.
- Okay.

1305
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:14,694
I'll let you know after solving it.

1306
01:02:24,495 --> 01:02:25,996
Hyun-min.

1307
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:28,207
Number 9 is 199.

1308
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:29,875
Number 9 is 199.

1309

- Sure.

- Please solve numbers 70 and 80.
- Number 80?

1313
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:43,639
- Got it.
- Yes, that one.

1314
01:02:43,723 --> 01:02:45,516
- The binary and the quinary systems.
- Tell me the numbers.

1315
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,059
They're 70, 80, and 82.

1316
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:48,852
- So 82? Got it.
- It's 70, 80, and 82.

1317
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:52,856
Can you tell me what a ternary system is?

1318
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:54,942
The ternary system? Is it number 156?

1319
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:56,318
No, that one. Number 242.

1320

305 IN TERNARY NUMBER

1322
01:02:59,238 --> 01:03:01,532
Keep dividing up the number by three.

1323
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:03,784
- That makes it 1, 0.
- Right.

1324
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:05,369
Then, you write these backward.

1325
01:03:05,453 --> 01:03:07,622
We'd get 102022.

1326
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:09,164
- Right.
- That's the ternary system.

1327
01:03:09,707 --> 01:03:12,126
Dong-kyu contributed the most.

1328
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:16,547

We could be the first to finish.

1364
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:45,154
Put it here.

1365
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:47,030
- These are 291 to--
- Get them in order.

1366
01:05:47,573 --> 01:05:48,866
I don't have time. Sorry.

1367
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:52,119
How far down are you?

1368
01:05:52,328 --> 01:05:53,412
- What?
- What number are you on now?

1369
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:54,664
You told me to start with number 261.

1370
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:56,457
- I just got started.
- You did? In that case,

1371
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,500
- I could--
- Start from the back.

1372
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:59,621
I'm done. I'll take it from 270.

1373
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,044
- Cover 261 to 269.
- No.

1374
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,505
Start from 290.

1375
01:06:02,922 --> 01:06:04,674
I did already.

1376
01:06:04,757 --> 01:06:05,883
- Already?
- Yes.

1377
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:07,677
I'm all done.
It's just you and Do-hyun now.

1378
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,720
- So I should do up to 269?
- That's right.

1379
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:11,013
Gosh, he's really quick.

1380
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:13,933
TEAM POSTECH

1381
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:15,058
How far down are you?

1382
01:06:15,142 --> 01:06:16,560
My share's done. I'm working on the rest.

1383
01:06:16,644 --> 01:06:17,770
- You finished all 90 of them?
- Yes.

1384
01:06:17,854 --> 01:06:19,188
- Oh, my.
- You're super fast.

1385
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:21,524
You're so fast.

1386
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:22,942
Gosh, that's unbelievable.

1387
01:06:26,737 --> 01:06:28,989
TEAM SNU'S DO-HYUN PASSES ON
THE ANSWERS FOR QUESTIONS 231-260

1388
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:31,325
What should I solve next?

1389
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,202
I'm working on this one now.

1390
01:06:33,285 --> 01:06:35,245
You can take it from number 267.

1391
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:36,372
- Number 267?
- Yes.

1392
01:06:36,455 --> 01:06:37,581
I'll solve up to number 266.

1393
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:39,583
I'm sorry I'm slow.

1394
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:43,379
Where are the answers
to questions from 120 to 150?

1395
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:45,047
What? It's over there.

1396
01:06:46,674 --> 01:06:48,676
I'm almost down to number 240.

1397
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:55,850
I've finished my share.

1398
01:06:55,933 --> 01:06:57,727
Then let's take ten more each.

1399
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:59,812
- You'll cover numbers 251 to 260.
- Got it.

1400
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:02,022
You'll then take numbers 261 to 270.

1401
01:07:03,273 --> 01:07:04,567
When it's done, I'll...

1402
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:06,652
These are for numbers 267, 268, and 269.

1403
01:07:06,736 --> 01:07:08,445
Numbers 267, 268, and 269?
We're done, then.

1404
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:09,530
We are, right?

1405
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:12,324
- I think we're all set.
- We are.

1406
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:18,288
As long as we made no mistakes...

1407
01:07:27,006 --> 01:07:28,131
Please let it be over in one go.

1408
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:30,133
Shall we pray? Shall we?

1409
01:07:32,845 --> 01:07:34,805
- I'll call you when it's over.
- Okay.

1410
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,017
Hyun-min has 20 more to input.

1411
01:07:40,436 --> 01:07:41,520
We're good now.

1412
01:07:56,786 --> 01:07:57,996
- Did you type all these in?
- Yes.

1413
01:07:58,704 --> 01:07:59,789
There are three left.

1414
01:07:59,998 --> 01:08:01,415
- Okay. Bring them over when you're done.
- Sure.

1415
01:08:01,499 --> 01:08:03,709
- He's has three left.
- I'm doing the back page.

1416
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:05,878
Three? Three more?

1417
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,306
It's done.

1418
01:08:17,765 --> 01:08:19,851
Team SNU submitted their answers.

1419
01:08:20,685 --> 01:08:21,894
...submitted their answers.

1420
01:08:24,522 --> 01:08:27,692
I thought, "It might end really soon.
This is bad for us."

1421
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,197
Team SNU submitted their answers.

1422
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,156
Let's go!

1423
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:37,451
He's taking his time.

1424
01:08:38,036 --> 01:08:39,662
Team SNU's number of wrong answers...

1425
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:44,166
Team SNU's number of wrong answers...

1426
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:51,549
is...

1427
01:08:55,887 --> 01:08:57,847
ELITE LEAGUE

1428
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:01,726
- Hurry up. We don't have time.
- Hurry up. Hurry!

1429
01:09:01,809 --> 01:09:04,311
- Round two has come to a close.
- Darn it.

1430
01:09:04,395 --> 01:09:05,479
That's just crazy.

1431
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:07,732
I think something went wrong.

1432
01:09:07,815 --> 01:09:09,149
- It's 403, 400...
- No.

1433
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:10,651
It's time to show them what we've got.

1434
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:11,944
I'm amazing. Trust me?

1435
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:13,195
We must survive.

1436
01:09:13,278 --> 01:09:14,154
We aren't going home today.

1437
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,990
They just lit a fire under me.
I want to win now.

1438
01:09:16,115 --> 01:09:17,116
We're done for.

1439
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:18,158
The pressure is too much.

1440
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:19,159
I'm in a real tizzy.

1441
01:09:19,243 --> 01:09:20,661
This is tough. No, please...

1442
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:25,017
