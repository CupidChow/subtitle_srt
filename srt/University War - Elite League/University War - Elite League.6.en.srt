ELITE LEAGUE

2
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,693
- Are you confident we'll win?
- Of course.

3
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,695
We have nothing to worry about.
We're going to win.

4
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:28,946
- Are you worried?
- I'm not.

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,322
I'm just trying to psych ourselves up.

6
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:34,410
- You mean, mentally prepare ourselves?
- Yes. We have to be prepared.

7
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,453
I'm mentally prepared to win.

8
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,247
I just felt really bad about it.

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,668
The match was as good as lost
the moment I lifted my foot.

10
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,421
MAIN MATCH
SILENT HUMAN CHESS

11
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,673
Team Yonsei and KU's third player,

12
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,550
PLAYER 3: LEE JI-SOO, BISHOP
please make your move.

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,559
- I only took two steps.
- I see.

14
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,978
And that was it for us.

15
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,608
It's not going to be an easy match.

16
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,359
But if we were to lose,

17
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:10,571
I wouldn't be able to face my teammates.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,323
So losing is not an option at the moment.

19
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:14,951
Korea University!

20
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,786
- For the nation!
- For the nation!

21
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:21,040
TEAM HARVARD'S BASE CAMP

22
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,043
What was that about?

23
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,005
Girls in male-dominated departments
need a good pair of lungs.

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,174
People with class
don't shout at the top of their lungs.

25
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,801
That's so corny.

26
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,721
I think Ji-soo felt bad about the match.

27
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:38,516
But we're going to win the Deathmatch,

28
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,143
so there's no need for her
to feel that way.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,270
To be honest, I'm not worried.

30
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,606
My sole focus is winning,

31
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,109
and I'm sure we have what it takes
to win the Deathmatch today.

32
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,737
Team Yonsei and Team KU,

33
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,573
please gather at the Main Hall
for the Deathmatch.

34
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,909
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP
It's about to start.

35
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:59,704
Let the battle
between Team Yonsei and Team KU start.

36
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,122
This is a match
I've always wanted to watch.

37
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,300
Today's Deathmatch

38
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,594
is Match and Mix.

39
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,512
MATCH AND MIX

40
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,180
...is Match and Mix.

41
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,181
- What?
- M and M?

42
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,141
- Are we matching things?
- It's M and M.

43
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,396
In Match and Mix,
numbers will be placed on sliding tiles.

44
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,649
The team that finds
the most matching pairs of numbers wins.

45
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,945
Among the 9 slots on the board,
1 slot will remain empty.

46
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:35,781
The other eight slots
will each be filled with tiles.

47
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,577
The board will have
20 pairs of numbered chips,

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,453
ranging from 1 through 20.

49
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,039
20 PAIRS OF NUMBERED CHIPS
RANGING FROM 1 TO 20

50
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,498
Before the match begins,

51
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:48,210
the players will be given time
to memorize where all the chips are.

52
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,756
Starting with the first tile,
each tile will be shown for ten seconds.

53
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:56,468
When the game begins,

54
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:01,390
the first player will have 10 seconds
to choose 2 chips of the same number.

55
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:05,477
If the pair matches,
one point will be awarded,

56
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,939
and the player will receive another turn.

57
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:12,234
If the pair does not match,
the opponent will take their turn.

58
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:13,986
So it's a memory game.

59
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:19,825
After each turn,
contestants must move a tile.

60
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,662
After each turn,
contestants must move a tile.

61
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:29,585
However, returning a tile
to its original position is forbidden.

62
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,713
So they have to match the chips
and then mix the tiles.

63
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:38,510
The team that earns 11 points first wins.

64
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,305
The game will consist of three rounds.

65
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,766
The first two rounds
will be played two-on-two.

66
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,726
And the third round
will be played one-on-one.

67
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,396
Those who play in the first round
may not compete again in the second round.

68
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,233
- The third round sounds important.
- It should be their best player.

69
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,987
This third round is going to be brutal.

70
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,865
Both teams,
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

71
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,742
We have a decent shot at this.

72
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:04,662
Our chances of winning are really good.

73
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,082
This isn't a strategy game.
We just have to use our memory.

74
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,293
I agree. Our best tactic
may be to use plain old memorization.

75
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,796
I'm not sure if I can,
but I plan on memorizing it all.

76
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,922
- All 40 of them?
- Yes.

77
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,882
If 2 players memorize all 40 chips,

78
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,010
and pick matching pairs
while consulting each other,

79
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,512
we could win the round in one go.

80
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,766
It'll be challenging
to memorize all the chips.

81
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,977
- We should divide them up.
- We should.

82
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,728
One, two, three.

83
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:33,858
We don't plan on having each player
memorize all 40 chips.

84
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,401
Instead, we'll take turns
memorizing tiles that are on display,

85
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,654
so each player would be familiar
with half of the board.

86
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:40,531
If we get to go first,

87
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,075
we could win the round
on our first attempt.

88
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:48,164
This isn't a difficult game,
so I'm not nervous at all.

89
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,083
This is difficult.

90
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,252
- It's hard.
- It's harder than I thought.

91
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,172
If we find this difficult,
Team KU will find it difficult too.

92
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,841
Your time is up.

93
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,844
- Three, two, one. Let's go!
- Let's go!

94
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,304
Let's do this.

95
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,031
If we win the Deathmatch,

96
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,700
we can continue
to prove how capable we are,

97
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,410
so we'll do our best to ride the storm.

98
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,164
We have absolutely no choice but to win.

99
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,667
Having Team KU as the opponent

100
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:37,671
only put more pressure
on the fact that we needed to win.

101
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:42,093
Objectively speaking,
I think our team is much stronger,

102
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,594
so I'm not that worried.

103
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:50,726
Since this is a memory game,
I think Team Yonsei will win.

104
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,519
Should we make a bet?

105
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,521
Let's make a wager on who will win.

106
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:55,606
I'll bet on Team Yonsei.

107
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,650
- I'll bet on KU.
- Hyun-bin and Hyun-min chose KU.

108
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,401
I think Team Yonsei will do well.

109
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:01,946
It's all for fun anyway.

110
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,657
TEAM YONSEI: HYUN-SEOK, DO-HYUN
TEAM KU: HYUN-MIN, HYUN-BIN

111
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,121
Both teams, please select two players
who will compete in the first round.

112
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,791
Team KU, please announce your players.

113
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,252
The players who will compete
in the first round...

114
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,882
are Lee Dong-kyu and Kim Jung-min.

115
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:29,349
Team Yonsei, please announce
your players for the first round.

116
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,850
The players for the first round...

117
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,480
are Cho Hyun-jun and Park Na-yoon.

118
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,942
We wanted to secure
a win for the first round,

119
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:42,862
which is why Hyun-jun and I went first.

120
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:48,534
I was surprised they put
their two best players in the first round,

121
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,245
but I'll let the results
speak for themselves.

122
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:53,455
We can't avoid them forever.

123
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,837
We will now begin
the first round of Match and Mix.

124
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,181
Good luck, guys.

125
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:14,601
Before we begin the match,
we'll toss the dice to see who goes first.

126
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,063
An odd number
will mean Team KU goes first,

127
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,232
and an even number
will mean Team Yonsei goes first.

128
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,861
The dice landed on two, an even number.

129
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,988
That means Team Yonsei will go first.

130
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,323
TEAM YONSEI PLAYS FIRST

131
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,368
We will now reveal the first tile.

132
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:43,089
We will now reveal the second tile.

133
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,977
We will now reveal the third tile.

134
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,856
TILE 3, TILE 4, TILE 5

135
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,693
TILE 6, TILE 7, TILE 8

136
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,752
I don't remember any of the numbers.

137
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,463
All I remember is the first tile.

138
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,048
Team Yonsei will start off the game.

139
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:28,884
TEAM YONSEI: 0
TEAM KU: 0

140
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:30,970
May I go first?

141
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,432
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

142
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:39,895
Team Yonsei found a matching pair.

143
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,688
You may go again.

144
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,316
Go for the numbers you know.

145
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,776
TEAM YONSEI: 1
TEAM KU: 0

146
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,278
That is a match.

147
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,199
TEAM YONSEI: 2
TEAM KU: 0

148
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,411
Team Yonsei found a matching pair.

149
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:58,664
TEAM YONSEI: 3
TEAM KU: 0

150
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,336
That is a match.

151
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:04,920
TEAM YONSEI: 4
TEAM KU: 0

152
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:06,339
That is a match.

153
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,881
TEAM YONSEI: 5
TEAM KU: 0

154
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,800
- Let me go again.
- You may go again.

155
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,678
That is a match.

156
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:16,474
Team Yonsei would get a match
every time they turned the chips over.

157
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,766
TEAM YONSEI: 6
TEAM KU: 0

158
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,143
They're doing so well.

159
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,645
How are they this good?

160
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:27,485
Team Yonsei found a matching pair.

161
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,487
You may go again.

162
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:31,697
Do you know where the nine is?

163
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,407
TEAM YONSEI: 7
TEAM KU: 0

164
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:34,992
Do you know where the nine is?

165
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,038
That is a match.

166
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,249
TEAM YONSEI: 8
TEAM KU: 0

167
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:42,833
Do you know where the nine is?

168
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,598
Your ten seconds are up.

169
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,394
Team KU will now take their turn.

170
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,146
Since we got to go first,

171
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,067
our plan was to find
all the matching pairs in one go,

172
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,069
so I was disappointed when we didn't.

173
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,614
Please move a tile.

174
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:19,703
TEAM YONSEI, TEAM KU

175
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,623
Team KU will now take their turn.

176
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,961
I have to turn this game around.

177
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:34,469
Out of 18, 3, and 6,
the remaining pair is 3.

178
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,554
This one's three.
Do you know where the other one is?

179
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,180
- What?
- Do you know where it is?

180
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:40,433
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

181
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,268
Where's the other one?

182
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,479
- Well...
- This might be it.

183
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,647
- You're right.
- That is a match.

184
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,856
You're right.

185
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:49,817
Good job.

186
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,820
TEAM YONSEI: 8
TEAM KU: 1

187
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,948
That's 14. Where's the other one?

188
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,160
That's 14. Where's the other one?

189
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,748
Hurry up. You only have ten seconds.

190
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,042
- Fourteen...
- Your time is up.

191
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:11,213
Team Yonsei will now take their turn.

192
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:13,174
Please move a tile.

193
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,469
There were a few numbers
that were easier to remember.

194
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,846
For example,
3, 6, and 18 were in the same tiles.

195
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,264
I focused on those numbers,

196
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:23,643
but Team Yonsei got to go first
and matched all the easy pairs.

197
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,729
- I'll go first and find 14.
- Sure, go ahead.

198
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,275
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

199
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:38,115
That is a match.

200
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,035
TEAM YONSEI: 9
TEAM KU: 1

201
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,330
That is a match.

202
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,582
ROUND 1
TEAM YONSEI: 10, TEAM KU: 1

203
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:50,044
TEAM YONSEI WILL WIN ROUND 1
IF THEY GET 1 MORE POINT

204
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,004
Do you know where 13 or 16 is?

205
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,558
Team Yonsei found a matching pair.

206
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,938
The first round goes to Team Yonsei.

207
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:12,983
TEAM YONSEI WINS ROUND 1
CHO HYUN-JUN AND PARK NA-YOON

208
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,446
We may have miscalculated things.
We should've split them up.

209
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,031
Team KU didn't stand a chance.

210
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,450
Team Yonsei is doing great.

211
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,785
If the team that goes first
gets a lot of matches,

212
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,079
it puts the other team on edge.

213
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,082
We need to get
a lot of matches like they did.

214
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,043
I'll memorize the first ten.
You can take the rest.

215
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,754
We should've split you two up, right?

216
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,381
We went in too strong.

217
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,341
We'll win even if it goes to round three.

218
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:38,718
We can win this round.

219
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,261
- Of course.
- Let's do that.

220
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,054
Team KU is having a meltdown.

221
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,348
Let's take advantage of that.

222
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,726
Come on. Please...

223
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,398
We will now begin the second round.

224
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,733
MATCH AND MIX
ROUND 2

225
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:57,361
In the second round,
Team KU's Chae Seung-min and Lee Ji-soo

226
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:00,448
will compete with Team Yonsei's
Kim Ki-hong and Son Ju-hyung.

227
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,493
Team KU, who lost the first round,
will go first in the second round.

228
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:05,661
TEAM KU PLAYS FIRST

229
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,247
My team has the advantage of going first,

230
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,542
so I'll do everything I can
to win this round.

231
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:15,837
The first thought that came to mind
was that I needed to do well,

232
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,715
so I was under a lot of pressure.

233
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,844
We will now reveal the first tile.

234
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,647
We will now reveal the second tile.

235
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,987
TILE 3, TILE 4, TILE 5
We will now reveal the third tile.

236
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,116
TILE 6, TILE 7, TILE 8

237
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,662
All of the tiles have now been revealed.

238
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,083
Team KU will start off the game.

239
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,418
TEAM YONSEI: 0
TEAM KU: 0

240
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,170
- Do you want to go first?
- No, you go.

241
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,131
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

242
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,053
Team KU found a matching pair.

243
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,888
You may go again.

244
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,224
TEAM YONSEI: 0
TEAM KU: 1

245
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,728
- Good job.
- Way to go.

246
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,021
You may go again.

247
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,119
TEAM YONSEI: 0
TEAM KU: 2

248
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,604
TEAM YONSEI: 0
TEAM KU: 3

249
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,831
Team KU found a matching pair.

250
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,791
- Can I go?
- Sure.

251
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,050
You may go again.

252
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:44,594
Is it my turn?

253
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:46,285
TEAM YONSEI: 0
TEAM KU: 4

254
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,940
Where's the other 11? Is it here?

255
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,405
Your time is up.

256
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,365
Your time is up.

257
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,034
Please move a tile.

258
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,248
I thought we'd get it in one go,
but we didn't do as well as I'd hoped.

259
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,292
So that made me really nervous.

260
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:24,216
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

261
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,098
I knew it. I was about to pick that up.

262
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,933
- Why didn't you?
- Team Yonsei found a matching pair.

263
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,227
You may go again.

264
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:36,604
TEAM YONSEI: 1
TEAM KU: 4

265
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:39,064
- Do you know any other pairs?
- I think this is 18.

266
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,065
Hold on.

267
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,901
TEAM YONSEI: 2
TEAM KU: 4

268
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,861
- How about this one?
- Let's just flip it over.

269
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:45,905
It's 15.

270
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:47,948
It's 15.

271
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,199
Your time is up.

272
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:52,161
Team KU will now take their turn.

273
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,497
Please move a tile.

274
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,374
- Can I go?
- Sure.

275
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,377
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

276
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:11,013
Team KU found a matching pair.

277

TEAM YONSEI: 2
TEAM KU: 5

278
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,018
That's it.

279
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:18,688
- Nicely done.
- She's good.

280
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,564
Things are getting interesting.

281
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:22,107
That is a match.

282
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,193
You may go again.

283
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,195
TEAM YONSEI: 2
TEAM KU: 6

284
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,655
That's 10, and that's 7.

285
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,244
Team KU failed to find a matching pair.

286
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,205
- What number was that?
- It was one.

287
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,379
TEAM YONSEI: 3
TEAM KU: 6

288
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:44,964
- Team Yonsei found a matching pair.
- Where's one?

289
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,423
- There.
- This one?

290
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:47,591
You may go again.

291
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,721
Team Yonsei found a matching pair.

292
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:53,556
You may go again.

293
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:56,058
We still have a chance.

294
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,478
- Please win.
- They may still win this thing.

295
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:01,355
TEAM YONSEI: 4
TEAM KU: 6

296
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,612
That is not a match.

297
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,531
Please move a tile.

298
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,325
Is this four?

299
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:14,368
Yes.

300
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,542
- Get that one.
- Can I turn this over?

301
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,338
- What?
- That is not a match.

302
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:27,673
Is it the one below it?

303
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,175
You caught that, right?

304
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:33,136
- You get 4, and I'll get 18.
- Okay.

305
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,180
Please move a tile.

306
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,308
Team Yonsei will now take their turn.

307
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,853
Please find a matching pair of numbers.

308
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,189
TEAM YONSEI: 5
TEAM KU: 6

309
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:46,108
You may go again.

310
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,694
Where's 19?

311
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:52,031
Should I guess?

312
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,199
Where's 19?

313
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,038
That is not a match.

314
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,040
Please move a tile.

315
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,751
Team KU will now take their turn.

316
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:05,377
- Is this 19?
- Yes.

317
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,796
- Is this 19?
- Yes.

318
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:10,716
Okay.

319
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,677
Team KU found a matching pair.

320
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,595
You may go again.

321

TEAM YONSEI: 5
TEAM KU: 7

322
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:18,516
Where is four?

323
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:20,184
Is this four?

324
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:21,853
Is this four?

325
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,312
I think so.

326
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,692
- Oh, no.
- Is that 13?

327
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:30,611
- Oh, no.
- Is that 13?

328
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,321
Just turn one over.

329
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:35,574
It's hard to keep up.

330
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:37,618
- This one is ten.
- You're right.

331
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:39,787
It's really confusing
because the tiles keep moving.

332
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:42,164
I think they know where four is.

333
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,083
- I'll try to find four.
- Okay.

334
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:48,880
Team Yonsei, please step forward
and find a matching pair of numbers.

TEAM YONSEI: 6
TEAM KU: 7

336
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:52,884
That is a match.

337
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,886
- You may go again.
- What else do we have?

338
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,098
Let's pick one we haven't tried yet.
This one?

339
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,933
- Seventeen.
- Where's the other one?

340
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,019
This one?

341
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:04,854
- Seventeen.
- Where's the other one?

342
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,231
Please...

343
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,818
- Should I turn this over?
- Sure.

344
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:11,903
That's five.

345
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,946
That is not a match.

346
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,408
- That is not a match.
- Come on.

347
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,993
Please move a tile.

348
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:22,371
Team KU will now take their turn.

349
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,748
This was five, right?

350
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,041
Turn it over.

351
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:26,250
That isn't five.

352
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:29,503
LEE JI-SOO THINKS THE 10 IS A 5

353
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,463
- I want to see what this is.
- Go ahead.

354
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,967
This one's five.

355
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:37,095
This one's five.

356
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,304
This one's five.

357
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,265
Why'd you do that? Ask me first.

358
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:44,102
I'm so sorry.

359
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,439
- She shouldn't have done that.
- I'm so sorry.

360
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,525
There's no need to rush.
We can use all ten seconds.

361
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,785
Team Yonsei will now take their turn.

362
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,625
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

363
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:09,168
It's a tie.

364
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,223
TEAM YONSEI: 7
TEAM KU: 7

365
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,007
We weren't able to get
a lot of matches as we initially planned,

366
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:18,343
and I started to second-guess myself.

367
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,138
So it was very distressing.

368
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:26,351
- You may go again.
- I saw a three over here.

369
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,023
Three?

370
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,316
That is not a match.

371
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,401
This one's three, right?

372
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:36,320
That's 3, and this is 6.

373
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,905
- Should I turn this over?
- Sure.

374
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:40,950
Okay.

375
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:44,912
- Yes!
- That's it!

376
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:46,038
TEAM YONSEI: 7
TEAM KU: 8

377
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:48,540
Six should be somewhere in the middle.

378
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,418
Six should be somewhere in the middle.

379
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,545
I think this one is ten.

380
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,174
That is a match.

381
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,675
- That's it!
- Way to go!

382
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,094
TEAM YONSEI: 7
TEAM KU: 9

383
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,639
Team KU, you may go again.

384
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,891
The sixes were in the middle.

385
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:09,269
I think it's these two.

386
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,025
- They just need one more.
- Checkmate.

387
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:14,942
One more.

388
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,694
It's not over yet.

389
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:17,862
TEAM YONSEI: 7
TEAM KU: 10

390
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,071
We just need one more.

391
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:22,116
TEAM KU WILL WIN ROUND 2
IF THEY GET 1 MORE POINT

392
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,095
That is a match.

393
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,639
- That's it.
- That's what I'm talking about!

394
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,520
That is a match.

395
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,607
The second round goes to Team KU.

396
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,359
TEAM KU WINS ROUND 2
CHAE SEUNG-MIN AND LEE JI-SOO

397
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:01,113
TEAM YONSEI: 1, TEAM KU: 1

398
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:02,240
- We did our best.
- Sorry.

399
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,991
Who wants to keep playing?

400
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:05,243
You have to play.

401
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,785
- I'll play.
- You can do it, right?

402
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:09,205
- It's okay if you get it wrong.
- I know.

403
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:11,707
The other team
can't memorize everything anyway.

404
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:15,878
- Who should play next?
- You did well.

405
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:17,297
I think you should.

406
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,505
I think so too.

407
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,804
We will now begin
the third round of Match and Mix.

408
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,514
In the third round of Match and Mix,

409
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,267
a new set of rules will apply.

410
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:30,935
In this round,

411
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,938
a point will be awarded
for each successful match.

412
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,482
Once a match is made,
the player will move a tile,

413
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,109
and the turn will go to the opponent.

414
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:41,112
If a player fails to make a match,

415
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:43,739
the same rules will apply.

416
00:22:43,823 --> 00:22:45,532
CHANGE TURNS

417
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,660
In short, regardless of the outcome,

418
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,079
a player will only be given
one chance at each turn.

419
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:52,832
I was right. We take turns now.

420
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:56,002
Going first won't be
a big advantage anymore.

421
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:58,171
Just do what you've been doing,
and you'll win.

422
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,925
I just need to score points
and make fewer mistakes.

423
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:03,843
That's right.

424
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:06,220
That means the tiles
will move at least ten times.

425
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:07,680
THE TILES WILL MOVE MUCH MORE NOW

426
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:10,724
Players for the third round,
please step onto the stage.

427
00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:15,771
TEAM YONSEI'S PARK NA-YOON
VS TEAM KU'S CHAE SEUNG-MIN

428
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:20,442
The fate of Team KU now rests in my hands,

429
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:22,444
so I have to do my best and win.

430
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:26,032
I will defeat Team KU no matter what
and survive this Deathmatch.

431
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,458
We will now reveal the tiles.

432
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:52,141
Team Yonsei will go first.

433
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,476
Please find a matching pair of numbers.

434
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,795
TEAM YONSEI: 0
TEAM KU: 0

435
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,655
TEAM YONSEI: 1
TEAM KU: 0

436
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:08,115
Please move a tile.

437
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,536
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

438
00:24:20,753 --> 00:24:21,754
Good job.

439
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,006
Please move a tile.

440
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,469
TEAM YONSEI: 1
TEAM KU: 1

441
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:29,262
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

442
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:38,478
That is not a match.

443
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:40,356
The one above 18 is 10.

444
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,614
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

445
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:00,167
That is a match.

446
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,752
- That's it!
- Okay.

447
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,255
TEAM YONSEI: 1
TEAM KU: 2

448
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:05,589
Please move a tile.

449
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,053
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

450
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,063
It's the one on top.

451
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:23,523
It's the tile on the top.

452
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,026
She has to mind the time.

453
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,036
Your ten seconds are up.

454
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,746
TIME IS UP

455
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,124
Team KU will now take their turn.

456
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,168
I was a bit flustered,

457
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:44,753
but I was sure I could still win.

458
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:48,508
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

459
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,220
That is a match.

460
00:25:53,304 --> 00:25:54,514
TEAM YONSEI: 1
TEAM KU: 3

461
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:58,351
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

462
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,527
That is not a match.

463
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,905
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

464
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:18,204
He's really smart.

465
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:19,955
That's amazing.

466
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:22,791
We're winning. Let's not lose this streak.

467
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:26,045
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

468
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:27,755
TEAM YONSEI: 1
TEAM KU: 4

469
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,221
TEAM YONSEI: 2
TEAM KU: 4

470
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:36,514
That is a match.

471
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,140
Please move a tile.

472
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:42,311
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

473
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:47,400
- That's it!
- Yes!

474
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:48,692
That is a match.

475
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:49,985
TEAM YONSEI: 2
TEAM KU: 5

476
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:51,779
I feel like I'm going to cry.

477
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,614
I'm getting emotional too.

478
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:58,327
I didn't want our poster to get shredded,
so I was determined to win.

479
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:02,498
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

480
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,761
That is not a match.

481
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,432
That is not a match.

482
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:21,309
Thank goodness.

483
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,603
I think 13 is under 14.

484
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,521
- What?
- I think 13 is under 14.

485
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:29,358
PARK NA-YOON MISTOOK 14 FOR 13

486
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:32,736
She chose 13 and 14 earlier,
and I think she got them mixed up.

487
00:27:33,488 --> 00:27:35,406
Please move a tile.

488
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:38,618
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

489
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:48,210
This isn't looking good.

490
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:49,587
TEAM YONSEI: 2
TEAM KU: 6

491
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,843
I tried to memorize
the chips Na-yoon flipped over

492
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:58,137
because it could help me
when it was my turn.

493
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:19,950
Your ten seconds are up.
Team KU will now take their turn.

494
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:21,661
Please move a tile.

495
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:27,210
TEAM YONSEI: 2
TEAM KU: 7

496
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,918
- He's impressive.
- He has them all memorized.

497
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:31,128
He's really good.

498
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:33,922
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

499
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:49,438
Your time is up.

500
00:28:49,522 --> 00:28:51,273
Please move a tile.

501
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,235
If I turned a chip over
but had no clue where the pair was,

502
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:57,488
flipping over another one
would only give Seung-min an advantage.

503
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:02,243
So I just let the time run over
without revealing another chip.

504
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:03,452
SHE CHOSE NOT TO REVEAL CHIPS

505
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,503
That is a match.

506
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:19,635
She won't be able
to bounce back from this.

507
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:21,303
She let him get to her.

508
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,889
Please move a tile.

509
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,851
TEAM YONSEI: 2
TEAM KU: 8

510
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,479
Team Yonsei,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

511
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:45,953
Your ten seconds are up.

512
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:48,539
Please move a tile.

513
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:52,460
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

514
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:03,471
That is a match.

515
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:06,474
TEAM YONSEI: 2
TEAM KU: 9

516
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:07,933
That is a match.

517
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:10,561
TEAM YONSEI: 3
TEAM KU: 9

518
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:15,566
- That's it!
- That is a match.

519
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:16,900
He's...

520
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,860
- He's a genius.
- He's really good.

521
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:21,196
Team KU may be the strongest team here.

522
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:24,325
- We just haven't faced them yet.
- I disagree.

523
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:25,993
That is a match.

524
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,787
Please move a tile.

525
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,623
Team KU,
please find a matching pair of numbers.

526
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:32,750
TEAM KU WILL WIN ROUND 3
IF CHAE SEUNG-MIN GETS 1 MORE POINT

527
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,418
TEAM YONSEI: 4
TEAM KU: 10

528
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:45,012
TEAM KU'S CHAE SEUNG-MIN WINS ROUND 3

529
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:46,639
That's what I call a dramatic win!

530
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,983
That concludes
the third round of Match and Mix.

531
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:01,195
The third round goes to Team KU.

532
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:03,406
TEAM KU WINS THE DEATHMATCH, MATCH AND MIX

533
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,783
You made all the right choices!

534
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,452
I'm so overwhelmed.

535
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:10,246
Let's celebrate.

536
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,790
When it was over,
a wave of relief washed over me.

537
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:16,085
I spared no effort and gave it my all

538
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:19,463
since we were playing against Team Yonsei.

539
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:23,926
Good job.

540
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:28,765
It's okay. Good effort.

541
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:34,895
If we had lost to any other team,

542
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:37,732
I wouldn't have felt this bad.

543
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,234
I knew I could've done better,

544
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:42,361
so I felt horrible
for letting my team down.

545
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:45,698
MATCH AND MIX
FINAL RESULTS

546
00:31:45,782 --> 00:31:48,701
TEAM YONSEI: 1
TEAM KU: 2

547
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:51,788
The third team
to be eliminated from Elite League is

548
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,414
Team Yonsei.

549
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,542
It's over now.

550
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,295
That's it for us.

551
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:05,593
All our hard work has come to an end.

552
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,809
Just watching them
made my heart feel heavy.

553
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:16,228
I'd hate to see our poster get shredded.

554
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,231
Team Yonsei, please exit the grounds.

555
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:34,622
- Hello.
- Hello.

556
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:38,668
I had such wonderful teammates,
so I was sure we would win.

557
00:32:38,918 --> 00:32:42,922
I was also able to lead my team
when we were pushed to the limit.

558
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:44,423
...the other one will check.

559
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:46,216
I'd say we've had half the success.

560
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,218
There were times we won by a huge margin,

561
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:53,140
but at the end of the day,
we ended up in the Deathmatch and lost.

562
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:55,142
It's a shame
we didn't get to see it through.

563
00:32:56,477 --> 00:33:00,898
I was quite proud of myself
for being able to come this far.

564
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,486
- What was that?
- I told you I would win.

565
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,780
- I proved myself, didn't I?
- That was amazing.

566
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:13,577
It's been a long time
since I used my brain this much.

567
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:15,329
- That is correct.
- I realized

568
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:18,791
I was much more capable
than I had thought.

569
00:33:21,377 --> 00:33:23,128
This journey showed me

570
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:25,715
that there are
a lot of brilliant minds out there.

571
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:30,010
And as one of the contestants,
I gave it my best.

572
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:32,304
Let's go.

573
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:33,890
I'm so happy.

574
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:35,641
So I felt proud of myself.

575
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:41,647
I have no regrets about joining the show.

576
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:43,440
I hope you'll remember us fondly.

577
00:33:55,578 --> 00:33:57,621
Korea University for the nation!

578
00:33:59,707 --> 00:34:02,209
- Korea University for the world!
- Korea University for the world!

579
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:05,838
- It's all of you!
- I don't remember the rest!

580
00:34:06,463 --> 00:34:09,091
TEAM KU'S BASE CAMP

581
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,885
How does my hair look today?

582
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,220
I like it like that the best.

583
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:18,141
What about me?
Do I look better with my hair down?

584
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,196
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP
Seoul National University!

585
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,157
Now that I've come to my senses,
I'm getting nervous again.

586
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:35,743
I'm feeling great.

587
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,622
As long as you're feeling great,
that's all that matters.

588
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:42,792
TEAM HARVARD'S BASE CAMP

589
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:46,838
I want to submit
the answer first today, okay?

590
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:48,840
Even if you have the answer,
I want to go first.

591
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,591
No, I want to go first.

592
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,511
No, I'm going first today.

593
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:54,679
I'll stand right here.

594
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:56,806
That won't help
if you don't know the answer.

595
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,517
If I don't know the answer,
it would be pointless.

596
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,521
Today's Ace Selection
might be about number sequence.

597
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:05,898
- You mean finding patterns?
- Yes.

598
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,359
Today's main match
could be about mind games.

599
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,276
That's possible.

600
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,653
We might have to play mind games.

601
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:13,072
We don't have to worry
since we have a psychology major.

602
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:14,406
PARK HYUN-MIN
PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR

603
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,992
I'll try to see right through them.

604
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:17,910
We need to be able to read people.

605
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:19,370
The eyes give it away.

606
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:21,622
Janice has a lousy poker face.

607
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,833
She can't mask her emotions at all.

608
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:28,087
That might come up.

609
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,008
The Deathmatch and Ace Selection
have been quite similar.

610
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,218
Let's write the Deathmatches down.

611
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:37,137
- We're not doing that, so don't bother.
- We won't end up there.

612
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:40,224
- We're not doing that, so don't bother.
- We won't end up there.

613
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:41,684
"Don't bother"?

614
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:42,977
You're so confident.

615
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:49,608
This music stresses me out.

616
00:35:49,692 --> 00:35:51,736
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League.

617
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:54,113
I'm so nervous. This is insane!

618
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:57,700
We've done this so many times,
but I'm still nervous.

619
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:00,494
Today's Ace Selection...

620
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,497
is Track the Dice.

621
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,416
Is this about space perception?

622
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:07,167
- I think so.
- It is.

623
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,669
Let's do this.

624
00:36:08,753 --> 00:36:10,088
We can do this.

625
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,672
In Track the Dice,

626
00:36:11,756 --> 00:36:15,718
you will sum up the numbers
left on the track of the dice.

627
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:20,305
A different set of rules
will apply to today's Ace Selection.

628
00:36:20,723 --> 00:36:24,268
All contestants who answer correctly
may come outside to the Main Hall.

629
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:27,521
- So we can all go out?
- Yes. We can all go out this time.

630
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,232
It's going to be very different today.

631
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:32,944
ACE SELECTION, TRACK THE DICE
Here's your question.

632
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:35,195
THE OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE DICE ADD UP TO 7

633
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,907
RECORD THE NUMBER THAT TOUCHES THE GROUND

634
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,034
AND FIND THE SUM OF BOXES 1 THROUGH 4

635
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:01,055
Three, one, four, six...

636
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,974
- Two, five...
- I can't picture it.

637
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:08,228
Six, five...

638
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,571
The first person who got it right...

639
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:21,951
is Kyung Do-hyun from Team SNU.

640
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:23,661
1ST PLACE: KYUNG DO-HYUN
SNU, ECONOMICS

641
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:28,874
That's six...

642
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,005
I kept asking myself
what value I brought to my team,

643
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:36,841
but I was able to prove my worth
even among my peers at SNU.

644
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,926
That thought itself was very satisfying.

645
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:43,055
The second person who got it right
is Jung Hyun-bin from Team SNU.

646
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:44,807
Good job.

647

2ND PLACE: JUNG HYUN-BIN
SNU, PRE-MED

648
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,023

- The third person who got it right...

649
00:37:55,193 --> 00:37:56,527
is from Team SNU.

650
00:37:58,696 --> 00:38:00,364
- It's Park Hyun-min.

653
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:06,286
Six, two, five... Hold on.

654
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,873
SONG HYUN-SEOK IS THE ONLY ONE ON TEAM SNU
WHO HASN'T GOTTEN THE ANSWER

655
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:14,294
Thirteen...

656
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:31,645

657
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:36,650
NO ONE FROM TEAM HARVARD OR TEAM KU

658
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:39,403
The second person
who got it right is from Team SNU.

659
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:42,031
The third person
who got it right is from Team SNU.

660
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,202
It was super frustrating.

661
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,790
The situation wasn't bad.
It was devastating.

662
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,835
The fourth person
who got it right is from Team KU.

663
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:58,131

- So I kept getting a small number.
- The fifth person is from Team KU.

667
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,309
- It's Chae Seung-min.
- Team KU is doing great.

668
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:11,018
Koreans are bound to excel at this.

669
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:13,395
We solved puzzles like this
when we were young.

- Let me try.
- Go on.

673
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,823
I got it.

674
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:25,199
I got it.

675
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:32,957

Six, two, five...

680
00:39:47,305 --> 00:39:50,766
The seventh person who got it right
is Song Hyun-seok from Team SNU.

681
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,226
- I got confused at the end.
- Good job.

682
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,021

- You did great.

683

687
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:03,737
ONLY TWO CONTESTANTS REMAIN

688
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:05,531
LEE JI-SOO
KU, PHYSICS

689
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:07,449
SKY,
HARVARD, COMPUTER SCIENCE

690
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:09,535
The 11th person who got it right...

691
00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:17,001
is Sky from Team Harvard.

692
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:22,006
11TH PLACE: SKY
HARVARD, COMPUTER SCIENCE

693
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,800
It was embarrassing.

694
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:28,221
I felt like I let my teammates down,

695
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:31,557
so I felt really bad about that.

696
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:37,230
The 12th person who got it right
is Lee Ji-soo from Team KU.

697
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:41,359
12TH PLACE: LEE JI-SOO
KU, PHYSICS

698
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,657
That concludes the Ace Selection.

699
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:49,575
1ST: SNU, KYUNG DO-HYUN

700
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,035
4TH: KU, KIM JUNG-MIN
6TH: HARVARD, JANICE

701
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:52,745
In today's Ace Match,

702
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:58,376
all four members from each team

703
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:01,921
RELAY MATCH
will participate in Relay Match.

704
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,505
A relay?

705
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:06,884
A relay race?

706
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,678
RELAY MATCH
The match consists of three rounds.

707
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:11,431
The first 2 rounds will have 4 questions,

708
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:13,766
and the third round
will have three questions.

709
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:17,270
The winner of the Ace Selection
will choose their opponent.

710
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:21,399
The contestant who wins
will then choose their opponent

711
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:25,069
and will continue to do so
until they lose.

712
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:29,198
The category of questions
will change for each round.

713
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,201
After the three rounds are over,

714
00:41:32,285 --> 00:41:35,579
the team with the highest number of points

715
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:38,498
will receive a benefit
they can use in the next match.

716
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,502
So basically,
you keep playing until you lose.

717
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:44,922
And if the opponent chooses us, I'll play.

718
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,466
It's like playing rock, paper, scissors.

719
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:49,635
If you win, you keep playing.
If you lose, you get substituted.

720
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:53,055
RELAY MATCH
The first round of Relay Match

721
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:54,640
is Modified Times Table.

722
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:56,976
- "Modified Times Table"?
- What is that?

723
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:00,187
In Modified Times Table,

724
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:04,108
you will be asked to sum up
the sum and product of two given numbers.

725
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:06,319
That sounds easy.

726
00:42:06,986 --> 00:42:09,196
- It's a game of mental math.
- I like this game.

727
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,198
- It's not bad.
- I like our chances.

728
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:13,867
What if the numbers are 6 and 3?

729
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:15,202
- Is it 27?
- It is.

730
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:18,205
This is new.

731
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:21,792
The winner of the Ace Selection

732
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:25,963
must choose 1 out of the 8 contestants
to compete against.

733
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,048
TEAM SNU'S KYUNG DO-HYUN
WILL CHOOSE HIS OPPONENT

734
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:31,051
Here are the profiles of the contestants.

735
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:34,096
It's cool she studies computer science.

736
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,140
You should avoid math majors.

737
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,142
Also, we don't know
who is good on that team.

738
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:39,435
We need those points.

739
00:42:40,102 --> 00:42:41,521
Choose someone from Team KU.

740
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:44,398
I think Sky or Ji-soo is your best bet.

741
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:47,609
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun,

742
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:50,154
please decide who you'll play against.

743
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:57,203
I think he'll choose one of us.

744
00:42:58,204 --> 00:42:59,872
Bring it on.

745
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:05,294
I have made my decision.

746
00:43:09,465 --> 00:43:11,426
I'll play against

747
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:15,304
the queen of the Physics Department,

748
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:17,181
Lee Ji-soo.

749
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:24,272
No pressure.

750
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:30,111
Ji-soo was the last to join us
in the Main Hall today.

751
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:31,779
She may not be on her A game.

752
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:34,907
She's also the easiest contestant
to go up against.

753
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,035
Being named first can mean only one thing.

754
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:40,037
He thinks I'm an easy mark.

755
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:42,664
So I'm determined to put him in his place.

756
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:47,002
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun
and Team KU's Lee Ji-soo,

757
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:49,547
please step onto the stage for the match.

758
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:51,966
Let's go!

759
00:43:56,429 --> 00:44:01,183
TEAM KU'S LEE JI-SOO
VS TEAM SNU'S KYUNG DO-HYUN

760
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:15,156
We will now begin Modified Times Table,
the first round of Relay Match.

761
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:16,782
Here is your question.

762
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:26,875
That's a bit much.

763
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:45,478
I have the answer. It's 395.

764
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:48,814

769
00:45:05,414 --> 00:45:07,791
- Thank you.

770
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,251

TEAM KU'S LEE JI-SOO: LOSE
TEAM SNU'S KYUNG DO-HYUN: WIN

772
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:22,682
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun,
please name your next opponent.

773
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:27,811
Are you eyeing Team Harvard?

774
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:31,315
- Let's finish Team KU first.
- Any volunteers?

775
00:45:36,737 --> 00:45:39,114
JANICE, PRESIDENT OF HKA
RAY, ENGINEER OF FUTURE WASHING MACHINES

776
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:40,949
DAVID, MATH GENIUS, VIOLINIST
SKY, CODING GENIUS

777
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:47,039
The next person I'll play against

778
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,086
is Sky from Team Harvard, a coding genius.

779
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,381
You named Team Harvard's Sky
as your next opponent.

780
00:46:00,094 --> 00:46:02,971
TEAM HARVARD'S SKY
VS TEAM SNU'S KYUNG DO-HYUN

I have the answer. It's 311.

786
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,299
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun
answered correctly.

787
00:46:40,468 --> 00:46:43,763
TEAM HARVARD'S SKY: LOSE
TEAM SNU'S KYUNG DO-HYUN: 2 WINS

788
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:45,013
He's defeating them 1 by 1.

789
00:46:45,097 --> 00:46:48,559
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun,
please name your next opponent.

790
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:52,313
...please name your next opponent.

791
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:58,319
He's considering Team Harvard.

792
00:46:59,487 --> 00:47:00,696
Again?

793
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:02,864
He must be so stressed right now.

794
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:16,671
The next contestant I'll play against

795
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:20,090
is David, a math genius and violinist.

796
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:24,595
You chose Team Harvard's David
as your next opponent.

797
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:26,723
TEAM HARVARD'S DAVID
VS TEAM SNU'S KYUNG DO-HYUN

798
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:29,016
I was contemplating who to choose next

799
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:32,936
but then decided to go
from the bottom up in today's ranks.

800
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:37,066
That's why I chose Sky and then David.

801
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:43,740
I felt very confident doing mental math.

802
00:47:43,823 --> 00:47:46,534
I can picture the numbers
while I run calculations.

803
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:48,869
RELAY MATCH
MODIFIED TIMES TABLE

804
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:50,413
Here is your question.

805
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:02,299
What in the world?

806
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:04,844
- That probably caught them off guard.
- I know.

807
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:23,987
I have the answer.

808
00:48:25,782 --> 00:48:27,450
It's 649.

809
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:29,452
TEAM SNU'S KYUNG DO-HYUN
ANSWER: 649

810
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,878
That is correct.

811
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:41,756
ANSWER REVEALED

812
00:48:48,137 --> 00:48:50,013
Team Harvard's David...

813
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:51,682
He's super fast.

814
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:54,059
- That was fast.
- Team Harvard's David...

815
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:55,185
That was incredible.

816
00:48:56,479 --> 00:49:00,274
TEAM HARVARD'S DAVID: LOSE
TEAM SNU'S KYUNG DO-HYUN: 3 WINS

817
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,360
I didn't stand a chance.

818
00:49:03,444 --> 00:49:05,946
I didn't even start
calculating the second line.

819
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:13,496
The moment I saw the question,
I knew how to solve it quickly.

820
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:18,626
A diamond B
is the sum of A times B and A plus B.

821
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:22,588
But all you have to do is add one
to both numbers and multiply it.

822
00:49:22,672 --> 00:49:24,548
Then subtract one from it.

823
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:26,425
When a question was revealed,

824
00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:30,095
I didn't try to calculate
all the different formulas.

825
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:32,890
I just added one to both numbers,

826
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:34,809
multiplied it, then subtracted one.

827
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:36,101
That was my strategy.

828
00:49:36,185 --> 00:49:37,269
DO-HYUN'S SOLUTION

829
00:49:37,854 --> 00:49:40,940
Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun,
please name your next opponent.

830
00:49:41,524 --> 00:49:44,485
The next contestant I'll play against

831
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:50,574
is Kim Jung-min, a puzzle enthusiast.

832
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,869
I'll put a stop to his winning streak.

833
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:55,329
You named Team KU's Kim Jung-min.

834
00:49:56,539 --> 00:49:57,540
Let's do this.

835
00:49:57,623 --> 00:50:00,209
TEAM KU'S KIM JUNG-MIN
VS TEAM SNU'S KYUNG DO-HYUN

836
00:50:00,877 --> 00:50:04,296
Do-hyun named me as his opponent,
but I didn't think I would lose.

837
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:06,716
Do-hyun can beat him.

838
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:08,759
Everyone on our team is brilliant.

839
00:50:09,844 --> 00:50:11,094
Please let him win.

840
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:12,304
Please let him win.

841
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,056
Let's get him.

842
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:21,104
Here is your question.

843
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:57,391
The answer is 587.

844
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,560
Your answer is 587.

845
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:01,938
TEAM KU'S KIM JUNG-MIN
ANSWER: 587

846
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:12,072
That is correct.

847
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:14,784

849
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:25,210
TEAM KU'S KIM JUNG-MIN: WIN
TEAM SNU'S KYUNG DO-HYUN: LOSE

850
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:27,005
He did break the winning streak.

851
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:32,134
- Great job.
- Team SNU's Kyung Do-hyun,

852
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:33,886
- You did great.
- please return to your seat.

853
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,805
- I got us three points.
- Have a seat.

854
00:51:38,016 --> 00:51:42,854
I knew an easy way to solve the problem,
but I think Jung-min did too.

855
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:46,858
I modified the expression
to make the calculation easier.

856
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:51,195
I knew we had to challenge Do-hyun
and stop his winning streak,

857
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,405
so I was glad that he chose me.

858
00:51:53,865 --> 00:51:55,533
RELAY MATCH
END OF ROUND 1

859
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:57,451
TEAM KU'S KIM JUNG-MIN SURVIVES WITH 1 WIN

860
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,329
TEAM SNU: 3, TEAM KU: 1
TEAM HARVARD: 0

861
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:01,914
Getting five points
increases our shot at winning.

862
00:52:01,998 --> 00:52:03,123
Of course.

863
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:05,209
If you guys can win...

864
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,503
- Win 2 guys?
- Yes, score 2 points.

865
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:08,921
They're changing categories.

866
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,590
We will now change categories.

867
00:52:11,674 --> 00:52:13,217
CATEGORY OF QUESTIONS
ARE DIFFERENT FOR EACH ROUND

868
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,846
The second round
of Relay Match is Count the Blocks.

869
00:52:19,557 --> 00:52:20,892
Sounds good.

870
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,643
In Count the Blocks,

871
00:52:22,727 --> 00:52:26,397
you'll be asked to state
how many blocks there are in the picture.

872
00:52:26,939 --> 00:52:27,857
TOTAL: 13 BLOCKS

873
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,110
The game focuses
on space perception and memorization.

874
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:34,072
I was happy we were playing this game.

875
00:52:34,864 --> 00:52:36,866
As the winner of the last game,

876
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:39,159
Team KU's Kim Jung-min
will now name his opponent.

877
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:45,499
Choose one of us.

878
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:46,834
Let's have some fun.

879
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:53,298
The opponent I'll play against...

880
00:52:53,925 --> 00:52:55,843
HYUN-SEOK GOT INTO SNU AND KAIST
HYUN-BIN GOT A PERFECT SCORE ON THE CSAT

881
00:52:55,927 --> 00:52:57,136
HYUN-MIN GOT INTO SNU
AFTER STUDYING FOR 1 YEAR

882
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:58,804
JANICE, PRESIDENT OF HKA

883
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:00,639
RAY, ENGINEER OF FUTURE WASHING MACHINES

884
00:53:01,057 --> 00:53:03,017
The opponent I'll play against

885
00:53:03,308 --> 00:53:06,812
is Ray, an engineer
of future washing machines.

886
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:11,483
You chose Team Harvard's Ray.

887
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:14,779
I'm really competitive.

888
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:18,824
So I wanted to win
and make him regret choosing me.

889
00:53:19,742 --> 00:53:21,493
Here is your question.

890
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:22,494
ROUND 2: COUNT THE BLOCKS

891
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:39,386
The answer's 65, right?

892
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:41,973
- Isn't it 64?
- Move the 3 blocks on top to the middle.

893
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:43,432
You get a multiple of five.

894
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:44,600
Isn't it 70?

895
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,560
The answer is 65.

896
00:53:46,978 --> 00:53:48,771
- The answer is 65.
- Your answer is 65.

897
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:57,029
That is correct.

898
00:53:57,113 --> 00:53:59,573
Team KU's Kim Jung-min answered correctly.

899
00:53:59,657 --> 00:54:03,828
Team Harvard's Ray,
please return to your seat.

900
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:06,705
65 BLOCKS

901
00:54:07,456 --> 00:54:10,417
Team KU's Kim Jung-min,
please name your next opponent.

902
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:15,631
My next opponent...

903
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:23,388
My next opponent managed
to get into SNU after studying for a year.

904
00:54:23,472 --> 00:54:24,974
It's Park Hyun-min.

905
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:27,143
You chose Team SNU's Park Hyun-min.

906
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:29,937
TEAM SNU'S PARK HYUN-MIN
VS TEAM KU'S KIM JUNG-MIN

907
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:31,981
Is that his only hashtag?

908
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:33,691
He has another one.

909
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:36,152
- He's a straight A-plus student.
- I see.

910
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:39,321
GOT INTO SNU AFTER STUDYING FOR 1 YEAR
STRAIGHT A-PLUS STUDENT

911
00:54:39,697 --> 00:54:40,948
Here is your question.

912
00:54:41,032 --> 00:54:42,200
RELAY MATCH
COUNT THE BLOCKS

913
00:55:14,899 --> 00:55:16,942
- The answer is 94.
- Your answer is 94.

914
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:23,074
That is incorrect.

915
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:24,950
The answer is 62.

916
00:55:25,034 --> 00:55:26,953
Team KU's Kim Jung-min's answer is 62.

917
00:55:27,036 --> 00:55:28,162
TEAM KU'S KIM JUNG-MIN
ANSWER: 62

918
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:36,587
That is correct.

919
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,547
62 BLOCKS

920
00:55:38,631 --> 00:55:40,049
ANSWER REVEALED

921
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:43,136
62 BLOCKS

922
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:45,012
TEAM SNU'S PARK HYUN-MIN: LOSE
TEAM KU'S KIM JUNG-MIN: 3 WINS

923
00:55:45,096 --> 00:55:49,016
Team SNU's Park Hyun-min,
please return to your seat.

924
00:55:51,227 --> 00:55:52,270
Don't worry.

925
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:59,235
I was never selected as my team's Ace,
so it was my first time in the spotlight.

926
00:55:59,319 --> 00:56:02,905
I also had a fear of individual matches,
but that started to fade away.

927
00:56:03,323 --> 00:56:05,449
The protruding shape in front
had the same number of blocks.

928
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:07,785
I just needed to rearrange it
to make it look the same.

929
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:11,455
After that,
all I had to do was add 11 and 35.

930
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:15,293
I was really disappointed.

931
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:19,463
Watching Team KU catch up to us
made me realize how good they were.

932
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,512
That was two questions, right?

933
00:56:26,595 --> 00:56:27,930
Yes, there's two more left.

934
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:30,183
Jung-min seems to be good at this.

935
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:31,558
I know. I'm glad.

936
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:35,896
Team KU's Kim Jung-min,
please name your next opponent.

937
00:56:36,356 --> 00:56:38,899
My next opponent is Janice.

938
00:56:38,983 --> 00:56:42,569
You chose Team Harvard's Janice.

939
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:44,238
I wanted to go up against Team Harvard.

940
00:56:45,198 --> 00:56:46,699
Here is your question.

941
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:47,992
RELAY MATCH
COUNT THE BLOCKS

942
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:21,359
The answer is 100.

943
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,402
Your answer is 100.

944
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:27,073
TEAM KU'S KIM JUNG-MIN
ANSWER: 100

945
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:30,284
That is correct.
Team KU's Kim Jung-min answered correctly.

946
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:32,578
- Team Harvard's Janice...
- How did he get it so fast?

947
00:57:32,661 --> 00:57:35,706
- I can't figure this out.
- I only counted up to 80.

948
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:37,041
Did you guys see that?

949
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:39,126
- He's really good.
- Did you see how good he is?

950
00:57:42,338 --> 00:57:43,381
He's good.

951
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:44,924
He really is.

952
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:49,803
EVERYONE FROM TEAM HARVARD
HAS BEEN ELIMINATED

953
00:57:50,054 --> 00:57:51,513
I got all the answers wrong so far.

954
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:52,848
I don't buy that.

955
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:54,308
You should pick me.

956
00:57:54,392 --> 00:57:57,561
Team KU's Kim Jung-min,
please name your next opponent.

957
00:57:58,938 --> 00:58:00,147
My next opponent...

958
00:58:03,192 --> 00:58:07,113
My next opponent is Jung Hyun-bin,
who received a perfect score on the CSAT.

959
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:10,616
You named Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

960
00:58:12,243 --> 00:58:13,286
Crush him, Hyun-bin.

961
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:16,247
TEAM SNU'S JUNG HYUN-BIN
VS TEAM KU'S KIM JUNG-MIN

962
00:58:17,123 --> 00:58:18,916
He got a perfect score on the CSAT.

963
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:22,711
I chose Hyun-bin
because I couldn't avoid him any longer,

964
00:58:22,795 --> 00:58:27,133
and a part of me also wanted to beat
the guy with the perfect CSAT score.

965
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,054
Here is your question.

966
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:33,222
THE LAST QUESTION OF ROUND 2

967
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:04,044
- The answer is 58.
- Your answer is 58.

968
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:15,848
That is correct.

969
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:21,395
TEAM SNU'S JUNG HYUN-BIN: WIN
TEAM KU'S KIM JUNG-MIN: LOSE

970
00:59:22,313 --> 00:59:24,231
I don't know where I went wrong.

971
00:59:24,315 --> 00:59:26,192
- Maybe you missed something.
- Maybe.

972
00:59:26,442 --> 00:59:28,944
Why did you knock everyone
from Team Harvard out?

973
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:30,988
- I wanted to face them.
- They got it wrong.

974
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,701
RELAY MATCH
END OF ROUND 2

975
00:59:35,784 --> 00:59:37,703
TEAM SNU'S JUNG HYUN-BIN
SURVIVES WITH 1 WIN

976
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:40,664
TEAM SNU: 4, TEAM KU: 4
TEAM HARVARD: 0

977
00:59:41,082 --> 00:59:42,833
We will now change categories.

978
00:59:44,377 --> 00:59:45,920
The third round of Relay Match...

979
00:59:48,256 --> 00:59:50,383
is Endless Chain of Numbers.

980
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,510
"Endless"?

981
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:54,803
"Endless Chain of Numbers"?

982
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:56,556
Is it like a word chain with numbers?

983
00:59:56,638 --> 00:59:57,848
Hyun-bin is good at this.

984
00:59:57,932 --> 00:59:59,517
If it's endless, who wins?

985
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:02,395
Someone has to win.

986
01:00:02,937 --> 01:00:05,189
- Dong-kyu, we're tied 4 to 4.
- It's a tie.

987
01:00:05,273 --> 01:00:06,774
We can win if he doesn't get you both.

988
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:12,113
In Endless Chain of Numbers,

989
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:18,202
the player who fills in the three blanks
to complete the number sequence wins.

990
01:00:18,286 --> 01:00:20,204
THERE ARE THREE SEQUENCES
THAT FOLLOW DIFFERENT PATTERNS

991
01:00:20,288 --> 01:00:23,124
- It's recognizing patterns in sequences.
- That's right.

992
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:24,792
Your team has a math major.

993
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:28,087
LEE DONG-KYU
KU, MATHEMATICS

994
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,381
As the winner of the last game,

995
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:32,841
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin
will now name his opponent.

996
01:00:35,261 --> 01:00:37,054
My next opponent

997
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,682
is Team KU's Lee Dong-kyu,
a mathematics major.

998
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:44,937
You named Team KU's Lee Dong-kyu,
a mathematics major.

999
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:50,943
What is he doing?

1000
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,199
What is he doing?

1001
01:00:56,324 --> 01:00:58,618
The energy that you bring
can determine the outcome,

1002
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:02,663
so the mindset I had at the time was
to take him down a peg or two.

1003
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:05,707
I think Dong-kyu will do well.

1004
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:08,461
This is his moment to shine
and show us what he's good at.

1005
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:13,382
TEAM KU'S LEE DONG-KYU
VS TEAM SNU'S JUNG HYUN-BIN

1006
01:01:13,466 --> 01:01:16,511
Endless Chain of Numbers,
the third round of Relay Match.

1007
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:18,720
Here is your question.

1008
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:42,953
I get the other two,
but not the middle one.

1009
01:01:44,664 --> 01:01:47,625
I don't understand
the sequence that's in the middle.

1010
01:01:48,459 --> 01:01:51,045
I have the bottom two figured out,
but not the one on top.

1011
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:52,771
The difference in the bottom row

1012
01:01:52,854 --> 01:01:55,550
form a geometric sequence
whose common ratio is two.

1013
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,135
So the blanks are 89 and 152.

1014
01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:01,096
But I'm not sure about the one on top.

1015
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,140
I think that's where Dong-kyu is stuck.

1016
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,283
The first blank is 18,

1017
01:02:21,367 --> 01:02:23,952
the second blank is 89,

1018
01:02:24,495 --> 01:02:26,455
and the third blank is 152.

1019
01:02:31,377 --> 01:02:33,879
TEAM KU'S LEE DONG-KYU
ANSWERS: 18, 89, 152

1020
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:35,339
That is correct.

1021
01:02:35,423 --> 01:02:38,092
Team KU's Lee Dong-kyu answered correctly.

1022
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:40,844
TEAM KU'S LEE DONG-KYU: WIN
TEAM SNU'S JUNG HYUN-BIN: LOSE

1023
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:43,805

ADD THE POWER OF 2 FOR EACH DIGIT
TO GET THE NEXT TERM

1026
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,153
DIFFERENCES: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32

1027
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:00,406
TO FIND THE DIFFERENCE
SUBTRACT THE 1ST TERM FROM THE 2ND

1028
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:02,950
THE DIFFERENCE FORMS A GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE
WHOSE COMMON RATIO IS 2

1029
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:05,578
Team KU's Lee Dong-kyu answered correctly.

1030
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:08,539
TEAM KU: 5, TEAM SNU: 4
TEAM KU IS LEADING BY 1 POINT

1031
01:03:13,419 --> 01:03:15,671
Look at his cheeky dance moves.

1032
01:03:17,465 --> 01:03:18,882
Are we going to win today?

1033
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:22,344
He created a stereotype that math majors
are good at solving sequences.

1034
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:26,181
- Go ahead and wrap things up.
- What?

1035
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:28,183
- Finish it off.
- You don't want to steal the show?

1036
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:29,393
No, I'm good.

1037
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:31,729
You can get up here and dance too.

1038
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:39,194
SONG HYUN-SEOK IS NERVOUS
AND IS NOT IN THE MOOD FOR JOKES

1039
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:40,529
This won't be easy.

1040
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:44,241
Team KU had a math major
and a statistics major,

1041
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:45,534
so things weren't looking good.

1042
01:03:45,618 --> 01:03:47,035
Team SNU's Song Hyun-seok,

1043
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,663
- please come forward.
- Good luck!

1044
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:54,669
TEAM KU'S LEE DONG-KYU
VS TEAM SNU'S SONG HYUN-SEOK

1045
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:00,049
You can do it, Hyun-seok.

1046
01:04:01,718 --> 01:04:02,885
I need to stay calm.

1047
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:08,725
Here is your question.

1048
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:22,279
Damn...

1049
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:36,669
My brain isn't working.

1050
01:05:02,612 --> 01:05:04,739
I know the other two,
but not the last one.

1051
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:08,576
I can't figure out one of the blanks.

1052
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:13,414
Let's go, Hyun-seok.

1053
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:30,306
The first blank is 51,

1054
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:32,558
the second blank is 11 over 3,

1055
01:05:32,642 --> 01:05:34,310
and the third blank is 16 over 9.

1056
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:41,066
TEAM SNU'S SONG HYUN-SEOK
ANSWERS: 51, 11/3, 16/9

1057
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,359
That is incorrect.

1058
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:44,027
That is incorrect.

1059
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:46,739
He got the last one wrong.

1060
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:49,408
Isn't it 17 over 9?

1061
01:05:51,243 --> 01:05:53,496
1ST DIFFERENCE: -1, +1, +5, +13, +29
2ND DIFFERENCE: +2, +4, +8, +16

1062
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:56,999
THE 2ND DIFFERENCE IS A GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE
WHOSE COMMON RATIO IS 2

1063
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:06,843
THE NEXT TERM CONSISTS OF A NUMBER
WHERE THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR

1064
01:06:06,926 --> 01:06:09,219
ARE THOSE OF THE PREVIOUS TERM
INCREASED BY 1

1065
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:11,138
Your opponent will be given ten seconds.

1066
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:12,598
A WRONG ANSWER
GIVES THE OPPONENT 10 SECONDS

1067
01:06:18,771 --> 01:06:20,105
Did I get 51 wrong?

1068
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:22,525
Your time is up.

1069
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:43,253
Please...

1070
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:48,091
The first blank is 51,

1071
01:06:48,384 --> 01:06:50,511
the second blank is 11 over 3,

1072
01:06:50,803 --> 01:06:53,472
and the third blank

1073
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:55,516
is nine...

1074
01:06:58,602 --> 01:06:59,603
over 17.

1075
01:06:59,687 --> 01:07:00,938
Your time is up.

1076
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:03,816
TEAM SNU'S SONG HYUN-SEOK TIMED OUT
Your time is up.

1077
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:04,942
What?

1078
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:13,033
Your opponent will be given ten seconds.

1079
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:21,792
- He can repeat what he said.
- Just repeat it.

1080
01:07:22,919 --> 01:07:24,921
- Just say what he said.
- Say it.

1081
01:07:25,004 --> 01:07:27,172
- What's wrong with him?
- Why won't he?

1082
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:28,507
Why won't he say it?

1083
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:31,635
Please...

1084
01:07:32,428 --> 01:07:34,054
Is ten seconds really this long?

1085
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,066
Your time is up.

1086
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:48,611
Your time is up. You may now--

1087
01:07:48,694 --> 01:07:51,572
I'll start with the last one.
That's 17 over 9.

1088
01:07:51,655 --> 01:07:53,156
The next one is 11 over 3,

1089
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,034
and the one on top is 51.

1090
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:57,160
That is correct.

1091
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:58,704
That is correct.

1092
01:07:58,788 --> 01:08:01,165
TEAM KU'S LEE DONG-KYU: LOSE
TEAM SNU'S SONG HYUN-SEOK: WIN

1093
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,085
That is correct.

1094
01:08:06,963 --> 01:08:08,631
- Why didn't you say what he said?
- Why didn't you?

1095
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,594
He must've been wrapped up
in his own thoughts.

1096
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:18,850
TEAM KU: 5, TEAM SNU:5
THE TWO TEAMS ARE TIED AGAIN

1097
01:08:20,726 --> 01:08:25,564
I realized I might actually be
a bigger threat than I thought I was.

1098
01:08:26,816 --> 01:08:29,777
Why do I have to play the 11th round?

1099
01:08:30,402 --> 01:08:33,322
TEAM KU'S FATE NOW RESTS ON CHAE SEUNG-MIN

1100
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:37,409
TEAM KU'S CHAE SEUNG-MIN
VS TEAM SNU'S SONG HYUN-SEOK

1101
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:39,620
- Your palm is sweaty.
- I know.

1102
01:08:39,704 --> 01:08:41,831
It's been that way
since the Deathmatch yesterday.

1103
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:49,755
Did you solve it right away?

1104
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:52,174
I solved it faster than you two.

1105
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:55,177
At least I beat the math major.

1106
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:00,725
That math major beat the guy
who got a perfect score on the CSAT.

1107
01:09:03,102 --> 01:09:05,813
I beat the math major,
who beat the guy with the perfect score.

1108
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,651
THE LAST QUESTION OF RELAY MATCH
Here is your question.

1109
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:14,154
THE TEAM THAT GETS THIS QUESTION RIGHT
WILL SECURE THE BENEFIT

1110
01:09:24,123 --> 01:09:25,875
What's with the repetition of 13.5?

1111
01:09:36,886 --> 01:09:38,096
Team SNU's Song Hyun-seok.

1112
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:45,352
- That was fast.
- I'll start from the top.

1113
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:49,774
I'll start from the top.
The answers are 111, 144, and...

1114
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:56,572
Why does he do that all the time?

1115
01:09:56,655 --> 01:10:00,159
Your time is up.
Your opponent will take his turn.

1116
01:10:00,242 --> 01:10:01,285
Damn it.

1117
01:10:05,289 --> 01:10:08,709
I was afraid Seung-min would get it right.

1118
01:10:10,086 --> 01:10:13,213
The answers are 111, 144, and 13.5.

1119
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:21,472
That is incorrect.

1120
01:10:22,264 --> 01:10:23,307
That is incorrect.

1121
01:10:24,308 --> 01:10:27,478
Your opponent will be given
ten seconds to answer the question.

1122
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:33,317
So the first term is divided by 4,
the next one is divided by 2...

1123
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,735
It's not division.

1124
01:10:35,277 --> 01:10:37,446
How else do you get 36 from 144?

1125
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:39,239
The first term is 144.

1126
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,450
- That was multiplied by 1/4 to get 36.
- Right.

1127
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:43,828
Next, it was multiplied by 1/2.
That's the same as 2/4.

1128
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:46,330
That's the logic, right?
So it'd be 3/4 and then 4/4.

1129
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:48,833
You have to multiply the last term
by 5/4 to get the answer.

1130
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,334
ANSWER REVEALED

1131
01:10:57,675 --> 01:11:00,552
1ST DIFFERENCE: +1, +4, +10, +19, +31, +46
2ND DIFFERENCE: +3, +6, +9, +12, +15

1132
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:04,306
THE 2ND DIFFERENCE INCREASES BY 3,
FORMING AN ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE

1133
01:11:24,869 --> 01:11:25,995
Team SNU's Song Hyun-seok.

1134
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:30,124
I'll name the last one first. It's 16.875.

1135
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:32,668
The next two are 144 and 111.

1136
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:35,379
Team SNU's Song Hyun-seok
answered correctly.

1137
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:37,256
TEAM SNU'S SONG HYUN-SEOK
ANSWERS: 111, 144, 16.875

1138
01:11:39,383 --> 01:11:40,425
I'm the king!

1139
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:44,763
I'm the king!

1140
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:48,851
Team KU's Chae Seung-min,
please return to your seat.

1141
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:51,645
TEAM KU'S CHAE SEUNG-MIN: LOSE
TEAM SNU'S SONG HYUN-SEOK: 2 WINS

1142
01:11:51,729 --> 01:11:54,523
Here are the final results of Relay Match.

1143
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,278
The contestant who earned the most points
was Kim Jung-min from Team KU.

1144
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:00,571
KIM JUNG-MIN WON 4 TIMES

1145
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:03,157
However, the total number of points
for each school are as follows.

1146
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:04,992
Team SNU scored six points,

1147
01:12:05,076 --> 01:12:06,618
Team KU scored five points,

1148
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:08,328
and Team Harvard scored zero points.

1149
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:10,497
Thus, Team SNU scored the most points

1150
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:13,167
and has secured the benefit.

1151
01:12:15,628 --> 01:12:17,213
Today's main match

1152
01:12:17,297 --> 01:12:18,547
is...

1153
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:24,262
So are you going to tell me or not?

1154
01:12:24,804 --> 01:12:26,055
I'm going to compare it.

1155
01:12:26,139 --> 01:12:27,890
Then where does that leave me?

1156
01:12:27,974 --> 01:12:30,726
The first one was easier.
You keep doing that.

1157
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:32,103
We need it too!

1158
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:34,438
We have nothing right now. Just hurry up.

1159
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:36,816
This is so stupid.

1160
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:38,484
That'd be a big mistake.

1161
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:40,402
We aren't communicating.

1162
01:12:40,486 --> 01:12:42,029
You're considering it, right?

1163
01:12:42,113 --> 01:12:43,489
That puts us at a disadvantage.

1164
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,783
You won't? All right.

1165
01:12:45,866 --> 01:12:47,160
I'm getting pissed off.

1166
01:13:47,345 --> 01:13:49,347
