00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:18,519
ELITE LEAGUE

2
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,022
That concludes
the first round of Signal Investigation.

3
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,401
Team SNU, Team Yonsei,

4
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,695
Team KU, and Team Harvard

5
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,496
have apprehended the culprit.

6
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,965
SNU, YONSEI, KU, HARVARD SUCCEED

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,167
Team KAIST has failed
to apprehend the culprit.

8
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,170
ROUND 1
TEAM KAIST FAILS TO CATCH THE CULPRIT

9
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,441
We're screwed.

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,210
We lost this round,

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,088
but I knew there would be
other teams that would mess up.

12
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,590
So, if we use fewer cards,

13
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,634
we will still have a decent shot.

14
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,304
Before we begin the second round,
you will be given ten minutes

15
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,850
to confer with your teammates
and edit your 15 Signal Cards.

16
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,994
Your arresting officer

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,105
may also switch roles
with one of the investigators.

18
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,732
SIGNAL INVESTIGATION
ROUND 1

19
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:07,067
KAIST: 0
SNU, HARVARD, YONSEI, KU: 1

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,537
All contestants,
please return to your base camps.

21
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,154
- What happened?
- I'm so sorry.

22
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,448
- No, hold on.
- What confused you?

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,449
What was confusing?

24
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,701
We almost had it.

25
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:18,830
- Was it down to these two?
- Yes, I even had it set aside.

26
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,206
We should've been able
to tell them apart by their hairstyles.

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,835
We need additional clues
for different hairstyles.

28
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,211
- This card drove me crazy.
- Great job.

29
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,464
JUST LIKE SO HYUN-JI,
KIM JUNG-MIN WAS TORN BETWEEN 2 SUSPECTS

30
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,675
I had to guess
because they shared the same traits.

31
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,592
Really?

32
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,260
- They're both wearing earrings.
- Team KAIST...

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,929
- Did they choose this?
- Team KAIST chose this.

34
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,764
We need to work on our hairstyle clues.

35
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:38,808
Let's add length to the description.

36
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,601
TEAM KU ADDS HAIRSTYLE DETAILS
It would've been easy

37
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:41,602
if we had known the hair length.

38
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,271
- Are you okay as the arresting officer?
- Yes.

39
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,273
- You'll do well.
- He's right.

40
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,775
- I'm sorry.
- It'll only get more difficult.

41
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,643
- It wasn't your fault.
- It wasn't.

42
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:53,197
I wanted to give her
a chance to make up for it.

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,951
I thought Hyun-ji would be the best
at scrutinizing the clues we gave her.

44
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,911
I trusted her.

45
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,955
First, let's add "short hair."

46
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,083
TEAM KAIST ALSO ADDS MORE DETAILS
Write "mid-length" next.

47
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,292
And "ponytail."

48
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,920
The next important thing is colors.
As for colors...

49
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:11,131
We devised a 3 by 3 matrix
to convey information on colors.

50
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,509
The card's placement would tell us
what color we were describing.

51
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,972
It covered all the colors of the rainbow
including black, white, and gray.

52
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,683
So I was confident
we'd apprehend the culprit this time.

53
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,020
I think we should add
a card that describes colors.

54
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:26,772
Why don't we use
the clock system here as well?

55
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,649
- What?
- The colors of the rainbow and black.

56
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,736
We can use the eight directions
to indicate different colors.

57
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,918
THE PLACEMENT INDICATES THE COLOR

58
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,073
Hey.

59
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,116
You did great.

60
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,701
I want to keep apprehending.

61
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:40,536
You did an amazing job.

62
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,205
- There was one thing that confused me.
- What was it?

63
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,624
I could only see one ear.

64
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,252
THE NUMBER OF EARS VISIBLE
ARE DIFFERENT FOR EACH SUSPECT

65
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,336
0 EAR, 1 EAR, 2 EARS

66
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,254
In that case...

67
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,171
Hold on.

68
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,928
Two ears and one ear.

69
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,262
- One ear.
- I see.

70
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,015
"EARS" MEANS 2 VISIBLE EARS

71
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,549
"EAR" MEANS 1 VISIBLE EAR

72
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,184
- The number of ears?
- Yes.

73
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,021
You can see 1 ear, 2 ears, or no ears.

74
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:10,649
I think we can add clues
by rotating cards 2, 3, and 4 around.

75
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:14,236
Let's take ears as an example.
Each direction would represent 0, 1, or 2.

76
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,156
A CARD'S DIRECTION INDICATES A TRAIT
This means black, and this means dyed.

77
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,991
- Bangs, no bangs.
- No bangs.

78
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,034
Having a trait is the default.

79
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,160
- If you turn it...
- Right.

80
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,079
Guys, when we rotate the cards,

81
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:25,623
it should be counterclockwise,
not clockwise.

82
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,374
We should go counterclockwise.

83
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,127
Always rotate the cards counterclockwise.

84
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,087
- Like this, right?
- That's right.

85
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,297
I just wanted to make sure
that we're aligned.

86
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,017
We're engineering students.
Give us a little credit.

87
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,679
30 MINUTES LATER

88
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,141
I find it hard to believe

89
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,461
that Team SNU is struggling this much
when it's only the second day.

90
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,699
I'm just so mad at ourselves.

91
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,027
Your time is up.

92
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,863
Investigators,
please gather at the Main Hall.

93
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,175
Arresting officers,
please remain at your base camps.

94
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,578
This is so sad.

95
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,614
We really have to focus
if we want to avoid the Deathmatch.

96
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,709
Hopefully, two more teams
will mess up, right?

97
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,711
We'll be fine as long as we use
1 evidence photo in the next 2 rounds.

98
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,756
You never know what will happen.
We can turn it around.

99
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:19,026
- Anything could happen.
- We shouldn't be overly confident.

100
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,129
We thought we wouldn't mess up.

101
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,832
I know. We shouldn't be arrogant.
It could lead to our downfall.

102
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:33,732
Representatives of each team,
please take a photo of the culprit.

103
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,001
That looks like Yu Jae-seok.

104
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:57,048
SIGNAL INVESTIGATION
ROUND 2 CULPRIT

105
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,000
Does he look like he's happy?

106
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,968
Well, if we did--

107
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,012
He looks happy if you look at his eyes.

108
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,763
His lips curve upwards as well.

109
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,891
Is he happy?

110
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,732
He looks happy to me.

111
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,026
It does seem that way,
but it's not obvious.

112
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,485
So if it's vague...

113
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,653
Let's leave that out.

114
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,589
The color of the tie could be a huge clue.

115
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,392
We should put it down as brown.

116
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,995
What? You mean the tie?

117
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,596
It's plum.

118
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:32,625
Is it brown or plum?

119
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,136
We should leave this out then.

120
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,045
No, hear me out.

121
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:40,174
- It's still better to add a color clue.
- Let's pick one among these.

122
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,977
So this is where I'm torn right now.

123
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:46,346
Should this be flagged
as "others" or "tools"?

124
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,723
- It's not a tool.
- It's "others," then.

125
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,684
- Okay, we can go with that.
- You're not sure if we should include it?

126
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,187
No, I think it would confuse him.

127
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:54,314
I still think we need it.

128
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,858
So you think it's better
to let him know there's an object.

129
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:58,818
Exactly.

130
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,466
"Glasses, hat, beard." That's "OXX."

131
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,120
TEAM SNU IS READY
TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE PHOTO

132
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,579
- What's next?
- Next...

133
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:11,972
"Pants, short hair, jacket."

134
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,040
That's "OOO."

135
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,250
- He's wearing pants.
- It's "OOO."

136
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,418
He has short hair and is wearing a jacket.

137
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,212
- "Short-sleeves, object."
- Right.

138
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,131
"Short-sleeves, object."

139
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,249
We're ready.

140
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:23,926
We're done, right?

141
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,886
Hold on. What about bangs?

142
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,596
- Is the order no bangs, bangs?
- I think so.

143
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,597
Right?

144
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,157
He has bangs.

145
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,226
- I mean...
- This is right.

146
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,477
Does this mean "no bangs"?

147
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,478
- Why?
- No bangs, bangs.

148
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,437
Is it the other way around?

149
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:38,649
- Hold on.
- No bangs, bangs...

150
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,368
Isn't it bangs, no bangs?

151
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,777
What if we fail because of this?

152
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,366
We had an issue
with how we'd place the card.

153
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,534
Placing the card
horizontally or vertically

154
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,704
would determine
whether the culprit had bangs or not.

155
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,455
Damn it.

156
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,708
If we lose this round,
we'll be tied with Team KAIST.

157
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,027
I think having bangs was the default.

158
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,223
30 MINUTES AGO
Card 3 is for bangs.

159
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,640
Bangs, no bangs.

160
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:13,433
Bangs, no bangs.

161
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,395
VERTICAL: NO BANGS
HORIZONTAL: BANGS

162
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,806
CARD 3 IS PLACED HORIZONTALLY
WHICH MEANS THE CULPRIT HAS BANGS

163
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,360
BUT THE CULPRIT DOESN'T HAVE BANGS

164
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,071
It was a dumb mistake,

165
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:28,382
so we were trying to find a way
to let Hyun-bin know

166
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,017
that we forgot our strategy.

167
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:33,287
I feel bad about messing this up.

168
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,455
I know. We have to own that.

169
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,459
Let's shoulder
the responsibility together.

170
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,544
Damn it.

171
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,508
TIME TO CREATE EVIDENCE PHOTOS IS UP
Your time is up.

172
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,310
Please deliver your envelopes
to your base camps.

173
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:06,820
SUSPECTS FOR ROUND 2

174
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:13,060
TEAM KU'S BASE CAMP

175
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,208
GLASSES

176
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:22,920
SUSPECTS WITHOUT GLASSES ARE RULED OUT

177
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:29,593
DAVID RULES OUT SUSPECTS WITHOUT GLASSES

178
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,178
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP

179
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,390
CHO HYUN-JUN IS SORTING OUT
THE INFORMATION PASSED ON TO HIM

180
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,284
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

181
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:39,853
What the hell?

182
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,065
Why did they place it like that?

183
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,985
CARD 3: SHORT-SLEEVES, OBJECT

184
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,594
Why?

185
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,158
We agreed to place it
either vertically or horizontally,

186
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:55,702
but my teammates placed it
at an angle that was slanted.

187
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:59,957
It wasn't what we had agreed on,
so I wasn't sure what it meant.

188
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,501
What's that supposed to mean?

189
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,586
10 MINUTES AGO
How's this?

190
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,314
- Let's keep it as is.
- I have an idea.

191
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,548
Since we're confused,
we should let him know.

192
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,845
Let's set these slightly apart
and place "OXO" here at an odd angle.

193
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,055
- He'll know what that means.
- What?

194
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:18,434
We'll turn the card slightly
and place "OXO" next to it.

195
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:20,478
This should tell him we got confused.

196
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,189
Placing the card
at an angle we hadn't discussed

197
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:26,526
was our way of telling him
we were lost and forgot the rules.

198
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,406
I find it hard to believe

199
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:37,078
that Team SNU is struggling this much
when it's only the second day.

200
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:41,215
I'm just so mad at ourselves.

201
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,786
You have one minute.

202
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,883
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

203
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:55,763
TEAM KAIST'S SO HYUN-JI
HASN'T IDENTIFIED THE CULPRIT YET

204
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:01,269
It was incredibly difficult
to choose between the two,

205
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:03,604
so I wasn't sure
if I could find the culprit.

206
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,856
Do you think Hyun-ji will get it?

207
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,709
She must be under
a lot of pressure right now.

208
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,078
I'm sure she'll manage.

209
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,783
I hope Hyun-bin will get our message

210
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,785
and understand
what we were trying to convey.

211
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,912
I just want other teams to mess up.

212
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,259
You have 30 seconds.

213
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,220
Your time is up.

214
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,638
Arresting officers,
please put the photo of the culprit

215
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,075
in the envelope
and send it to the Main Hall.

216
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:49,609
Let's see.

217
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,019
- Please...
- Please...

218
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:53,779
I'm too scared to look.

219
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,756
I just can't.

220
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:00,094
Investigators, please open the envelope.

221
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,419
Did he get it?

222
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,926
TEAM KU CATCHES THE CULPRIT

223
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,305
- Nice.
- It was so easy.

224
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,483
TEAM YONSEI CATCHES THE CULPRIT

225
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,897
TEAM HARVARD CATCHES THE CULPRIT

226
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,275
I bet she got it right.

227
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,294
I bet she got it right.

228
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,304
She got it.

229
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,541
TEAM KAIST CATCHES THE CULPRIT

230
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,742
- Please...
- Just tear it here.

231
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,379
Please... I can't look.

232
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,714
I was scared we would lose this round.

233
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,385
I had faith in Hyun-bin.

234
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,887
He got a perfect score
on the CSAT for a reason.

235
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:08,996
He got it right.

236
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,106
- We got it, right?
- Everyone got it right.

237
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,401
TEAM SNU CATCHES THE CULPRIT

238
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:16,612
I seriously thought we were done for.

239
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:18,239
Let's ask him if he got our message.

240
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:19,948
Did everyone get it?

241
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:23,118
I think everyone got it.

242
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,245
You're right.

243
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,181
Oh, no.

244
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,792
That means the team that used
one evidence photo will win, right?

245
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:32,587
SIGNAL INVESTIGATION

246
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,213
IF TEAMS HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF ARRESTS,

247
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,465
THE TEAMS THAT USED
FEWER EVIDENCE PHOTOS WILL SURVIVE

248
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,469
TEAMS A, B, C: SURVIVE
TEAMS D, E: FACE ELIMINATION

249
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:53,240
All teams have apprehended the culprit.

250
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:01,156
Before we begin the third round,
you will be given ten minutes

251
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:04,851
to confer with your teammates
and edit your 15 Signal Cards.

252
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,705
Why did you place card three that way?

253
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,331
We got confused.

254
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,917
We forgot which direction
meant bangs and which meant no bangs.

255
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:15,504
- I see.
- So was it no bangs, bangs?

256
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:16,422
It was bangs, no bangs.

257
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:17,423
- Really?
- Yes.

258
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,341
- Was this round difficult?
- This round?

259
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:20,842
No, but this confused me.

260
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,721
We tried to let you know
that we were confused,

261
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,889
but we used "XX" to convey
that he doesn't have bangs.

262
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,058
It took me a while
because the placement threw me off.

263
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:32,747
So I excluded that information,
and managed to find the culprit.

264
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,940
TEAM SNU SORTS OUT DIRECTIONS
Let's keep it consistent.

265
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,317
If it's about bangs,

266
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,586
- the default would be bangs are present.
- Okay.

267
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,588
- So it's bangs, no bangs.
- Right.

268
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:42,197
- It's 0, 1, 2.
- That's right.

269
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:43,699
Male, female.

270
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,117
- That's right.
- Male, female?

271
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,704
Hey, that was so difficult.

272
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:48,829
Was it difficult?

273
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,457
It was really confusing.

274
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,375
Was it difficult?

275
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:55,169
The tie wasn't red. It was brown.

276
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,421
It wasn't just brown,
but more like dark brown.

277
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:58,673
It's almost black.

278
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:00,800
We'll have to use more specific clues.

279
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,176
What do we need to add?

280
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:05,221
- Let's fine-tune clues for colors.
- Okay.

281
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,114
- We could add "dark" and--
- "Light"?

282
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,982
We'll add "dark" and "light."

283
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:13,437
This is getting complicated.
I hope I don't get confused.

284
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:18,526
Judging from how it's been going,
the next round may be impossible to solve.

285
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,027
Would the direction
the person is facing help?

286
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:23,297
- Yes, that'd help us a lot.
- Facing front, right, and left.

287
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,742
Most suspects face the front,
but some are slightly turned.

288
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:26,667
I know.

289
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,703
So we'll tell you if they're facing front,

290
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:32,956
facing slightly to the right or left,
or standing at a 90-degree angle.

291
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,711
Let's use the card as a protractor.

292
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:39,046
Does slightly left mean
the left shoulder is further back?

293
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,674
From our point of view,
this is slightly left,

294
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:43,050
- and this is slightly right.
- Okay.

295
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,553
So slightly left means
the right shoulder is further back, right?

296
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,930
The left shoulder would come forward.

297
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,807
- Right.
- Check the shoulder that comes forward.

298
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,062
We'll add another one here.

299
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,273
- We want to add patterns.
- We'll be adding patterns.

300
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,441
We'll add patterns.

301
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:01,769
- I can't really focus when I'm waiting.
- Really?

302
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:06,240
The three of them had discussed
and fine-tuned a lot of clues,

303
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,827
so it was hard for me
to keep up with all the updates

304
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,613
within a short period of time.

305
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,791
You're not confident in your role?

306
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,050
- Me?
- Yes.

307
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,118
I'm not.

308
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:19,920
- One of us should do it.
- How about you?

309
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:20,838
- Me?
- Yes.

310
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,548
I know all our clues inside out,

311
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,717
- but you can do it if you want to.
- I don't want to.

312
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:25,860
- You should do it.
- I agree.

313
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,305
- Do you understand all our clues?
- I do. I know it inside out.

314
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,898
I'm sorry to bring this up,

315
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,868
but if everyone
gets it right in the third round,

316
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,186
they'll have used 3 evidence photos
when our count would be 4.

317
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,063
We went overboard in the first round.

318
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:40,190
We need the third round to be difficult.

319
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,276
- Totally.
- That's our best-case scenario.

320
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,879
I hope we get it right
and one team gets it wrong.

321
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,581
I really don't want to do the Deathmatch.

322
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:50,451
There's a possibility another team used
more than one evidence photo.

323
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,704
How many evidence photos
did the others use? Did they all use two?

324
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,790
- I think they used two at most.
- Damn it.

325
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,374
We've only used four so far.

326
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,959
We'll try to use one this time.

327
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:02,212
The next round will be harder,
so getting it right matters more.

328
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,882
I hope it's super difficult.

329
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,425
You can do it, Hyun-ji.

330
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:09,470
If it's difficult,
you'll be the only one to get it right.

331
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:11,889
I hope the last round
is extremely difficult.

332
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,909
Your time is up.

333
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,146
TEAM KAIST MAY FACE THE DEATHMATCH
FOR FAILING TO APPREHEND THE CULPRIT

334
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,582
TEAM HARVARD MAY FACE THE DEATHMATCH
FOR USING TOO MANY EVIDENCE PHOTOS

335
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:22,692
SIGNAL INVESTIGATION

336
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:25,486
THE LAST ROUND WILL DETERMINE
WHO GOES TO THE DEATHMATCH

337
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,112
We can do this.

338
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,989
We just need to remember our clues.

339
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:31,792
What do I do? This?

340
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,287
I'm jealous they can joke around.

341
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:49,343
Representatives of each team,
please take a photo of the culprit.

342
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,980
Please.

343
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:02,523
The more difficult it is,
the more cards we'll use.

344
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:03,858
But in the third round,

345
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,402
the culprit didn't have
a lot of distinct traits.

346
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,796
This round will be difficult for Hyun-ji.

347
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,699
- Seriously?
- She's wearing heels.

348
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:14,902
SIGNAL INVESTIGATION
ROUND 3 CULPRIT

349
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:19,273
WHO IS THE CULPRIT IN THIS LINEUP?

350
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,751
- She has long hair.
- We can use our direction clues.

351
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:27,130
Her right shoulder is forward,
so that's slightly right.

352
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,750
Does she have long or short hair?

353
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,319
- Is it short?
- She has short hair.

354
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,013
- No bangs.
- Is her hair long?

355
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,347
No, let's go with short hair.

356
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:37,558
- Isn't it long?
- No, it's mid-length.

357
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:39,810
- Is it?
- If her hair reaches her shoulders,

358
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:42,479
- we agreed it would be mid-length.
- Got it.

359
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,900
I'm worried that Hyun-bin
will think she has short hair.

360
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,401
- He won't.
- No way.

361
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:49,269
Short hair would reach just about here.

362
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,437
How about her pants?

363
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,823
These are definitely pants.

364
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:54,658
They are. Don't worry.

365
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:57,286
She's wearing long, wide slacks.

366
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,537
That's my go-to look.

367
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,332
Does she have long hair?

368
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,449
She does.

369
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:10,049
Where's the "holding object" card?

370
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,469
We shouldn't use
more than one evidence photo.

371
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,222
We really need to keep it at one.

372
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,434
We should've used
one evidence photo in the first round.

373
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,521
- I know. I'm kicking myself over it.
- Well, we didn't know.

374
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,777
I'm worried that the suspects
are going to look very similar.

375
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,664
Adding the number
of visible ears was a good idea.

376
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,042
We might win because of this clue.

377
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,836
If it takes Team KAIST this long,

378
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,587
they may be using
multiple evidence photos.

379
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:52,925
Let's make it as detailed as possible
even if it takes one more evidence photo.

380
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:57,847
Getting it right was our priority,
so we used two evidence photos.

381
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:00,933
Is there anything else we could add
with the cards we haven't used?

382
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:03,343
There are so many cards we didn't use.

383
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:05,396
We should tell her it's a rose.

384
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:09,441
The other suspects could be holding
some other object that's red.

385
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:12,695
Why don't we make the letter F
to let her know it's a flower.

386
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,698
20 MINUTES AGO
We can make letters with the cards.

387
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,324
We can make the letter R.

388
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,660
Should we go with rose?

389
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:20,995
- The letter R?
- Yes.

390
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:22,130
Like this.

391
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:24,832
It does look like it.

392
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,668
I think this will be enough
for her to get it right.

393
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,213
Please deliver your envelopes
to your base camps.

394
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:41,348
Damn.

395
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:51,759
Is this it?

396
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,911
DAVID IS FLUSTERED
THAT THERE'S ONLY 1 EVIDENCE PHOTO

397
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,750
I knew the other teams would try
to use as few evidence photos as possible,

398
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,752
so I suggested we use one evidence photo.

399
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:15,133
David is very logical
and doesn't overthink things,

400
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,301
so I was confident he'd get it.

401
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:24,358
1 VISIBLE EAR

402
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,226
TEAM KU'S BASE CAMP

403
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:31,732
I was flustered at first because the cards
were scattered all over the place.

404
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:37,237
What I saw in the evidence photo
didn't align with what we'd agreed upon,

405
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,447
so it threw me off.

406
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,366
20 MINUTES AGO

407
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,994
How does this sound?

408
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:46,455
We'll place the direction card below
and the object card above it.

409
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,082
Sounds great.

410
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,335
- So the cards mimic her posture?
- Right.

411
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:52,586
CARDS ARE PLACED
ON CORRESPONDING BODY PARTS

412
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,922
We didn't discuss this,
but I hope he gets it.

413
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,930
I really hope he figures it out.

414
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,833
Please look at how the cards are arranged.

415
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,769
I hope Jung-min gets it.

416
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:09,895
I'm counting on him.

417
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:11,672
I really am.

418
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,308
TEAM SNU'S' BASE CAMP

419
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,235
SHORT HAIR: X

420
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,946
THE CULPRIT DOESN'T HAVE SHORT HAIR

421
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:23,075
SUSPECTS WITH SHORT HAIR ARE RULED OUT

422
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:27,412
BLACK HAIR

423
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:32,292
SUSPECTS WITH DYED HAIR ARE RULED OUT

424
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,495
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

425
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:36,430
HAPPY, LONG PANTS, HEELS

426
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:39,050
RIGHT HAND
We added a clue that indicates

427
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:41,301
which hand they're holding the object.

428
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:45,806
The clue would tell me if they're using
the right hand, the left hand, or both.

429
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,851
So I was able to rule out
the suspects using the wrong hand.

430
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,228
SUSPECTS USING
THEIR LEFT HAND ARE RULED OUT

431
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,446
That concludes the third round.

432
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,292
Arresting officers,
please take the photo of the culprit

433
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,527
and gather at the Main Hall.

434
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:10,831
Well done.

435
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,204
You did great.

436
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,840
You did great.

437
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,846
- You're finally out.
- I'm not sure if I got it.

438
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,389
- Was it confusing?
- You got it.

439
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:29,516
The suspects all looked identical.

440
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:30,476
Really?

441
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,352
Was this round easy?

442
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,121
See for yourself.

443
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:37,275
- I bet it was the hardest round.
- I think I got it, though.

444
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:39,110
Was it complicated?

445
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:43,030
Not at all. It was super clear.

446
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,327
If everyone gets it right,
we might end up in the Deathmatch.

447
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:49,954
- Why?
- We used five photos in total.

448
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:51,872
TOTAL NUMBER OF EVIDENCE PHOTOS

449
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:54,583

YONSEI: 4, KU: 3

450
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,460
We need one team to fail this round.

451
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,632
SNU, KU, or Yonsei needs to get it wrong.

452
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,151
Team SNU, please open your envelope.

453
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:10,057
SIGNAL INVESTIGATION
ROUND 3 CULPRIT

454
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,559
- Please.
- I'm too scared to look.

455
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:14,061
- I'll flip it over.
- Please.

456
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,734
Did we get it wrong?

457
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:23,871
- He got it right.
- He got it.

458

ROUND 3
TEAM SNU CATCHES THE CULPRIT

459
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:29,369
ROUND 3
TEAM KU CATCHES THE CULPRIT

460
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:30,286
He got it.

461
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,453
Let's open it.

462
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:33,413
I hope I got it.

463
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:45,559
It's correct.

464
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:48,888
ROUND 3
TEAM KAIST CATCHES THE CULPRIT

465
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,265
You should've gotten
the first one right, dummy.

466
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:52,833
I'm sorry.

467
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,441
We used the most number of photos,

468
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:03,443
so that made me nervous.

469
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,872
ROUND 3
TEAM HARVARD CATCHES THE CULPRIT

470
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:19,501
TEAM KAIST WILL FACE THE DEATHMATCH

471
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:22,088
IF YONSEI SUCCEEDS,
HARVARD WILL FACE THE DEATHMATCH

472
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:24,882
It didn't feel great.

473
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:28,386
Try not to look so happy.
Team KAIST is miserable right now.

474
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:37,103
ROUND 3
TEAM YONSEI FAILS TO CATCH THE CULPRIT

475
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,645
What? They got it wrong.

476
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:41,282
They got it wrong.

477
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,610
Why do they all have long hair?

478
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:46,486
The clue said she had short hair.

479
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:47,654
Hold on.

480
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,156
You didn't look?

481
00:24:49,257 --> 00:24:53,727
- We did.
- We did, but she had a mid-length bob.

482
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:59,600
At first, I was sure I got it right

483
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:04,105
because I chose the suspect
that I thought had short hair.

484
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,673
So I was convinced that I got it right.

485
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:10,878
It turns out that we all had
different definitions for short hair.

486
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,973
- This is what short hair looks like.
- I know,

487
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:17,885
but we only had this picture,
and it looked like she had short hair.

488
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,895
But this is what short hair looks like.

489
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,334
We categorized the hairstyles
into short and long hair.

490
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:37,455
But we should've thought it through
and added mid-length.

491
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:39,807
40 MINUTES AGO
Let's discuss hairstyles.

492
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,377
We should go with
bald, cropped, short, and long hair.

493
00:25:43,444 --> 00:25:45,296
Is it short hair
if it reaches the shoulders?

494
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:47,948
- This should be short hair.
- Okay.

495
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:54,588
The final results will now be revealed.

496
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:56,890
Team SNU

497
00:25:56,957 --> 00:25:58,225
made three arrests.

498
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,186
Team KU

499
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:01,462
made three arrests.

500
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:03,331
Team Harvard

501
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:04,631
made three arrests.

502
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:06,600
Team Yonsei

503
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:08,610
made two arrests.

504
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,197
Team KAIST

505
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:12,606
made two arrests.

506
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:18,620
The top three teams,
SNU, KU, and Harvard, have survived.

507
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:20,789
The two teams
that will face the Deathmatch

508
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:23,417
are Team Yonsei and Team KAIST.

509
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:25,127
TEAM YONSEI VS TEAM KAIST

510
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:28,588
- We need to prepare for the Deathmatch.
- I just...

511
00:26:29,023 --> 00:26:32,176
We had a great system,

512
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,628
so it bummed me out that we got it wrong.

513
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,266
How can that be short hair?

514
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:42,686
I was confused and flustered at first.

515
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,313
After I calmed down a bit,

516
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:47,141
I thought about
how to prepare for the Deathmatch.

517
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:49,527
We have to prepare for the Deathmatch.

518
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:53,114
I'll win the Deathmatch for us.

519
00:26:57,076 --> 00:27:00,687
You need to let it go
because it wasn't all your fault.

520
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:03,999
We're a team, so everyone is responsible.

521
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:10,798
I knew I could've done better,
so I felt bad for letting my team down.

522
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:13,134
I was overwhelmed with guilt and regrets.

523
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,803
It'll be amazing if we win.

524
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,557
Stop saying "if."

525
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,809
We have to win, and we will.
Let's just focus on how we'll win.

526
00:27:23,394 --> 00:27:24,395
We can do it.

527
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,281
- We can do it.
- We can win.

528
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:31,193
Both teams,
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

529
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,755
DEATHMATCH
TEAM YONSEI VS TEAM KAIST

530
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:37,617
KI-HONG, NA-YOON, JU-HYUNG, HYUN-JUN

531
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:42,663
HYUN-JI, JUN-HYUK, SEO-YEON, SUNG-BUM

532
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:47,268
How did we end up here again?

533
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:49,504
I was quite exhausted at that point,

534
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:52,923
and it all felt like a bad dream.

535
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:55,343
We all felt cornered.

536
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:03,484
I think my team ended up
in the Deathmatch because of me,

537
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:06,086
so I was determined to give it my all.

538
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:11,292
I knew we had to do well,
but I had a feeling we'd win.

539
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:15,821
Team KAIST must be exhausted
doing this two days in a row.

540
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:17,798
It's about perseverance at this point.

541
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,618
It'll be hard
if they're as exhausted as I am today.

542
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,746
I knew it'd be a cutthroat match,

543
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,741
but I was confident we'd win.

544
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,753
We needed to be prepared
to win the Deathmatch.

545
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:35,650
We'll survive this Deathmatch
no matter what.

546
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,285
Today's Deathmatch

547
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:41,013
is Pixel Number.

548
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:44,808
"Pixel Number"?

549
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:47,395
- What's that?
- "Pixel Number"?

550
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:49,730
In Pixel Number,

551
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:53,484
you will be asked to find target numbers
by combining a set of cards.

552
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:56,362
The team that finds
the most target numbers wins the game.

553
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:57,705
TARGET NUMBER 6:
COMBINATION: 1, 8, 11

554
00:28:57,771 --> 00:29:01,075
When the match begins,
you'll be presented with 15 Pixel Cards

555
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:03,578
TARGET NUMBERS: 3, 6, 9
and 3 target numbers.

556
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:08,048
- That sounds fun.
- It totally does.

557
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:12,186
The target number is the number
that appears when Pixel Cards are layered,

558
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:16,298
and you must use at least two Pixel Cards
to make a target number.

559
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:17,958
MINIMUM NUMBER OF PIXEL CARDS: 2

560
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,303
The contestant that rings the bell first
will be given a chance to answer,

561
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:25,600
and he or she must give the answer
within the ten-second time limit.

562
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:28,977
You will be awarded
one point for a correct answer.

563
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:31,188
Your opponent will get a chance to answer

564
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:33,399
if your answer is wrong
or your time is up.

565
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:40,989
Each round will come to an end
when all the target numbers are found.

566
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:41,907
ROUND OVER

567
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,159
This match will consist of five rounds.

568
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:47,921
For rounds 1 to 4,
you will be given 3 target numbers.

569
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:50,958
In round 5,
you will be given 2 target numbers

570
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:53,894
and one hidden number.

571
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:57,047
If you get the hidden number right,

572
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:59,091
your team will be awarded three points.

573
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:01,843
After the five rounds,

574
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:04,096
the team with the most points wins.

575
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,059
Please choose
the contestant for each round.

576
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,355
They're playing one on one?

577
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,650
- Choosing the order will be important.
- Totally.

578
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:17,151
Matchups can be critical, too.

579
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:20,821
We can't prepare for this.
We'll just have to pull our own weight.

580
00:30:25,618 --> 00:30:28,295
Both teams,
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

581
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:31,248
Let's go.

582
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:34,251
You will be given
five minutes to discuss your strategy.

583
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:36,069
So it's a one-on-one match.

584
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:39,006
How should we do this?

585
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:41,759
We only have five minutes. Let's hurry.

586
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:44,144
- I'm not that confident.
- Me neither.

587
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:46,556
- We have to decide who'd do best here.
- Not me.

588
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:48,641
Honestly, I think I'll do fine.

589
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,893
- Really? You think so?
- Yes.

590
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,886
I'll go first.

591
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:54,397
All right. Cool.

592
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,149
- Go and set the tone for us.
- I will.

593
00:30:57,817 --> 00:31:01,362
You'll see the same
pixelated numbers in elevators.

594
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:04,865
Whenever I took the elevator,
I would look at the numbers

595
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:08,035
and would work out which pixels
were present for different numbers.

596
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:11,105
There are 2 holes in the number 8, right?

597
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:15,309
There can't be a pixel there,
but there should be pixels in the middle.

598
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:18,087
I've thought about this quite a lot,

599
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,257
so I was confident
I'd do well in this challenge.

600
00:31:21,591 --> 00:31:24,761
Ki-hong will play first,
practice during the next three,

601
00:31:24,852 --> 00:31:26,637
and play again in the fifth round.

602
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:28,138
Numbers 2, 3, and 5 seem important.

603
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:30,224
Are you suggesting we tackle them first?

604
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,227
- Wouldn't 1 be easy?
- These 3 lines are used often.

605
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:36,313
It's used for 2 as well as 3.

606
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:42,361
My strategy was to identify the numbers
that filled the top, middle, and bottom.

607
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:46,340
PRIORITIZE THE 3 HORIZONTAL LINES
The numbers 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8

608
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:48,743
fill up all three rows.

609
00:31:48,826 --> 00:31:50,244
So I wanted to prioritize checking

610
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:54,206
whether the given Pixel Cards
can be combined to create those numbers.

611
00:31:54,816 --> 00:31:55,983
We can so win this.

612
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:01,380
We'll get three target numbers,
so find the pixels that are used the most.

613
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:04,425
Numbers 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9
need the column on the right.

614
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:08,679
TARGET NUMBERS: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
Here's the rundown. 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9

615
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:11,098
all need the right column.

616
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,643
And 6 and 8 need the left column.

617
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:15,603
TARGET NUMBERS: 6, 8

618
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,647
TARGET NUMBERS: 2, 5
That makes it easy.

619
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,340
Two and five are the only exceptions.

620
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,876
Six and eight need the left column,
and the rest need the right.

621
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:23,319
1, 3, 4, 7, 9: RIGHT COLUMN
6: LEFT COLUMN

622
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,912
8, 0: BOTH COLUMNS
2, 5: PARTIALLY FILLED

623
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:26,989
Look for numbers
that fill up the right column.

624
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,158
TEAM KAIST PRIORITIZES THE COLUMNS

625
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:33,329
Since all numbers use pixels
on both the right and left columns,

626
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:35,998
I thought it'd be easier
to have them filled first.

627
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:39,669
We went over this earlier,
so just memorize the patterns now.

628
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,754
There are so many overlaps.

629
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:44,340
Like I said earlier,
write it down in your notepads.

630
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:49,002
I drew all the numbers on the board

631
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:52,473
because I had to look at the cards
and come up with a combination

632
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:55,242
that would form the target number quickly.

633
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,846
I kept practicing
with the patterns on the board.

634
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:04,109
This will be really tricky.

635
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:05,553
What about the order?

636
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:07,571
The order will be important.

637
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:11,325
I'll go first since I'm the leader.

638
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,288
Not many can step up
the way he did under such pressure.

639
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:19,166
We needed to win the first round
to set the tone of the game.

640
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:21,335
We needed the momentum on our side.

641
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:25,840
Please gather at the Main Hall
for the Deathmatch.

642
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:35,449
Guys, let's go.

643
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:38,519
So it begins.

644
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,521
Don't be intimidated.

645
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:49,463
We had no choice but to win.

646
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,398
Losing was not an option for us.

647
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,453
I'm sure Team KAIST is exhausted

648
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:59,607
and under a lot of pressure right now.

649
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,586
We're going to win
because we're full of energy.

650
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:06,714
They must be so stressed right now.

651
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:09,049
I'd hate to be in their shoes.

652
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:10,551
PIXEL NUMBER

653
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:14,154
We will now begin
the first round of Pixel Number.

654
00:34:14,722 --> 00:34:17,474
Players for the first round,
please step forward.

655
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:18,809
I wonder who's first.

656
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,352
I have to see who's up first.

657
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:23,698
Players for the first round,
please step forward.

658
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:29,403
TEAM YONSEI'S PLAYER FOR ROUND 1
KIM KI-HONG

659
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:32,197
I knew they would
choose their best player to play first,

660
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:35,108
so I expected Sung-bum to step up.

661
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:38,913
TEAM KAIST'S PLAYER FOR ROUND 1
HEO SUNG-BUM

662
00:34:39,872 --> 00:34:41,582
I was confident I'd win.

663
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:47,254
- Is it Sung-bum?
- I knew it'd be him.

664
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,632
I guess the aces are going first.

665
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:51,550
- I think he's cool.
- Who?

666
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:52,885
- Sung-bum.
- Me too.

667
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:55,805
I'll show them how it's done.

668
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:59,767
Sung-bum is good, but so am I.

669
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:10,611
The question for round one
will now be revealed.

670
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:16,659
ROUND 1
TARGET NUMBERS: 1, 7, 9

671
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:18,369
They need to make 1, 7, and 9.

672
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:21,455
- That's tricky.
- I know, right?

673
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,761
He just rang the bell.

674
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:39,264
Heo Sung-bum from Team KAIST.

675
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:41,241
My target number is one.

676
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,394
The combination is 2, 9, and 14.

677
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:47,915
Your target number is 1,
and your combination is 2, 9, and 14.

678
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:50,442
Team KAIST's Heo Sung-bum.

679
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:53,195
ROUND 1
TARGET NUMBER: 1

680
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,288
That is correct.

681
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:55,740
That is correct.

682
00:35:58,525 --> 00:36:00,594
He got it right. Number one is easy.

683
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:04,065
I believed in him
and knew I could count on him.

684
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:07,167
TEAM KAIST: 1
TEAM YONSEI: 0

685
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:11,171
ROUND 1
TARGET NUMBERS: 7, 9

686
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,258
We will now resume the game.

687
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:16,385
Heo Sung-bum from Team KAIST.

688
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,679
Heo Sung-bum from Team KAIST.

689
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,782
My target number is seven.

690
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,818
The combination is 4, 6, and 10.

691
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:30,024
Team KAIST's Heo Sung-bum.

692
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:34,028
ROUND 1
TARGET NUMBER: 7

693
00:36:34,112 --> 00:36:35,295
That is correct.

694
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:37,064
That is correct.

695
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,070
That is correct.

696
00:36:43,788 --> 00:36:44,956
He's a genius.

697
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:47,833
Team KAIST got two numbers already.

698
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,376
He's good.

699
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,097
I admit I was anxious,

700
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,424
but I knew I had to keep my cool,
especially at a time like this.

701
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,728
We will now resume the game.

702
00:37:10,631 --> 00:37:14,568
ROUND 1
TARGET NUMBER: 9

703
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:16,112
We will now resume the game.

704
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:17,471
Kim Ki-hong from Team Yonsei.

705
00:37:17,947 --> 00:37:19,239
Kim Ki-hong from Team Yonsei.

706
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:25,204
I rang the bell
without thinking things through.

707
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,514
My target number is nine.

708
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,249
The combination is 3, 11, and 12.

709
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,886
Your target number is nine,

710
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,890
and your combination is 3, 11, and 12.

711
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,633
That is incorrect.

712
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:39,927
ROUND 1
TARGET NUMBER: 9

713
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:41,129
That is incorrect.

714
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:43,231
I got it wrong.

715
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:44,640
I thought I lost this round

716
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:47,568
because I practically gave
the answer away.

717
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:53,315
Your opponent will have
ten seconds to give an answer.

718
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:55,576
I had it earlier.

719
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:59,113
ROUND 1
TARGET NUMBER: 9

720
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:08,622
HEO SUNG-BUM FAILS TO ANSWER
Both of you may answer now.

721
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:09,874
Kim Ki-hong from Team Yonsei.

722
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:12,251
My target number is 9.
The combination is 3, 7, and 12.

723
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:13,848
TARGET NUMBER: 9
COMBINATION: 3, 7, 12

724
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,840
Your target number is nine,

725
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:22,136
and your combination is 3, 7, and 12.

726
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:28,742
ROUND 1
TARGET NUMBER: 9

727
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:29,844
That is correct.

728
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:32,013
That is correct.

729
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:37,651
That concludes the first round.

730
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:41,280
Team KAIST earned 2 points,
and Team Yonsei earned 1 point.

731
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,422
ROUND 1
TEAM KAIST: 2, TEAM YONSEI: 1

732
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:44,558
I wasn't happy with the results.

733
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:51,032
I was sure my teammates
were more capable than Team Yonsei.

734
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:53,709
If all of them earned 2 points each round,
we'd stand at 8 to 4.

735
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:56,937
So I thought we'd win with nine points.

736
00:38:57,305 --> 00:38:59,207
We had the upper hand in this game.

737
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:02,718
Earning one point
against Sung-bum isn't bad at all.

738
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:05,471
I agree. He's good.
He stands out as an individual player.

739
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:07,431
It's simpler than we expected.

740
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,317
Tackle the easy ones first.

741
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:11,311
Numbers 1 and 7 were easy.

742
00:39:13,221 --> 00:39:15,522
PIXEL NUMBER: ROUND 2
The second round will now begin.

743
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:18,492
Players for the second round,
please step forward.

744
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,236
- Who is up next?
- Who is up?

745
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,821
We're all thinking the same thing.

746
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:24,406
The lineup is pretty important.
Sung-bum, then...

747
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:35,309
As soon as I saw my opponent,
I knew I would win.

748
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:41,481
My opponent seemed like an easy target.

749
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:47,138
PIXEL NUMBER: ROUND 2
KAIST'S HYUN-JI VS YONSEI'S HYUN-JUN

750
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:49,349
The question for round two
will now be revealed.

751
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:51,475
ROUND 2
TARGET NUMBERS: 4, 6, 9

752
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,144
This round seems more complicated.

753
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:56,897
ROUND 2
TARGET NUMBERS: 4, 6, 9

754
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:02,069
He should go for four first, right?

755
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:05,031
All right.

756
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:10,119
Cho Hyun-jun from Team Yonsei.

757
00:40:10,203 --> 00:40:11,495
He got it this fast?

758
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:14,832
My target number is nine.

759
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,250
He's going with nine?

760
00:40:16,334 --> 00:40:17,960
The combination is 3, 7, and 11.

761
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:20,420
Your combination is 3, 7, and 11.

762
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,258
ROUND 2
TARGET NUMBER: 9

763
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:25,425
That is correct.

764
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:29,055
I was screwed.

765
00:40:29,347 --> 00:40:30,298
That is correct.

766
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:32,300
I knew I could win this round.

767
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:34,402
He's really good.

768
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:35,978
Team Yonsei got it already.

769
00:40:36,062 --> 00:40:36,937
In six seconds.

770
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:40,874
I was worried that he was taking the lead.

771
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:44,362
I knew I had to be quick
in finding the numbers.

772
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:47,114
ROUND 2
TARGET NUMBERS: 4, 6

773
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:49,783
So Hyun-ji from Team KAIST.

774
00:40:50,884 --> 00:40:52,052
So Hyun-ji from Team KAIST.

775
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,413
My target number is four.

776
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:54,955
The combination is 1, 10, and 12.

777

779
00:40:59,526 --> 00:41:00,594
That is correct.

780
00:41:01,379 --> 00:41:02,296
That is correct.

781
00:41:02,397 --> 00:41:03,505
TEAM KAIST: 3
TEAM YONSEI: 2

782
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,601
I had my faith in her.

783
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,141
Cho Hyun-jun from Team Yonsei.

784
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:16,936
Cho Hyun-jun from Team Yonsei.

785
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,813
My target number is 6.
The combination is 2, 6, and 15.

786
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:21,523

That is correct.

TEAM KAIST: 3
TEAM YONSEI: 3

792
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:31,992
I was relieved.

793
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:35,529
To be honest,
I knew I was going to win from the get-go.

794
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:38,958
I felt really bad
for messing this up for my team.

795
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:46,966
The score is now tied at 3 to 3.

796
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:48,259
ROUND 2
TEAM KAIST: 3, TEAM YONSEI: 3

797
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:49,927
- It's a close match.
- It's really close.

798
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,112
They're neck and neck.

799
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,307
They must be really alert right now.

800
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,309
They're laser-focused
on finding the numbers.

801
00:41:57,226 --> 00:42:00,229
We will now begin
the third round of Pixel Number.

802
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:04,091
Players for the third round,
please step forward.

803
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:07,820
It didn't matter who my opponent was.

804
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:09,397
I just wanted to win.

805
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:15,069
I wanted to score
as many points as I could.

806
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:19,307
We should all get at least 1 point.
If we get 2 points, even better.

807
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:20,833
Na-yoon will do well.

808
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:24,544
I reminded myself
to keep my calm at all times.

809
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:29,049
The question for round three
will now be revealed.

810
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:34,680
ROUND 3
TARGET NUMBERS: 2, 5, 8

811
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:35,848
Two, five, and eight.

812
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,808
Eight seems the easiest, is it not?

813
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:39,768
I'd go for eight first.

814
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,063
ROUND 3
TARGET NUMBERS: 2, 5, 8

815
00:42:49,937 --> 00:42:52,306
It was really nerve-racking.

816
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,117
My target number is eight.

817
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:57,577
The combination is 1, 2, and 7.

818
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:00,373
Your combination is 1, 2, and 7.

819
00:43:00,456 --> 00:43:02,958
TARGET NUMBER: 8

820
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:05,353
ROUND 3
TARGET NUMBER: 8

821
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:06,454
That is correct.

822
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:09,798
She was doing great,
so I was confident we'd win.

823
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:13,761
I reminded myself to focus.

824
00:43:13,861 --> 00:43:15,012
ROUND 3
TARGET NUMBERS: 2, 5

825
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,142
Park Na-yoon from Team Yonsei.

826
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:22,603
My target number is two.

827
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,505
The combination is 3, 14, and 15.

828
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:28,443
ROUND 3
TARGET NUMBER: 2

829
00:43:28,543 --> 00:43:29,676
That is correct.

830
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:33,013
So they're tied at 4 to 4?

831
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:35,491
Whoever scores next will win this round.

832
00:43:35,575 --> 00:43:38,994

ROUND 3
TARGET NUMBER: 5

835
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:47,294
I couldn't find it.

836
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:02,226
You both rang your bells
almost at the same time.

837
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,812
I knew the answer,

838
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:07,648
so I was anxious
she might get to answer first.

839
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:13,588
I was nervous she'd get to go first
because that meant she'd win this round.

840
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:27,042
Choi Seo-yeon from Team KAIST.

841
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:29,086
- My target number is five.
- Okay.

842
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:32,173
The combination is 4, 6, and 11.

843
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:33,508
TARGET NUMBER: 5
COMBINATION: 4, 6, 11

844
00:44:33,591 --> 00:44:35,476
ROUND 3
TARGET NUMBER: 5

845
00:44:35,543 --> 00:44:36,644
That is correct.

846
00:44:38,137 --> 00:44:41,815
It was intense, so I was glad when I won.

847
00:44:42,308 --> 00:44:45,986
I felt really bad
for putting pressure on my teammates.

848
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:50,232
ROUND 3
TEAM KAIST: 5, TEAM YONSEI: 4

849
00:44:50,324 --> 00:44:52,568
There are two rounds left.

850
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,195
It's so close.

851
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:56,697
- I know. They have two more rounds.
- Even I'm nervous.

852
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,075
We will now begin
the fourth round of Pixel Number.

853
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:01,661
You have to get at least one.

854
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:02,744
Okay.

855
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:05,247
I couldn't help
but feel the pressure to do well.

856
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:09,910
Keep your cool, okay?

857
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,215
I don't think I can do it.

858
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:15,416
You can do it.

859
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:17,343
I know that for a fact.

860
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,972
Players for the fourth round,
please step forward.

861
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,060
We were winning,
so I was determined to keep it that way.

862
00:45:27,228 --> 00:45:29,796
I was set on bringing my team to victory.

863
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,504
The question for round four
will now be revealed.

864
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:37,821
PIXEL NUMBER: ROUND 4

865
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:42,618
ROUND 4
TARGET NUMBERS: 2, 3, 5

866
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,318
- I don't see it.
- Me neither.

867
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:04,306
I expected the questions to get harder.

868
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:07,643
It didn't seem easy to tackle.

869
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,480
I have the combination for five.

870
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:14,174
You get 5 with 4, 8, and 13.

871
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:16,193
TARGET NUMBER: 5
COMBINATION: 4, 8, 13

872
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:20,314
Ju-hyung needed to do well,
and to be honest, I was worried.

873
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:28,080
Son Ju-hyung from Team Yonsei.

874
00:46:28,414 --> 00:46:29,957
My target number is five.

875
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:34,211
The combination is 4, 8, and 13.

876
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:37,131
ROUND 4
TARGET NUMBER: 5

877
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:38,365
That is correct.

878
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:41,034
I was off to a great start.

879
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:43,929
TEAM KAIST: 5
TEAM YONSEI: 5

880
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:46,307
ROUND 4
TARGET NUMBERS: 2, 3

881
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:57,151
Yang Jun-hyuk from Team KAIST.

882
00:46:59,487 --> 00:47:01,221
- My target number is two.
- Okay.

883
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:03,324
The combination is 1, 7, and 10.

884
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,927
ROUND 4
TARGET NUMBER: 2

885
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:08,028
That is correct.

886
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,033
Is the score 6 to 5?

887
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,881
PIXEL NUMBER: ROUND 4

888
00:47:21,908 --> 00:47:25,095
ROUND 4
TARGET NUMBER: 3

889
00:47:28,474 --> 00:47:30,384
I can't figure out
the combination for three.

890
00:47:30,718 --> 00:47:31,769
That's crazy.

891
00:47:34,772 --> 00:47:35,790
Hurry up.

892
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,157
Please...

893
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:41,612
I just couldn't figure out
the last target number.

894
00:47:42,488 --> 00:47:43,740
I didn't know what to do.

895
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:46,867
- Yang Jun-hyuk?
- My target number...

896
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:50,120
- Yang Jun-hyuk?
- My target number is three.

897
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:51,997
The combination is 3, 9, 11, and 15.

898
00:47:54,842 --> 00:47:57,211
ROUND 4
TARGET NUMBER: 3

899
00:47:57,278 --> 00:47:58,379
That is incorrect.

900
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,881
That is incorrect.

901
00:48:00,948 --> 00:48:02,174
This can't be happening.

902
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,176
Damn it, the time.

903
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:07,012
Son Ju-hyung will be given
ten seconds to provide an answer.

904
00:48:07,722 --> 00:48:12,727
ROUND 4
TARGET NUMBER: 3

905
00:48:13,686 --> 00:48:14,771
- Son Ju-hyung.
- My target number is three.

906
00:48:14,862 --> 00:48:16,355
The combination is 2, 6, 11, and 15.

907
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:19,333
Your combination is 2, 6, 11, and 15.

908
00:48:21,736 --> 00:48:25,948
ROUND 4
TARGET NUMBER: 3

909
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:26,907
That is correct.

910
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:28,509
TEAM KAIST: 6
TEAM YONSEI: 6

911
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:29,710
That is correct.

912
00:48:31,145 --> 00:48:32,212
That is correct.

913
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:38,294
We can use four cards?

914
00:48:38,377 --> 00:48:39,386
- It's 6 to 6.
- It's so close.

915
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:40,421
This is so fun!

916
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:44,425
That concludes
the fourth round of Pixel Number.

917
00:48:45,134 --> 00:48:47,795
ROUND 4
TEAM KAIST: 6, TEAM YONSEI: 6

918
00:48:48,496 --> 00:48:51,599
We will now begin
the fifth round of Pixel Number.

919
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:55,369
You will be given one hidden number.

920
00:48:55,436 --> 00:48:59,482
This hidden number is worth three points.

921
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:00,858
We have to get it.

922
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,777
Just focus on the hidden number.

923
00:49:02,844 --> 00:49:03,778
Okay.

924
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:06,864
- The other two don't matter.
- That's right.

925
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:11,410
ROUND 4
TEAM KAIST: 6, TEAM YONSEI: 6

926
00:49:11,494 --> 00:49:14,722
THE TEAM THAT FINDS
THE HIDDEN NUMBER WINS THE DEATHMATCH

927
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:18,626
Players for the fifth round,
please step forward.

928
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:26,233
WHO ARE THE LAST CONTESTANTS?

929
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:28,177
Do you want to go, or shall I?

930
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,595
AFTER ROUND 4

931
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:30,554
You should do it.

932
00:49:30,638 --> 00:49:31,764
I'm not good at this.

933
00:49:31,848 --> 00:49:33,340
I want you to play.

934
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:37,728
- We're not as fast as you.
- You're faster than us.

935
00:49:37,812 --> 00:49:40,356
You're the only one who can do this.

936
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:41,691
I'll do it then.

937
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:44,610
Guys, must I play?

938
00:49:44,694 --> 00:49:46,445
Either Seo-yeon or you should play.

939
00:49:46,787 --> 00:49:49,114
But to be honest, you're better than me.

940
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:52,284
You're better than me.

941
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:53,494
I'm not sure.

942
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,705
Relax. You'll do fine.

943
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:02,002
I just needed to find the hidden number,
and I was confident I would.

944
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:05,715
When I saw Hyun-jun,
I knew it wouldn't be an easy match.

945
00:50:05,798 --> 00:50:09,635
But I was set on finding
the last number and winning the match.

946
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:12,847
It's all about the energy.

947
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:14,682
You need nerves of steel.

948
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:18,268
I was sure I'd win.

949
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:23,106
I felt confident that I'd win this round.

950
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,751
If I'd made a two-point headway...

951
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:45,045
It's fine. Don't beat yourself up.

952
00:50:47,882 --> 00:50:50,009
The question for round five
will now be revealed.

953
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:52,553
PIXEL NUMBER: ROUND 5

954
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:56,557
ROUND 5
TARGET NUMBERS: 0, 6, ?

955
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:18,871
I knew I just had to find
the hidden number to win this round.

956
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:23,751
My ears are quite sensitive,
so I covered them up to focus.

957
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:26,963
But the combinations wouldn't work.

958
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,622
Cho Hyun-jun from Team Yonsei.

959
00:52:03,499 --> 00:52:05,084
The hidden number is eight.

960
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:10,673
The hidden number is 8.
The combination is 1, 4, and 9.

961
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,889
You named eight as the hidden number.

962
00:52:17,972 --> 00:52:21,976
And your combination is 1, 4, and 9.

963
00:52:31,736 --> 00:52:33,863
TARGET NUMBER: 8
COMBINATION: 1, 4, 9

964
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:34,922
That is correct.

965
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:42,955
That is correct.

966
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,380
That is correct.

967
00:52:59,814 --> 00:53:01,099
How did he get that?

968
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:03,884
- Great job.
- Good game.

969
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:07,146
Team Yonsei scored nine points,

970
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:09,481
and Team KAIST scored six points.

971
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:12,944
Congratulations.
The victory goes to Team Yonsei.

972
00:53:13,027 --> 00:53:14,486
TEAM YONSEI WINS THE DEATHMATCH

973
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:22,369
I had targeted the number eight
from the beginning.

974
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:26,040
The number eight
has the most number of pixels,

975
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:29,168
so I thought it was highly likely
to be the hidden number.

976
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:31,170
WHEN THE QUESTION FOR ROUND 5 WAS REVEALED

977
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:33,672
If eight wasn't included
in the target numbers,

978
00:53:33,756 --> 00:53:36,341
the quickest solution would be
to find the combination for eight.

979
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:40,179
The hidden number is eight.

980
00:53:40,262 --> 00:53:43,182
Frankly speaking,
I had no trouble finding the combination.

981
00:53:49,647 --> 00:53:51,023
Do you have regrets?

982
00:53:51,107 --> 00:53:52,984
What could we have done better?

983
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:55,444
I don't have any regrets.

984
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:59,115
It's just my first time
to fail at something.

985
00:54:00,116 --> 00:54:02,660
I never imagined losing a game
that tested my intelligence.

986
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:09,167
The second team
to be eliminated from Elite League is

987
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:10,835
Team KAIST.

988
00:54:13,754 --> 00:54:15,890
So this is it.

989
00:54:17,191 --> 00:54:18,884
They're all very smart.

990
00:54:18,968 --> 00:54:20,845
To be honest, I couldn't believe it.

991
00:54:21,629 --> 00:54:26,300
We were competing against one another,
but it didn't feel great to see them go.

992
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:28,769
What?

993
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:42,867
It's still painful to watch
the second time around.

994
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:44,660
That breaks my heart.

995
00:54:46,754 --> 00:54:49,540
I was embarrassed, and my ego was bruised.

996
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:52,334
It felt like it was all my fault.

997
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:58,049
I couldn't believe our journey had ended
and we were being sent home.

998
00:54:58,766 --> 00:55:00,259
I never saw it coming.

999
00:55:00,334 --> 00:55:03,971
It didn't feel like a survival show
until that point in time.

1000
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:11,245
Team KAIST, please exit the grounds.

1001
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:30,497
I know we lacked
in many aspects to represent KAIST,

1002
00:55:30,564 --> 00:55:32,666
but we did our best.

1003
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,877
We could've done better,
so I'm quite bummed out.

1004
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:39,406
And it's a shame
because we had more to show you.

1005
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:45,179
Being with all these people
helped me realize

1006
00:55:45,263 --> 00:55:48,849
I still have a lot more to learn
and improve upon.

1007
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:56,257
I wanted to show my fellow students
how capable KAIST students are,

1008
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:58,192
so it's a shame I couldn't.

1009
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:02,830
Our potential can't be measured
by this show alone.

1010
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:06,326
We will keep moving forward
in our respective fields,

1011
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:09,954
so I would really appreciate it
if you could cheer us on.

1012
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:17,044
Are you sure we're being filmed?

1013
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:26,987
- Great job, team.
- You all did great.

1014
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,636
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League.

1015
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:46,991
Today's main match is...

1016
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:51,912
Please form alliances as you please.

1017
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:54,414
- Let's go for Team Harvard.
- They're the best.

1018
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:56,416
We have to find out
if the best option is SNU or Harvard.

1019
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,584
Let's talk to Team Harvard.

1020
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:58,585
Do you want to team up?

1021
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:00,754
Are we left out again?

1022
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:02,631
Why are you obsessed with Team Harvard?

1023
00:57:02,715 --> 00:57:04,258
We should consider
the worst-case scenario.

1024
00:57:04,342 --> 00:57:05,592
What's so amazing about Team Harvard?

1025
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:07,728
We have to decide
which team to target today.

1026
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:10,139
Team Harvard simply got lucky yesterday.

1027
00:57:10,223 --> 00:57:11,431
They didn't stand out at anything.

1028
00:57:11,557 --> 00:57:13,642
I honestly don't think
Team Yonsei's that good.

1029
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:15,936
Who do we want to partner with?
We're not sure yet.

1030
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,521
I think Team KU's going home.

1031
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:19,190
We're in the worst position.

1032
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:20,858
We have to win no matter what.

1033
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:22,402
The pressure is too much.

1034
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,338
