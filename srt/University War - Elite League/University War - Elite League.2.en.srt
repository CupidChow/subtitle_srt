ELITE LEAGUE

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,156
TEAM SNU IS INPUTTING THE 300 ANSWERS

3
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,819
CHECKING

4
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:29,947
It's done.

5
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,533
Team SNU submitted their answers.

6
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,744
...submitted their answers.

7
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,419
I thought, "It might end really soon.
This is bad for us."

8
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,846
Team SNU submitted their answers.

9
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:46,797
Let's go!

10
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,049
How many?

11
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,175
He's taking his time.

12
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,595
Team SNU's number of wrong answers...

13
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,895
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is 28.

14
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:02,312
Why are there so many?

15
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,023
...number of wrong answers is 28.

16
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,265
- Why are there so many?
- Why?

17
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,859
- What?
- Hang on.

18
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:10,195
We were flustered, but we had to move on.

19
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:14,375
I was worried I made a mistake
when I inputted the answers.

20
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:15,952
...is 28.

21
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:19,814
- They got 28 questions wrong.
- Oh, no.

22
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:20,815
It's fine.

23
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,042
I don't think they know
what they got wrong.

24
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:25,711
...is 28.

25
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,216
SNU was my biggest concern,
but I felt like we stood a chance.

26
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,014
They got 28 questions wrong,
which is quite a lot.

27
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,057
It was more than I expected.

28
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,979
OUT OF 300 QUESTIONS,
TEAM SNU MUST FIND THE 28 WRONG ANSWERS

29
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:47,942
We corrected a few answers.

30
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:49,485
Wait, this one says 894705.

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,569
Fix it. Hurry.

32
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:51,737
CORRECTED ANSWER: 894105

33
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,489
- We're down to 27.
- Yes, that's it.

34
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,406
Okay.

35
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,702
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is 27.

36
00:01:58,828 --> 00:01:59,996
I'm done.

37
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,422
TEAM KAIST

38
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,880
Team KAIST submitted their answers.

39
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,340
Team KAIST's number of wrong answers...

40
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,803
is 106.

41
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,137
Why are there so many?

42
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,607
- That's a ridiculous amount.
- I know.

43
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:22,643
We were surprised
that they got so many incorrect answers.

44
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,688
If they're on this show,
they must be math whizzes.

45
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,356
Did they input the answers incorrectly?

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,818
TEAM POSTECH SUBMITTED THEIR ANSWERS

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,322
Team POSTECH submitted their answers.

48
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,796
Team POSTECH's number
of wrong answers is 85.

49
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,031
...is 85.

50
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,501
It was as we planned.

51
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,404
...is 85.

52
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,298
They must be using a similar tactic.

53
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:57,678
Our plan was to utilize a method
that's called debugging in coding.

54
00:02:57,762 --> 00:03:00,264
We filled the answer sheet with zeros
as if we were debugging.

55
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,891
We wrote down zeros at first.

56
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,434
Then, we checked how many we got wrong.

57
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,020
We wanted a system
where we could check the answers.

58
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:08,272
1 HOUR AGO
MEETING FOR THE MAIN MATCH

59
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,607
How do we know what's wrong?

60
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,734
Let's say we got 10 out of 300 wrong.

61
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:12,818
How do we find them?

62
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:15,195
Input the answers
and fill the rest with zeros.

63
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,263
Should we input zeros?

64
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,407
Inputting zeros sounds like a great idea.

65
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:24,246
We couldn't check the score
unless we input all 300 answers.

66
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,474
UNABLE TO SUBMIT, ABLE TO SUBMIT

67
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,128
We decided to input zeros
to check our answers.

68
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,046
That was our first strategy.

69
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,464
INPUT ANSWERS

70
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,548

Team POSTECH's number of wrong answers

76
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,792
is 85.

77
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:48,353
We didn't solve 60 of them,
so we got 25 wrong.

Team POSTECH's number of wrong answers

82
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,740
is 55.

83
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,533
We got all of them right.

84
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,493
All of them, right?

85
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,711
- Yes.
- We corrected 30.

86
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:04,712
That's good.

87
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,872
We got three questions wrong here.

88
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,248
KAIST USES DEBUGGING
TO CHECK THE WRONG ANSWERS

89
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,169
There are six of them here.

90
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,214
I told my teammates
that it'd come down to one question.

91
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,883
The first team to find
the last incorrect answer will win.

92
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,260
That's why we needed to use
the debugging method.

93
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,564
Team KAIST's number
of wrong answers is 97.

94
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,391
- Good.
- Their number is growing.

95
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,144
- We're doing well.
- We are.

96
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:31,271
At this rate, we'll win first place.

97
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,358
We didn't use any tricks.
We just solved the questions.

98
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,944
We went over the questions
if they were incorrect.

99
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:40,514
I knew we could win
if I stayed focused on the problems.

100
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,533
Team SNU submitted their answers.

101
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,077
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is 25.

102
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,454
- What?
- Seventy-two.

103
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,413
- Seventy-two?
- Yes.

104
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,707
NA-YOON AND HYUN-JUN
ARE IN CHARGE OF ARITHMETICS

105
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,724
Thanks.

00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,028
KI-HONG IS IN CHARGE
OF CHECKING THE ANSWERS

107
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,497
JU-HYUNG IS IN CHARGE
OF INPUTTING THE ANSWERS

108
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,635
There are three mistakes
on the first page.

109
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,054
The other pages are similar.

110
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,438
- We should check thoroughly.
- Okay.

111
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,906
It's absolutely necessary.

112
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,102
Nobody was taking a break or slacking off.

113
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:14,182
All of us had to put
our abilities to use to be more efficient.

114
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,853
I'm done.

115
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,587
Go check the answers.

116
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,906
I finished checking them.

117
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,757
- No mistakes?
- No.

118
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,259
Keep checking.

119
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,208
- Have you submitted it?
- I just did.

120
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:34,835

121
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:37,337
Team Yonsei submitted their answers.

122
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:43,443
Team Yonsei's number
of wrong answers is 21.

123
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,221
...is 21.

124
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,598
I was bummed.

125
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,417
We might lose. Let's hurry.

126
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:54,688
We were slow, but we wanted to be precise.

127
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,150
That was our mindset,
so we kept solving the questions.

128
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,484
Four, zero, eight...

129
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,404
Did you solve them all?

130
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,490
- Not yet.
- How many do you have left?

131
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,533
- We should probably help him out.
- Yes.

132
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,953
We should solve the questions in order.

00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,414
KU HASN'T SUBMITTED THEIR ANSWERS
It was played in teams,

135
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:16,585
so I went to help others
rather than only focusing on my task.

136
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,545
Can you tell me what a ternary system is?

137
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,505
The ternary system?

138
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,966
I don't know
the binary and quinary systems.

139
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,051
I hope I got them right.

140
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,186
Use division.

141
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:28,055
I thought it'd be more efficient
to have them solve it.

142
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,517
It would help us
if they all knew how to solve it.

143
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,728
I thought it would be better for us
in the long run.

144
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,897
DONG-KYU IS BEHIND
IN INPUTTING HIS ANSWERS

145

Go input them.
Just finish the problem you're working on.

147
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,770
Tell me where you left off.

148
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,364
I just solved question 150.

149
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,073
- Okay.
- Input the answers you have.

150
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:47,741
We'll work on solving the rest.

151
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:55,082

Team KU submitted their answers.

159
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,011
- Team KU submitted their answers.
- How many?

160
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:27,865
- It's legendary.
- No way.

161
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,825

- Good.
- We're good.

165
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,337

...number of wrong answers is 12.

168
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:51,764
I was flustered at first.

169
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:56,476
I was checking the answers,
and I got a bit anxious.

170
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,813
I realized that I had to hurry.

171
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,400
I knew we'd lose if I lost focus.

172
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:06,921
They're insane.

173
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:09,031
- I found one.
- Great.

174
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:10,157
We fixed one.

175
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,118
- Nice.
- Great.

176
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,078

00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:17,831
Team KU's number of wrong answers is nine.

179
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,202
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS
TEAM KU: 9

180
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:22,370
...is nine.

181
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,840
They're going to win.

182
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,092
No. We don't know yet.

183
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,052
It won't be easy for them.

184
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:40,488
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is 21.

185
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,990
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is 20.

186
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:44,459
Eighteen wrong answers.

187
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,726
Seventeen wrong answers.

188
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:48,695
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is 16.

189
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:50,572
One down.

190
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,824
That's great.

191
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,035
I knew that SNU would try and catch up,

192
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:57,497
but I didn't expect them to be that fast.

193
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,208
Let me check.

194
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:06,464
Team KU's number
of wrong answers is eight.

195
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,634
Since it becomes harder and harder

196
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,970
to find the wrong answers
as it nears the end,

197
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:15,348
I thought we could turn it around.

198
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,393
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is 14.

199
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,362
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS: 14

200
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:22,796
Nice.

201
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,699
Team KU's number of wrong answers is six.

202
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,733
- Yes!
- Yes!

203
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,902
- Is it 27164?
- Yes.

204
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,488
It's 27164.

205
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,449
- It's a factorial. It needs another zero.
- We're missing a zero.

206
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,701
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is 12.

207
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,869
No, stop catching up.

208
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,538
Please stop catching up to us.

209
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,374
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS

210
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,625
Team Yonsei's number
of wrong answers is 28.

211
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,127
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS
TEAM YONSEI: 28

212
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,488
Team Yonsei's number
of wrong answers is 38.

213
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,881
TEAM YONSEI: 38

214
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:53,052
That's a drastic difference.
Each time it changes...

215
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,306
Team Yonsei's number
of wrong answers is 46.

216
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,392
TEAM YONSEI KEEPS GETTING
MORE ANSWERS WRONG

217
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,936
When I saw them going from 10 to 40,

218
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,855
I knew they were also using
the debugging strategy.

219
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,341
Team Yonsei's number
of wrong answers is 46.

220
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:15,115
30 MINUTES AGO

221
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:17,918
Team KAIST's number
of wrong answers is 105.

222
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,955
Team POSTECH's number
of wrong answers is 109.

223
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:26,710
I figured out that KAIST and POSTECH
were using some type of strategy.

224
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:30,465
They're deliberately putting in zeros

225
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,758
to check the wrong answers as they go.

226
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,761
- I think I get it.
- Team KAIST submitted their answers.

227
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:40,433
The key to winning this game
is getting all the answers correct.

228
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:43,018
That's when I knew
we needed some sort of system.

229
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,312
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS: 112

230
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:48,357
TEAM YONSEI'S JU-HYUNG
USES THE DEBUGGING TACTIC

231
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,109
There's a wrong answer here.

232
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:51,193
Here?

233
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:52,620
- One of these three?
- Really?

234
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,405
- One of these ten?
- There's one more.

235
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,740
We got three questions wrong here.

236
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,367
KAIST CONTINUES TO FIND THE WRONG ANSWERS

237
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,369
- Where? From here?
- Yes.

238
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,231
Now, we found all three.

239
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,793
- Which section?
- No errors from 251 to 275.

240
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:11,046
Did you solve numbers 91 to 110?

241
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,174
- Yes.
- There are four wrong answers.

242
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,511
There's one error between 241 and 245.

243
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,804
In between 241 and 245? I'll get to it.

244
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,850
WILL THEIR DEBUGGING TACTIC WORK?

245
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,286
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS

246
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:29,290
TEAM KU: 6 WRONG, 1ST PLACE
TEAM SNU: 12 WRONG, 2ND PLACE

247
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,444
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is 11.

248
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,156
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is ten.

249
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,502
Team SNU's number
of wrong answers is nine.

250
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,371
I knew we were in trouble.

251
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,082
We're down to less than ten now.

252
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,042
Let's keep this up.

253
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,311
KU makes one mistake, and we take over.

254
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:51,212
Right.

255
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,172
I think we're going to finish first.

256
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,582
I agree. We have a system.

257
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:56,425
- I put them together here.
- Okay.

258
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,320
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS

259
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:01,556
Team SNU's number
of wrong answers is eight.

260
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,324
We're coming for you, KU.

261
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:05,792
Team KU's number
of wrong answers is seven.

262
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,496
TEAM KU GOT ONE MORE WRONG ANSWER

263
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:09,863
Come on.

264
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:13,942
CHECKING

265
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,135
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS: 7

266
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,238
Guys, we're tied in first place.

267
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:19,490
Team SNU's number
of wrong answers is seven.

268
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,534
I knew I could count on Hyun-bin.

269
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,978
They're so good.

270
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,914
My hands are sweaty.

271
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:28,666
- It's one...
- Okay.

272
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:29,584
One more.

273
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:34,088
HYUN-BIN SPOTTED A WRONG ANSWER

274
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:41,562
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS

275
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,098
Team POSTECH's
number of wrong answers is 51.

276
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:46,100
Okay.

277
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,103
We took over KU.

278
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:52,940
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is six.

279
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,611
This is terrible.

280
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,988
- Hold on. It's 240.
- Team SNU's number

281
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,699
- of wrong answers is five.
- Nice.

282
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:02,991
- Four wrong answers.
- Good.

283
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:03,992
Write it down.

284
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:09,757
Once we were tied,
I stopped minding the scoreboard.

285
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,060
Team KU's number of wrong answers is six.

286
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:17,097
- One more.
- Team KU has five wrong answers.

287
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:21,176
Team KU's number of wrong answers is four.

288
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,053
TEAM KU: 4

289
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,222
It's like we're going back and forth.

290
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:26,848
It's a tug of war.

291
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,842
This must be 52.

292
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:31,746
- Three left.
- Three?

293
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,105
Great!

294
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,749
We have two left, guys.

295
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,150
- Great.
- Let's keep going.

296
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,653
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is two.

297
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,407
- You got everything right.
- Okay. Wait.

298
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:44,992
We just need to find two more.

299
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,100
I can't see.

300
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,203
It's 213.

301
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:01,175

TEAM SNU: 2, TEAM KU: 4

302
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,177
CHECKING

303
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,179
- That's it!
- We got it.

304
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,390
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is one.

305
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,017
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is one.

306
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,524
We're almost there.

307
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,526
- What was the number?
- We've got this.

308
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:22,463
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS
TEAM SNU: 1, TEAM KU: 4

309
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:27,635
Trying to find the wrong answers
really took a toll on me,

310
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,837
so I sighed a lot.

311
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:37,754
I was so exhausted
I didn't think I could go on.

312
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:41,549
But Dong-kyu stayed calm
and kept checking the answers.

313
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:46,253
I was the oldest and a mathematics major,
so I felt responsible.

314
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:49,690
Goodness.

315
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:53,561
Oh, boy.

316
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,064
Come on, let's do this.

317
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,133
Let's go.

318
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,360
Team KU's number
of wrong answers is three.

319
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:02,361
TEAM KU: 3

320
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:11,011
30 MINUTES HAVE PASSED

321
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,017
TEAM SNU AND TEAM KU ARE AT A STANDSTILL

322
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:23,390
THEY CAN PASS ONLY IF THEY GET
ALL 300 QUESTIONS RIGHT

323
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,760
Anything else we need to check?

324
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:27,261
We checked all of them.

325
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,562
- What's left?
- Nothing.

326
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,431
- Give me that. I'll do it.
- Okay.

327
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,141
- Take your time, guys.
- Number 194.

328
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,062
It's 3763.

329
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,439
You got all of them right.

330
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:40,474
Oh, no. Hold on.

331
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,243
- Did you find it?
- They're all correct.

332
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,155
- From number 30...
- Yes.

333
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,048
It's 1464.

334
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,984
So, 153...

335
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:55,915
I went over it three times
and still couldn't find it.

336
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:59,084
It was frustrating to think
of going over all 300 questions.

337
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:00,594
It was exhausting.

338
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:03,213
I was fine physically,
but I was mentally exhausted.

339
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:08,302
I didn't study math enough in school,
and karma is getting back to me.

340
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,267
They can't be all right.

341
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,395
- Did you check this?
- We did.

342
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,480
What is it, then?

343
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,415
What is it?

344
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:25,352
We checked all the answers again together,

345
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:28,238
but we still couldn't reduce
the number of wrong answers.

346
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:31,158
I felt lost.
I didn't know what else to do.

347
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,744
How should we find them now?

348
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,167
They just couldn't find that last one.

349
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,503
We divided the questions into sections,

350
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,632
so in the best-case scenario,
I thought we could finish first.

351
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,811
These are 15, right?

352
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:52,346
- I'll delete them.
- Okay.

353
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:54,014
Then we should have 32, right?

354
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:56,976
- Delete these.
- Yes.

355
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,619
This page is the problem.

356
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,355
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS: 31

357
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:02,648
We still have one wrong.

358
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,400
One of them is wrong.

359
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,944
Cross-check it with someone else.

360
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,329
It's not number 70, right?

361
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:10,948
Can you check them again?

362
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,033
- We have two more here.
- Okay.

363
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,159
Check again.

364
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,236
He says they're all correct.

365
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:18,272
- They're all correct?
- Yes.

366
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,542
I redid the math numerous times.

367
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,004
I checked some of the sections
three or four times.

368
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,549
But it kept telling me it was incorrect.

369
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,888
We have 24.

370
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,181
No, is it 29?
We have a lot of wrong answers.

371
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,727
Shouldn't you check the ones
you didn't solve?

372
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,563
- What? My answers are all correct.
- Yes. I--

373
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,065
- Are you sure?
- I mean the ones from your section.

374
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,818
We went over them again,

375
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:50,613
but it kept telling us there were
three wrong when it should've been one.

376
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,364
It means there's an issue, right?

377
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,378
So 31 minus 15 is...

378

CHECKING

379
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,414
We should have 16 wrong answers.

380
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:02,216
Please.

381
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,250
CHECKING

382
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:04,669
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS: 18

383
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,020
We got two wrong.

384
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,506
Why are there two? I just checked it.

385
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,560
I was taken aback
when we had so many wrong answers.

386
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,099
We checked numbers 270 to 300.

387
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:21,435
Are the answers
from 240 to 270 all correct?

388
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,896
- Yes. You checked them.
- Are you sure?

389
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,539
- Is this all correct?
- Yes.

390
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:28,026
- From 261 to 270.
- From 261 to 270?

391
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,045
These were our answers for 260 to 270.

392
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,374
We hadn't organized the sheets,
so we got confused.

393
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:46,335
We ended up checking the ones
that we'd already checked.

394
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:51,049
We should've organized
the answer sheets more systematically,

395
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,067
but we failed to do that.

NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS

397
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,556
Team KU's number of wrong answers is two.

398

Yes!

399
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:01,600
Yes!

400
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:03,477
Two more to go.

401
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:04,645
We have two left.

402
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,018
What were the orders here?

403
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,445
Let me see. Put it there.

404
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,488
Oh, really?

405
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,198
Yes. So are you checking them?

406
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,825
- Not these ones.
- Check these.

408
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,087
Team Yonsei's number

409
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,297
- That sounds about right.
- Yes.

410
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,009
Team Yonsei's number
of wrong answers is one.

411
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,311
What?

412
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:38,946
What's happening?

413
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,748
Why is this happening to me?

414
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:44,268
It was okay that SNU was ahead of us.

415
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:49,090
But it started becoming an issue
when Yonsei caught up to us.

416
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:53,694
You should've marked them.
This is so confusing.

417
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:54,695
I'm sorry.

418
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:55,654
It's fine.

419
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:57,531
TEAM SNU GETS EDGY
AS TEAM YONSEI CATCHES UP

420
00:19:58,032 --> 00:19:59,232
Which one was this?

421
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:03,270
Guys, I'm inputting the numbers.

422
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:06,373
Keep doing the math.
What's our main goal now?

423
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,176
Do you see the ones we corrected?

424
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,835
Go over those once again.

425
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,295
Okay.

426
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,313
Go over them again, okay?

427
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,633
- Focus on checking the revised ones.
- Okay.

428
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,844
Do you think you can do it fast?

429
00:20:18,928 --> 00:20:20,354
- Let me do it.
- Hurry.

SNU has one left.

00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:34,234
They're solving it one by one.
It's not going to work.

433
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,839
They're solving it one by one.
It's not going to work.

434
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:42,242
It should be 31...

435
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,161
No, 30.

436
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,311
Please.

437
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,512

Great job.

Team Yonsei's number

445
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,734
- Didn't we get it?
- How did we get 30?

446
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:16,777
That's legendary.

447
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:18,612
Hurry. We don't have time for this.

I felt like things were going our way.

00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,397
Team Yonsei's number

475
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:37,791
Team Yonsei takes first place.

TEAM YONSEI

477
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:45,933
I never thought
that we'd end up in the Deathmatch.

478
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:50,496
I needed to pull it together

479
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,774
and find the last wrong answer.

480
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,757
I was surprised to see
the number zero at first.

481
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:03,759
I checked, and it was Team Yonsei.

482
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:05,886
I thought, "This is bad."

483
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,891
I didn't know
what Team Yonsei was doing at first.

484
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,893
- Ji-soo.
- What?

485
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:14,770
I just had a good idea.

486
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:16,605
- Shall we try Yonsei's way?
- How?

487
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:17,998
Look.

488
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:21,861
If we delete 30 answers and get 32 errors,
it means there are no errors on this page.

489
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:23,779
They did delete 30.

490
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:26,782
- Everyone is finding them by pages.
- Yes.

491
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,408
It's only ten pages, right?

492
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,244
It's a piece of cake.

493
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,538
This is faster
than recalculating all of them.

Let's try one page at a time.

00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:45,676
- One page at a time.
- We have no choice.

499
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,511
- It's not our fault.
- Put zeros in all of them.

500
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,805
Are you sure about this?

501
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:52,099
- Let's try.
- This is our only choice.

502
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,100
Right.

00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,615
- From 271 to 300?
- Start from the bottom.

527
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,367
- I'll work my way up.
- Okay.

528
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,396
- We have two sets left.
- It won't take long.

529
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,098
- We can still find it.
- Right.

530
00:24:57,698 --> 00:24:58,632
Where?

531
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,376
TEAM SNU FOUND THE SECTION
WITH THE WRONG ANSWER

532
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,377
- Where?
- I found it.

533
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:03,003
Between numbers 181 to 210.

534
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,106
- Where?
- I found it.

535
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,132
Numbers 181 to 210.

536
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:07,383
- Where?
- I found it.

537
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:08,443
Numbers 181 to 210.

538
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:09,444
Input these.

539
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,844
I'll input them.

540
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,579
- Do you want to do it?
- I did it.

541
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:14,681
- Where is it?
- I'll go from 181.

542
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:16,451
Give me the answer sheets.

543
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,119
I need the answer sheets.

544
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,353
Hurry.

545
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,022
I'll do numbers 201 to 210.

546
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,565
I'll start from number 181.

547
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:25,259
Stay calm.

548
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,823
- It's either 286 or 287.
- It's 286 or 287.

549
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,468
- What?
- ...number of wrong answers is 13.

550
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,470
Did you check number 286?

551
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,537
It's either number 286 or 287.

552
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:40,674
- I feel dizzy.
- Where's the answer sheet?

553
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,419
Can I compare my answers
with the answer sheet?

554
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,505
I have to organize these.

555
00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:47,681
- These?
- Take these two first.

556
00:25:48,424 --> 00:25:50,176
- I'll give them to you once I find them.
- Okay.

557
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:51,652
- If they're--
- From 201 to 210.

558
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,053
If they're missing, solve it.

559
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:56,390
- I'll organize them and give them to you.
- Hold on.

560
00:25:58,326 --> 00:25:59,393
- We got it.
- We did?

561
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:00,686
It's done.

562
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:02,062
Come. Check them together.

563
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:03,230
It's over.

564
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:04,398
You input them fast.

565
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:05,525
Input them now.

566
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,276
- I found the error.
- I'll read it to you.

567
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:11,071
Start from number 75.

568
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:12,973
We have to check together.

569
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:16,511
Do you remember number 286?

570
00:26:16,944 --> 00:26:18,346
Number 286? It's 640.

571
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,182
- I got 660, though.
- It's 660.

572
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,383
Hang on. Number 293.

573
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,717
- That's 89951.
- Okay.

574
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:25,386
Next, 3248.

575
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:26,628
Please.

576
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,255
Please be correct.

577
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:29,857
Please.

578
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:37,365
CHECKING

579
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:39,534
- Yes!
- Way to go!

580
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,236
- Yes!
- Way to go!

581
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:44,539
- Yes!
- Way to go!

582
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,440
This is it!

583
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,109
- That was insane.
- Did you get it?

584
00:26:49,444 --> 00:26:51,571
Team KU's number of wrong answers is zero.

585
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,514
Team KU places second.

586
00:26:55,149 --> 00:26:57,418
Don't be so loud. It's rude.

587
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:06,461
It's interesting that the top two
are KU and Yonsei.

588
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:09,630
- They really are rivals.
- Team SNU might be eliminated.

589
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,831
We don't know yet.

590
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:12,716
They must be anxious.

591
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,303
It's better if Team SNU goes
to the Deathmatch.

592
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:17,721
It's one less team we have to worry about.

593
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:22,976
Thank you. You guys were great.

594
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:29,350
- I did a lifetime's worth of multiplying.
- I'm so done.

595
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:33,087
Team SNU must be so upset.

596
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:37,658
They have one wrong answer,
and they've been stuck for an hour.

597
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:38,759
It's 1,7?

598
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:42,229
It's 10399, 821476.

599
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:49,170
We're so exhausted that we won't be able
to perform well on the Deathmatch.

600
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,547
We need to avoid it at all costs.

601
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:52,881
Tell me if I'm wrong.

602
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:53,824
You two check.

603
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:55,884
- I'll be rechecking the answers.
- Okay.

604
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,012
- I'll erase these.
- Yes.

605
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:00,281
- It's 1, 2, 3...
- And 8, 2, 1...

606
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:02,016
It's 853.

607
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:03,225
- That's all.
- Is it?

608
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:04,485
- That's it.
- Next.

609
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:08,397
TEAM SNU SUBMITTED THEIR REVISED ANSWERS
Please. I beg you.

610
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:14,403
Team SNU's number of wrong answers...

611
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,573
Team SNU's number of wrong answers...

612
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:25,956
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is one.

613
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:27,875
- What?
- Is that wrong?

614
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:29,585
- Hold up.
- What did you fix?

615
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:32,713
What?

616
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:35,216
- Team SNU might go to the Deathmatch.
- No way.

617
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,426
Team SNU's number of wrong answers is one.

618
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,987
They haven't found it yet.

619
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:40,921
Didn't you--

620
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:42,598
- I would have cried.
- Honestly.

621
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,724
One of you...

622
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,662
It's not over until it's over,
so we kept doing what we could.

623
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:51,499
We tried to finish before Team SNU did.

624
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,984
They might never
be able to find the last one,

625
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,361
so we had to do our best.

626
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:58,772
We still had a shot, and I was hopeful.

627
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:04,745
Wait. Did I miscalculate it?

628
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:09,166
We had to input the answers in the boxes
where we previously put zeros.

629
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,254
There was one answer that bothered me
when we input the answers,

630
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,963
but I looked past it.

631
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:18,825
When we got one wrong answer,
I decided to check that one.

632
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,179
Wait, guys. I found it.

633
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:23,264
- You did?
- What is it?

634
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,898
- Hang on.
- Take your time.

635
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,102
This one. Number 123.

636
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:29,019
- What?
- Number 123.

637
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:30,571
It's 2340.

638
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:32,189
- The answer is 2340?
- Yes, 2340.

639
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:34,942
We're done.

640
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:36,736
Can we get cool background music?

641
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:45,911
CHECKING
NUMBER OF WRONG ANSWERS: 0

642
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:52,359
- We did it!
- Finally.

643
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:57,005
Great work.

644
00:29:57,097 --> 00:29:58,424
You're the ace today.

645
00:29:58,499 --> 00:29:59,533
Good job, guys.

646
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:01,935
Team SNU's number
of wrong answers is zero.

647
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:03,971
Team SNU places third.

648
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:10,978
Our goal was to be the champion,

649
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:13,314
so I didn't imagine
we'd go to the Deathmatch.

650
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:15,916
That was not part of my plan.

651
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:19,754
We'll beat KAIST and remain in the game,

652
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:21,756
so we'll prepare well for the Deathmatch.

653
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:25,225
The Main Match, 300, has ended.

654
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:29,096
First place, Team Yonsei.

655
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,964
Second place, Team KU.

656
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:33,367
Team SNU takes third place.

657
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,629
The other two teams,
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

658
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:38,005
KAIST AND POSTECH FACE ELIMINATION

659
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:47,615
The first Deathmatch
of Elite League will now begin.

660
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,527
People would think that it was staged.

661
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,738
How did KAIST and POSTECH
end up competing?

662
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:08,745
THE BEST SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING COLLEGES
IN KOREA FIGHT FOR THEIR PRIDE

663
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,083
KAIST is the best engineering school.

664
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,501
We'll teach them a lesson.

665
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:18,512
POSTECH is our biggest rival.

666
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,048
Of course, KAIST must win.

667
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:22,650
That's a given.

668
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,885
There's no room for compromise.

669
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:27,054
I want to win. No, I have to win.

670
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:31,759
A fated battle.

671
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:33,811
We must beat KAIST, no matter what.

672
00:31:34,437 --> 00:31:35,605
We met the right match.

673
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:37,981
Team POSTECH is ready
to destroy Team KAIST.

674
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:41,469
We'll beat Team KAIST on day one.

675
00:31:44,572 --> 00:31:48,576
The first Deathmatch
of Elite League is Formula Archery.

676
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:50,578
FORMULA ARCHERY

677
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:51,846
In Formula Archery,

678
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:54,915
you must use four numbers
and math operators

679
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:58,419
to make the target number
on the target board.

680
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,856
You win if you earn 25 points first.

681
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:07,461
Each team gets 2 sets of number cards
that ranges from 1 to 6.

682
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:12,600
Then you'll choose two cards
from the deck and show them

683
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:14,226
to the opposing team.

684
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:17,938
Using the 4 numbers
submitted by the 2 teams

685
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,357
and the given operators,

686
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:23,444
you must form
the target number on the target board.

687
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:24,612
TARGET NUMBER 333

688
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:28,482
However, all numbers can only be used
as a single-digit number.

689
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:33,020
The number cards and operators
can be used more than once.

690
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,706
The team that makes the formula

691
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:39,393
should ring the bell and say
the target number in three seconds.

692
00:32:39,894 --> 00:32:43,063
Then hold up the board
to show the finished formula.

693
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:46,634
You get one point
for getting numbers in the white area,

694
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:48,969
two points for the black area,

695
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:50,872
three points for the blue area,

696
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:52,890
four points for the red area,

697
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:55,685
and you get five points
for the yellow area.

698
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:57,545
WHITE: 1, BLACK: 2, BLUE: 3
RED: 4, YELLOW: 5

699
00:32:57,645 --> 00:33:01,883
Also, if you create formulas
for three adjacent numbers,

700
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:05,085
you get two extra points.

701
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,823
It'll be more important
to figure out the opponent's plan

702
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,491
instead of just doing the math.

703
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:13,160
This is a game for engineering majors.

704
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:14,620
This is going to be intense.

705
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,630
It's pretty much the finals.

706
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,042
It's finally my time to shine.

707
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,378
It's a chance to knock out KAIST.

708
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:27,474
Please get ready for the Deathmatch.

709
00:33:28,275 --> 00:33:29,343
Let's go to our room.

710
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:30,444
Let's go.

711
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:32,722
Let's do this.

712
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:34,264
Let's go.

713
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:35,883
Let's do this.

714
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,854
We can do this.

715
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,230
It sounds fun.

716
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:43,657
- It's starting to get interesting.
- Finally.

717
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,825
Let's beat them.

718
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,894
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

719
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:48,404
Big numbers.

720
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:50,531
We need to be prepared for big numbers.

721
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:54,660
We could think of formulas
for some square numbers in advance.

722
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:56,771
We can come up with a few beforehand.

723
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:58,288
Get 17 squared.

724
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,082
Write down 23 squared too.

725
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:02,175
And 27 and 29.

726
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,579
We tried to come up
with as many possibilities as we could

727
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,047
for each number.

728
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,217
What's 19 squared?

729
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,260
It's 361.

730
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:13,012
- Did you do that in your head?
- Yes.

731
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:15,355
- You're starting to scare me.
- What?

732
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:19,268
- I wrote down up to 6 to the power of 6.
- Me too.

733
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:22,062
- Good.
- Writing down as many as possible

734
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:24,799
will help you get used to
the square numbers.

735
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:29,528
Putting exponents in parentheses
can be tricky to think of on the spot.

736
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:32,865
For example, 2 to the power of 1 plus 6.

737
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,658
You can get 2 to the power of 7.

738
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:36,944
- I see.
- It might not come to you on the spot.

739
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:41,716
We should keep in mind
that you can use power to another power.

740
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:46,286
For example, 2 to the power of 3
to the power of 5.

741
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:48,255
Then we can make quite a lot.

742
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:52,718
The extra points for getting
three adjacent numbers seem important too.

743
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:55,304
We get 2 more points
for getting 3 adjacent ones.

744
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:56,639
One-pointers are easy,

745
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:59,500
so we can secure extra points
from one-pointers.

746
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:03,145
They'll be worried
when we get three in a row.

747
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:06,190
If they try to win points in a row,
we must stop them.

748
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:09,543
Right. You get 2 more points
if you get 3 adjacent targets.

749
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:11,412
TEAM KAIST

750
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:12,822
TEAM POSTECH

751
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:15,407
SO-YUL, MIN-SUB, JAE-YOON, HYUN-SOO

752
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:18,243
HYUN-JI, JUN-HYUK, SEO-YEON, SUNG-BUM

753
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:19,203
FORMULA ARCHERY

754
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:23,041
Contestants, please come
to the Main Hall for the Deathmatch.

755
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:35,903
Let's do this.

756
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:40,975
- I'm nervous.
- I wonder what their tactic is.

757
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:49,984
Formula Archery.

758
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:52,486
Here's the target board.

759
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,409
- It's 1.25?
- There are decimals?

760
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:01,037
It'd definitely be better
to target the white area.

761
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:02,872
I can't even dare to try the middle ones.

762
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:04,231
None of them work.

763
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:06,709
Shouldn't we start with the big numbers?

764
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:08,794
Mark the ones you have the formulas for.

765
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:11,714
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP

766
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:13,382
How are they supposed to do it?

767
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:16,594
How do you get 8388610 using 4 numbers?

768
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,012
The yellow area is insane.

769
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,547
It's 8388610? That's totally unexpected.

770
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,641
- So, it's 838...
- What are its factors?

771
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:25,144
- This is making me dizzy.
- Right?

772
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:29,490
Both teams, submit two cards each.

773
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:33,694
That's worth one point, right?

774
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,320
This is the only one.

775
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:37,865
Seo-yeon, keep your hand on the bell.

776
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:39,158
We can get negative two, too.

777
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:43,537
We'll get the formulas
for white and black areas on the spot.

778
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,707
And we'll calculate
the blue ones in advance

779
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:49,001
and keep submitting cards
for those until we get them.

780
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:50,611
Which ones?

781
00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:52,180
- These two?
- I agree.

782
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:55,582
Both teams, submit two cards each.

783
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,458
One, two, three.

784
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:07,770
Team KAIST submitted 1 and 5.

785
00:37:07,862 --> 00:37:10,606
Team POSTECH submitted 1 and 4.

786
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:12,942
Please use the operators
to make the formulas.

787
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:14,860
TEAM KAIST RINGS THE BELL
BEFORE THE EXPLANATION ENDED

788
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,504
That was quick.

789
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:20,374
The target number is one.

790
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:25,079
It's 1 to the power of 1 to the power
of 4 to the power of 5 to get 1.

791
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:26,714
Team KAIST,

792
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:28,582
that is correct.

793
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:31,652
Team KAIST has earned one point.

794
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:35,723
They were quick at math.

795
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,191
I got anxious.

796
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,960
I realized that I had to focus.

797
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:43,965
Both teams, please submit new cards.

798
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:47,476
- Anything we can get right away?
- Well...

799
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,393
Put 1 and 3.

800
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:51,705
Wait. You hold them.

801
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:54,875
Any ideas? We need a strategy.

802
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,079
Let's try and make negative two.

803
00:37:58,146 --> 00:37:59,404
Negative 2 or negative 7.

804
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:00,681
Or 1.25.

805
00:38:04,218 --> 00:38:07,121
Both teams, submit two cards each.

806
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:09,790
Team KAIST submitted 1 and 3.

807
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,392
TEAM POSTECH: 2, 5
TEAM KAIST: 1, 3

808
00:38:16,172 --> 00:38:17,297
Team KAIST.

809
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:19,700
Our target number is negative two.

810
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,468
You're targeting negative two.

811
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:26,682
One to the power of 2 plus 5
and subtract 3 to get negative 2.

812
00:38:26,774 --> 00:38:28,642
TARGET NUMBER: NEGATIVE 2

813
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,077
That is correct.

814
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:33,948
Team KAIST has earned two points so far.

815
00:38:34,548 --> 00:38:39,086
TEAM KAIST USED POWER OF 1 TWICE IN A ROW

816
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:41,197
I was obsessed with winning strategies.

817
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:43,282
I think I figured something out.

818
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:45,693
When they ask us to submit the next cards,

819
00:38:46,227 --> 00:38:49,997
we might have to submit
the cards that we need.

820
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:53,134
But we can't predict what they'll submit.

821
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:54,501
But we can make it

822
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:57,004
- difficult for them if we put one.
- Right.

823
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:58,405
Like 1 to the power of 3.

824
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,775
We were making powers of one.

825
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:04,845
When we submit number one,

826
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:08,282
we can use their cards
to make powers of one anyway.

827
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:12,053
That way, we can earn
a few points before they do.

828
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:14,288
That's their plan.

829
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,991
They'll put out 1 and take out 3.

830
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:18,567
Okay.

831
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:20,903
TEAM POSTECH FIGURED OUT
TEAM KAIST'S TACTIC

832
00:39:20,987 --> 00:39:23,463
What else can you make with one?
Negative 1 over 2?

833
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:26,567
They realized
that we've been submitting one.

834
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:28,119
We should try something else.

835
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:30,704
Shouldn't we stop them from getting 1.25?

836
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:32,173
We should. Yes.

837
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,626
IF TEAM KAIST GETS 1.25,
THEY GET AN EXTRA 2 POINTS

838
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:39,780
Both teams, submit two cards each.

839
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:45,385
BOTH TEAMS ARE TARGETING 1.25

840
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:48,097
Both teams, submit two cards each.

841
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:49,890
One, two, three.

842
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:52,526
TEAM POSTECH: 5, 4
TEAM KAIST: 5, 4

843
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:53,527
Good.

844
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:56,856
What's your target number?

845
00:39:57,965 --> 00:39:59,066
It's 1.25.

846
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,301
It's 1.25.

847
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:04,238
With 5 divided by 4 times 5 minus 4,
we'll make 1.25.

848
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:07,241
That is correct.

849
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:12,246
Team KAIST got three adjacent numbers,

850
00:40:12,346 --> 00:40:14,790
so you get two extra points.

851
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:16,884
TEAM POSTECH: 0
TEAM KAIST: 5

852
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:19,086
- It's bad.
- I know.

853
00:40:20,129 --> 00:40:21,505
Team KAIST is going to win.

854
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,090
They got a head start on them.

855
00:40:23,457 --> 00:40:24,491
Team KAIST scares me.

856
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:26,260
They certainly are.

857
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,829
How do they do that in such a short time?

858
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:32,933
I guess they can do the math
as soon as they see numbers.

859
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:36,103
Both teams will now get ready.

860
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:37,313
Let's do this one.

861
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:38,906
We can get it with one.

862
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:41,275
We can get this target number with these.

863
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,377
I made two sets of these.

864
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:44,412
Let's use this.

865
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:46,513
Okay.

866
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:49,483
We have to predict their target.

867
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,751
We'll get 37.

868
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:53,887
- Should we submit 6 and 2 to get 37?
- Yes.

869
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:55,156
Let's do 6 and 2.

870
00:40:55,256 --> 00:40:59,559
TEAM POSTECH WILL TARGET 37
BY USING THE SQUARE OF 6

871
00:41:03,864 --> 00:41:06,533
Both teams, submit two cards each.

872
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,236
One, two, three.

873
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,405
One, two, three.

874
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,472
One, two, three.

875
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,608
They're going first.

876
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:16,043
Team POSTECH,

877
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,711
what's your target?

878
00:41:18,346 --> 00:41:19,980
Our target number is 37.

879
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:21,182
Target number 37.

880
00:41:21,882 --> 00:41:24,952
We got 6 to the power of 2 plus 6
minus 5 to get 37.

881
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:28,030
They're right.

882
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:29,690
Yes, that is correct.

883
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,127
Team POSTECH has earned one point.

884
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:36,730
Please get ready for the next one.

885
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,334
Let's submit 3 and 6 to make 18.

886
00:41:41,035 --> 00:41:42,937
Then, add 1 to get 19.

887
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:45,706
We'll make the number one, no matter what.

888
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,944
Team KAIST used powers of 1
to turn all the numbers into 1

889
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:51,553
and got their targets.

890
00:41:51,645 --> 00:41:54,648
We'll use their strategy to get them.

891
00:41:55,582 --> 00:41:57,151
If they submit one...

892
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:59,019
- Then do 1 to the power of 3.
- Yes.

893
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,922
- We'll make number one for sure this way.
- Right.

894
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:05,901
I don't know. Hang on.

895
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,661
Let me do it my way.

896
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:09,322
We should try to do this way.

897
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,303
Let's just think on our feet.

898
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:20,475
Both teams, submit two cards each.

899
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,809
One, two, three.

900
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:25,480
TEAM KAIST SUBMITTED NUMBER 1 AS EXPECTED

901
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:26,847
One, two, three.

902
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:29,250
Three.

903
00:42:29,616 --> 00:42:32,052
You've submitted 3 and 6, and 6 and 1.

904
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:34,522
Team POSTECH rang the bell first.

905
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:37,057
The target number is 19.

906
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:39,827
Your target number is 19.

907
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,097
With 6 times 3 plus 1 to the power 6,
we'll make 19.

908
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:44,815
Yes, that is correct.

909
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,275
TEAM POSTECH: 2
TEAM KAIST: 5

910
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,528
We still have a shot. We can do it.

911
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:51,839
We might be able to turn it around
if we don't rush.

912
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:56,110
Let's submit 3 and 5 and target 45.

913
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:58,120
I'm sure it'll work.

914
00:42:58,204 --> 00:42:59,872
TRYING TO STOP TEAM POSTECH
FROM EARNING EXTRA POINTS

915
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:01,374
You can get 45 with 3 and 5?

916
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:02,517
Probably.

917
00:43:07,522 --> 00:43:09,857
Both teams, submit two cards each.

918
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:10,891
One, two, three.

919
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,393
One, two, three.

920
00:43:12,826 --> 00:43:13,928
Three and two.

921
00:43:14,028 --> 00:43:15,938
And Team KAIST submitted 3 and 5.

922
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:17,932
And Team KAIST submitted 3 and 5.

923
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:19,066
Team KAIST.

924
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:20,334
We get three seconds.

925
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:21,643
Three seconds.

926
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:23,479
- Target--
- Three seconds have passed.

927
00:43:23,563 --> 00:43:25,273
It's Team POSTECH's turn now.

928
00:43:25,873 --> 00:43:27,542
- We have to write it.
- Write it now.

929
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:29,569
Just write it. It'll be our turn again.

930
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,078
It's our turn.

931
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:32,321
We have ten seconds to write it.

932
00:43:32,405 --> 00:43:33,655
TEAM POSTECH GETS 10 SECONDS

933
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:35,316
It's Team POSTECH's turn.

934
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,218
Our target is 216.

935
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:39,320
Target number 216.

936
00:43:40,388 --> 00:43:41,489
Twelve, fifteen...

937
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:45,560
It's 3 plus 3 to the power of 5 minus 2,

938
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:48,229
which is 6 to the power of 3. That's 216.

939
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:49,196
TARGET NUMBER 216

940
00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:50,764
That is correct.

941
00:43:51,932 --> 00:43:53,234
Team POSTECH

942
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:56,303
gets one more point.

943
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:57,638
You've earned three points.

944
00:43:57,738 --> 00:43:59,348
TEAM POSTECH: 3
TEAM KAIST: 5

945
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,610
It felt like we hit our stride,

946
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:05,513
so I thought we could keep earning points.

947
00:44:06,247 --> 00:44:09,149
I'm a math major,
so I had a lot on my shoulders.

948
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:11,486
It was too much pressure
to remember anything.

949
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,992
No, I'll do it.

950
00:44:18,092 --> 00:44:19,494
- No, these.
- What?

951
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,262
I can make it if it's 1, 2, or 3.

952
00:44:22,163 --> 00:44:23,764
Anything from 1 to 3.

953
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:24,999
Can you write it fast?

954
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:27,168
- Hold the pen.
- Yes, hold it.

955
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:28,235
Seo-yeon.

956
00:44:29,736 --> 00:44:30,804
- Ring it or not?
- Good?

957
00:44:30,904 --> 00:44:32,106
Are we good to go?

958
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:38,212
Both teams, submit two cards each.

959
00:44:40,914 --> 00:44:43,117
Exceeding the time limit was my fault.

960
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:45,586
I thought I had to do better
and make up for it.

961
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,123
Both teams, submit two cards each.

962
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,924
One, two, three.

963
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:53,327
One, two, three.

964
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:58,366
You've submitted 3 and 5, and 5 and 3.

965
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,569
You've submitted 3 and 5, and 5 and 3.

966
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:05,005
Team KAIST.

967
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,275
- Our target is 45.
- You've had your 3 seconds.

968
00:45:08,376 --> 00:45:09,918
- What?
- Three seconds have passed.

969
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:15,049
You've submitted 3 and 5, and 5 and 3.

970
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:17,017
Team KAIST.

971
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:19,153
Our target is 45.

972
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:22,323
It's Team POSTECH's turn now.

973
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:24,858
- But--
- What's your target?

974
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:26,727
Our target is 45.

975
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:27,936
- Is it 45?
- Yes.

976
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:29,697
Submit your answer.

977
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,400
It's 3 to the power of 5 minus 3 times 5.

978
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,634
That is correct.

979
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:38,906
Team POSTECH also got
three adjacent numbers right,

980
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:41,442
so you've earned two extra points.

981
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:44,545
TEAM POSTECH: 6
TEAM KAIST: 5

982
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:46,146
Come on.

983
00:45:46,247 --> 00:45:47,498
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

984
00:45:47,582 --> 00:45:49,517
Just ring the bell as you write it.

985
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:51,460
- Don't ring it and write it.
- Right.

986
00:45:51,552 --> 00:45:53,688
- That was your fault.
- Just write it first. It's all right.

987
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:55,047
- Hey, calm down.
- It's okay.

988
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:57,057
This is not a war.

989
00:45:57,425 --> 00:45:58,959
We can get bigger points.

990
00:46:00,386 --> 00:46:02,471
Let's not get worked up over one-pointers.

991
00:46:04,432 --> 00:46:06,701
We lost the lead
because of timing mistakes.

992
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:08,769
I felt more and more nervous.

993
00:46:12,072 --> 00:46:14,542
Both teams, submit two cards each.

994
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,009
One, two, three.

995
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:19,012
It's 6 and 4, and 6 and 1.

996
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,414
Team POSTECH.

997
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:21,915
- Ring it.
- ...and 6 and 1.

998
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:23,534
Team POSTECH.

999
00:46:23,618 --> 00:46:24,518
Team POSTECH.

1000
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,622
Our target is 15.

1001
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:28,756
Your target is 15.

1002
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:31,592
It's 6 plus 4 plus 6 minus 1.

1003
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:32,960
That is correct.

1004
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,796
I missed number five.

1005
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:36,922
I missed additions.

1006
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:39,066
- I know, right?
- Me too, but you reminded me.

1007
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:40,167
That's a relief.

1008
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:43,537
Team POSTECH has earned one point.

1009
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:45,439
How are they doing it?

1010
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,674
They're fast.

1011
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,746
I was frustrated and worried.

1012
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:57,050
I could see them earning points,
so I was worried.

1013
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:00,154
- How about these...
- Let's put 1 and 5.

1014
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:01,697
They'll hand in 6 or 3.

1015
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:02,856
Submit those.

1016
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:05,660
There. We found it.

1017
00:47:06,527 --> 00:47:07,995
But the rest...

1018
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:09,229
What about the rest?

1019
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:10,364
I got it.

1020
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:13,626
Ring the bell only when I tell you to.

1021
00:47:18,673 --> 00:47:21,275
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1022
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:22,610
One, two, three.

1023
00:47:23,277 --> 00:47:24,578
One, two, three.

1024
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:27,648
You've submitted 3 and 6, and 1 and 5.

1025
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:28,716
Team KAIST.

1026
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,720
Our target is 7777.

1027
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,759
It's 6 to the power of 5
and 1 to the power of 3.

1028
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,695
That is correct.

1029
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:43,239
Is 6 to the power of 5 equal to 7776?

1030
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:45,899
Team KAIST,

1031
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:48,135
you've earned two points.

1032
00:47:48,335 --> 00:47:49,837
TEAM POSTECH: 7
TEAM KAIST: 7

1033
00:47:49,903 --> 00:47:51,672
- It must be nerve-racking.
- Indeed.

1034
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:53,507
It's 7 to 7.

1035
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,611
I hope Team KAIST loses.

1036
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,846
We can't go against those geniuses.

1037
00:47:58,912 --> 00:47:59,922
I want both out.

1038
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:01,115
Me too.

1039
00:48:04,844 --> 00:48:06,520
Let's make 5 to the power of 4.

1040
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:07,930
What is that?

1041
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:09,457
It's 15625.

1042
00:48:09,757 --> 00:48:10,933
No, it's the power of 6.

1043
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:14,495
TEAM POSTECH IS AFTER 15625

1044
00:48:14,562 --> 00:48:15,772
- It's 5 to the power of 6.
- Yes.

1045
00:48:15,863 --> 00:48:18,691
So we make 5 to the power of 3
and multiply it by 2.

1046
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:20,668
So, we make two with theirs?

1047
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:22,936
Please.

1048
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:32,012
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1049
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:35,249
Do you have an idea?

1050
00:48:35,316 --> 00:48:36,208
- Yes.
- We're ready.

1051
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:37,668
Team KAIST is ready.

1052
00:48:39,186 --> 00:48:41,889
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1053
00:48:47,328 --> 00:48:48,696
One, two, three.

1054
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:52,767
You've submitted 5 and 3, and 5 and 1.

1055
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,902
Five, three, five... Wait.

1056
00:48:58,272 --> 00:48:59,239
We're ready.

1057
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,109
We're ready.

1058
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:03,210
Team KAIST.

1059
00:49:03,811 --> 00:49:06,238
Our target number is 15625.

1060
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:12,286
With 5 to the power of the factorial of 3,
we made 15625

1061
00:49:12,553 --> 00:49:14,580
and multiplied it by 1 to the power of 3

1062
00:49:14,747 --> 00:49:16,332
to get 15625 in the black area.

1063
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:18,559
Your target number is 15625.

1064
00:49:18,893 --> 00:49:19,894
That is correct.

1065
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:22,839
Team KAIST has earned two points.

1066
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,632
TEAM POSTECH: 7
TEAM KAIST: 9

1067
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:27,468
Team KAIST was thinking
of the same formula.

1068
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:28,803
It was a bummer.

1069
00:49:29,537 --> 00:49:31,906
Our winning strategy was slightly ruined,

1070
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:35,142
but I thought it was critical
to keep my head in the game.

1071
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,645
What are they going for?

1072
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,732
They'll probably try
to stop us from getting our target.

1073
00:49:46,587 --> 00:49:47,722
But they...

1074
00:49:48,522 --> 00:49:50,491
- They only use 3, 5, and 6.
- We need to make 4.

1075
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:52,426
- They are?
- So...

1076
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:55,362
- What can we make, then?
- Team POSTECH, are you ready?

1077
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,764
Should we bet?

1078
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:58,666
Let's make it then write it.

1079
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,436
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1080
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:03,771
One, two, three.

1081
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:05,172
One, two, three.

1082
00:50:05,606 --> 00:50:08,075
You've submitted 6 and 6, and 4 and 1.

1083
00:50:08,442 --> 00:50:10,811
They're 6 and 6. Divide 6 by 6.

1084
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:14,515
Do 5 times 6 plus 4 plus 1.

1085
00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:15,716
Ring the bell.

1086
00:50:16,149 --> 00:50:18,419
Team POSTECH, what's your target?

1087
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:21,188
- Our target is 66.
- It's 66.

1088
00:50:21,288 --> 00:50:22,356
- Yes, 66.
- Yes, 66.

1089
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,460
Our formula is 6 times 6 plus 4 plus 1.

1090
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:28,395
That is correct.

1091
00:50:28,629 --> 00:50:32,466
Team POSTECH got three adjacent numbers,

1092
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:34,451
so you've earned two extra points.

1093
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:35,619
TEAM POSTECH: 10
TEAM KAIST: 9

1094
00:50:35,703 --> 00:50:37,204
- It's 10 to 9.
- It's 10 to 9?

1095
00:50:37,304 --> 00:50:39,006
It's such a close game.

1096
00:50:39,273 --> 00:50:40,407
POSTECH is killing it.

1097
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:44,545
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1098
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:45,746
One, two, three.

1099
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,648
They're 3, 4, 1, and 4.

1100
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:48,883
- It's this, right?
- Yes.

1101
00:50:48,983 --> 00:50:50,818
- Ring it.
- Target number.

1102
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:52,519
Our target is 2.25.

1103
00:50:52,954 --> 00:50:56,523
With 3 times 4 minus 1 divided by 4,
we got 9 over 4.

1104
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,959
That is correct.

1105
00:50:58,626 --> 00:51:00,761
- Our target is negative 7.
- Negative 7.

1106
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,631
With 3 minus 1 minus 4 minus 5,
we got negative 7.

1107
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:04,866
That's correct.

1108
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:06,034
Yes!

1109
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,938
Team POSTECH has earned one point.

1110
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,407
Is it 4, 6 to the power of 3?

1111
00:51:13,507 --> 00:51:14,742
We win with these two.

1112
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:16,577
Either these two or these two.

1113
00:51:17,045 --> 00:51:18,078
Then we win.

1114
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:21,499
It's fine.
We're not even close to 25 points.

1115
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,686
At this rate, we'll lose.

1116
00:51:25,753 --> 00:51:27,797
I couldn't let that happen,

1117
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:29,957
so I got into it more desperately.

1118
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:32,626
We have to win.

1119
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,962
I know there will be a way to win.

1120
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,099
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1121
00:51:43,004 --> 00:51:44,171
One, two, three.

1122
00:51:44,471 --> 00:51:47,008
They're 2, 2, 3, and 4.

1123
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:48,676
They're 2, 2, 3, and 4?

1124
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:50,878
TEAM POSTECH: 3, 4
TEAM KAIST: 2, 2

1125
00:51:58,586 --> 00:52:00,021
Multiply it by four.

1126
00:52:00,354 --> 00:52:02,498
- No, we don't have 3.
- It's 3 times 2 times 2.

1127
00:52:03,357 --> 00:52:04,291
Did we get it?

1128
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:05,559
No, we don't have four.

1129
00:52:06,002 --> 00:52:07,169
No, we don't have four.

1130
00:52:07,962 --> 00:52:10,998
- Wait. I want to go.
- What?

1131
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:12,566
Just write it.

1132
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:13,868
- I'll go.
- Write first.

1133
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:19,740
What's your target, Team KAIST?

1134
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,376
Our target number is 716.

1135
00:52:22,576 --> 00:52:23,577
It's 716.

1136
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:28,582
The factorial of factorial of 3
minus 4 times 2 divided by 2.

1137
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:30,526
That's right.

1138
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:31,552
That's correct.

1139
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:37,825
The factorial of factorial of three.
I never thought of that.

1140
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:40,202
The factorial of factorial of three.

1141
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:44,498
We would have been destroyed
had we placed lower than third.

1142
00:52:44,598 --> 00:52:46,199
- I'm so shocked right now.
- Me too.

1143
00:52:46,634 --> 00:52:47,668
They're so creative.

1144
00:52:50,755 --> 00:52:52,882
1 HOUR AGO
FORMULA ARCHERY STRATEGY MEETING

1145
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:54,967
We get 720 with 3 factorial's factorial.

1146
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:56,677
- If there's such a number,
- Or this.

1147
00:52:56,777 --> 00:52:58,512
- will we submit it with one?
- Yes.

1148
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:00,598
We can use
the factorial of factorial of three.

1149
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:01,891
Man, he's smart.

1150
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:03,084
You're a genius.

1151
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,791
Team KAIST has earned three points.

1152
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:12,568
TEAM POSTECH: 13
TEAM KAIST: 12

1153
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:15,663
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1154
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:18,565
One, two, three.

1155
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,334
They're 2, 2, 2, and 2.

1156
00:53:20,618 --> 00:53:22,036
They're 2, 2, 2, and 2.

1157
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:24,246
- They're 2, 2, 2, and 2.
- It's 2, 2... It's crazy.

1158
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,040
TEAM POSTECH: 2, 2
TEAM KAIST: 2, 2

1159
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,175
They're all two?

1160
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:33,881
What? Hold up.

1161
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:39,954
Team POSTECH.

1162
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:41,856
Team POSTECH.

1163
00:53:42,156 --> 00:53:43,157
What's your target?

1164
00:53:43,824 --> 00:53:45,826
Our target is negative 0.5.

1165
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:47,352
Target number negative 0.5.

1166
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:49,897
It's 2 divided by 2 minus 2 divided by 2.

1167
00:53:49,964 --> 00:53:53,333
Your answer is
2 divided by 2 minus 2 divided by 2.

1168
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:56,403
That is correct. You've earned a point.

1169
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,808
We had the lead,

1170
00:54:01,008 --> 00:54:04,444
so I thought we could win
if we kept it up.

1171
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:06,747
Let's submit 2 and 2.

1172
00:54:07,514 --> 00:54:08,749
Which one is the highest?

1173
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:10,450
Let's do something we can get.

1174
00:54:10,784 --> 00:54:11,719
Go for 244.

1175
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:20,178
I think they'll submit 2 and 2.

1176
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,054
It seems like they're contemplating.

1177
00:54:22,797 --> 00:54:23,898
Or not.

1178
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:27,367
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1179
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:28,702
One, two, three.

1180
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:30,738
They're 2, 2, 2, and 2.

1181
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:32,640
TEAM POSTECH: 2, 2
TEAM KAIST: 2, 2

1182
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:34,075
Oh, no.

1183
00:54:34,142 --> 00:54:35,193
Oh, this won't work.

1184
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:37,111
BOTH TEAMS SUBMITTED
THE SAME NUMBERS TWICE IN A ROW

1185
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:40,114
We submitted the same ones,
doubting that they would

1186
00:54:40,181 --> 00:54:41,715
submit the same ones.

1187
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,259
Minus...

1188
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:52,660
Team KAIST.

1189
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,495
Team KAIST.

1190
00:54:55,196 --> 00:54:57,297
Our target is negative 1.5.

1191
00:54:57,431 --> 00:54:58,833
Target number negative 1.5.

1192
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:02,069
It's 2 divided by 2 plus 2 minus 2.

1193
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:04,304
Good answer. That's what I had too.

1194
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:05,439
That is correct.

1195
00:55:05,506 --> 00:55:06,406
Well done.

1196
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:13,747
THE TWO TEAMS ARE TIED ONCE AGAIN

1197
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:16,750
Team KAIST, you've earned two points.

1198
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,054
That's a problem. The two are close.

1199
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:21,405
TEAM KAIST MAY GET EXTRA POINTS

1200
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:22,656
The two are adjacent.

1201
00:55:22,723 --> 00:55:24,292
- Oh, no.
- If they get 47...

1202
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:25,793
How should we make 47?

1203
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:28,412
They're thinking the same thing.

1204
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:31,032
They keep submitting 2 and 2
to get 1, 2, 2, and 6.

1205
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,467
Wait. How about we use it against them?

1206
00:55:33,534 --> 00:55:34,768
Five factorial

1207
00:55:35,203 --> 00:55:36,237
times two.

1208
00:55:36,704 --> 00:55:38,306
- And?
- Plus four.

1209
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:40,141
So, let's submit 5 and 2.

1210
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:41,742
And they'll submit 2 and 2.

1211
00:55:41,976 --> 00:55:43,110
TEAM POSTECH'S STRATEGY

1212
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:49,349
But we might be giving them a chance.

1213
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:52,519
No, but it's about time we make our bet.

1214
00:55:56,257 --> 00:56:00,460
TEAM POSTECH: 14
TEAM KAIST: 14

1215
00:56:00,728 --> 00:56:03,164
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1216
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:04,298
One, two, three.

1217
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:05,699
One, two, three.

1218
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,035
They're 5, 2, 6, and 2.

1219
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,871
They're 5, 2, 6, and 2.

1220
00:56:10,971 --> 00:56:11,872
Did you get it?

1221
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,043
They're 5, 2, 6, and 2.

1222
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,045
- Got it?
- Ring it.

1223
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:19,880
- Nice.
- Team POSTECH.

1224
00:56:20,006 --> 00:56:21,882
- What's your target?
- Target number 244.

1225
00:56:21,982 --> 00:56:23,084
Target number 244.

1226
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:34,103
It's 5 factorial times 2 plus 6 minus 2.

1227
00:56:34,195 --> 00:56:35,696
TARGET NUMBER 244

1228
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:36,897
That is correct.

1229
00:56:38,266 --> 00:56:39,233
Great.

1230
00:56:39,317 --> 00:56:40,860
It was the first three-pointer,

1231
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:43,946
so I bet it put a lot of pressure on them.

1232
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:47,741
I thought we'd win if we kept it up.

1233
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:51,345
I thought, "This isn't going so well."

1234
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:55,208
Okay. Eleven points to go.
Now we should get larger numbers.

1235
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,335
- How about this?
- What?

1236
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:59,962
We can make this number no matter what.

1237
00:57:00,288 --> 00:57:01,630
Is it for 601?

1238
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:03,132
How many points is it worth?

1239
00:57:03,216 --> 00:57:04,717
- The blue area.
- Oh, I see.

1240
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:06,677
We can go for larger numbers now.

1241
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:08,428
Five factorial times five plus--

1242
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:09,930
- What is it for?
- It's for 601.

1243
00:57:10,014 --> 00:57:11,015
It's 5 and 1...

1244
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:12,933
TEAM POSTECH ALSO TARGETS 601

1245
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:23,777
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1246
00:57:23,877 --> 00:57:25,012
One, two, three.

1247
00:57:25,346 --> 00:57:26,446
One, two, three.

1248
00:57:28,582 --> 00:57:30,284
They're 5, 5, 1, and 5.

1249
00:57:30,351 --> 00:57:34,855
TEAM POSTECH: 5, 5
TEAM KAIST: 1, 5

1250
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:37,691
- Ring it.
- They're 5, 5, 1, and 5.

1251
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,161
Ring it.

1252
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,396
Ring it.

1253
00:57:44,432 --> 00:57:46,567
Team KAIST, what's your target?

1254
00:57:47,235 --> 00:57:49,303
- Our target is 601.
- It's 601.

1255
00:57:51,764 --> 00:57:55,676
It's 5 times 5 factorial
plus 1 to the power of 5.

1256
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:57,978
That is correct!

1257
00:57:58,045 --> 00:57:59,521
THE TWO TEAMS ARE TIED AGAIN

1258
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:02,983
Team KAIST has earned three points.

1259
00:58:03,443 --> 00:58:04,385
What a bummer.

1260
00:58:05,853 --> 00:58:07,255
Team KAIST is so good.

1261
00:58:07,355 --> 00:58:08,456
They are, right?

1262
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:10,691
What am I doing?

1263
00:58:11,742 --> 00:58:12,659
I was bummed.

1264
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,995
I was usually the one ringing the bell,

1265
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:16,830
so I thought it was my fault.

1266
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:21,602
- It's such a close game.
- Please get ready.

1267
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,972
The current score is 17 to 17.

1268
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:34,282
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1269
00:58:34,514 --> 00:58:35,749
One, two, three.

1270
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:37,351
They're 6, 4, 2, and 3.

1271
00:58:37,452 --> 00:58:39,053
They're 2, 3, 4, and 6. Ring it.

1272
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,654
One, two, three.

1273
00:58:42,623 --> 00:58:43,557
Ring it.

1274
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:46,693
Team POSTECH, what's your target?

1275
00:58:48,528 --> 00:58:49,497
What's your target?

1276
00:58:49,563 --> 00:58:50,998
Our target is 4090.

1277
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,635
It's 4 to the power of 6 minus 2 times 3.

1278
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:57,271
TARGET NUMBER 4090

1279
00:58:57,505 --> 00:59:00,908
That is correct.
Team POSTECH has earned three points.

1280
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:06,546
Team KAIST calculated
a lot of factorials in advance,

1281
00:59:06,613 --> 00:59:10,092
so they seemed flustered
that they couldn't use them.

1282
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:12,011
I thought we'd win at this rate.

1283
00:59:13,654 --> 00:59:15,722
But what choice do we have?

1284
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:17,599
We still have to find a way to win.

1285
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:23,964
It's okay. We can do it.

1286
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:25,699
What should we use?

1287
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:28,802
We calculated all the possibilities.

1288
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:32,114
I kept thinking
about how to use which number.

1289
00:59:32,273 --> 00:59:33,991
I wanted to be ready for any number.

1290
00:59:38,979 --> 00:59:40,414
- Let's try 4 and 6 again.
- Yes.

1291
00:59:40,481 --> 00:59:41,682
We can do 31, too.

1292
00:59:41,782 --> 00:59:42,749
One more time?

1293
00:59:46,987 --> 00:59:49,656
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1294
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,896
One, two, three.

1295
00:59:56,297 --> 00:59:57,998
They're 4, 6, 2, and 3.

1296
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:00,167
They're 4, 6, 2, and 3.

1297
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:02,002
They're 4, 6, 2, and 3.

1298
01:00:08,142 --> 01:00:10,278
- They rang it first.
- Team KAIST was faster.

1299
01:00:10,403 --> 01:00:11,987
Team KAIST, what's your target?

1300
01:00:14,148 --> 01:00:16,250
Our target is 777.

1301
01:00:16,517 --> 01:00:17,684
Target number 777.

1302
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:24,124
It's 3 to the power of 6
plus 4 factorial times 2.

1303
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:28,095
That is correct.
Team KAIST has earned four points.

1304
01:00:28,162 --> 01:00:29,930
KAIST IS BACK IN THE LEAD

1305
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,035
It's so neck-and-neck. I'm all for it.

1306
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:36,770
Four points to go.

1307
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:39,306
- All it takes is one problem.
- Yes, it's close.

1308
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,892
- They got the red area.
- Back on the lead.

1309
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:44,061
- Team KAIST is back on the lead.
- Red area?

1310
01:00:44,445 --> 01:00:45,446
That's incredible.

1311
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,316
TEAM POSTECH: 20
TEAM KAIST: 21

1312
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:57,024
Looking at my teammates,
I was certain that we'd take the lead.

1313
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:00,286
We'd already made formulas
for larger numbers,

1314
01:01:00,361 --> 01:01:02,455
so we tried our best until the end.

1315
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:05,633
Please get ready.

1316
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,641
Both teams, submit two cards each.

1317
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:15,075
One, two, three.

1318
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,810
They're 4, 6, 3, and 4.

1319
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:18,145
We got it.

1320
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,181
Ring it.

1321
01:01:20,281 --> 01:01:22,183
They're 3, 4, 4, and 6.

1322
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:23,351
Ring it quickly.

1323
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:34,261
TEAM POSTECH: 20
TEAM KAIST: 21

1324
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:35,863
Team KAIST.

1325
01:01:35,996 --> 01:01:38,265
- Our target is 173.
- Okay.

1326
01:01:43,538 --> 01:01:44,938
Show us your formula.

1327
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:48,709
- Our target is 173.
- It's 173.

1328
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:53,648
It's 6 factorial over 4 minus 3 plus 4.

1329
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:04,024
That is correct.
Team KAIST has earned four points.

1330
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:06,026
TEAM POSTECH: 20
TEAM KAIST: 25

1331
01:02:06,327 --> 01:02:10,398
TEAM KAIST WINS THE DEATHMATCH,
FORMULA ARCHERY

1332
01:02:14,468 --> 01:02:18,005
Formula Archery,
the Deathmatch, has ended.

1333
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,808
The first team to be eliminated
from Elite League is

1334
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,512
Team POSTECH.

1335
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:29,250
It's over.

1336
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,819
That's when I realized
that we were actually going home.

1337
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:37,132
It was only a one-point difference
until the end.

1338
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:38,509
I was so bummed.

1339
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:42,346
I'm regretful that we lost
in the first main match

1340
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:44,465
and the first Deathmatch.

1341
01:02:45,132 --> 01:02:47,768
I was over the moon that we won.

1342
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:50,371
I was so relieved.

1343
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:51,639
I'm relieved we won.

1344
01:02:53,807 --> 01:02:54,742
Oh, my goodness.

1345
01:02:55,735 --> 01:02:56,944
What? It's being shredded.

1346
01:02:57,511 --> 01:02:58,946
They're shredding it.

1347
01:02:59,046 --> 01:02:59,947
It's a shredder?

1348
01:03:00,147 --> 01:03:01,198
There was a shredder?

1349
01:03:01,348 --> 01:03:02,349
No way.

1350
01:03:06,987 --> 01:03:09,690
They shredded the photo,
and it tore my heart apart.

1351
01:03:09,957 --> 01:03:13,494
I was heartbroken
to see our photo be shredded.

1352
01:03:15,396 --> 01:03:16,530
That's cruel.

1353
01:03:17,398 --> 01:03:18,365
Oh, gosh.

1354
01:03:19,734 --> 01:03:22,536
I realized it wasn't a joke
and was a bit taken aback.

1355
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:25,765
It reminded me
that this really is a survival match.

1356
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:28,517
I told myself,
"We can't let that happen to us."

1357
01:03:28,684 --> 01:03:31,853
I couldn't let our photo be shredded.
I needed to perform well.

1358
01:03:36,049 --> 01:03:37,184
Good work.

1359
01:03:37,585 --> 01:03:38,694
Great work, guys.

1360
01:03:38,786 --> 01:03:40,112
You were good, Team KAIST.

1361
01:03:41,288 --> 01:03:42,556
Team POSTECH,

1362
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:44,391
please exit the grounds.

1363
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:45,993
Let's go.

1364
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:57,046
We only played two games,
but I think it was meaningful

1365
01:03:57,129 --> 01:04:00,407
that our teammates could show
their talent and skills.

1366
01:04:00,907 --> 01:04:05,513
We could've shown you a lot more,
so it's a shame we were knocked out.

1367
01:04:05,638 --> 01:04:08,558
I'm relieved that we did our best
even though we lost.

1368
01:04:08,649 --> 01:04:11,051
Competing with students
from other schools was

1369
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:13,145
a fun and pleasant experience in itself.

1370
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:32,206
We have four teams remaining,

1371
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:34,809
so we survive
if we're in the top two, right?

1372
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:37,077
We have to survive.

1373
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:39,756
- Let's not go to the Deathmatch.
- We won't.

1374
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:40,848
We never will.

1375
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:42,049
Let's win no matter what.

1376
01:04:42,116 --> 01:04:43,760
We have to win first place today.

1377
01:04:44,385 --> 01:04:46,687
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League.

1378
01:04:47,154 --> 01:04:48,188
Here we go.

1379
01:04:48,922 --> 01:04:50,057
...Elite League.

1380
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:53,269
A new university is joining you.

1381
01:04:53,352 --> 01:04:54,762
- What?
- What?

1382
01:04:54,928 --> 01:04:55,929
Who are they?
