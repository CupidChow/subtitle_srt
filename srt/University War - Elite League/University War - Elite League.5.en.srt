1
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,519
ELITE LEAGUE

2
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:30,865
We always sit in the same spot.

3
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:32,366
- Do we?
- Yes.

4
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,578
I'm sleepy.

5
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,287
You should stand up and stretch.

6
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,792
Ipselenti Je Hook

7
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,878
THEY JOIN IN ON THE SCHOOL CHANT
Kashe Koshe Koshe Koo

8
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,337
- Kalmashi Keshi Keshi
- Kalmashi Keshi Keshi

9
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,673
- Korea University
- Korea University

10
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,383
We're in better shape than yesterday.

11
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:55,222
We're not going to end up
in the Deathmatch today.

12
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,460
It'd be a shame to be eliminated
when we made it this far.

13
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,597
- I agree.
- We need to focus on winning now.

14
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,233
Team Harvard has to go
for the SKY teams to survive.

15
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,334
SKY: SNU, KU, YONSEI

16
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,821
It'd be fun to compete
against Team SNU in the finals.

17
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,824
Team Yonsei and Team KU
should battle each other.

18
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,376
- In the Deathmatch?
- Yes.

19
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,213
- That'd be interesting.
- And we'd battle it out with Team SNU.

20
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:22,917
I want to send Team Yonsei home today.

21
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,018
They're a big threat.

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,211
I saw them play yesterday,
and they're good.

23
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,756
The guy from Busan Science High School

24
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:31,425
- is really smart.
- But they messed up the main match.

25
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,053
I honestly don't think
Team Yonsei is that good.

26
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,097
I think Team KU is a much more solid team.

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,478
I just don't see anything that remarkable
about Team KU or Team Harvard.

28
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:44,805
It's starting.

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,541
What's that?

30
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,110
This reminds me of the CSAT.

31
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,156
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League.

32
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,117
Today's Ace Selection

33
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,754
is Dates of Birth.

34
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,288
It's a numbers game again.

35
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,790
What is it this time?

36
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:03,925
What is this?

37
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,593
In Dates of Birth,

38
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:10,130
you will be given 2 minutes
to memorize 10 dates of birth.

39
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,342
You will then be asked
to recall an individual's date of birth.

40
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,260
So it's a memory game?

41
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,932
The time limit is five minutes.

42
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,143
If a team does not have
any contestants that answer correctly,

43
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,313
that team will be excluded
from participating in the Ace Match.

44
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,068
- I doubt we'll need five whole minutes.
- Of course not.

45
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,736
I'm good at memorizing birthdays.

46
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,826
You will now see
ten individuals and their dates of birth.

47
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,128
ALBERT EINSTEIN: MARCH 14, 1879

YU GWAN-SUN: DECEMBER 16, 1902

50
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:43,748
This is insane.

51
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,333
- This is going to be hard.
- I'm screwed.

52
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,469
I'm really screwed.

53
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,545
MARIE CURIE: NOVEMBER 7, 1867

54
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,629

59
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,635
LEONARDO DA VINCI: APRIL 15, 1452

60
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:01,149
I had a feeling I'd do well in this game.

61
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,728
I'm good at math and memorizing things,

62
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,564
so when I found out it was a memory game,
I was confident I'd win.

63
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,525
When I memorize numbers,

64
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,028
I attach meaning to them
by seeing how they relate to each other.

65
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:17,156
If the numbers are 2, 3, and 5,
I'll memorize it as 2 plus 3 equals 5.

66
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,037
I also use basic mathematical concepts
like arithmetic and geometric sequences

67
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,539
to find regularities
when memorizing a set of numbers.

68
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,917
So I wasn't too worried about it.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,010
CHO HYUN-JUN IS CONFIDENT

70
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,412
You have one minute.

71
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,148
You have one minute.

72
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,199
Your two minutes are up.

73
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,151
The question will now be revealed.

74
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,469
The question will now be revealed.

75
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,114
WHAT IS THIS INDIVIDUAL'S DATE OF BIRTH?

76
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:01,209
YI SANG

77
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,285
The question will now be revealed.

78
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,621
The question will now be revealed.

79
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:14,822
Hold on.

80
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,434
The first person who got it right...

81
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,233
is from Team Yonsei.

82
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,277
It's Kim Ki-hong.

83
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:41,015
1ST PLACE: KIM KI-HONG
YONSEI, PHARMACY

84
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:47,663
Winning the Ace Selection twice in a row
made me feel upbeat and confident.

85
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,558
KIM KI-HONG FROM TEAM YONSEI
WON THE ACE SELECTION TWICE IN A ROW

86
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,044
Ki-hong is on fire.

87
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,504
He's doing well in the Ace Selection.

88
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,009
When was it?

89
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,678
Was it the 1800s or the 1900s?

90
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,071
Damn it. I don't remember.

91
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,848
The second person who got it right

92
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,183
is from Team SNU.

93
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,855
It's Jung Hyun-bin.

94
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:16,350
2ND PLACE: JUNG HYUN-BIN
SNU, PRE-MED

95
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,027
I felt a twinge of disappointment

96
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,355
because I wanted to win
and pick Team Harvard as my opponent.

97
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:25,534
The third person who got it right
is from Team Harvard.

98
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:26,911
It's Ray.

99
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:27,995
3RD PLACE: RAY
HARVARD, MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

100
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,081
I knew the answer,
so I should've placed first.

101
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,399
But I placed third,
which was disappointing.

102
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,210
The fourth person who got it right

103
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,770
is Lee Ji-soo from Team KU.

104
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:43,928
4TH PLACE: LEE JI-SOO
KU, PHYSICS

105
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,348
ACES FROM ALL 4 TEAMS HAVE BEEN SELECTED

106
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,226
It's my first time being the Ace.

107
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,313
You came in first twice in a row.

108
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,191
Who are you going to pick?

109
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,694
I'm still thinking about it.

110
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,868
The fifth person who got it right...

111
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,583
is Cho Hyun-jun from Team Yonsei.

112
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,710
I don't know why it took me this long.

113
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,046
It's Sky.

114
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,341
It's Kyung Do-hyun.

115
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,967
- It's Son Ju-hyung.
- Go ahead.

116
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,927
9TH: KIM JUNG-MIN
10TH: SONG HYUN-SEOK

117
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,553
11TH: PARK HYUN-MIN
12TH: CHAE SEUNG-MIN

118
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,555
LEE DONG-KYU HASN'T SOLVED IT YET
No, this isn't it.

119
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,683
NEITHER HAS PARK NA-YOON FROM TEAM YONSEI

120
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,768
NOR JANICE AND DAVID FROM TEAM HARVARD

121
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,895
You have one minute.

122
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:38,107
- You have to input it now.
- Do you know the answer?

123
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:39,275
It was 191...

124
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,571
I'm not going to remember this.

125
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,282
I'm not looking.

126
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:47,241
Let me try.

127
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,539
- You can do it.
- I'm pretty sure this year is correct.

128
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:56,167
If I'm wrong, I don't know what to say.

129
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,652
You have ten seconds.

130
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,674
The 13th person who got it right...

131
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:07,469
ACE SELECTION

132
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,696
...is Park Na-yoon from Team Yonsei.

133
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:14,476
13TH PLACE: PARK NA-YOON
YONSEI, PRE-DENTISTRY

134
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:20,107
I was relieved to make the cut
since this was harder than I thought.

135
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,818
THE 5-MINUTE TIME LIMIT IS OVER
Your time is up.

136
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,988
LEE DONG-KYU DIDN'T SOLVE IT IN TIME
It's fine, Dong-kyu.

137
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,448
I can't remember the last four digits.

138
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,367
It's okay.

139
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,330
One person from Team KU
didn't get the answer either,

140
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:36,332
- but everyone else did.
- They all got it.

141
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,458
JANICE AND DAVID FAIL

142
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,212
Don't let this get to you.
We were just unlucky this time.

143
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,256
It was really embarrassing.

144
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,049
The three of us had one thing in common.

145
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,551
We were all math majors.

146
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,389
People who major in mathematics
are terrible at memorizing things.

147
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,177
That concludes the Ace Selection.

148
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,938
Here are the results from Dates of Birth.

149
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,115

4TH: KU, LEE JI-SOO

152
00:08:06,362 --> 00:08:08,488
KIM KI-HONG PLACES 1ST
Kim Ki-hong from Team Yonsei.

153
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,283
- He's impressive.
- He is.

154
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:11,867
He won two days in a row.

155
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,703
He either comes in first or last.

156
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,130
There's no middle for him.

157
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,748
KIM KI-HONG'S ACE SELECTION RESULTS

158
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,375
DAY 1: 20TH
DAY 2 AND DAY 3: 1ST

159
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:22,378
JUNG HYUN-BIN PLACES 2ND
Jung Hyun-bin from Team SNU.

160
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,048
RAY PLACES 3RD
Ray from Team Harvard.

161
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,926
LEE JI-SOO PLACES 4TH
Lee Ji-soo from Team KU.

162
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,473
You have been selected as your team's Ace.

163
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:35,433
KIM KI-HONG, TEAM YONSEI

164
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,476
JUNG HYUN-BIN, TEAM SNU

165
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,517
RAY, TEAM HARVARD

166
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,560
LEE JI-SOO, TEAM KU

167
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,271
Today's Ace Match...

168
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:45,276
is Blindfold Connect Five.

169
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,281
Connect Five?

170
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,201
That sounds hard.

171
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:56,912
You have to have a really good memory.

172
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:59,457
Does that mean
they won't get to see the board?

173
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,541
They have to play from memory.

174
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,088
- They'll be playing without any stones.
- They won't be able to look at the board.

175
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:07,381
BLINDFOLD CONNECT FIVE

176
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:10,634
In Blindfold Connect Five,
the contestants will not see the board.

177
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,679
Instead, they will play the game
relying only on their memory.

178
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:20,727
The contestants will each take turns
to call out coordinates in two minutes.

179
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,188
COORDINATES: C3

180
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,607
The board will remain hidden
during the course of the game.

181
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:26,859
BLIND

182
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,370
Placing a stone on an occupied coordinate

183
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:32,114
or forming 2 rows of 3
will be considered an illegal move.

184
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,283
You will be given
one chance to make the move legal.

185
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,951
ONE CHANCE TO CORRECT AN ILLEGAL MOVE

186
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,619
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,

187
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,997
please name the Ace
you wish to play against.

188
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,962
The Ace I'll play against...

189
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,633
I feel like he's going to pick us today.

190
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,928
- He already played against Harvard.
- It's our turn now.

191
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,971
- What about SNU?
- They already had a match.

192
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,557
I think he'll pick Ji-soo.

193
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,476
I think so too.

194
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:02,470
He needs to stay away from Hyun-bin.

195
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,439
- What's his major again?
- He's in medical school.

196
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,190
Don't forget his CSAT score.

197
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,984
- That's a definite "no" for us.
- He got a perfect score.

198
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,410
The Ace I'll play against

199
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:21,955
is Jung Hyun-bin from Team SNU.

200
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,130
...is Jung Hyun-bin.

201
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:30,089
Why?

202
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,566
- I don't get it.
- Why?

203
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,700
Why'd he choose him?

204
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:39,240
Kim Ki-hong and Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please prepare for the Ace Match.

205
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,268
It's as if Team Yonsei is avoiding us.

206
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,603
Maybe they're scared of us.

207
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,729
- That must be it.
- We're going to win.

208
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:49,525
We lost the Ace Match
against Team SNU on the first day,

209
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:51,110
so I wanted a rematch.

210
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,625
Hyun-bin from Team SNU kept saying

211
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:01,621
that he was bad at Connect Five
and that his memory wasn't that great.

212
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,205
...is Blindfold Connect Five.

213
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:05,583
WHEN THE GAME WAS FIRST INTRODUCED

214
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,210
My memory is bad, and I suck at that game.

215
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,136
Really?

216
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,274
I don't have a lot of experience
playing Connect Five,

217
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,676
so when I heard
we had to play it using our memory,

218
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,745
I felt like the odds
were stacked against me.

219
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:24,602
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong
and Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,

220
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,753
please prepare for the Ace Match.

221
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,606
I look forward to our game.

222
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,904
Damn it.

223
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,615
What's your game plan?

224
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,742
Is there anyone that can walk me
through some strategies?

225
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,871
I'll give you a rundown.
Your initial move should be

226
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,789
placing stones to make a triangle

227
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,875
- or a right-angled one like this.
- He's right.

228
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,545
This will give you options
when you attack.

229
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:54,482
You can also use this strategy
when you counterattack.

230
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:59,220
Do-hyun was well-versed in the game,
so he helped me strategize a game plan.

231
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,057
We were pretty sure
that Ki-hong would choose to go first,

232
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,809
so we worked on strategies
assuming I would go second.

233
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:11,357
There's a maneuver
that exploits illegal moves.

234
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,108
ILLEGAL MOVE: DOUBLE-3 RULE

235
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:16,320
THE DOUBLE-3 RULE PREVENTS PLAYERS
FROM FORMING 2 ROWS OF 3

236
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:17,672
Let's say you have two Xs here.

237
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,074
It's actually three Xs
since this would be an illegal move.

238
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:23,452
So if you place an X to the right,
he won't be able to block you.

239
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:27,081
His options would be to block either end,
but you'll already have four in a row.

240
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,666
That's such a cool move.

241
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:33,087
If an opponent
places four stones like this,

242
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,924
he can't place a stone in the middle
since it'd be an illegal move.

243
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,595
So if we take that into account
and place two black stones diagonally,

244
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:42,846
we don't have a connecting line,

245
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,268
but we can regard it like it does
since a white stone can't be placed there.

246
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,703
2 BLACK STONES CAN ACT AS 3

247
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:53,073
I taught Hyun-bin how to use
the double-three rule to his advantage.

248
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:57,236
This strategy sounds like our best bet
especially since you're going second.

249
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,655
Keep an eye out for this
while you play defense.

250
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:01,532
- Don't worry.
- I'm not.

251
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,124
You're going first, right?

252
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,918
- Right.
- The first player has the upper hand.

253
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,464
If the opponent puts his stone here,
place your stone in the middle.

254
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,299
They'll try to cut you off,

255
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,469
but you need to continue to play offense.

256
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,804
Just continue to connect three stones.

257
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,806
You're bound to win
if you keep playing offense.

258
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,676
Their stones will be far apart,
so we will have an advantage.

259
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,979
Since you're going first,
you'll connect three stones first.

260
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,773
Just keep playing offense like that.

261
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,857
Hyun-jun knew the game pretty well.

262
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,694
I used to take
Go lessons when I was young.

263
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:42,448
I also played Connect Five a lot,
and I think I'm quite good at it.

264
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,493
So I tried to teach him
how to win when going first.

265
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:46,868
After the first move,

266
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,997
if the opponent places it diagonally,
we should skip a space on our turn.

267
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:53,042
If they place their stone in the middle,
we just need to block them.

268
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,503
If they don't,
we can connect our stones to make three.

269
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,631
These are the strategies I taught Ki-hong.

270
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:01,217
If you remember the first few moves,

271
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,303
and take an offensive strategy,
your chances of winning will be high.

272
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:13,145
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong
and Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,

273
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,322
please proceed to the One-on-One Room.

274
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:23,664
Hello.

275
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:44,985
Before we begin,
as Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong

276
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,096
placed first in the Ace Selection,

277
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:50,015
he will decide who plays first.

278
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:56,230
I'll go first.

279
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,611
- Obviously.
- He made the right choice.

280
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:04,363
TEAM YONSEI OPENS WITH BLACK
TEAM SNU GOES SECOND WITH WHITE

281
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,866
Contestants,
please turn away from the board.

282
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,553
You will call out coordinates
based on the board in front of you.

283
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:24,174
The guy with a perfect score on the CSAT
and the two-time winner of Ace Selection.

284
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:25,860
Here we go.

285
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,561
- This is insane.
- We've got this.

286
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:29,346
I can't believe this is happening.

287
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:36,370
We will now begin the Ace Match,
Blindfold Connect Five.

288
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:39,406
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong will go first.

289
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,910
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

290
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:48,365
He needs to start off with H10.

291
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,651
I'll go with H10.

292
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,754
Your stone will be placed on H10.

293
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:59,259
A black stone is placed on H10
for Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong.

294
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,505
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

295
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,703
I'll go with I11.

296
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:14,074
A white stone is placed on I11
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

297
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,977
I'll go with J10.

298
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:21,549
A black stone is placed on J10
for Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong.

299
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:24,585
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

300
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:28,188
I'll go with I9.

301
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:33,494
A white stone is placed on I9
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

302
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:36,205
- This is the strategy we discussed.
- You're right.

303
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,419
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name your next coordinate.

304
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,971
I'll go with I10.

305
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:48,342
A black stone is placed on I10
for Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong.

306
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,803
KIM KI-HONG CONNECTS 3 STONES FIRST

307
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,889
- Good move.
- It's easy for us to remember.

308
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:54,390
It's perfect for us.

309
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,475
He needs to focus
on playing defense now.

310
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,103
I'll go with K10.

311
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:06,660
A white stone is placed on K10
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

312
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,072
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

313
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:12,165
I'll go with H9.

314
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:13,968
You chose H9.

315
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:16,169
I'll go with G8.

316
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,838
You chose G8.

317
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:21,291
I'll go with H11.

318
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,676
You chose H11.

319
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,594
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

320
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,559
I'll go with H8.

321
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:40,477
You chose H8.

322
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:53,574
ANALYSIS FOR KIM KI-HONG

323
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,842
A STONE ON G10 CONNECTS 4

324
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,202
A STONE ON H12 CONNECTS 4

325
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,873
A STONE ON J9 OR G12 CONNECTS 3

326
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,383
Go for G10.

327
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,818
Please let him remember.

328
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:08,339
I'll go with G7.

329
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:10,174
You chose G7.

330
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:14,345
A black stone is placed on G7
for Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong.

331
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:16,639
- What?
- Why did he do that?

332
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,309
- Maybe he meant J7.
- I don't think so.

333
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,477
KIM KI-HONG'S MOVE PUZZLES THEM

334
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,062
Do you think he forgot?

335
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,647
Guys, he messed up.

336
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,074
- He screwed up.
- He did.

337
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,650
That was definitely a mistake.

338

Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name your next coordinate.

339
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:39,244
I'll go with I8.

340

You chose I8.

341
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,710
A white stone is placed on I8
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

342
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:49,630

ANALYSIS FOR JUNG HYUN-BIN

346
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,145
HE NEEDS TO BLOCK THE OPPONENT
FROM CONNECTING 5 STONES

347
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,481
He needs to block it.

348
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:14,780
I'll go with F10.

349
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,574
You chose F10.

350
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:21,161
A white stone is placed on F10
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

351
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,414
- Great move.
- He blocked it.

352
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:26,042
I can't believe
he remembers all the moves.

353
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,301
Team Yonsei's Ki-hong...

354
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,254
- Good move.
- He knows where everything is.

355
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:32,965
He just blocked us.

356
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:38,679
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

357
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,600
I'll go with J8.

358
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,935
You chose J8.

359
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,938
I'll go with G9.

360
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,789
You chose G9.

361
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:53,327
A white stone is placed on G9
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

362
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,572
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

363
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,766
I'll go with J7.

364
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,492
You chose J7.

365
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,269
I'll go with J9.

366
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:04,138
You chose J9.

367
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,210
- They're both really good.
- They are.

368
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,963
- They're thinking a few moves ahead.
- Right.

369
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,260
I'll go with K11.

370
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:20,420
You chose K11.

371
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:28,095
IT'S HIS 10TH MOVE

372
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,463
I'll go with I9.

373
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,201
I9 is occupied by a white stone
making it an illegal move.

374
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,003
...making it an illegal move.

375
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,338
...making it an illegal move.

376
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:42,994
- Oh, no.
- Was that illegal?

377
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:45,679
I think they both forgot
where the stones are.

378
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,873
They just told us the color of the stone.

379
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:50,375
- Hyun-bin could be checking.
- I think you're right.

380
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,254
You will be given one more chance.

381
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,214
One moment.

382
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,758
A PLAYER HAS ONE CHANCE
TO CORRECT AN ILLEGAL MOVE

383
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:00,136
I had forgotten about that stone.

384
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:04,732
As the game progressed,
it was hard to keep track of the stones.

385
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:07,559
So I made the decision
to check the coordinates.

386
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,188
- You have one minute.
- I'll go with H7.

387
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:12,023
You chose H7.

388
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:17,745
A white stone is placed on H7
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

389
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,532
It's over. We won this game.

390
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:23,408
A white stone is placed on H7.

391
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:27,989
BLACK: KIM KI-HONG
WHITE: JUNG HYUN-BIN

392
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,124
Hyun-bin is so freaking good.

393
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,543
He really is amazing.

394
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,295
He connected three stones
and made sure he remembered them.

395
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,006
That's a great strategy.

396
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:45,472
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

397
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,769
I'll go with H12.

398
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:52,780
You chose H12.

399
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:57,218
A black stone is placed on H12
for Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong.

400
00:21:57,518 --> 00:22:00,988
BLACK: KIM KI-HONG
WHITE: JUNG HYUN-BIN

401
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,791
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

402
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:08,955
I want him to draw a blank.

403
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:10,081
Please don't remember.

404
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:29,516
I'll go with G6.

405
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:30,851
You chose G6.

406
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,352
I'll go with G6.

407
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,687
You chose G6.

408
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,397
You chose G6.

409
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:40,778
The winner of the first round
is Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

410
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,322
TEAM SNU'S JUNG HYUN-BIN WINS ROUND 1

411
00:22:43,114 --> 00:22:44,665
JUNG HYUN-BIN: 1
KIM KI-HONG: 0

412
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:50,121
- That was fun.
- They come up with the best games.

413
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:51,747
- That was cool.
- Ki-hong's strategy wasn't bad.

414
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:53,916
If he made that move, he would've won.

415
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:58,145
- Hyun-bin didn't see that move.
- No, he didn't.

416
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,380
If we had one more move, we would've won.

417
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,134
This is really tough.

418
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,512
I won the first round
which put me at an advantage.

419
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,655
All I have to do now
is win the second round.

420
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:12,310
I am a little concerned,
but I know I can still win this game.

421
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,354
I just need to win the next two rounds.

422
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,647
We will now begin the second round.

423
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:20,818
Kim Ki-hong, who lost the first round,
will open the second round.

424
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,321
Contestants,
please turn away from the board.

425
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,782
BLINDFOLD CONNECT FIVE
ROUND 2

426
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:33,289
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong
will make the first move.

427
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:36,292
I'll go with I11.

428
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,153
A black stone is placed on I11.

429
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:42,756
I'll go with J12.

430
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:47,261
A white stone is placed on J12
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

431
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,555
I'll go with I13.

432
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,299
You chose I13.

433
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:53,867
I'll go with H12.

434
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,304
You chose H12.

435
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,857
I'll go with I12

436
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,275
You chose I12.

437
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,408
I'll go with I10.

438
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,368
You chose I10.

439
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,704
- Make a row of four stones.
- Go for I14.

440
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:17,417
I'll go with H13.

441
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,459
You chose H13.

442
00:24:19,827 --> 00:24:22,430
A black stone is placed on H13.

443
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:24,715
KI-HONG DIDN'T MAKE A ROW OF 4

444
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,800
That wasn't the best move.

445
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:29,595
It's really helpful
if you have four stones in a row.

446
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,805
It can open up
a lot of options for offense.

447
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:35,809
It's all about the momentum.
He needs to keep attacking the opponent.

448
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:40,147
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

449
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:42,516
I'll go with I14.

450
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,253
A white stone is placed on I14.

451
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:48,239
He's trying something new.

452
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,199
Why is he blocking the row of three?

453
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:56,163
I memorized a few strategies
before going into the match.

454
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:59,666
I predicted what moves he would make
and how I would counter his moves.

455
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,753
But he didn't play like I predicted,
which made the game fun.

456
00:25:03,963 --> 00:25:06,548
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

457
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,212
I'll go with J13.

458
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:15,182
A black stone is placed on J13
for Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong.

459
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,143
I'll go with G13.

460
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:19,086
You chose G13.

461
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:26,277
I'll go with J10.

462
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,527
You chose J10.

463
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,733
A black stone is placed on J10
for Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong.

464
00:25:33,468 --> 00:25:34,902
I'll go with H14.

465
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,454
You chose H14.

466
00:25:37,238 --> 00:25:40,958
A white stone is placed on H14
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

467
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:45,379
I had a strategy in mind.

468
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:48,341
I wanted to create
a row of stones without him noticing,

469
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,717
so I had to be very tactful about it.

470
00:25:52,453 --> 00:25:55,139
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

471
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,057
I'll go with K14.

472
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,160
You chose K14.

473
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,022
Ki-hong seems to have
a better visualization of the board.

474
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:05,816
Hyun-bin is only playing defense.

475
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,862
- He needs to block that.
- It's hard to visualize.

476
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,173
He should put it on H11 or block K14.

477
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,584
I'll go with H12.

478
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:33,386
H12 is occupied by a white stone
making it an illegal move.

479
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:34,962
...making it an illegal move.

480
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:37,097
...making it an illegal move.

481
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,144
You will be given one more chance.

482
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:45,856
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

483
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,317
Please go for H11.

484
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:49,651
Block that diagonal line.

485
00:26:57,418 --> 00:26:58,652
I'll go with J14.

486
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:01,155
You chose J14.

487
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:05,376
A white stone is placed on J14
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

488
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,961
- What? Did he just...
- That's it!

489
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,422
Did he make the wrong move?

490
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:13,067
Once you make an illegal move,
your mind tends to go blank.

491
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:25,613
I'll go with L15.

492
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,981
You chose L15.

493
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:33,153
A black stone is placed on L15
for Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong.

494
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,239
KIM KI-HONG CONNECTS 4 STONES

495
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,365
We won.

496
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:37,992
- It's too early to tell.
- Okay.

497
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,578
I'm not going to get ahead of myself.

498
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,372
- He knows.
- He knows he has a row of four.

499
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:44,499
He's going to win.

500
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:46,434
This is intense.

501
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,378
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

502
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:51,339
I'll go with H11.

503
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:52,773
You chose H11.

504
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:57,136
A white stone is placed on H11
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

505
00:27:57,637 --> 00:28:01,215
KIM KI-HONG WINS IF HIS NEXT MOVE IS M16

506
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,274
He just needs to finish the diagonal line.

507
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:20,000
I'll go with H10.

508
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:24,079
You chose H10.

509
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:26,290
What?

510
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:28,626
This is crazy.

511
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,085
What's going on?

512
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:32,129
It must've slipped his mind.

513
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,814
We're in the clear now.

514
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,132
We can let that go now.

515
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:37,092
- He's not going to remember.
- I disagree.

516
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:40,262
He's not even aware of the fact
that he missed his chance.

517
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:41,930
If he was, he would've won.

518
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:44,850
The person who knows what just happened

519
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:47,395
will turn the game around
or win this round.

520
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,072
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

521
00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:00,541
What if he calls M16?

522
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:02,410
That'd make things difficult for us.

523
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:03,711
Please no...

524
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:13,546
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

525
00:29:15,623 --> 00:29:16,965
I'll go with H9.

526
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:18,634
I'll go with H9.

527
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,761
- What? Hold on.
- What did he say?

528
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:23,972
He didn't go with M16.

529
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:25,766
This is insane.

530
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:29,570
He totally forgot about it.
He's not going to block M16.

531
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:31,838
You chose H9.

532
00:29:32,573 --> 00:29:36,711
A white stone is placed on H9
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

533
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:40,481
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

534
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,337
I'll go with M16.

535
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:56,897
You chose M16.

536
00:29:57,715 --> 00:30:00,635
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong
has connected five stones.

537
00:30:00,718 --> 00:30:02,928
KIM KI-HONG WINS ROUND 2
That concludes the second round.

538
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,406
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong
has connected five stones.

539
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:06,540
It's a tie.

540
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,975
Bring on the third round.

541
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,353
Why'd he put it on H10?

542
00:30:11,437 --> 00:30:12,396
Let's ask him later.

543
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,815
I just don't get why he put it there.

544
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:16,275
I'll ask him.

545
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,944
We almost had it, but it's okay.

546
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,405
He would've won if he had blocked M16.

547
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:25,626
Contestants,
please turn around and check the board.

548
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:30,790
I totally missed that.

549
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:35,670
You need a mental model
of the position of the pieces,

550
00:30:35,753 --> 00:30:39,006
but I lost my focus
in the middle of the game.

551
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,408
So I didn't see this coming.

552
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:45,012
It was exhilarating to win.

553
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:50,351
I plan on winning the third round
by making unconventional moves.

554
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:52,562
Will he be okay going second?

555
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:54,313
We didn't cover that scenario at all.

556
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:58,067
If you have a play in mind,
you need to focus on that play.

557
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,528
- You shouldn't get distracted.
- You're right.

558
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:02,405
You need to be completely focused.

559
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:05,199
Remembering your moves
helps when you're playing offense.

560
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:07,326
Remembering the opponent's
helps when playing defense.

561
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,203
In the end,
your odds are better going first.

562
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:11,831
He'll be fine
since he's going first this time.

563
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,041
We will now begin the third round.

564
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:17,678
Contestants,
please turn away from the board.

565
00:31:23,676 --> 00:31:27,513
TEAM SNU'S JUNG HYUN-BIN GOES FIRST
Jung Hyun-bin, please name a coordinate.

566
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,100
I don't usually choke under pressure,

567
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:35,028
so I'm certain I can win this round
as long as I stay calm and focused.

568
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:37,774
I'll go with H10.

569
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:41,935
A white stone is placed on H10
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

570
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,306
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

571
00:31:45,606 --> 00:31:47,283
I'll go with I11.

572
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,009
You chose I11.

573
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,913
I don't think I have to fight
tooth and nail to win this round.

574
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:56,317
I just need to be
the first one to connect five stones.

575
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:01,622
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

576
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,190
I'll go with J10.

577
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:07,219
A white stone is placed on J10
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

578
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:11,165
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

579
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:13,300
I'll go with I10.

580
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:15,068
You chose I10.

581
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:18,188
Is he placing it in between?

582
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,857
I9 would be our best move.

583
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,776
- I'm sure he knows.
- He'll put it on I9.

584
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:24,528
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

585
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,072
I'll go with I9.

586
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:28,850
You chose I9.

587
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,494
I'll go with K11.

588
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:33,036
You chose K11.

589
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:37,249
He did well. That was his next best move.

590
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:41,762
A black stone is placed on K11
for Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong.

591
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:44,866
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

592
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,510
I'll go with G11.

593
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:52,005
A white stone is placed on G11
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

594
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:55,976
JUNG HYUN-BIN CONNECTS 3 STONES FIRST

595
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:58,813
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

596
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,818
I'll go with J12.

597
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:05,452
You chose J12.

598
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:11,074
- What?
- He's going for the diagonal line.

599
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:13,828
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

600
00:33:24,705 --> 00:33:26,590
You have one minute.

601
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:28,475
You have one minute.

602
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:30,928
- What's taking him so long?
- Please remember.

603
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,013
He has to remember.

604
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,598
Hyun-bin is caught off guard.

605
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:39,019
- He might think he missed something.
- He's definitely caught off guard.

606
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:40,563
It could confuse him.

607
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:44,274
Ki-hong's last move must've confused him.

608
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:46,318
He's doubting himself.

609
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:51,632
After playing the first round,

610
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:55,168
I realized Hyun-bin couldn't remember
all the moves we played as well.

611
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:59,582
That's why I made it my strategy
to throw irregular moves into the mix.

612
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,318
I'll go with J8.

613
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:12,762
I'll go with J8.

614
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:14,021
You chose J8.

615
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:18,726
A white stone is placed on J8
for Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin.

616
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:22,062
- He's so good at this.
- I admire him.

617
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:23,263
Why is he so good?

618
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:26,400
I don't know how he does it.

619
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:29,570
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name a coordinate.

620
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:32,197
I'll go with I13.

621
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:33,657
You chose I13.

622
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:38,663
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin,
please name a coordinate.

623
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:39,881
I'll go with K7.

624
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,448
I'll go with K7.

625
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,336
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin
has connected five stones.

626
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:46,963
That concludes the third round.

627
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:49,674
JUNG HYUN-BIN: 2
KIM KI-HONG: 1

628
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:50,591
Way to go.

629
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:54,428
That was amazing, Hyun-bin!

630
00:34:57,974 --> 00:34:58,933
That was great.

631
00:34:59,017 --> 00:35:00,351
They both put up a great fight.

632
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,335
That was awesome.

633
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,188
Didn't Hyun-bin say
he was bad at this game?

634
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:05,105
- He did.
- But he's good.

635
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:06,231
That was obviously a ruse.

636
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:07,900
- A ruse?
- Yes.

637
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:09,710
That must suck for Ki-hong.

638
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:11,946
- It's so...
- I'd be really upset.

639
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,249
The winner of Blindfold Connect Five

640
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:18,077
is Jung Hyun-bin from Team SNU.

641
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,705
Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin
has won this match

642
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:22,707
and thus has secured the benefit.

643
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,294
I was disappointed

644
00:35:27,378 --> 00:35:30,297
because I tried my best
to win the benefit for my team,

645
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:32,100
but I kept handing it over
to the other team.

646
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:35,603
It was a wake-up call for me
to get my head in the game and do better.

647
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:38,639
I was thrilled.

648
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:42,685
It also felt really good
to secure the benefit for my team.

649
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:46,847
Contestants,
please return to your base camps.

650
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:54,279
- You did great.
- I feel like my brain is fried.

651
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:55,489
I have mad respect for you.

652
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:59,243
We played along using this board,
and I thought my head was going to burst.

653
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:02,496
You focused on memorizing your moves
in the latter half of the game,

654
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,124
but that only helps
when you're playing offense.

655
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,209
- Not defense.
- That's why I lost the second round.

656
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,669
That's what I thought.

657
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:10,713
But you got to go first,
so I knew you'd win.

658
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:13,257
- You did good.
- I'm so relieved.

659
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,968
This was a really tough game,
but you did an awesome job.

660
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:18,312
You almost had it.

661
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:19,931
- You still did great.
- Good job.

662
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:23,893
I couldn't predict
your moves in the second round.

663
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,812
I couldn't remember
if I had put a stone on H11,

664
00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:28,773
- so I wanted to check.
- Since you had a chance?

665
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:31,275
I wanted to check
if a white stone was there.

666
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,361
Then I was going to go for M16,
but I was off by one column.

667
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:36,697
- Were you surprised it was a legal move?
- I was.

668
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:39,575
That's when I knew
I had to go for M16, so I did.

669
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:41,994
- Thank goodness Hyun-bin didn't notice.
- I know.

670
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,375
KIM KI-HONG, PARK NA-YOON,
SON JU-HYUNG, CHO HYUN-JUN

671
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,911
That concludes the Ace Match.

672
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:54,648
All contestants,
please gather at the Main Hall.

673
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:08,312
- I'm really nervous.
- Should we stand here?

674
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:11,398
There used to be
a few more things on the set.

675
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:13,067
Why do you think they moved it?

676
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:16,528
Do you think we're playing a game here?

677
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:17,822
We need to be quick.

678
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,836
It'd be fun to have
four people do the Deathmatch.

679
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:32,753
Four people?

680
00:37:32,837 --> 00:37:34,254
No, I meant the four teams.

681
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:35,798
That's a hard pass for us.

682
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:40,344
- Today's main match is...
- Here we go.

683
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,099
Today's main match is

684
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,935
Silent Human Chess.

685
00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:48,894
SILENT HUMAN CHESS

686
00:37:48,978 --> 00:37:51,189
...is Silent Human Chess.

687
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:55,818
I knew Ray was an excellent chess player,

688
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:58,320
so I was glad
when I heard we were playing chess.

689
00:37:59,197 --> 00:38:00,748
I've heard about Human Chess.

690
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:04,018
You only see these things in movies.

691
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:07,205
I never expected
to play this game in real life.

692
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:11,192
In Silent Human Chess,
2 universities will form 1 team.

693
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:15,963
All contestants will act
as a chess piece in the game.

694
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,002
Contestants may not speak to each other
and will move based on their own judgment.

695
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:25,139
I'm horrible at chess.

696
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:32,063
Each team will have
2 rooks, 2 bishops, and 1 king.

697
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,397
2 ROOKS, 1 KING, 2 BISHOPS

698
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,692
A rook can move one square
either horizontally or vertically.

699
00:38:36,784 --> 00:38:39,611
A bishop can move one square diagonally.

700
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:43,615
A King can move
one square in any direction.

701
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:47,703
In addition, a king can skip over
any piece on the board.

702
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:49,038
A KING'S SPECIAL MOVE

703
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:52,083
A KING MAY SKIP OVER
ANY PIECE ON THE BOARD

704
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,794
It sounded like the king
was the most important piece.

705
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:58,589
Each team will assign
numbers 1 to 5 to each piece.

706
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,342
The pieces will take turns
making a move according to the order.

707
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:05,345
The game had a very distinct mechanism,

708
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:08,515
and I thought the order
would play an important role.

709
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:11,852
You will have
five starting members on the board.

710
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:14,480
The three remaining members
will act as substitutes.

711
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:18,442
For example, the first piece
from Team A will make a move.

712
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,569
Then, the first piece
from Team B will follow.

713
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:23,281
All the other pieces
will follow in the same fashion.

714
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,631
ORDER OF PIECES

715
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:28,619
Pieces must move
in the arranged order within one minute.

716
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:31,538
You may not change
the order once it has been set.

717
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,843
So both teams will take turns
and play based on the prearranged order.

718
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,179
We're the ones that decide that order.

719
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:41,007
If your piece
is captured by the other team,

720
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:45,186
the substitute will step in
and take the role and order of the piece.

721
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:49,389
However, once a substitute takes
the place of the piece that is captured,

722
00:39:49,473 --> 00:39:51,725
they may only enter the board

723
00:39:51,825 --> 00:39:54,695
at the captured piece's next turn
and must start at the bottom ranks.

724
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,688
ENTRY POINT

725
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:58,899
Additionally, if your team
loses all your substitutes

726
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:01,610
and can no longer supply a player,

727
00:40:01,694 --> 00:40:05,239
the turn will be given
to the opponent that is next in line.

728
00:40:05,323 --> 00:40:06,406
ORDER OF PIECES

729
00:40:06,673 --> 00:40:09,743
The king from each team
will reserve the right

730
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,705
to call one timeout
at any point in the game.

731
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,583
To win the game,
you must capture the opponent's king

732
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:21,672
or your king must survive two turns
in the opponent's bottom ranks.

733
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:26,510
The two winning universities
will proceed to the next round,

734
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:30,348
but the losing two
will face each other in the Deathmatch.

735
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:32,933
Team Harvard is good at playing chess.

736
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,894
Even if we lose, we can take them down.

737
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,478
Do you know how to play chess?

738
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,315
This has nothing to do with chess.
It's just a strategy game.

739
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:41,208
You don't need to know how to play chess.

740
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,110
What matters is how we build our strategy.

741
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,864
We will now reveal
the benefit for today's match.

742
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:51,085
The team with the benefit
will decide who goes first.

743
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:54,088
...will decide who goes first.

744
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:57,291
...will decide who goes first.

745
00:40:58,759 --> 00:40:59,893
Team SNU...

746
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,298
No, they choose who goes first.

747
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:05,883
So they get to choose the order.

748
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,343
Going first is better.

749
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:12,639
Team SNU, please decide
whether you will go first or second.

750
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:14,350
Should we go first or second?

751
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:17,686
Isn't it better to go first
in turn-based strategy games?

752
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,606
We can choose our positions,
so it's better to go first.

753
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:21,523
We should go first.

754
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:22,942
We've reached our decision.

755
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:25,361
We'll go first.

756
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:27,238
We'll go first.

757
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:35,871
You will now be given some time
to form alliances as you please.

758
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:38,874
Guys, gather around.

759
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,834
Let's ask if any teams
have a chess master.

760
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:42,295
We'll get a chance to ask them.

761
00:41:42,378 --> 00:41:44,755
I bet Team Harvard has one.

762
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:47,216
We should form
an alliance with Team Harvard.

763
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:48,809
I guarantee they have an edge in chess.

764
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:49,885
Let's ask around.

765
00:41:49,977 --> 00:41:51,812
They might not let us ask around.

766
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:52,930
We can ask them now.

767
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:55,724
They might not give us time
to discuss with other teams.

768
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:58,727
Team Harvard is the obvious choice.
Chess is an American game.

769
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:02,290
American students are bound
to have more experience with chess,

770
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,484
so we thought they'd be strong players.

771
00:42:05,401 --> 00:42:08,446
We could beat Team Harvard
if we end up in the Deathmatch.

772
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,409
It doesn't matter who we team up with
as long as it's not Team Yonsei.

773
00:42:13,493 --> 00:42:15,869
- You're right.
- If we lose, we play against them.

774
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:17,830
- Even if we win--
- We're not going to win.

775
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:19,206
Sorry, I take that back.

776
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:21,750
- It won't be easy.
- The odds won't be in our favor

777
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,669
playing against SNU and Harvard.

778
00:42:23,752 --> 00:42:25,963
We have to decide
if our best option is SNU or Harvard.

779
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:28,866
- Team Harvard is the safer choice.
- I agree.

780
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:31,593
I want to avoid
going to the Deathmatch with Team SNU.

781
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:35,789
TEAM SNU MAKES THE FIRST MOVE

782
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:38,767
Do you want to team up?

783
00:42:40,328 --> 00:42:41,687
Let's talk to Team Harvard.

784
00:42:42,522 --> 00:42:45,899
We have no choice but to follow suit now.

785
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:46,984
An alliance...

786
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,196
- Who decides the team?
- We do.

787
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,738
- Would you like to team up?
- Would you?

788
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:54,200
- It's better to go first.
- We're going first.

789
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:55,868
We have an advantage, so let's team up.

790
00:42:56,452 --> 00:43:00,481
I couldn't help but wonder
if SNU knew I was an avid chess player.

791
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:06,920
Ray plays chess every chance he gets.

792
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:11,091
So when I found out we were playing chess,
I knew we had the upper hand.

793
00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:15,196
It felt really good
when all the teams approached us.

794
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,698
We have an advantage, so let's team up.

795
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:20,059
We'd be an easier opponent
in the Deathmatch.

796
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:21,018
We're going first.

797
00:43:21,102 --> 00:43:22,937
We have an advantage, so let's team up.

798
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,356
We'd be an easier opponent
in the Deathmatch.

799
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:29,318
It'd be hard to beat Team SNU.

800
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,812
Why would we lose?
We even get to go first.

801
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:34,407
You should consider
the worst-case scenario.

802
00:43:34,782 --> 00:43:36,784
- Let me talk to my team.
- Of course.

803
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:38,494
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

804
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:41,021
We should consider...

805
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:44,459
They all want us.

806
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:45,560
We should go with SNU.

807
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:46,710
It's better to go first.

808
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:48,379
- I vote for Team SNU.
- Me too.

809
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,173
Will we go first because of Team SNU?

810
00:43:51,257 --> 00:43:52,425
- We'll be on one team.
- We will.

811
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:53,601
That sounds good.

812
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:55,386
There's a possibility...

813
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,097
- Don't think about the Deathmatch.
- We'll work with Team SNU

814
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,599
and avoid the Deathmatch.

815
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:02,143
Team Yonsei and Team KU
will do the Deathmatch.

816
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:03,727
I'm for it. Do you guys agree?

817
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,104
I agree.

818
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:10,485
Why does everyone want Team Harvard?
Are they even that good?

819
00:44:10,568 --> 00:44:11,611
I don't get it.

820
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:14,238
I wouldn't mind
beating Team KU in the Deathmatch.

821
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:19,577
- We need a team.
- Why don't we ask Team Yonsei?

822
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,120
It wouldn't hurt to ask.

823
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:24,165
Could you tell us
who you want to team up with in order?

824
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:26,501
- We're not really sure yet.
- Really?

825
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:30,171
Our only focus right now
is winning the game.

826
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:33,240
They chose Team SNU.

827
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:40,264
TEAM HARVARD GOES STRAIGHT
TO TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

828
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:41,349
Let's join forces.

829
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,118
- We're coming up with strategies.
- Hello.

830
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:45,227
- Hello.
- Hi.

831
00:44:45,311 --> 00:44:46,687
- Let's do this.
- We're going to win.

832
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,440
I look forward to our alliance.

833
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:53,994
TEAM SNU AND TEAM HARVARD FORM AN ALLIANCE

834
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:56,597
That leaves our two teams.

835
00:44:56,697 --> 00:45:00,034
It's not like we're going to lose
if we team up with each other.

836
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:01,035
Let's beat them.

837
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,371
I didn't see this alliance coming.

838
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,666
ALLIANCE FOR SILENT HUMAN CHESS

839
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:08,342
YONSEI, KU VS HARVARD, SNU

840
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:11,629
Now that it's settled...

841
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:12,713
We just have to win.

842
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,841
We should give Team SNU
the boot while we're at it.

843
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,344
We should.
We don't get many chances like this.

844
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:20,012
I didn't expect this alliance.

845
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:21,222
THE RIVALS ARE ALLIES NOW

846
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:24,933
Our two teams had the same goal,
and that was to win.

847
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:29,271
Working together with Team Yonsei
to achieve a common goal

848
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:32,066
is an opportunity that is hard to come by.

849
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,484
So that motivated me

850
00:45:33,568 --> 00:45:37,029
to pit Team SNU and Team Harvard
against each other in the Deathmatch.

851
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:41,141
Our focus should be securing the line.

852
00:45:41,534 --> 00:45:44,620
- The battle will happen in the middle.
- Right.

853
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:47,331
So we should place our pieces here.

854
00:45:47,415 --> 00:45:49,917
Everyone should be able to move
in the beginning, right?

855
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,711
If they can't, they'll be captured.

856
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:53,421
I have a formation in mind.

857
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:56,340
I'll mark rooks with a square
and bishops with a triangle.

858
00:45:57,049 --> 00:46:00,428
ROOK-BISHOP-BISHOP-KING-ROOK
The crown will represent the king.

859
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:02,096
If we place them like this,

860
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:05,666
all the pieces can move in any direction.

861
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:07,976
MOVES A PIECE CAN MAKE
Like this...

862
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,811
KING: UP, DOWN, DIAGONAL
ROOK: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT

863
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,439
BISHOP: DIAGONAL
You're right.

864
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:12,440
That's about it.

865
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:14,734
YONSEI AND KU'S PLACEMENT STRATEGY

866
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:17,236
ROOK-BISHOP-BISHOP-KING-ROOK

867
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:21,907
EASY TO MANEUVER
AS PIECES DON'T BLOCK EACH OTHER

868
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,243
I think we should defend our line

869
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:26,537
and make moves
based on the opponent's moves.

870
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:30,499
We need to take a defensive approach
rather than an offensive one.

871
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:34,336
We're going second,
so I agree with your approach.

872
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:40,008
When I heard his strategy,
I realized he was better at this than me.

873
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:42,219
I felt like I could trust him.

874
00:46:42,836 --> 00:46:45,097
Let's decide who the king should be.

875
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:49,243
- I think you'd be our best option.
- You should do it.

876
00:46:49,577 --> 00:46:52,521
You should be the king
since you understand the strategy.

877
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:54,273
You'll know when to call a timeout.

878
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:56,317
He's right. That could be crucial.

879
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:58,277
- Okay, I'll do it.
- That's settled.

880
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:03,031
Since we couldn't talk to each other,
we needed strong players.

881
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:06,744
And from what I saw,
Hyun-jun fit the bill.

882
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:09,455
I thought he was a skilled player,

883
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:12,899
so it didn't bother me
when Team Yonsei took the lead.

884
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:15,002
Let's decide the king first.

885
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:16,379
Who wants to be the king?

886
00:47:16,713 --> 00:47:20,841
The king is the only one
who can call a timeout during the game,

887
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:24,712
so the king has to be someone
who can see the bigger picture.

888
00:47:25,054 --> 00:47:26,889
A king has to have good judgment, right?

889
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:28,974
- He does.
- In that case, I suggest Ray.

890
00:47:29,058 --> 00:47:30,226
I'll do it.

891
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:33,053
Ray has a lot of experience
playing chess games.

892
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:38,192
That's why I suggested Ray to be the king
since he could guide all of us.

893
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:41,629
The decision to call for a timeout
is entirely at your discretion.

894
00:47:42,096 --> 00:47:44,741
I'll call for one
if I sense the tide shifting.

895
00:47:44,824 --> 00:47:47,167
We can plan
the first few moves ahead of time.

896
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:51,247
I felt confident about my ability
to call the shots as the king.

897
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:55,000
There's a lot of pressure,
but I knew I could do well.

898
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:57,754
Here's the formation I have in mind.

899
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:00,005
The battle will happen here.

900
00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:02,299
- Right.
- We'll put the rooks and bishops here.

901
00:48:02,383 --> 00:48:05,219
The bishops and rooks
can move forward while defending the king.

902
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,470
We should go with this.

903
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:10,190
That does sound like a good strategy.

904
00:48:10,266 --> 00:48:13,436
THE STRATEGY FOCUSES ON THE CENTER
We need to claim this area.

905
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:15,730
In a game of chess,

906
00:48:15,813 --> 00:48:18,232
everything hinges
on who controls the center.

907
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:21,235
My strategy was to target the center
by placing pieces in two rows.

908
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:24,655
We were going first,
so we needed to claim the center.

909
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:26,031
We came up with a lot of scenarios.

910
00:48:26,115 --> 00:48:30,911
I also suggested that we plan
our first two moves ahead of time.

911
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:32,747
HARVARD AND SNU'S PLACEMENT STRATEGY

912
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:35,040
We'll decide the first few moves,

913
00:48:35,124 --> 00:48:37,668
so those who aren't confident
can go first.

914
00:48:37,752 --> 00:48:40,220
Ray is really good at strategizing.

915
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:43,557
And also, I could see why Harvard
wanted them as its students.

916
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:53,893
As long as we stay focused
and don't make mistakes...

917
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:56,236
I was positive we'd win.

918
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:58,147
I think we're going to win.

919
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:01,442
We have to win.

920
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:03,736
Where else would we see
SNU and Harvard compete?

921
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:05,279
It'll be fun.

922
00:49:08,182 --> 00:49:09,450
This will be interesting.

923
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,084
I think so too.

924
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:15,038
I felt confident going in
because the game was based on chess.

925
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:17,708
I knew we would win at chess.

926
00:49:18,693 --> 00:49:19,827
I really want to win.

927
00:49:19,927 --> 00:49:21,253
- What?
- I want to win.

928
00:49:21,337 --> 00:49:22,171
We will.

929
00:49:30,037 --> 00:49:32,206
We will now reveal each team's lineup.

930
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:43,400
The first players of both teams,
please step onto the board.

931
00:49:43,484 --> 00:49:45,027
...please step onto the board.

932
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:52,827
HARVARD AND SNU'S 1ST PLAYER
JANICE, ROOK

933
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,206
YONSEI AND KU'S 1ST PLAYER
KIM JUNG-MIN, BISHOP

934
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:09,343
The second players of both teams,
please step onto the board.

935
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:13,848
Good luck.

936
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,558
HARVARD AND SNU'S 2ND PLAYER
DAVID, BISHOP

937
00:50:15,649 --> 00:50:19,770
YONSEI AND KU'S 2ND PLAYER
KIM KI-HONG, ROOK

938
00:50:26,894 --> 00:50:28,362
Why are they set apart?

939
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,948
We must have the same strategy.

940
00:50:37,504 --> 00:50:40,499
The third players of both teams,
please step onto the board.

941
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:45,922
YONSEI AND KU'S 3RD PLAYER
LEE JI-SOO, BISHOP

942
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:52,219
HARVARD AND SNU'S 3RD PLAYER
RAY, KING

943
00:50:58,350 --> 00:50:59,810
I didn't see that coming.

944
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:05,858
We were caught off guard
at how early they had their king play.

945
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:08,736
Shouldn't the king be last?

946
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:13,240
HYUN-JUN HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE ORDER
It'd be risky to place the king last.

947
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:14,324
You're right.

948
00:51:16,544 --> 00:51:20,039
The first two players were told
specifically where to move.

949
00:51:20,113 --> 00:51:23,417
The king would come third
and move to a prime spot.

950
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:26,378
And we relied on the last two
to make smart moves.

951
00:51:26,462 --> 00:51:31,175
RAY TOOK AN OFFENSIVE APPROACH
AND HAD THE KING PLAY EARLY ON

952
00:51:31,926 --> 00:51:34,962
The fourth players of both teams,
please step onto the board.

953
00:51:36,163 --> 00:51:39,099
HARVARD AND SNU'S 4TH PLAYER
KYUNG DO-HYUN, ROOK

954
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:43,871
YONSEI AND KU'S 4TH PLAYER
CHO HYUN-JUN, KING

955
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:50,402
The fifth players of both teams,
please step onto the board.

956
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:53,531
YONSEI AND KU'S 5TH PLAYER
PARK NA-YOON, ROOK

957
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:55,449
HARVARD AND SNU'S 5TH PLAYER
JUNG HYUN-BIN, BISHOP

958
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:09,839
Substitute players of both teams,
please return to your base camps.

959
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:11,173
He's protecting them.

960
00:52:11,265 --> 00:52:12,675
PLAYERS MAY CONVERSE AT THEIR BASE CAMPS

961
00:52:12,758 --> 00:52:14,635
It's different from what we expected.

962
00:52:15,053 --> 00:52:18,430
That's a smart strategy
to have the king protect them.

963
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,766
- Let's go in.
- First off...

964
00:52:24,712 --> 00:52:26,105
We have a lineup problem.

965
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:29,817
We thought their king would play last,
but he's their third player.

966
00:52:29,884 --> 00:52:31,318
Their king is one move ahead.

967
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:34,154
Today's main match, Silent Human Chess,

968
00:52:35,623 --> 00:52:36,857
begins now!

969
00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:39,827
...begins now!

970
00:52:40,694 --> 00:52:43,898
We need to have a good grip on the game.

971
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,252
Team SNU and Harvard's first player,

972
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:50,129
PLAYER 1: JANICE, ROOK
please make your move.

973
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:52,631
POSSIBLE MOVES

974
00:52:55,076 --> 00:52:58,779
Team Yonsei and KU's first player,
please make your move.

975
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:01,348
PLAYER 1: KIM JUNG-MIN, BISHOP

976
00:53:01,415 --> 00:53:05,061
IF HE MOVES FORWARD,
PLAYER 2 CAN CAPTURE HIM

977
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:10,925
FOLLOWING HIS TEAM'S STRATEGY,
KIM JUNG-MIN TAKES A DEFENSIVE COURSE

978
00:53:12,068 --> 00:53:12,985
He went backward.

979
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:14,570
That was the right call.

980
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,239
They're trying to lure us in.

981
00:53:18,783 --> 00:53:20,492
They have the same strategy as us.

982
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:24,413
Team SNU and Harvard's second player,
please make your move.

983
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:25,414
PLAYER 2: DAVID, BISHOP

984
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,476
DAVID MOVES ACCORDING TO THEIR GAME PLAN

985
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:32,880
Team Yonsei and KU's second player,
please make your move.

986
00:53:32,964 --> 00:53:33,798
PLAYER 2: KIM KI-HONG, ROOK

987
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:37,885
IF HE MOVES FORWARD,
PLAYER 1 CAN CAPTURE HIM

988
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:41,263
HE MOVES TO A SPOT
WHERE HE CAN SUPPORT HIS KING

989
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:44,959
Team SNU and Harvard's third player,
please make your move.

990
00:53:45,693 --> 00:53:48,328
PLAYER 3: RAY, KING

991
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,981
It's our turn now.

992
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:53,818
- Is it the king's turn?
- Yes.

993
00:53:57,613 --> 00:54:01,617
THE KING MAY MOVE
ONE SQUARE IN ANY DIRECTION

994
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:06,497
AND SKIP OVER AN ADJACENT PLAYER

995
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:13,879
HE MOVES ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE CENTER

996
00:54:13,963 --> 00:54:16,957
HE TAKES AN OFFENSIVE APPROACH

997
00:54:17,457 --> 00:54:18,926
He went forward.

998
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:20,052
Forward?

999
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:22,471
He moved forward.

1000
00:54:24,682 --> 00:54:28,144
Team Yonsei and KU's third player,
please make your move.

1001
00:54:28,227 --> 00:54:29,228
PLAYER 3: LEE JI-SOO, BISHOP

1002
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:32,481
IF SHE MOVES FORWARD,
PLAYER 4 OR 5 CAN CAPTURE HER

1003
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:40,948
LEE JI-SOO TAKES A DEFENSIVE APPROACH

1004
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:47,538
THEIR STRATEGY IS TO DEFEND THE LINE
AND MAKE MOVES BASED ON THE OPPONENT'S

1005
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:51,042
TEAM YONSEI AND KU
IS STICKING TO THE STRATEGY

1006
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:55,087
Team SNU and Harvard's fourth player,
please make your move.

1007
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:56,214
PLAYER 4: KYUNG DO-HYUN, ROOK

1008
00:54:56,797 --> 00:54:58,699
I think we're screwed.

1009
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:02,761
We'll lose if we play into their strategy.

1010
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:06,431
- We'll capture him if he steps forward.
- He's their fourth player, so it's here.

1011
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,811
KYUNG DO-HYUN TAKES A STEP BACK

1012
00:55:10,895 --> 00:55:13,814
Team Yonsei and KU's fourth player,
please make your move.

1013
00:55:13,898 --> 00:55:15,191
PLAYER 4: CHO HYUN-JUN, KING

1014
00:55:24,725 --> 00:55:27,287
PLAYER 5: JUNG HYUN-BIN, BISHOP
Team SNU and Harvard's fifth player,

1015
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:29,230
please make your move.

1016
00:55:30,623 --> 00:55:33,209
The king would come third
and move to a prime spot.

1017
00:55:33,293 --> 00:55:37,404
And we relied on the last two
to make smart moves.

1018
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:54,388
Ray stressed the importance of the center
and told us we needed to claim it.

1019
00:55:54,897 --> 00:55:57,566
We need to claim this area.

1020
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:00,360
It's a bit of a gamble.

1021
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:05,199
JUNG HYUN-BIN CLAIMS THE CENTER
FOLLOWING THE TEAM'S STRATEGY

1022
00:56:05,283 --> 00:56:07,994
Hyun-bin followed our strategy
and made the right move.

1023
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:10,871
PLAYER 5: PARK NA-YOON, ROOK
Team Yonsei and KU's fifth player,

1024
00:56:10,955 --> 00:56:12,790
please make your move.

1025
00:56:22,008 --> 00:56:26,137
ALL PLAYERS HAVE TAKEN A TURN

1026
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,523
Team SNU and Harvard's first player,
please make your move.

1027
00:56:34,854 --> 00:56:38,332
Team Yonsei and KU's first player,
please make your move.

1028
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:44,613
Team SNU and Harvard's second player...

1029
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:48,242
Team Yonsei and KU's second player,
please make your move.

1030
00:56:55,216 --> 00:56:58,418
Team SNU and Harvard's third player,
please make your move.

1031
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:24,111
- He moved forward!
- He chose to go forward?

1032
00:57:24,195 --> 00:57:25,738
He should've moved to this spot.

1033
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:27,323
This spot would've shielded him.

1034
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:29,317
That's right. He'd be protected.

1035
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:32,036
So why did he move forward?

1036
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,787
That was a very aggressive move.

1037
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:46,967
Team Yonsei and KU's third player,
please make your move.

1038
00:57:56,244 --> 00:57:59,713
Team SNU and Harvard's fourth player,
please make your move.

1039
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:06,653
Team Yonsei and KU's fourth player,
please make your move.

1040
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,129
I'd like to call a timeout.

1041
00:58:15,696 --> 00:58:17,331
I'd like to call a timeout.

1042
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:20,876
AT ANY POINT IN THE GAME,
KINGS MAY REQUEST A TIMEOUT OF 10 MINUTES

1043
00:58:20,968 --> 00:58:23,170
A timeout has been called.

1044
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,840
- Our king is the third player.
- It's a timeout?

1045
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:28,926
You will be given ten minutes.

1046
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:30,261
We can go in too, right?

1047
00:58:32,805 --> 00:58:33,889
Did you ask for a timeout?

1048
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:35,916
No, the opponent did.

1049
00:58:36,392 --> 00:58:38,102
We're in a bind right now.

1050
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:40,229
No, we're doing fine right now.

1051
00:58:40,313 --> 00:58:41,439
We already won.

1052
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:43,774
Since I'm here,
I can move before their king.

1053
00:58:43,857 --> 00:58:44,900
The game's already over.

1054
00:58:44,984 --> 00:58:46,110
I can move before their king.

1055
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:48,129
The game's already over.

1056
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:52,532
The control over the center
is at the heart of any chess game.

1057
00:58:53,234 --> 00:58:56,536
When Hyun-bin,
the bishop standing next to me,

1058
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,789
claimed the center spot,

1059
00:58:59,106 --> 00:59:01,875
I knew we had a shot at checkmate.

1060
00:59:02,293 --> 00:59:04,837
That's when I started to look
for ways to get a checkmate.

1061
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:09,049
Then it hit me when the opponent
stepped in front of their king.

1062
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:13,454
I knew the king had nowhere to run.

1063
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:20,353
Cho Hyun-jun, the king for Yonsei and KU,
has the following three options.

1064
00:59:20,928 --> 00:59:24,064
First, he could capture
the opponent's fifth player, the bishop.

1065
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:25,816
If he makes this move,

1066
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:28,269
he will be captured
by the opponent's king.

1067
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:31,638
Second, he can move up one spot.

1068
00:59:32,198 --> 00:59:33,615
If he makes this move,

1069
00:59:33,707 --> 00:59:35,784
he will be captured
by the opponent's king.

1070
00:59:36,277 --> 00:59:39,497
Third, he could skip over
the second player, the rook.

1071
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:41,715
If he makes this move,

1072
00:59:41,782 --> 00:59:43,918
he will be captured
by the opponent's king.

1073
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:46,504
ANALYSIS OF SILENT HUMAN CHESS

1074
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:48,255
You have excellent judgment, Ray.

1075
00:59:48,356 --> 00:59:49,524
That was smart.

1076
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,843
I saw this coming from the second line.

1077
00:59:57,473 --> 00:59:59,475
You shouldn't have moved
to that spot, Ji-soo.

1078
00:59:59,567 --> 01:00:00,518
- Really?
- Yes.

1079
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:02,603
- If you move here--
- Their king would get him.

1080
01:00:02,703 --> 01:00:05,022
He'll be captured
no matter what move he makes.

1081
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:06,899
...no matter what move he makes.

1082
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:09,977
I realized I made a mistake.

1083
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:14,574
I felt horrible
for putting my team in that situation.

1084
01:00:15,533 --> 01:00:17,751
I just felt really bad about it.

1085
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:26,060
Your time is up.

1086
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:27,895
You can come too.

1087
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:31,365
Please move to your positions.

1088
01:00:38,205 --> 01:00:39,706
We will now resume the game.

1089
01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:47,482
The fifth player of Team SNU and Harvard
has been captured.

1090
01:00:47,565 --> 01:00:50,684
Team Yonsei and KU's fifth player,
please make your move.

1091
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:54,196
Team SNU and Harvard's first player,
please make your move.

1092
01:00:54,447 --> 01:00:56,190
Please make your move.

1093
01:00:57,057 --> 01:01:00,077
Team SNU and Harvard's second player,
please make your move.

1094
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:06,934
Team SNU and Harvard's third player,
please make your move.

1095
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:12,406
Team SNU and Harvard's third player,
please make your move.

1096
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:19,054
TEAM HARVARD AND SNU
WINS SILENT HUMAN CHESS

1097
01:01:19,138 --> 01:01:24,118
TEAM HARVARD AND SNU
WINS SILENT HUMAN CHESS

1098
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:28,489
It felt great to win,
and I had fun playing the game.

1099
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:31,817
I was really happy we won,
but it was an obvious outcome.

1100
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:35,829
The top two schools
working together and winning

1101
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:37,657
was like a dream come true for me.

1102
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:41,243
Our strategy was to make moves
that would not give us the losing hand.

1103
01:01:41,327 --> 01:01:44,246
Unfortunately, the two bishops on our team

1104
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:47,416
had to play
earlier than the opponent's bishops.

1105
01:01:47,508 --> 01:01:50,378
On top of that,
they were facing each other,

1106
01:01:50,478 --> 01:01:52,963
so our bishops
had no choice but to retreat.

1107
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:56,050
That didn't give the king
many options to move.

1108
01:01:56,116 --> 01:01:59,953
It actually drove the king to a corner
which led to the checkmate.

1109
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,492
That concludes the main match,
Silent Human Chess.

1110
01:02:05,192 --> 01:02:06,143
The winners are

1111
01:02:06,627 --> 01:02:09,497
Team SNU and Team Harvard.

1112
01:02:10,314 --> 01:02:14,868
Team Yonsei and Team KU,
please prepare for the Deathmatch.

1113
01:02:16,571 --> 01:02:18,531
We just have to beat Team KU.

1114
01:02:20,282 --> 01:02:23,285
Among the three teams,
we think Team KU is the easiest team

1115
01:02:23,377 --> 01:02:25,621
to go up against in the Deathmatch.

1116
01:02:25,713 --> 01:02:26,947
Don't worry.

1117
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:29,500
We can win the Deathmatch.

1118
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:31,001
Let's beat them by a huge margin.

1119
01:02:31,686 --> 01:02:34,054
This is bad for us in two respects.

1120
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:37,132
First, we have to do the Deathmatch,
and second, it's against Team Yonsei.

1121
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:01,949
Why are you crying?

1122
01:03:08,188 --> 01:03:11,250
- I only took two steps.
- I see.

1123
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:15,296
And that was it for us.

1124
01:03:15,996 --> 01:03:19,933
I'm sure you made those moves
because they were your best options.

1125
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:25,306
The match was as good as lost
the moment I lifted my foot,

1126
01:03:25,372 --> 01:03:26,940
so that was really upsetting.

1127
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:28,809
I do feel bad for Team Yonsei,

1128
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:33,648
but I have to win
the Deathmatch to save my team.

1129
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,110
Both teams, please gather
at the Main Hall for the Deathmatch.

1130
01:03:42,356 --> 01:03:44,625
Let the battle
between Team Yonsei and Team KU start.

1131
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,118
We're going to win,

1132
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:47,453
so they better watch out.

1133
01:03:47,795 --> 01:03:49,038
This is going to be easy.

1134
01:03:51,165 --> 01:03:52,625
- We're killing it.
- It's over.

1135
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:54,502
You two are unbelievably good at this.

1136
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:56,170
Why did you look?

1137
01:03:56,236 --> 01:03:57,571
I don't understand.

1138
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:00,060
They look flustered.

1139
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:01,884
I might not be able
to trust my own judgment.

1140
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,969
That's how you guys played earlier.

1141
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,806
I need to keep it together.

1142
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:11,370
