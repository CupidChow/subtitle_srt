1
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,519
ELITE LEAGUE

2
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,315
It's a new day.

3
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,442
Let's do our best today.

4
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,236
We can't be eliminated.

5
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:29,530
- Let's not go to the Deathmatch.
- We won't.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,698
We never will.

7
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,450
Let's make it out alive today.

8
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,327
We have to win first place today.

9
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,287
We have to come in first today.

10
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,706
I wonder what awaits us today.

11
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,791
It can't be calculations.

12
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,293
They could test us on space perception.

13
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:44,921
Memorization?

14
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,047
We're good at everything
except memorizing things.

15
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,257
That's not our strength.

16
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:51,176
Look. They're praying.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,012
- They're praying?
- Are they praying?

18
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,680
TEAM KAIST IS MEDITATING
They're meditating.

19
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,265
All four of them are meditating.

20
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,391
I'll try it, too.

21
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,025
Picture a surface of water
that is pitch-black.

22
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:10,070
Now, imagine droplets of water
pushing out any intrusive thoughts.

23
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,697
That will help clear your mind.

24
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,622
Since Team KAIST survived the Deathmatch--

25
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,883
- They're tougher.
- I bet they're determined.

26
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,793
They might win the main match today.

27
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,420
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League.

28
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:28,923
Here we go.

29
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:35,346
Your intelligence is the only thing
that can help you win this battle.

30
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,348
Among Team SNU,

31
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,517
Team Yonsei,

32
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,686
Team KU,

33
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,855
Team KAIST,

34
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,274
and Team POSTECH,

35
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:51,012
Team POSTECH
was the first to get eliminated.

36
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,322
They sure left a void behind them.

37
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,119
They even removed
the school logo that was on the door.

38
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,372
Wasn't Team POSTECH quite cheerful?

39
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,082
Yes. They had a great attitude.

40
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,793
- It's not the same without them.
- I know.

41
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,670
I can't believe they were sent home.

42
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,632
It'd be great if they came back
and told us it was all a joke.

43
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:14,385
In high school,
I played basketball and lacrosse.

44
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,178
I also was a fencer.

45
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,271
- What?
- Who is that?

46
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,222
Who is that?

47
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,016
- Who is he?
- Who is that guy?

48
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,643
In high school,
I played basketball and lacrosse.

49
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,645
I also was a fencer.

50
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,481
My classes would end around 3:30 p.m.

51
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:31,318
So I'd play volleyball until 6 p.m.
or sometimes until 9 p.m.

52
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,112
I never overdid anything.

53
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:36,240
I studied hard,
but I didn't overwork myself.

54
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:40,912
I didn't put in a lot of hours studying
when I was growing up.

55
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:45,958
I practiced the violin
for about 3 to 4 hours a day.

56
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,086
A new university is joining you.

57
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,336
A NEW TEAM IS JOINING

58
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,337
What?

59
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:53,574
What's this?

60
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,967
Are they serious?

61
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,678
There's a new team?

62
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,389
- They must attend an overseas university.
- They're not from here.

63
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,434
The world's most prestigious university...

64
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,320
I attend Harvard...

65
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,456
I'm a Harvard student.

66
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,658
Seriously?

67
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:11,826
Harvard?

68
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:14,779
What are Harvard students doing here?

69
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,197
I can't believe this is happening.

70
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,825
Am I dreaming?

71
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:27,125
We were faced with a new threat.

72
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,460
I didn't think they'd be an easy opponent.

73
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:36,450
When they said they were from Harvard,
I freaked out a little bit.

74
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,805
We sent Team POSTECH home,
but now, we have to face Team Harvard.

75
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,058
I'm double-majoring
in applied mathematics and sociology.

76
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,644
My name is Janice, and I go to Harvard.

77
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,980
Ever since I was young,

78
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,273
I really enjoyed math and humanities.

79
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,736
I wanted to study both,
so I decided to pursue a double major.

80
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:59,073
I trained as a violinist
at Julliard Pre-College.

81
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,785
I'm David, and I'm currently majoring
in mathematics at Harvard University.

82
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:04,545
JULLIARD PRE-COLLEGE
IS A PREPARATORY COURSE

83
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,205
FOR TALENTED STUDENTS
WHO WANT TO PURSUE MUSIC

84
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,498
ACCLAIMED ALUMS INCLUDE

85
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,851
CHANG HAN-NA, CONDUCTOR AND CELLIST,
AND LIM HYUNG-JOO, POPERA SINGER

86
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:15,322
I played the violin
and performed at recitals growing up.

87
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,093
When I started school,
my interest in mathematics grew.

88
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:20,794
So I decided to pursue both.

89
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,889
I entered math competitions
and tried to challenge myself.

90
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,684
I'm pretty good with numbers.

91
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,852
They're both math majors.

92
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,203
YANG JUN-HYUK
MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES

93
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,370
Be on your guard.

94
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,940
They have two math majors. What do we do?

95
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,981
My name is Sky Jung.

96
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:37,945
I'm a Harvard student,
and I study computer science.

97
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,614
I'm Ray Noh,
and I study mechanical engineering.

98
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:45,153
Harvard is a prestigious university
that everyone knows and wishes to attend.

99
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:48,914
I believe Harvard is an institute

100
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,917
that fosters world leaders.

101
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,085
There are no limits.

102
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:55,337
Some students
want to be the next president.

103
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,717
Others want to win the Nobel Prize.

104
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,677
The students are full of ambitions.

105
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,679
They all have different dreams.

106
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:08,559
No matter where you are in the world,
Harvard is recognized by everyone.

107
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,811
You won't find a school like Harvard.

108
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,442
- This isn't looking good.
- Listen up.

109
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:21,405
It's harder for a Korean to get into SNU
than an American to get into Harvard.

110
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,656
That's the truth.

111
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,159
NAME ANY KOREAN UNIVERSITIES YOU KNOW

112
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,370
SNU, Yonsei, and KAIST.

113
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,081
I've heard of these three.

114
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,540
I've heard of these three.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,835
- What?
- What about Korea University?

116
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,964
She hasn't heard of KU?

117
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,381
That was deliberate.

118
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,050
It's infuriating.

119
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,102
She mentioned SNU, Yonsei, and KAIST,

120
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,895
but said she hadn't heard of KU.

121
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,690
I want to see Team Harvard
face the Deathmatch on their first day.

122
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,068
Harvard is on another level.

123
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,195
I'll show you what differentiates us.

124
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:04,115
We'll show you why Harvard
is the world's number one university.

125
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:10,537
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League.

126
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,706
A new university will be joining us today.

127
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,374
Are they really here?

128
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,376
- They're here?
- This is crazy.

129
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,412
Are they serious? Is this a prank?

130
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,214
This is insane.

131
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,426
Let me introduce the contestants
from Harvard University.

132
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,693
They made a grand entrance.

133
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:44,671
It felt novel.
I doubt anyone saw this coming.

134
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,992
I've never met a Harvard student before.

135
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,243
I was intrigued.

136
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,297
DAVID, MATH GENIUS, VIOLINIST
JANICE, PRESIDENT OF HKA

137
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:02,715
RAY, PUZZLE ENTHUSIAST
SKY, CODING GENIUS

138
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,759
Team Harvard, please be seated.

139
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,722
I can't believe they're here.

140
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,352
- Will the questions be in English?
- It won't.

141
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:16,354
For it to be fair, it has to be in Korean.

142
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,372
- Of course.
- There's that saying.

143
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,574
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."

144
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:23,485
We're in Korea, so we should use Korean.

145
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,654
We might get English questions.

146
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:29,116
- That would be unfair.
- I'm so bad at English.

147
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,534
I'll handle English.

148
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,752
You seem confident.

149
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,421
- I'm glad you're on my team.
- You're amazing.

150
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,454
I can count on you.

151
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,424
I looked at Team SNU's poster,
and they all seemed brilliant.

152
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,634
I didn't look at any more posters
as it'd make me more nervous.

153
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,439
Members of Team SNU seemed the smartest.

154
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,473
Was it Hyun-bin?

155
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,268
He seemed the brightest.

156
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:58,979
I thought he looked
confident and laid-back.

157
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,481
Damn it.

158
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,158
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League.

159
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,827
The game will now begin.

160
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,998
All contestants,
please return to your base camps.

161
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,541
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

162
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,668
- Bye.
- Good luck!

163
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,003
Good luck, Team KU!

164
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,380
Good luck!

165
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:31,387
I think Team SNU's Hyun-bin
is smarter than the students from Harvard.

166
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:33,722
- I agree.
- Team Harvard doesn't seem formidable.

167
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:34,807
I think so, too.

168
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,101
- I doubt they're good.
- They speak good English. That's it.

169
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,144
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

170
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,437
- Harvard?
- It's surprising.

171
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,110
P. K. R. L.

172
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,230
POWER OF KOREAN ROTE LEARNING

173
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:50,448
HARVARD IS ONLY AN AMERICAN SNU

174
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,617
As I wrote on the board,
Harvard is an American version of SNU.

175
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,244
Nothing more, nothing less.

176
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:56,937
I'm sure we can beat them.

177
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:01,041
Mathematics and applied mathematics.
You have two more rivals now.

178
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:04,795
David and Janice from Team Harvard
both major in mathematics.

179
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,465
I'd like to be given a chance
to go up against them.

180
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,384
- I wonder where Team Harvard will rank.
- Me too.

181
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,305
Harvard University
is the top university in the world.

182
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,683
I'd love to face
the two math majors from Harvard.

183
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,361
TEAM HARVARD'S BASE CAMP

184
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,732
- Aren't you going to sit?
- No, I'd rather stand.

185
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,026
I'll stand up too, then.

186
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,804
I felt a bit anxious.

187
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,116
I was really nervous.

188
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,826
And it was nerve-wracking, too.

189
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,412
Check to see if your pens work, okay?

190
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,872
- It does.
- Checked.

191
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,618
- I'm so nervous.
- Me too.

192
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,630
I was worried,
but I felt super driven to win.

193
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,299
19TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
KU, LEE JI-SOO

194
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:51,926
I'm starting to get nervous.

195
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:53,969
20TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
YONSEI, KIM KI-HONG

196
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:57,639
Placing last on the first day
made me doubt myself.

197
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,435
It kept haunting me to think
that I was the weakest link in my team.

198
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,105
I didn't want to win this badly yesterday,

199
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,565
but I really want to win today.

200
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,400
Weren't you offended?

201
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:10,403
If I win the Ace Selection,
I'm going to pick Team Harvard.

202
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,950
Today's Ace Selection...

203
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,084
ACE SELECTION

204
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,719
...is Perfect Number.

205
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,788
What?

206
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,373
"Perfect Number"?

207
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:24,041
In Perfect Number,

208
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,462
you'll be asked to make
all seven sentences on the screen true

209
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:31,332
by filling each blank
with a numerical digit.

210
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,403
I expected this kind of challenge.

211
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,240
I was excited to solve this puzzle.

212
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,541
It seemed fun.

213
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:44,678
I wanted to win no matter what.

214
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,816
Let the Ace Selection begin.

215
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,237
Here's your question for Perfect Number.

216
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:57,533
FILL IN THE BLANKS WITH NUMERICAL DIGITS
SO THAT THE SENTENCES ARE TRUE.

217
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,201
INPUT THE NUMBERS IN ORDER

218
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:02,704
IN THIS SENTENCE,
THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES

219
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,748
OF THE DIGIT 1 IS X
OF THE DIGIT 2 IS X

220
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,750
OF THE DIGIT 3 IS X
OF THE DIGIT 4 IS X

221
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,877
OF THE DIGIT 5 IS X
OF THE DIGIT 6 IS X

222
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,588
OF THE DIGIT 7 IS X

223
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,141
Damn it.

224
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,069
How did he solve that?

225
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:38,073
He got a perfect score
on the CSAT for a reason.

226
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,492
He's basically omniscient.

227
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,037
I don't think this is right.

228
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,292
The first person who got it right...

229
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,256
The first person who got it right

230
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,302
is from Team Yonsei.

231
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,526
...is from Team Yonsei. It's Kim Ki-hong.

232
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:11,566
THE 1ST PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
YONSEI, KIM KI-HONG

233
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:15,777
It was exhilarating.

234
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,573
I opened the door, and no one was there.

235
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,408
I was the first person to get it right.

236
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,828
- He really did turn it around.
- He nailed it.

237
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,121
KI-HONG WENT FROM LAST TO FIRST PLACE

238
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,416
I have huge respect for Ki-hong.

239
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,299
Damn it.

240
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,553
I bet everyone's flustered.

241
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,473
It seemed simple at first glance,

242
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,642
but I think I rushed through it.

243
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:49,437
It took longer than I expected
as my thoughts got jumbled up.

244
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,568
When I first read the question,

245
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:59,447
I noticed that it said,
"In this sentence..."

246
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,616
It seemed like a major clue to me.

247
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:04,785
I just didn't think
the number seven would appear a lot.

248
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,704
So I wrote down "1" for digit 7.

249
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,040
And when I did,
I noticed that one was used twice.

250
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,326
That meant I had to write "2" for digit 2.

251
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:15,504
But if I did, 2 would be used 3 times.

252
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,465
That's when I realized
what the issue was.

253
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:21,093
So I filled in the blanks with a few ones
and it slowly came to me.

254
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,930
The second person who got it right...

255
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:31,562
is from Team KAIST.

256
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,273
It's So Hyun-ji.

257
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,525
THE 2ND PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
KAIST, SO HYUN-JI

258
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,987
I didn't contribute much on the first day,

259
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,364
so I was determined to win today

260
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,825
and become the Ace.

261
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,243
HYUN-JI WENT FROM 17TH PLACE TO 2ND PLACE

262
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:57,505
The third person who got it right
is from Team KAIST.

263
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:58,715
It's Heo Sung-bum.

264
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,441
THE 3RD PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
KAIST, HEO SUNG-BUM

265
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:04,970
We're quite good.

266
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:09,266
We should've taken the top two spots.
It's a bummer we didn't.

267
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,435
Take it slow and focus.

268
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,772
The fourth person who got it right...

269
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,861
is from Team Yonsei.

270
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,072
It's Son Ju-hyung.

271
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,492
THE 4TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
YONSEI, SON JU-HYUNG

272
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,619
Yonsei and KAIST are doing well.

273
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,003
ACE SELECTION

274
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,247
1ST: YONSEI, KIM KI-HONG
2ND: KAIST, SO HYUN-JI

275
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,582
3RD: KAIST, HEO SUNG-BUM
4TH: YONSEI, SON JU-HYUNG

276
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,336
Not bad, Yonsei.

277
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,922
The blue teams are killing it.

278
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,466
The other two teams are red.

279
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:47,488
HARVARD AND KU'S COLORS ARE BOTH RED

280
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,140
The fifth person who got it right

281
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,727
is from Team KU.

282
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,562
It's Lee Dong-kyu.

283
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,397
THE 5TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
KU, LEE DONG-KYU

284
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:58,816
I was more than satisfied.

285
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:03,704
I wanted to be the Ace on my team.

286
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:05,155
ACE SELECTION

287
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,783
1ST: YONSEI, KIM KI-HONG
2ND: KAIST, SO HYUN-JI

288
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:07,742
5TH: KU, LEE DONG-KYU

289
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:11,788
TEAM HARVARD AND TEAM SNU
DON'T HAVE THEIR ACES YET

290
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,348
TEAM HARVARD'S BASE CAMP

291
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,916
IN THIS SENTENCE,
THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES

292
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,628
OF THE DIGIT 1 IS X, OF THE DIGIT 2 IS X
OF THE DIGIT 3 IS X, OF THE DIGIT 4 IS X

293
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:20,713

294
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:21,798
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

295
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,324
The digit seven occurs once.

296
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:26,803
The digit 2 occurs 3 times.

297
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:28,304
I got it.

298
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:34,635
Let me try.

299
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,188
The sixth person who got it right...

300
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,411
is from Team SNU.

301
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,447
- It's Song Hyun-seok.
- Good job.

302
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:51,952
I'm here to represent SNU,

303
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,706
so I wanted to be
the team's Ace at least once.

304
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,750
This boosted my confidence a bit.

305
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:03,589
Damn it.

306
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:06,216
Here's a question.

307
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,803
Why is no one from Team Harvard here?

308
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:11,889
ACE SELECTION

309
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,517
5TH: KU, LEE DONG-KYU
6TH: SNU, SONG HYUN-SEOK

310
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:17,770
You'll definitely win
if you're up against Team Harvard.

311
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,857
I'll teach them a lesson.

312
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:23,450
Good luck.

313
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,236

314
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,489

It's Cho Hyun-jun.

317
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,161
I just got it now.

318
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,205
- You're slow.
- I know.

319
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,165
The eighth person who got it right

320
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,082
is Lee Ji-soo.

321
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,417

THE 9TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
SNU, KYUNG DO-HYUN

324
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,843
Harvard still doesn't have an Ace.

325
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:54,598
I was flustered at first. I was stumped.

326
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,601
It took me a while to get the hang of it.

327
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,906
The tenth person who got it right...

328
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:17,580
is from Team Harvard. It's Janice.

THE 10TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
HARVARD, JANICE

330
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:25,379
I was disappointed in myself
for taking so long.

331
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,761
Team Harvard may not be
as big of a threat as I thought they were.

332
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,598
The best university in Korea is SNU.

333
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,058
For the sake
of defending my school's honor,

334
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,727
I'd love to beat them.

335
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:46,609

HALF OF THE CONTESTANTS HAVEN'T PASSED YET

341
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,626
I feel like I'm almost there,
but I just can't solve this.

342
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,329
Damn it.

343
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,640
Why did it take me so long?

344
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,017
My brain isn't working today.

345
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,601
The 11th person who got it right

346
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:23,395
- is Jung Hyun-bin from Team SNU.
- This is bad.

347
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,974
I really wanted to be
the first person to get it.

348
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,068
I wanted to name
Team Harvard as my opponent.

349
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,153
I wanted to come in first again,

350
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:34,490
so it didn't feel great
when I came in 11th place.

351
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,742
PERFECT NUMBER
SOLUTION

352
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,745
PUT 1 FOR DIGITS 5, 6, 7
WHICH ARE UNLIKELY TO OCCUR MORE THAN ONCE

353
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:42,331
THE DIGIT 1 WILL OCCUR 4 TIMES

354
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,917
THE DIGIT 4 WILL OCCUR 2 TIMES

355
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:49,129
IF YOU PUT 2 FOR DIGIT 2,
THE STATEMENT WOULD BE FALSE

356
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:51,507
THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES
OF THE DIGIT 2 IS 3

357
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,467
THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES
OF THE DIGIT 3 IS 2

358
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,704
KNOWING HOW TO ELIMINATE ERRORS IS KEY

359
00:18:57,096 --> 00:18:59,515
The 12th person who got it right is Ray.

360
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,350
THE 12TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
HARVARD, RAY

361
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,853
- Did you solve it?
- I'm still clueless.

362
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,354
It's so confusing.

363
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,983
The 13th person who got it right
is Yang Jun-hyuk.

364
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:10,735
THE 13TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
KAIST, YANG JUN-HYUK

365
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:13,362
The 14th and 15th people who got it right

366
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,756
are Chae Seung-min and Kim Jung-min.

367
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:17,658
...and Kim Jung-min.

368
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:18,576
Let's go!

369
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,119
- Team KU all passed.
- You all passed.

370
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,287
- Let's go!
- He's so excited.

371
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,706
EVERYONE IN TEAM KU SOLVED THE QUESTION

372
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:25,624
5TH: KU, LEE DONG-KYU
8TH: KU, LEE JI-SOO

373
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,710
14TH: KU, CHAE SEUNG-MIN
15TH: KU, KIM JUNG-MIN

374
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:30,638
- We're the first school to finish.
- All of us solved it.

375
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:33,215
Look at us now, Team Harvard.

376
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:35,968
- You've heard of KAIST, SNU, and Yonsei?
- That was easy.

377
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:38,596
YONSEI, PARK NA-YOON
The 16th person...

378
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,514
HARVARD, DAVID
The 17th person...

379
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:42,282
SNU, PARK HYUN-MIN
The 18th person

380
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,809
who got it right is Park Hyun-min.

381
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,644
I was terrible today.

382
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:47,813
No, you did fine.

383
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,025
I came in 17th place.

384
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,945
I'm basically at the bottom.

385
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,196
ACE SELECTION

386
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,490
17TH: HARVARD, DAVID
18TH: SNU, PARK HYUN-MIN

387
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,159
Team Harvard has one person left.

388
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,869
- Harvard and KAIST?
- I think it's Team KAIST.

389
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,004
I think so.

390
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,500
- Does Team KAIST have one left?
- Yes.

391
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:12,046
TEAM HARVARD'S SKY
TEAM KAIST'S CHOI SEO-YEON

392
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,388
My mind went blank.

393
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:22,489
It was difficult.

394
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,642
You can do it.

395
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:25,659
Keep it up.

396
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,294
You can do it.

397
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,110
Don't look. We shouldn't pressure her.

398
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:38,105
This is ridiculous.

399
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,116
I just don't get it.

400
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:42,034
Why won't it work?

401
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:44,244
Meditate for 30 seconds and try again.

402
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,296
Why can't I solve this?
I don't know what to do anymore.

403
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:55,931
Two.

404
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,091
One.

405
00:20:57,175 --> 00:20:58,009
One.

406
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,059
I might have the answer.

407
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:15,234
The 19th person who got it right...

408
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,903
Why hasn't she solved it yet?

409
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:24,869
I felt super frustrated.

410
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,705
The 19th person who got it right...

411
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:35,462
is from Team KAIST. It's Choi Seo-yeon.

412
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:36,998
I almost died.

413
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,467
THE 19TH PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
KAIST, CHOI SEO-YEON

414
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:41,886
I almost died.

415
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,804
- You did great.
- It's Choi Seo-yeon.

416
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:49,210
That was insane.

417
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:50,811
Good job.

418
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,272
I'm so bad at logical reasoning.

419
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:56,117
Don't say that.
You never know what could happen next.

420
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:01,697
I was really bad at it.

421
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,366
I didn't want to weigh my team down.

422
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,618
But I did, so I felt bad about it.

423
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:09,697
I'll just have to do better
in the upcoming matches.

424
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,875
Last but not least,
the 20th person who got it right

425
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,835
is from Team Harvard. It's Sky.

426
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:16,087
Well done.

427
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,671
- Good work.
- It's embarrassing.

428
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:19,757
It's fine.

429
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,508
It's okay. It was just a warm-up.

430
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,177
This was our first challenge.

431
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:25,046
I was disappointed with the outcome.

432
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:29,016
But now that I know
what the questions are like,

433
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:32,645
I believe I can do better from now on.

434
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:34,563
I haven't lost my confidence yet.

435
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,733
ACE SELECTION

436
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:39,960
That concludes the Ace Selection.

437
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:47,534
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong.

438
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:49,270
Team KAIST's So Hyun-ji.

439
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,971
Team KU's Lee Dong-kyu.

440
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,706
Team SNU's Song Hyun-seok.

441
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:54,041
Team Harvard's Janice.

442
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,169
You've been selected as your team's Ace.

443
00:22:57,128 --> 00:22:58,796
Today's Ace Match...

444
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:02,950
is Balance Game.

445
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:06,179
In Balance Game,
you will be comparing numbers.

446
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:10,057
The first person to guess
the opponent's number combination wins.

447
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,851
I think I have a good shot.

448
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:15,329
I knew I'd do well
as soon as I saw what the game was.

449
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:20,026
Two contestants will each choose
four different numbers

450
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:22,236
that add up to 20.

451
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:26,240
Decimals or fractions may not be used,

452
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:29,285
and all numbers
must be a single-digit number.

453
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,538
When the game begins,

454
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:35,182
you may choose
1 of 2 methods to compare your card

455
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:39,120
with your opponent's
within a time limit of two minutes.

456
00:23:40,054 --> 00:23:41,088
The first method...

457
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:46,302
is to choose one card from each deck
and compare the two numbers.

458
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,681
- That's interesting.
- The second method

459
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:55,561
is to choose two cards from each deck
and compare the sum of the numbers.

460
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,064
You could mask your numbers
using this method.

461
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,483
Both contestants will take turns
to compare the numbers.

462
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:03,361
The time limit is two minutes.

463
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:06,989
You win if you guess
your opponent's numbers correctly.

464
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:10,576
If your guess is incorrect,
your opponent gets a chance to guess.

465
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:11,952
It sounds fun.

466
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:13,620
It's an interesting game.

467
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:15,915
The winner of the Ace Match

468
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:19,419
will receive a benefit
they can use in the next game.

469
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:22,588
I wanted to win the benefit
and contribute to my team.

470
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:26,067
I knew I would win
if I was given the chance to play.

471
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:28,269
I wanted to win that benefit,

472
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,762
and I was also confident I could win.

473
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:32,472
I knew I would be good at this game.

474
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:36,436
In Ace Match,
the winner of the Ace Selection

475
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:41,857
gets to pick their opponent
for a one-on-one match.

476
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:45,111
Please name the Ace
you wish to play against.

477
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:48,155
As a Yonsei student,

478
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,950
I wanted to go up against Team KU.

479
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:54,078
My team lost to Team SNU
in yesterday's Ace Match,

480
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:56,097
so I also wanted to choose Team SNU.

481
00:24:58,124 --> 00:25:00,435
The Ace I'll play against...

482
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:10,928
is Janice from Team Harvard.

483
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:14,432
- We've got this.
- Yes.

484
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:15,766
The benefit will be ours.

485
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:23,483
He seemed to think
we were an easy mark which was annoying.

486
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:26,986
I wanted to win the benefit for my team.

487
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:30,656
Objectively speaking,
Janice placed the lowest.

488
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,616
She also seemed like someone I could beat.

489
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:37,004
I was happy to be given
the chance to win the benefit.

490
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:39,773
To be honest, I wanted him to pick me.

491
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:44,504
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong
and Team Harvard's Janice,

492
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,848
please proceed
to the One-on-One Room for the Ace Match.

493
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,837
Exuding confidence was key,
so I kept telling myself I could do it.

494
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:13,824
I only chose Janice to secure my victory,

495
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,075
so I felt confident.

496
00:26:17,412 --> 00:26:19,997
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong
and Team Harvard's Janice,

497
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:22,249
please fill out your number cards.

498
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:41,310
TEAM YONSEI, KIM KI-HONG

499
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:42,811
30 MINUTES AGO
Look.

500
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:47,141
In theory, these numbers
would be the best numbers to pick.

501
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:50,652
You can easily figure out
your opponent's numbers with this set.

502
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,079
That's its greatest merit.

503
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:56,784
But the downside is that it makes it easy
for your opponent to guess your numbers.

504
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,911
They can figure it out
with a little reasoning.

505
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,162
That's a good strategy.

506
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:02,689
The first combination
I thought of was 2, 4, 6, and 8,

507
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,377
but it looked too simple
and the opponent could get it in one go.

508
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:09,004
So, I decided to make it a bit trickier.

509
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:11,549
That's why I came up with 3, 7, 6, and 4.

510
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:13,767
You can use any numbers between 0 and 9,

511
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:17,430
but it's highly unlikely
for the opponent to choose either 0 or 9.

512
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,932
It'd be obvious
if they chose those numbers.

513
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:24,011
We don't have to choose 8.
We can figure it out with the number 7.

514
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:38,284
JANICE FROM TEAM HARVARD
ALSO WRITES HER NUMBERS DOWN

515
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:44,698
TEAM YONSEI'S KIM KI-HONG: 3, 7, 6, 4
TEAM HARVARD'S JANICE: ?, ?, ?, ?

516
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,000
SPECTATORS CAN SEE ONE TEAM'S NUMBERS

517
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,627
You show us which numbers they chose.

518
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:51,772
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

519
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:52,673
Write it down.

520
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:55,926
Before we begin,
Kim Ki-hong from Team Yonsei,

521
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,928
who won first place in the Ace Selection,

522
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:01,048
will be given the chance
to decide who goes first.

523
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,558
He'll go first, right?

524
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:03,684
I'd go second.

525
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,228
If you go first,
you could take a wild guess.

526
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:08,730
There's no guarantee
that your guess would be right.

527
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:10,090
- But--
- It'd be meaningless.

528
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:11,692
But there's still that chance.

529
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:14,362
The comparisons
are revealed to both players, right?

530
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:16,947
Then it doesn't matter who goes first.

531
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:20,535
Would you like to go first or second?

532
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,143
I'll go first.

533
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:31,879
You have chosen to go first.

534
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:34,465
I didn't think it mattered who went first.

535
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:37,759
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong will go first,

536
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,596
and Team Harvard's Janice will go second.

537
00:28:43,157 --> 00:28:46,394
We will now begin Balance Game,
the Ace Match for today.

538
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,696
TEAM HARVARD'S BASE CAMP

539
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:50,565
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP

540
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:54,301
Team Yonsei's Kim Ki-hong,
please name the cards you wish to compare.

541
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:04,870
I looked Ki-hong in the eyes
to show him I wasn't intimidated by him.

542
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:08,790
I don't usually shy away
from making eye contact,

543
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:11,085
but Janice kept staring at me directly.

544
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:14,288
It was quite intense,
so I felt like I had to look away.

545
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:21,429
I'd like to compare my B with Janice's B.

546
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:22,722
Your B and her B.

547
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,848
- B and B?
- We will now compare

548
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:28,102
the number on Kim Ki-hong's B
with the number on Janice's B.

549
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,354
The comparison shows...

550
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:33,774
TEAM YONSEI, KIM KI-HONG, B
TEAM HARVARD, JANICE, B

551
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:37,278
...that the number on Janice's B
is greater than Kim Ki-hong's B.

552
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,079
JANICE'S B IS GREATER THAN KIM KI-HONG'S B

553
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,114
We've got this.

554
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:43,075
This is great. We're starting off strong.

555
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:48,038
- That really narrows it down.
- Team Harvard is in the dark right now.

556
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:49,998
JANICE'S B IS GREATER THAN KIM KI-HONG'S B

557
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:52,668
JANICE'S B IS EITHER 8 OR 9

558
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:54,754
We have an advantage right now.

559
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:56,922
Please choose the next cards.

560
00:29:57,998 --> 00:30:00,635
I'd like to compare my C with Ki-hong's B.

561
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,205
- Her C and his B?
- Yes.

562
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:06,599
That's it.

563
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:08,809
She's playing just as we predicted.

564
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:12,313
She's now playing offense by comparing
the seven with another number.

565
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:15,857
The comparison shows

566
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:18,819
that the number on Kim Ki-hong's B...

567
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:23,699
TEAM YONSEI, KIM KI-HONG, B
TEAM HARVARD, JANICE, C

568
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:24,958
...is greater.

569
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:28,329
KIM KI-HONG'S B IS GREATER THAN JANICE'S C

570
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:31,398
JANICE'S C IS BETWEEN 0 AND 6

571
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:37,971
I'd like to compare my D with Janice's C.

572
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:40,466
That was a smart move.

573
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,510
He's comparing his four with her C.

574
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:45,513
- That would be a big clue.
- It's right in the middle.

575
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:48,265
That's right. We need to counterattack.

576
00:30:49,082 --> 00:30:50,727
The comparison shows

577
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:55,456
that the number on Janice's C
is greater than Kim Ki-hong's D.

578
00:30:55,523 --> 00:31:00,327
JANICE'S C IS GREATER THAN KIM KI-HONG'S D

579
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,447
- That's really helpful.
- I love how this is going.

580
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:06,325
- That eliminates a lot of numbers.
- It's over.

581
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,836
KIM KI-HONG'S D IS LESS THAN JANICE'S C

582
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:10,663
JANICE'S C IS EITHER 5 OR 6

583
00:31:10,747 --> 00:31:14,792
Her B must be either 8 or 9,
and her C must be either 5 or 6.

584
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,213
TEAM HARVARD, JANICE

585
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,173
Team Yonsei has the upper hand, right?

586
00:31:21,257 --> 00:31:22,091
They do.

587
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,956
I'd like to compare my A with Ki-hong's D.

588
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:31,191
What's going on?

589
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:34,562
We will now compare
the number on Janice's A

590
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:37,898
with the number on Kim Ki-hong's D.

591
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:40,526
The comparison shows...

592
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:48,951
TEAM YONSEI, KIM KI-HONG, D
TEAM HARVARD, JANICE, A

593
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:50,745
...that they are the same.

594
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,707
KIM KI-HONG'S D EQUALS JANICE'S A

595
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,016
This is awesome.

596
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:03,006
- Team Yonsei is going to win.
- I know.

597
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:07,060
- He has a clear advantage.
- He already knows it's 4 and 6.

598
00:32:07,495 --> 00:32:09,563
TEAM HARVARD, JANICE

599
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:18,021
JANICE HAS 1 OF THESE 4 COMBINATIONS

600
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:19,649
We're almost there.

601
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:22,652
I had figured out most of her numbers.

602
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,779
She only knew one of mine.

603
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:29,533
I was convinced I was way ahead of her
and that the victory would be mine.

604
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:35,489
I'd like to compare the sum of my A and B
with the sum of Janice's A and C.

605
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,088
He's using the sum method
to camouflage his numbers.

606
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:45,007
The comparison shows

607
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:48,051
that the sum of both numbers...

608
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:53,808
are equal.

609
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:58,521
THE SUM OF KIM KI-HONGS A AND B
EQUALS JANICE'S A AND C

610
00:33:00,356 --> 00:33:01,732
He has a huge advantage.

611
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:03,317
It's over.

612
00:33:03,384 --> 00:33:05,319
It's down to either of these two.

613
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:06,487
TEAM HARVARD, JANICE

614
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:08,255
JANICE HAS 1 OF THESE 2 COMBINATIONS

615
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:12,618
Please choose the next cards.

616
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:18,165
I was sure I'd win.

617
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:25,673
I have the answer.

618
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:27,216
I have the answer.

619
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:28,743
I have the answer.

620
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,811
Look!

621
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:32,513
I have the answer.

622
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:34,598
His numbers are 3...

623
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:41,480
His numbers are 3, 7, 6, and 4.

624
00:33:42,322 --> 00:33:43,649
Yes, that is correct.

625
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:45,609
Yes.

626
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:55,210
TEAM HARVARD'S BASE CAMP

627
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:02,668
He gave us exactly what we needed.

628
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:04,086
How did you figure it out?

629
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:09,182
I needed to play offense
instead of defense to win this game.

630
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:15,431
My focus was on finding out
my opponent's numbers quickly.

631
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,692
JANICE'S STRATEGY
BINARY SEARCH

632
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:32,031
NARROW THE SEARCH
BY DIVIDING THE RANGE IN HALF

633
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,366
BEFORE THE ACE MATCH

634
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:52,927
When you search for a number in coding,

635
00:34:53,011 --> 00:34:56,263
you find the target value
by comparing it with the middle element.

636
00:34:56,347 --> 00:34:59,433
We decided to use that concept
and chose to start with six.

637
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:01,502
If it were greater,
we'd compare it with eight.

638
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:03,354
If not, we'd compare it with four.

639

FIRST ROUND
TEAM YONSEI'S KIM KI-HONG

00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:22,090

FIFTH ROUND
TEAM YONSEI'S KIM KI-HONG

647
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:37,722
I'd like to compare
the sum of Janice's A and C.

648
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:39,640
The sum of both numbers are equal.

649
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:43,143
TEAM YONSEI'S KIM KI-HONG: ?, 7, ?, 4

TEAM YONSEI'S KIM KI-HONG: 3, 7, ?, 4
TEAM HARVARD'S JANICE: 4, 8, 6, 2

651
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:48,900
ALL FOUR NUMBERS ARE UNIQUE
AND ADD UP TO 20

652
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:51,485
I had given her
more information than I thought.

653
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:54,989
I didn't take into account
the possibility that she knew my numbers.

654
00:35:55,073 --> 00:35:57,075
That's why I asked
for a comparison of the sums.

655
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,993
I think that was my mistake.

656
00:35:59,077 --> 00:36:00,694
- We were so close.
- The sums gave away 3 and 7.

657
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:02,121
He should've just guessed.

658
00:36:02,705 --> 00:36:04,707
That last move was the wrong one.

659
00:36:09,603 --> 00:36:11,505
That concludes the Ace Match.

660
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:16,761
Team Harvard's Janice has won this match
and thus has secured the benefit.

661
00:36:17,878 --> 00:36:20,781
Please return to your base camps.

662
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,018
TEAM HARVARD'S BASE CAMP

663
00:36:24,102 --> 00:36:24,936
Well done.

664
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,155
Good job.

665
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,860
We lost the last match
when Team SNU picked us.

666
00:36:32,944 --> 00:36:35,529
It's sad that we lost,
especially since we picked this time.

667
00:36:36,114 --> 00:36:37,865
- We'll get them back.
- We will.

668
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:40,993
They have the benefit,
but we'll beat them by a huge margin.

669
00:36:41,077 --> 00:36:44,371
- We beat Team SNU despite their benefit.
- That's right. We can do it.

670
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:45,706
It was a huge let-down.

671
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:49,209
I should've just taken a guess.

672
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,711
I was disappointed in myself.

673
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:56,258
All contestants,
please gather at the Main Hall.

674
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:08,196
Since this was a competition,
I went in with the mindset to win.

675
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:10,272
My confidence was at an all-time high.

676
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,801
I hope we can survive today.

677
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,909
I was determined
to avoid the Deathmatch this time.

678
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:25,163
I didn't want my team
to end up in the Deathmatch,

679
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:26,330
so I had to do well.

680
00:37:27,148 --> 00:37:29,541
Brainpower survival challenge,

681
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:30,918

682
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:36,724
Signal Investigation.

00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,292
"Signal Investigation"?

685
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:41,195
What is that?

686
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:44,682
In Signal Investigation,
each team will designate

687
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:47,601
three investigators
who will inspect the culprit

688
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:51,230
and one arresting officer
who will apprehend the culprit.

689
00:37:52,982 --> 00:37:54,608
I knew they'd split us up.

690
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,737
Each team will receive 15 Signal Cards.

691
00:37:58,813 --> 00:38:02,741
All four members will gather
at their base camps before the match

692
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:04,160
and create 15 Signal Cards

693
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:07,079
with a unique set of information
that will help apprehend the culprit.

694
00:38:07,163 --> 00:38:08,756
The time limit is 30 minutes.

695
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,626
There are no restrictions
on what you write on the Signal Cards,

696
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,171
however, it must not exceed 20 characters.

697
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:17,798
Spaces between words
will not count as characters.

698
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:19,258
Twenty characters is a lot.

699
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,469
Once the game begins,
the three investigators

700
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:24,889
and the arresting officer
will be sequestered.

701
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:29,143
The three investigators will spend
20 minutes inspecting the culprit.

702
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:32,563
They will then utilize the 15 Signal Cards

703
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,082
to produce up to ten photos for evidence.

704
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:38,694
You may use one Signal Card
for one evidence photo,

705
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:41,789
but you may also use
one Signal Card more than once.

706
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:45,409
The photos will then be put
in an investigation envelope

707
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,245
and handed over to the arresting officer.

708
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,454
INVESTIGATION ENVELOPE

709
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:51,124
Once the handover has been made,

710
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:55,419
the arresting officer will use
the evidence photos as clues

711
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:59,506
to determine who the culprit is
among the 8 suspects within 10 minutes.

712
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,550
Once identified,
place the culprit's photo in the envelope.

713
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:03,277
That's crazy.

714
00:39:05,746 --> 00:39:07,640
The game will consist of three rounds.

715
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:10,851
Between each round,
you'll be given ten minutes

716
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:14,480
to discuss your strategy
and edit your 15 Signal Cards.

717
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,358
- It sounds fun.
- We can do this.

718
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,487
At the end of Signal Investigation,

719
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,698
the top three teams
with the most arrests will survive.

720
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:27,902
The other two teams will face
the possibility of elimination.

721
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:34,167
If there is a tie after the third round,

722
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,753
the team that uses
fewer evidence photos will survive.

723
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:44,051
The benefit for today's main match
is an additional Signal Card.

724
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:47,788
Team Harvard will be given a card
for winning the Ace Match.

725
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:51,225
They will have a total of 16 Signal Cards.

726
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:54,428
All five teams,
please prepare for the main match.

727
00:39:55,021 --> 00:39:57,315
Learning all the cards may be a problem.

728
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,317
Let's think this through.

729
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,609
Let's go inside.

730
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:02,486
Do we need to write fewer clues?

731
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:06,157
We'll have to use
as few photos as possible to break a tie.

732
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,507
Can I be the arresting officer?

733
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,952
- I think I'd be better at it.
- I have a question.

734
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:12,372
- Let's go inside.
- Let's discuss this inside.

735
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:13,873
- We can ask that later.
- Okay.

736
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:17,551
We need to use as few photos as possible.

737
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:21,130
I think this will be important,
so I'd like to try something.

738
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:22,756
I'll give you an example.

739
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:24,925
Male or female. Wears a hat or doesn't.

740
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:26,677
Wears glasses or doesn't.

741
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,721
- Shoes or no shoes.
- Right.

742
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:29,972
Using that framework,

743
00:40:30,056 --> 00:40:33,351
we can assign
a binary number to each clue.

744
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,311
- We can use the binary system.
- Okay.

745
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:39,732
Using the binary number system
on the Signal Cards can be helpful.

746
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:41,275
Let's use the binary system.

747
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,277
Use the binary system and a clock.

748
00:40:43,361 --> 00:40:44,444
Write three clues.

749
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:47,073
That's 2 to the power of 3,
so that's 8 possible outcomes.

750
00:40:47,156 --> 00:40:49,033
We'll position them accordingly.

751
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,369
How do we manage that? Give me an example.

752
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:53,871
Let's say we have
"male, glasses, and height."

753
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:56,749
If we want to indicate the first word,
that'd be "OXX."

754
00:40:57,524 --> 00:41:00,336
Let's say we wrote
three words on a Signal Card.

755
00:41:00,428 --> 00:41:02,588
As 2 to the power of 3 equals 8,

756
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:06,508
we'd indicate what was true
by placing it in 1 of 8 directions.

757
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:09,469
OOO: MALE: O, GLASSES: O, BEARD: O

758
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:11,889
OXO: MALE: O, GLASSES: X, BEARD: O

759
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,308
XOX: MALE: X, GLASSES: O, BEARD: X

760
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:15,393
Hear me out.

761
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:17,353
- We're listening.
- I realized something.

762
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:21,190
Let's say we have
an "OOO" card and an "OOX" card.

763
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:24,285
The "OOX" card
can be used as an "XOO" card.

764
00:41:24,352 --> 00:41:27,321
- We can spare one card.
- You're right.

765
00:41:27,405 --> 00:41:29,156
Let's see how many cards we need.

766
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,324
We'd need "OXO."

767
00:41:30,408 --> 00:41:32,868
I thought the binary system
would be convenient.

768
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:34,995
Since our communication would be limited,

769
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:37,831
our game plan was to set binary classes

770
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:41,035
and share the information
by marking them with an O or an X.

771
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:42,636
Here's what I came up with.

772
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:46,540
I think specific traits
can be sorted into three categories.

773
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:50,428
We could add "young."

774
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:52,638
- "Young."
- "Middle-aged."

775
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:54,974
- "Middle-aged."
- "Old."

776
00:41:55,057 --> 00:41:58,269
On the horizontal axis,
we had "White," "Asian," and "Black."

777
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:02,623
On the vertical axis,
we had "young," "middle-aged," and "old."

778
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:05,092
We worked out a 3 by 3 grid that way.

779
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:06,494
With our 3 by 3 matrix,

780
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,697
we'd be able to give
2 clues with just 1 card.

781
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:11,907
ASIAN, MIDDLE-AGED

782
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:13,284
According to our system,

783
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:16,412
we'd place an OX card
next to the card with the three traits.

784
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:18,580
THE OX CARD WILL INDICATE
WHAT TRAITS THE CULPRIT HAS

785
00:42:18,973 --> 00:42:23,511
Our strategy should be to divide
the Signal Cards into three sections.

786
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:26,630
We'd have to be discrete
if we use this approach.

787
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:27,840
"Male."

788
00:42:28,466 --> 00:42:29,716
"Female."

789
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:31,551
Let's add "unknown."

790
00:42:31,618 --> 00:42:32,653
That's a good idea.

791
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,849
We may not be able to tell
whether the culprit is male or female.

792
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:37,766
Okay.

793
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,593
How does this sound?

794
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:42,562
We can divide the card
into 6 sections by making 2 columns.

795
00:42:42,629 --> 00:42:44,731
We can write one column upside down.

796
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:47,318
Our strategy was to divide
the card into three sections.

797
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:49,945
Each section would have a specific trait.

798
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:54,116
If the card is placed in the first row,
it means the culprit has the first trait.

799
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:56,910
If it's in the second row,
they have the second trait.

800
00:42:56,994 --> 00:43:00,047
If it's in the third row,
they have the third trait.

801
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:02,291
I thought we could utilize
the extra space,

802
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,752
so we added another column

803
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:07,054
and wrote three more words upside down.

804
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:10,425
We'd be able to give different clues
by flipping the card around.

805
00:43:10,508 --> 00:43:12,760
SKIRT, PANTS, SHIRT, GLASSES, HAT, MAN

806
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,720
We should allot two cards for colors.

807
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:17,515
We may need to describe
the color of the hair or necktie.

808
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:19,934
Wouldn't we need
to use the color card multiple times?

809
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:22,270
That'd mean we need multiple color cards.

810
00:43:22,353 --> 00:43:25,940
The photos would be in color,
so it could be an important clue.

811
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:27,108
- That makes sense.
- Yes.

812
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:30,077
It's tricky.

813
00:43:38,286 --> 00:43:40,388
JANICE WRITES DOWN "ROYGBIV"

814
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:41,497
It'd be like this.

815
00:43:45,084 --> 00:43:47,295
I made a color card first.

816
00:43:47,378 --> 00:43:50,965
The colors were red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

817
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,258
ROYGBIV are colors.

818
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:55,595
ROYGBIV is an English acronym
that stands for the colors of the rainbow.

819
00:43:55,677 --> 00:44:00,933
We made the arrow on our card
point to the corresponding color.

820
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:15,156
This is brilliant.

821
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:17,116
We just have to align them properly.

822
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:19,910
"Straight hair."

823
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:21,245
"Long hair."

824
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,498
- "Perm."
- We should be detailed.

825
00:44:23,564 --> 00:44:25,633
If we need to write down more traits,

826
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:28,169
- we can fit one more.
- Why don't we use the corners?

827
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:30,379
If we do this, we can have eight traits.

828
00:44:30,463 --> 00:44:31,339
It's a good idea.

829
00:44:31,422 --> 00:44:35,042
The photos will be on the table
when we take the picture.

830
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:37,094
The left corner
will be our point of reference.

831
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:38,513
This will be our guide.

832
00:44:38,596 --> 00:44:39,930
This means long hair.

833
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:42,016
If we place it like this, it means perm.

834
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:47,146
We decided to take photos
using the left corner as our reference.

835
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:51,651
We would read the word
parallel to the upper left corner.

836
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,319
PERM

837
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:54,529
LONG HAIR

838
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:56,531
We need words that describe shoes.

839
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,241
Sandals, barefoot.

840
00:44:59,325 --> 00:45:00,409
How about slippers?

841
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:04,121
I think this will be extremely difficult.

842
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:06,707
Why don't we add
straw shoes or wooden clogs?

843
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:11,837
What other bottoms are there?

844
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,922
What if he's not wearing something?

845
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:14,982
His bottoms?

846
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:16,175
Top or bottom.

847
00:45:16,634 --> 00:45:17,885
- So they'd be naked?
- Yes.

848
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,094
If it's a male athlete,

849
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:21,514
he could be in his shorts
and nothing more.

850
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:29,021
Which alphabet do we use for a skirt? S?

851
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:30,064
Skirt would be SK.

852
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,066
Got it. What's next?

853
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:34,109
- I think accessories are important.
- Accessories?

854
00:45:34,193 --> 00:45:35,986
Necklaces, bracelets, and rings.

855
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:39,031
We have more cards, so write them down.

856
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:42,201
If there are 2 identical females,
but 1 is wearing accessories,

857
00:45:42,284 --> 00:45:44,311
it would help us identify the culprit.

858
00:45:44,412 --> 00:45:46,247
It would be the deciding factor.

859
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:51,552
Please designate the investigators
and the arresting officer in your team.

860
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,962
Who wants to be the arresting officer?

861
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:01,512
I want to, but it's too much pressure.

862
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:04,223
Who wants to try?

863
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:08,436
I think we all want to try,
but we're worried about getting it wrong.

864
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,145
There are only three rounds.

865
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,024
It's okay if you don't get it right.

866
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:15,693
No, we have to get it right.

867
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:18,404
- You lack empathy, don't you?
- I do.

868
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,742
We need to decide each person's role.

869
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:25,661
Let's decide the investigators
and the arresting officer.

870
00:46:25,745 --> 00:46:28,748
Hyun-jun played
a big role in setting our system up,

871
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,083
so I think
he should be the arresting officer.

872
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,259
Should I do it?

873
00:46:32,893 --> 00:46:34,420
We can swap after the first round.

874
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:36,422
- True.
- I'm pretty confident.

875
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:37,923
I know I can do a good job.

876
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:41,302
Then, Hyun-jun will be
the arresting officer for the first round.

877
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:44,388
We can switch roles
if it doesn't work out well.

878
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:46,515
You'll be the arresting officer, right?

879
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,269
It may be better
if we switch roles after the first round.

880
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:52,605
We'd be able
to understand each other better.

881
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:54,482
If we get it right, we shouldn't switch.

882
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:58,193
Let's see how the first round goes.
I'm sure we'll succeed, but still.

883
00:46:58,285 --> 00:47:00,488
TEAM HARVARD'S ARRESTING OFFICER IS DAVID

884
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:02,740
- Are these the clues?
- Yes, that's what we got.

885
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,617
- She has curly hair.
- Right.

886
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,203
- She's wearing a red skirt.
- Right. What else?

887
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:08,228
Let's see.

888
00:47:09,205 --> 00:47:10,498
Guys, gather around.

889
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:12,916
We can do this. Our strategy is flawless.

890
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,168
Let's do this.

891
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:16,337
- Okay, guys.
- Let's go!

892
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,088
- The victory is ours.
- Try to relax.

893
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,174
- Victory is SNU's!
- Victory is SNU's!

894
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,718
Awesome.

895
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:24,470
- Your time to create Signal Cards is up.
- Let's do this.

896
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:27,557
- Good luck.
- Our strategy is flawless.

897
00:47:27,648 --> 00:47:29,183
- Let's go!
- Let's do this.

898
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:31,977
- Let's go!
- Good luck.

899
00:47:32,061 --> 00:47:34,021
- We've got this.
- Let's do our best.

900
00:47:34,087 --> 00:47:35,956
Let's review. There are eight options.

901
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:38,108
The binary system goes from 000 to 111.

902
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:40,728
- This indicates race, okay?
- I got it.

903
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,030
We don't need the color cards for this.

904
00:47:43,097 --> 00:47:45,241
- It'd be Black, White, and Asian.
- Okay.

905
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:49,670
Investigators,
please gather at the Main Hall.

906
00:47:49,737 --> 00:47:52,673
Arresting officers,
please remain at your base camps.

907
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:59,346
Representatives of each team,
please take a photo of the culprit.

908
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:06,053
We can do this.

909
00:48:06,687 --> 00:48:07,764
- We can do this.
- Okay.

910
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:09,356
We've got this covered.

911
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:13,060
- This is interesting.
- We can get this, right?

912
00:48:14,595 --> 00:48:16,230
- It's perfect.
- It is.

913
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:24,739
We can do this. This is purple.

914
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:30,703

ROUND 1 CULPRIT

915
00:48:31,979 --> 00:48:33,748

918
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,545
She's Asian, right?

919
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:42,423
We'll add "no bangs."

920
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:48,262
Let's go with dress.

921
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:49,972
It needs to face upward.

922
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:52,558
We'll call this a dress.

923
00:48:52,642 --> 00:48:54,727
The top and bottom are the same color.

924
00:48:54,811 --> 00:48:57,020
Let's put the bottom as purple.

925
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:58,981
- She's wearing a dress...
- That's purple.

926
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:00,941
- We'll go with purple.
- It's darker than scarlet.

927
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,485
Don't forget the instrument.

928
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:04,904
She's holding a guitar to her right.

929
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,824
- We're done. No glasses, right?
- Great.

TEAM KAIST'S SUSPECT ANALYSIS

931
00:49:10,326 --> 00:49:11,828
She's in a good mood, right?

932
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:13,329
Yes, she is.

933
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:15,322
- You think so?
- She's smiling.

934
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:20,336
Let's go with "no buttons"
and "short-sleeves."

935
00:49:20,419 --> 00:49:22,296
She's wearing a long skirt.

936
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:24,231
GOOD MOOD, SHORT-SLEEVES, LONG SKIRT

937
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:26,091
Let's decide what we want to convey.

938
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,594
Do you agree that she looks joyful?

939
00:49:28,678 --> 00:49:30,554
Do you agree that she has short hair?

940
00:49:30,638 --> 00:49:31,672
Yes, I do.

941
00:49:32,431 --> 00:49:34,099
- She's an adult.
- That's right.

942
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:35,676
We'll add that. Next.

943
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:39,605
EVERYONE IS WORKING
ON THEIR EVIDENCE PHOTOS

944
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:42,525
- We have nothing to do.
- I'm tired.

945
00:49:42,616 --> 00:49:45,110
- We have nothing to do.
- I'm tired.

946
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:47,279
- We don't have to revise our strategy.
- We're done.

TEAM SNU TOOK
THEIR EVIDENCE PHOTO IN ONLY 5 MINUTES

948
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,578

00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:55,705

950
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,899

951
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,001
I'll take the photo now.

952
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:02,770
It's perfect. This is insane.

953
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:07,508
The strategy that we came up with
holds countless possibilities.

954
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:09,927
It's 2 to the power of 11
times 3 to the 5th power.

955
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,514
We can convey any information
with such a wide range of possibilities.

956
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:16,642
I was bubbling with confidence
ever since the beginning.

957
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,102
Hyun-bin must be so bored right now.

958
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:22,272
So are we. We're done.

959
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:33,033
I had to wait quite some time.

960
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,746
To kill time,
I started calculating the powers of two.

961
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:47,757
I stopped when I reached
2 to the power of 91.

962
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:50,684
It's not how I normally pass my time.

965
00:50:58,058 --> 00:51:00,770
I wrote down the details
of all our 15 Signal Cards.

966
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:04,832
They were easy to memorize.

00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:23,501

00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:26,712
I'll take a sip of water
to calm my nerves.

If I start going the wrong way,

978
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,429
my teammates will use
telepathy to guide me.

979
00:51:36,163 --> 00:51:38,098
I hope Jung-min can figure it out.

980
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:41,686
Should it be landscape or portrait?

981
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:42,812
You have two minutes.

982
00:51:42,895 --> 00:51:44,438
2 MINUTES LEFT TO TAKE EVIDENCE PHOTOS

983
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,611
That's good.

984
00:51:51,988 --> 00:51:53,072
We'll place them like this.

985
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,289
This shouldn't be in the photo.

986
00:52:04,092 --> 00:52:07,378
The most important clue
is that she's holding an object.

987
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:08,587
- "Brown."
- You have one minute.

988
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:11,256
This should match this over here.

989
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:14,593
- I think we're set.
- Are we in agreement?

990
00:52:15,036 --> 00:52:16,804
- Are we?
- Yes.

991
00:52:16,888 --> 00:52:19,941
Let's check it one last time
before we hand the envelope over.

992
00:52:21,174 --> 00:52:23,310
Why is Team Yonsei so busy?

993
00:52:23,844 --> 00:52:26,689
This may be good for us.
I think they messed up.

994
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:28,248
It shouldn't take this long.

995
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:34,789
Your time to create evidence photos is up.

00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:41,370
In the investigation envelope,

997
00:52:41,462 --> 00:52:45,198
you will find photos of eight people,
including the culprit.

00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:09,810
The culprit is wearing
a purple dress and is an artist.

1026
00:55:09,894 --> 00:55:13,272
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

1027
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:18,277
TEAM SNU ONLY TOOK ONE EVIDENCE PHOTO
Our strategy was to fit it in one photo.

1028
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,319
TEAM SNU'S STRATEGY

1029
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:21,780
CARD NO.1'S POSITION:
REVEALS THE CULPRIT'S RACE AND AGE

1030
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:23,908
OX CARD:
REVEALS IF THE TRAITS ARE TRUE OR FALSE

1031
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:27,536
WHAT DO THE EMPTY SLOTS
AND CARDS PLACED HORIZONTALLY MEAN?

1032
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:28,955
Guys, hold on.

1033
00:55:29,038 --> 00:55:31,165
If it's "XXX,"
we'll place it horizontally.

1034
00:55:31,249 --> 00:55:32,708
If it's "OOO," we'll leave it blank.

1035
00:55:38,131 --> 00:55:39,715
In the remaining slot,

1036
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:42,260
horizontal cards will be for males
and vertical cards will be for females.

1037
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:45,387
A HORIZONTAL CARD WILL INDICATE
THAT THE CULPRIT IS MALE

1038
00:55:45,471 --> 00:55:48,224
A VERTICAL CARD WILL INDICATE
THAT THE CULPRIT IS FEMALE

1039
00:55:51,269 --> 00:55:55,982
MIDDLE-AGED ASIAN,
GLASSES: X, HAT: X, BEARD: X

1040
00:55:56,065 --> 00:55:57,775
PANTS: X, SHORT HAIR: O, COAT: X

1041
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:00,820
THREE SUSPECTS ARE WEARING GLASSES

1042
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:03,072
THREE SUSPECTS HAVE LONG HAIR

1043
00:56:13,249 --> 00:56:15,293
TEAM KAIST'S BASE CAMP

1044
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:19,463
I was positive we could
figure this out with one photo.

1045
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:23,092
This game will be easy for teams
who figure out a method

1046
00:56:23,176 --> 00:56:26,304
to use one photo,
but difficult for those who don't.

1047
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:27,596
TEAM KAIST'S STRATEGY

1048
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,350
LINE UP THE APPROPRIATE TRAITS
IN CORRESPONDING ROWS

1049
00:56:41,194 --> 00:56:43,654
SUSPECTS THAT AREN'T
HOLDING OBJECTS ARE RULED OUT

1050
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:45,161
OBJECT IS IN BOTH HANDS

1051
00:56:56,667 --> 00:57:00,004
TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP

1052
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,506
TEAM YONSEI USES 2 EVIDENCE PHOTOS

1053
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:03,716
TEAM YONSEI'S STRATEGY

1054
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:06,719
USE THE BINARY SYSTEM
AND POSITION CARDS ACCORDINGLY

1055
00:57:06,802 --> 00:57:08,346
WHAT ABOUT THE CARDS THAT LIST 4 TRAITS?

1056
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:11,224
We listed four traits on each card.

1057
00:57:11,307 --> 00:57:14,268
If the words are
"bald, bob, short hair, and long hair,"

1058
00:57:14,352 --> 00:57:18,064
how we place the cards
would indicate the corresponding trait.

1059
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:21,234
FEMALE, SHORT SLEEVES, LONG DRESS
JOB, OBJECT, ACCESSORY

1060
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,365
SUSPECTS WITH LONG HAIR ARE RULED OUT

1061
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:31,077
LONG SLEEVES: X, LONG BOTTOMS: O, PANTS: X

1062
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,621
THERE ARE 2 REMAINING SUSPECTS

1063
00:57:40,086 --> 00:57:43,214
Hopefully, Hyun-jun will get the answer.

1064
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:44,590
I believe in Hyun-jun.

1065
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,843
You have one minute.

1066
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:55,475
You have 30 seconds.

1067
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:02,566
You have ten seconds.
Please put your answer in the envelope.

1068
00:58:13,286 --> 00:58:15,037
Your time is up.

1069
00:58:15,121 --> 00:58:17,831
Arresting officers,
please put the photo of the culprit

1070
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:20,542
in the envelope
and send it to the Main Hall.

1071
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:22,295
ALL ENVELOPES HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED

1072
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:28,008
- Officer, did you arrest the culprit?
- Officer.

1073
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,261
Hyun-ji stamped the seal inside.

1074
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:32,263
Did she get it?

1075
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,103
Please.

1076
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:46,152
Investigators, please open the envelope.

1077
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:50,281
Investigators, please open the envelope.

1078
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:53,659
- Please.
- Come on.

1079
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:54,785
I hope he got it.

1080
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:57,204
Let's open it. I hope he got it.

1081
00:58:58,538 --> 00:58:59,539
Please.

1082
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:05,171
Come on.

1083
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:09,300
Come on.

1084
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:11,635
Let's see.

1085
00:59:35,201 --> 00:59:37,786
Please place the photo on the photo stand.

1086
00:59:45,753 --> 00:59:46,879
Place it on the stand.

1087
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:49,298
ROUND 1
TEAM HARVARD CATCHES THE CULPRIT

1088
00:59:50,383 --> 00:59:51,384
Did he get it right?

1089
00:59:57,848 --> 00:59:59,808
- I don't think they got it right.
- Really?

1090
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:00,726
We did it.

1091
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:05,314
ROUND 1
TEAM SNU CATCHES THE CULPRIT

1092
01:00:05,398 --> 01:00:06,732
- Do you want to check?
- Sure.

1093
01:00:12,572 --> 01:00:13,573
That's it.

1094
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:15,575
ROUND 1
TEAM KU CATCHES THE CULPRIT

1095
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:20,246
ROUND 1
TEAM YONSEI CATCHES THE CULPRIT

1096
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:21,581
Way to go.

1097
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:24,792
Everyone got it right.

1098
01:00:25,543 --> 01:00:26,544
They all got it.

1099
01:00:30,381 --> 01:00:32,425
- She got it wrong.
- Seriously?

1100
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:34,885
- She got it wrong.
- Seriously?

1101
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:37,763
Really? What happened?

1102
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:40,057
ROUND 1
TEAM KAIST FAILS TO CATCH THE CULPRIT

1103
01:00:48,524 --> 01:00:49,817
They got it wrong.

1104
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,027
Team KAIST didn't get it.

1105
01:00:52,111 --> 01:00:54,155
- They got it wrong.
- Nice.

1106
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:56,865
- Team KAIST got it wrong.
- Did they?

1107
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:58,576
I wonder why they got it wrong.

1108
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:02,330
Are we the only ones who got it wrong?

1109
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,248
Are we?

1110
01:01:04,332 --> 01:01:05,707
- We are.
- We're the only ones.

1111
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:07,543
- What now?
- What did we do wrong?

1112
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,632
I totally panicked
and thought we were in big trouble.

1113
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:24,644
That concludes
the first round of Signal Investigation.

1114
01:01:26,228 --> 01:01:28,022
Team SNU, Team Yonsei,

1115
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:30,316
Team KU, and Team Harvard,

1116
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:31,900
have apprehended the culprit.

1117
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:33,611
SNU, YONSEI, KU, HARVARD SUCCEED

1118
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:36,656
Team KAIST has failed
to apprehend the culprit.

1119
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:41,202
ROUND 1
TEAM KAIST FAILS TO CATCH THE CULPRIT

1120
01:01:44,163 --> 01:01:45,831
We have to do better.

1121
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:48,209
At least two more teams
will mess up, right?

1122
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:54,882
Is this it?

1123
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,554
- What about bangs?
- He has bangs.

1124
01:01:59,637 --> 01:02:00,971
He doesn't have bangs.

1125
01:02:01,055 --> 01:02:02,097
What is this?

1126
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:03,391
It was a dumb mistake.

1127
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:07,019
I'm really upset at our performance.

1128
01:03:06,704 --> 01:03:08,706
