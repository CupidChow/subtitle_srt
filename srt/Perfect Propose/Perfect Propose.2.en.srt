1
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:20,727
It's been three weeks since Kai came.

2
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,620
Welcome home.

3
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:28,523
I'm home. Ah!

4
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:32,281
Bitter melon?

5
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:34,044
I was just thinking that

6
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:35,589
I wanted to eat it!

7
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,789
Kai really understands me, huh?

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,484
I know everything about you, Hirokuni.

9
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,453
You like meatballs more than hamburgers,

10
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:47,531
you like sweet tamagoyaki,

11
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:49,515
and you can eat as much rice

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,226
as you want with just pickled plums.

13
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,523
Right now, you must be

14
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:59,484
thinking that I'm a good fiancé.

15
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,171
I don't think that!

16
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:04,369
- And besides, that fiancé thing is...
- Come on,

17
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,049
go wash your hands. It's almost ready.

18
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:48,962
"Perfect Propose"

19
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:53,220
"Episode 2"

20
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:53,885
Oh,

21
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,861
he's there again today.

22
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,088
Isn't he always alone?

23
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,088
He doesn't have friends, right?

24
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:03,346
His eyes always look scary.

25
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,853
Is that so?

26
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:10,955
Ah.

27
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:12,463
What?

28
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:13,924
I forgot my gym uniform.

29
00:03:14,557 --> 00:03:16,330
- Oh come on!
- Oh come on!

30
00:03:16,393 --> 00:03:17,010
Sorry, sorry.

31
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:18,853
Go home ahead.

32
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:20,306
Seriously...

33
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:21,439
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.

34
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:22,119
See you later.

35
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:35,059
Another yakisoba pan.

36
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,656
Certainly, his eyes

37
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,179
look kind of intimidating.

38
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:45,169
Hey.

39
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:49,684
Quite cute, actually.

40
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:51,989
Hirokuni...

41
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:53,931
Hirokuni.

42
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:55,447
Hirokuni.

43
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:00,119
The alarm is ringing.

44
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:03,564
Good morning.

45
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:05,994
I told you,

46
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:07,728
you're too close!

47
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:08,689
Okay, okay.

48
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,103
Don't be shy.

49
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,892
I'm not shy!

50
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:19,049
Not cute.

51
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:32,416
Salmon.

52
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:53,361
What?

53
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,829
You are able to eat breakfast now.

54
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:02,235
At first, you looked like you were

55
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:03,298
going to throw up.

56
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:07,127
Well, my stomach got used to it,

57
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:09,071
since you came,

58
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:10,978
I get to eat breakfast everyday.

59
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,994
How about lunch? Are you able to eat it?

60
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:23,043
Huh?

61
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,574
A lunch box?

62
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,847
Did you make it for me?

63
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:27,105
Why bother?

64
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:28,527
I made them at the same time.

65
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:30,932
If you can't eat it, throw it away.

66
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:32,324
It'll go bad in the summer.

67
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:33,941
Yeah.

68
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:36,918
Well, I'm off to work.

69
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,355
Hey...

70
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:46,738
Thanks.

71
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:01,933
Hey,

72
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,168
I just wanted to confirm something.

73
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,808
The friend who's living with you

74
00:06:09,832 --> 00:06:10,894
is a guy, right?

75
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:13,636
Yes.

76
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:15,582
Right.

77
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:17,488
No, this is... Well,

78
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:19,206
It's more like a thank you gesture.

79
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:20,587
He didn't have a place to live

80
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:21,775
and I'm taking care of him.

81
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,869
Well, it feels like

82
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:23,965
he's taking care of me.

83
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:25,574
But I think it's good,

84
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:27,644
Watari-san looks much better now.

85
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,183
Well, it's just that things

86
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,723
have been so bad until now.

87
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,324
But it's been quite a while

88
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:35,004
since you started living together.

89
00:06:35,058 --> 00:06:35,660
No,

90
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:36,832
it's not living together,

91
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:38,894
it's just sharing the same place.

92
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,636
It's been quite a while...

93
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,488
You look happy.

94
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,660
How long is he planning to stay?

95
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,230
For the time being,

96
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:50,628
until the acquaintance of his,

97
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:52,191
the old man in the hospital,

98
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:54,496
is discharged.

99
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,121
Excuse me.

100
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:45,925
I'm going to sleep.

101
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,013
It's about time I leave.

102
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:54,802
Fukaya-kun.

103
00:07:58,169 --> 00:07:58,982
Visiting my father?

104
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:03,529
Uh, this...

105
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:04,724
Ah...

106
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:07,936
Umm...

107
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:10,294
- Your old man...
- Listen,

108
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,420
I'm sorry,

109
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:14,013
but could you refrain

110
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:15,466
from visiting for a while?

111
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:17,865
He has finally decided to

112
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,177
focus on his treatment.

113
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:20,732
I don't want his feelings

114
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,255
to be disturbed any further.

115
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,263
Sorry, always keeping

116
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,349
you here until this late.

117
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:37,029
No,

118
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,325
Kanako-san, you're doing almost

119
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:39,410
double the work I am.

120
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:41,412
If I were a bit more efficient...

121
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:42,627
Can we save that conversation

122
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:43,457
for tomorrow?

123
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,873
I'm at my limit...

124
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:48,497
But I'm surprised Watari-san

125
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:49,473
is doing okay.

126
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:50,145
Huh?

127
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:50,960
What do you mean?

128
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,434
I mean, having someone else

129
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,794
at home even when you return.

130
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:55,052
I'd find it difficult,

131
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,622
even if it's just a fellow guy...

132
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,154
Come to think of it...

133
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,000
I feel like

134
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,443
I've never felt stressed

135
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:07,474
with him around.

136
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:09,404
It's like,

137
00:09:09,436 --> 00:09:11,636
being together is not bad at all,

138
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,342
how should I say it...

139
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:17,928
An easygoing relationship?

140
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:20,459
Ah.

141
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,889
It's better to get some rest, right?

142
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:24,209
No,

143
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:25,201
Still...

144
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,872
Just trying to make you

145
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:27,903
feel comfortable.

146
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,060
But

147
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,271
after that, nothing has happened,

148
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:34,287
and the talk about a fiancé

149
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:35,935
is just an excuse

150
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,138
to find a place to live.

151
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:46,123
He's probably not serious about it.

152
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:52,521
Welcome back.

153
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,834
I'm home.

154
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,357
What's that?

155
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:00,654
I bought it.

156
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,310
Won't we get scolded?

157
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,150
Wind chimes in an apartment?

158
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:05,864
If someone complains,

159
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,075
I can just take them down.

160
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,803
I guess that's how it is.

161
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:21,029
Then,

162
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:22,810
it's okay, isn't it?

163
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:24,818
To continue living like this.

164
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,170
Dinner's ready.

165
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:31,982
Yeah.

166
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:38,536
I was late too,

167
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,661
so I made something simple.

168
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:40,678
Sorry.

169
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:41,724
Were you out somewhere?

170
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:43,701
At the old man's hospital.

171
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:45,592
Oh, I see.

172
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:46,951
How was it?

173
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:48,045
Who knows?

174
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:50,037
He seemed fine.

175
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:53,185
He was admitted for quite a while.

176
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,185
What kind of disease is it?

177
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:55,592
I don't know.

178
00:10:55,896 --> 00:10:57,357
They won't tell me.

179
00:10:57,982 --> 00:10:58,795
Why?

180
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:00,451
Well,

181
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,210
I'm an outsider,

182
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,660
so it can't be helped.

183
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,060
Yakisoba!

184
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:13,834
And with an egg on top!

185
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:14,779
Go ahead.

186
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,631
Alright, bon appétit.

187
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,099
Mmm!

188
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,653
It's been a while since I had this.

189
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:30,825
It's so delicious.

190
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:31,787
I'm glad you like it.

191
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:35,724
By the way,

192
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:37,247
you used to eat a lot of

193
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,332
yakisoba, didn't you?

194
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:39,076
Did I?

195
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:40,154
Yeah.

196
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,654
Do you like yakisoba?

197
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:44,943
Not particularly.

198
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,724
Really?

199
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:49,217
I like it.

200
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:50,842
You know, like

201
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:52,177
the yakisoba at festivals,

202
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,349
it's really tasty.

203
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:54,576
Well,

204
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,005
I've never eaten it.

205
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,482
Huh? You haven't?

206
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:02,389
I haven't been to a festival.

207
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:04,998
Then what about candy apples,

208
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:06,134
baby castella,

209
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:08,982
and goldfish scooping?

210
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:22,334
Then...

211
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:23,912
how about we go to

212
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:25,279
a festival together?

213
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:30,052
The one at the nearby shrine.

214
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,550
They're holding a Tanabata festival.

215
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,170
Sure,

216
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:36,373
but what time does the festival ends?

217
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:37,646
Huh?

218
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:41,449
It usually ends around 9 p.m.

219
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:43,568
Impossible. You have work.

220
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:44,435
No,

221
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:46,521
I'll try to finish work a bit early...

222
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:48,724
You don't have to go that far.

223
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,982
I'll take a bath first.

224
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,553
Hey!

225
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:30,990
Whoa, sorry!

226
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:32,303
What's up?

227
00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:37,420
You know,

228
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,412
let's go to the festival after all.

229
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:45,420
Eat yakisoba,

230
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,162
candy apples,

231
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,849
and try goldfish scooping.

232
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:51,622
We could even keep the goldfish

233
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,918
in a tank at home,

234
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:54,724
and it might grow super big...

235
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:57,224
We don't have a tank here.

236
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:58,740
Ah...

237
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:00,959
What about work?

238
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,740
I'll make sure to finish it.

239
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,418
Hmm...

240
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,623
Then, I'm looking forward to it.

241
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:12,416
Yeah.

242
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Want to join?

243
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:16,920
No way!

244
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:19,451
Oh my,

245
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,810
why are you sleeping,

246
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:23,029
you are the older one.

247
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,810
Hey, Hirokuni!

248
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:26,545
- Hirokuni!
- Ah.

249
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:28,240
It's okay, I'm leaving now.

250
00:15:28,256 --> 00:15:29,373
Oh. Is that so?

251
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:32,279
I'll be heading back to my dad.

252
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,029
Is that so?

253
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:34,286
You're going to the festival

254
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:35,341
at night, right?

255
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,310
Ah.

256
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,342
Please tell Hiro for me that

257
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:40,217
I won't make it.

258
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:40,818
Oh,

259
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:42,107
what a shame.

260
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:45,513
Please tell him that

261
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:47,490
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

262
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:49,896
Yes, I'll tell him.

263
00:15:57,865 --> 00:15:58,732
Bye-bye.

264
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:01,943
See you later.

265
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:00,654
Huh?

266
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,474
Ah, good morning.

267
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:05,803
What time did you get here?

268
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:07,443
Before six o'clock.

269
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:08,803
What,

270
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:10,754
do you have some urgent business?

271
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,654
No, I just tend to work slow.

272
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:19,490
Hey, Watari...

273
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,764
You always say that about yourself...

274
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:23,881
Good morning!

275
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,537
I thought I'd be the first one here,

276
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:28,834
but as expected.

277
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,271
It's nothing as expected, this is...

278
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:32,185
Sakamoto-kun,

279
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:33,389
let's do our best!

280
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:36,224
Yes!

281
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:44,576
Good work today.

282
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:45,779
- Good work today.
- Good work today.

283
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:48,982
Good work today.

284
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,373
Hey, you.

285
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:52,418
How about having a drink today?

286
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:53,404
I'll treat you.

287
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:55,576
Sorry, I have something to do.

288
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:56,732
Huh?

289
00:17:57,318 --> 00:17:59,459
Come on, I'll treat you. Let's go!

290
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:00,795
Good work today.

291
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:14,349
(Half price)

292
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,005
Kaneko-san, today I...

293
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:38,841
I understand.

294
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:39,943
I'll take care of the rest.

295
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:40,865
Thank you very much.

296
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:45,513
No time to go back home today,

297
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:46,662
meet you at the venue!

298
00:18:57,295 --> 00:18:58,170
Amazing.

299
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,732
Got it.

300
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:02,482
Let's eat a lot today!

301
00:19:03,021 --> 00:19:03,888
On the house!

302
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,940
Candy apples with him.

303
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:19,865
That's funny.

304
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:21,139
Watari.

305
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,115
Yes.

306
00:19:24,982 --> 00:19:26,170
You got some free time, right?

307
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,912
Oh, no, it's not that I'm free...

308
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,272
Make a design document

309
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:31,489
for the revised part.

310
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,209
We'll need it by tomorrow, it's urgent.

311
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,334
Supervisor...

312
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:36,764
Today, I have to...

313
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:38,459
Huh?

314
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:40,396
Well...

315
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:42,037
Today...

316
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:44,053
Ah.

317
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,709
Are you leaving?

318
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,607
Because everyone else is still working,

319
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:50,873
and I have a meeting too.

320
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:52,857
Huh?

321
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:54,935
Who's going to work on it then?

322
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,373
That...

323
00:19:57,685 --> 00:19:58,467
Supervisor,

324
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:01,451
I'll take care of it.

325
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,959
No,

326
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:07,170
what about the work you're handling?

327
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:08,178
It's impossible,

328
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,873
it's too much.

329
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,318
That makes me look like

330
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:12,629
a power-harassing boss.

331
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:13,553
I can't do that.

332
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:15,334
Um, it's okay,

333
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:17,115
- I'll manage it by then...
- Honestly,

334
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,536
I can handle those design documents

335
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:20,607
in two hours.

336
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:21,857
Huh?

337
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:23,506
Is that also impossible?

338
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:25,256
You can't do it in two hours?

339
00:20:26,373 --> 00:20:27,217
But,

340
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,826
completing this in two hours is, well...

341
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:31,646
If you can't do this in two hours,

342
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:33,248
isn't that your responsibility?

343
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:36,098
Isn't it because you work too slow?

344
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:39,717
Am I wrong?

345
00:20:58,304 --> 00:20:59,015
Sorry,

346
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:01,070
I'll be about two hours late.

347
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:27,138
(Yakisoba, shaved ice
Chocolate covered bananas)

348
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,459
Ah, it's wrong...

349
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:03,947
Is big brother's one bigger?

350
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:04,909
No, It's not bigger.

351
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:06,521
Eat it before the candy melts.

352
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:08,126
Did you trick me?

353
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:09,151
I didn't.

354
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:10,518
- Really?
- Really, really!

355
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:12,635
Come on, let's eat before it melts.

356
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,591
(Tanabata Festival)

357
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:41,130
(Yakisoba, shaved ice
Chocolate covered bananas)

358
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:59,513
Excuse me,

359
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:01,512
is there any yakisoba...

360
00:24:01,513 --> 00:24:04,498
Ah, sorry, we're sold out.

361
00:24:08,342 --> 00:24:09,193
I see...

362
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:37,803
Six years after that,

363
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,490
Kai was abandoned by his father...

364
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:49,162
But even if

365
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,592
I had known about it at that time,

366
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:54,498
could I have done anything?

367
00:25:01,053 --> 00:25:01,881
No,

368
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,178
even now...

369
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:09,076
(Next episode)

370
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:09,911
I'm sorry.

371
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,764
Why do you have to apologize?

372
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:12,990
It can't help it.

373
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,645
It wasn't intentional, was it?

374
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,286
Wear this and cook.

375
00:25:16,373 --> 00:25:17,842
It's not for myself

376
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:19,787
but it's food for someone.

377
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:21,896
Can you finish it by tomorrow?

378
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:23,045
I understand.

379
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:24,803
Why aren't you angry?

380
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:26,349
Saying it can't be helped is...

381
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:29,920
That guy has given up on everything.

382
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:31,959
He has been like that all along.

383
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:33,748
Let me do something to compensate.

384
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:34,959
Then...
