1
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:12,070
I'm home.

2
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,477
Good job.

3
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,492
Thanks.

4
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:43,984
Time to properly face you

5
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:46,609
and then give you an answer...

6
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:50,820
even though it sounds selfish.

7
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:00,086
Lately...

8
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,773
It's getting worse again.

9
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:06,781
Ah, work?

10
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:09,227
Well, the deadline is approaching.

11
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:11,047
Not that.

12
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:16,078
Your appearance.

13
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:19,539
My appearance?

14
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,330
"Perfect Propose"

15
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,050
"Episode 4"

16
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:50,321
Hey,

17
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:52,922
I've always been curious

18
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:53,883
about something.

19
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,602
Back when,

20
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,571
you know,

21
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:02,969
you liked me, right?

22
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:05,946
When we were kids.

23
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,297
We haven't seen each

24
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:10,562
other for over 10 years.

25
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:13,078
Could it be that...

26
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,227
during that time,

27
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,906
were you still...

28
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,320
feeling this way about me?

29
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:29,500
You're overthinking.

30
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:32,219
Even though you knew...

31
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:33,336
I didn't always have

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,602
that kind of feeling,

33
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,359
but I haven't liked anyone else

34
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:37,305
besides Hiro,

35
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:38,664
maybe that's the case.

36
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:41,016
I see.

37
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:43,219
You're really thinking about it.

38
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:45,360
I have,

39
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:46,813
I told you, didn't I?

40
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:48,782
You're so earnest,

41
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,243
that's why life's hard for you.

42
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:05,078
If that's the case,

43
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:07,391
you should've come earlier.

44
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:10,610
When you came over much bigger,

45
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:12,508
it freaked me out.

46
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:17,032
Honestly,

47
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,586
I didn't want to meet you again.

48
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:22,789
Why?

49
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:26,000
Because I

50
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,578
thought Hiro was cool.

51
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:32,469
Cool?

52
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:35,172
Liar!

53
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:36,461
When we were kids,

54
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:38,351
you made fun of me all the time!

55
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,571
Well, yeah, you were dumb.

56
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:41,875
Not dumb!

57
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,438
Well, maybe not the brightest.

58
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:48,930
But you were cool.

59
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,289
That's why

60
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:54,008
I didn't want to see you change.

61
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:58,508
Then why did you come here?

62
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:02,102
I wonder why.

63
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:06,211
The old man collapsed...

64
00:05:08,328 --> 00:05:09,789
When there was nothing left,

65
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:14,828
I just really wanted to see

66
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:18,211
Hiro's face.

67
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:23,555
My face?

68
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:35,281
(Edo-ya)

69
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:41,547
(Baby Sage 150 yen
Jerusalem cherry 350 yen)

70
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,836
(Basil 150 yen)

71
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,398
(Tomato)

72
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,296
I'm going out for drinks tonight,

73
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,851
so don't worry about dinner.

74
00:06:10,414 --> 00:06:11,399
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

75
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:13,360
Thanks for your hard work! Cheers!

76
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:14,993
Thanks for your hard work.

77
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:21,969
It's finally over,

78
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,094
that's a relief.

79
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:24,579
Thanks for your hard work.

80
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:26,453
Kaneko-san, great job to you too.

81
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,015
That's right, if Kaneko-san

82
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:29,858
wasn't the leader for this project,

83
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:31,633
it would have been a disaster.

84
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:33,273
You really have a strong sense

85
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:34,804
of stability, don't you, leader!

86
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,367
I won't treat you to a drink

87
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:37,703
even if you flatter me.

88
00:06:39,852 --> 00:06:42,212
This is bad, if I drink now...

89
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,970
Sorry for dragging you along.

90
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:04,016
No problem.

91
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:05,688
But seriously, you look

92
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,907
even paler than usual.

93
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:09,024
- Do I?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,509
But it's probably my fault.

95
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:12,796
I dumped a lot of work on you, Watari.

96
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:13,969
No, Kaneko-san,

97
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:16,000
you're the one with an insane workload,

98
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:17,554
but you still handle it all by yourself.

99
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,617
That's impressive.

100
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,328
Cut it out, even you said that.

101
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:21,298
No, really,

102
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:23,524
your care for everyone is impeccable.

103
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:25,368
Without you, our department

104
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:26,833
wouldn't function.

105
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:29,516
Watari,

106
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:31,134
I...

107
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:35,430
I'm quitting the company

108
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,797
at the end of this month.

109
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,199
I've been telling them for a while,

110
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:43,839
but they wouldn't let me go.

111
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:46,542
I finally settled it last week.

112
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,995
I see.

113
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:51,316
Sorry for the sudden news.

114
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,769
So, what will you...

115
00:07:55,144 --> 00:07:56,667
An acquaintance is starting a business,

116
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:57,698
so I'm going there.

117
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,831
I see,

118
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,323
well,

119
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,824
I would be lonely.

120
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:06,503
Well,

121
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:11,956
I probably shouldn't say this, but...

122
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,636
You should quit too.

123
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:19,456
No,

124
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:21,011
it's true that I can't do

125
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,057
my job very well,

126
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:23,628
always causing trouble for everyone.

127
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,636
It's the opposite.

128
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:26,738
You're good at it.

129
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,433
After I leave, you'll probably be

130
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:31,136
the next project leader.

131
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:32,479
They don't want

132
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:33,658
to bring in outsiders,

133
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:34,854
so they'll probably stick

134
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:35,925
with the current team.

135
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,130
It's a completely

136
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:39,206
absurd story,

137
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:41,222
your workload is too big.

138
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,933
But if Watari also quits...

139
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:45,245
Wait a minute!

140
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:46,940
There's no way I'm

141
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:48,518
the next leader or anything.

142
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:51,706
That may be true if you look at my age,

143
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,058
but my juniors work much faster and are

144
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,603
more talented than me.

145
00:08:57,628 --> 00:09:00,574
You're excellent, you always have been.

146
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:06,449
That's why they took notice of you.

147
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:08,729
Capable people don't

148
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:10,621
want to stay here for long.

149
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,909
Wait, what do you mean?

150
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:13,918
In order to prevent you

151
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:14,658
from going elsewhere,

152
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:15,875
since you just joined, they've

153
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,890
treated you as incompetent,

154
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:17,884
pushed you to the brink,

155
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:19,316
making you think there's nowhere

156
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,666
else for you except here.

157
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:23,128
Brainwashing is what it sounds like.

158
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:24,667
No, no,

159
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:25,964
that's not...

160
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,284
Do you trust the supervisors

161
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,214
more than me?

162
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:31,152
No,

163
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,152
it's not that...

164
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:37,769
Sorry,

165
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:39,675
I couldn't do anything for you.

166
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:41,691
No,

167
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,769
if it weren't for you...

168
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:45,761
Anyway,

169
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,574
think it through.

170
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,823
Before it really goes downhill.

171
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:35,659
Hey!

172
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:37,195
Let's play together!

173
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:38,586
Huh?

174
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:40,222
No, I...

175
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:41,378
Why not?

176
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:43,034
Come on, let's play!

177
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,456
- Please?
- Let's play together!

178
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:45,956
- Yeah.
- Let's play!

179
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:47,613
I understand.

180
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,503
- Yay!
- Yay!

181
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:52,330
I was worried you'd say no!

182
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:53,027
Huh?

183
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:57,292
My mom told me to be nice to you.

184
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:59,167
I'm tired of baseball,

185
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,495
wanna play dodge ball?

186
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,433
- Let's do it!
- Sounds good!

187
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:07,064
Huh?

188
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,955
What's your problem, don't mess around!

189
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,446
I have to catch the last train soon,

190
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:25,721
so I should probably go.

191
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:26,605
Is it late already?

192
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:27,730
Don't push yourself, okay?

193
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,386
I can still go on!

194
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:31,675
Um, Kaneko-san!

195
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:32,128
Huh?

196
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,144
Watari...

197
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:40,027
When did he?

198
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:41,589
Did he really drink that much?

199
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:45,011
No, maybe just one drink.

200
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:46,924
He did seem unwell.

201
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:47,652
Hey.

202
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,597
Watari, you should head home now.

203
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:53,738
Hey!

204
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:55,206
Hey!

205
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,144
Sorry for coming late.

206
00:11:58,604 --> 00:11:59,714
I'll do it right away.

207
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:01,112
He seems to be having

208
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,657
a really bad dream.

209
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:05,284
Hey, does anyone know

210
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,580
this guy's address?

211
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,112
If so, I'll give him a taxi.

212
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,790
Umm, where was it again?

213
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:11,948
Oh no.

214
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:13,556
Oh, Watari's phone.

215
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:14,315
Is this it?

216
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:15,347
Thank you,

217
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:17,167
Watari.

218
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:19,706
Your face, please.

219
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:21,792
Got it.

220
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:23,542
Watari.

221
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,893
Your roommate, what's his name?

222
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:28,149
Watari.

223
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:29,768
Watari Hirokuni.

224
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:32,089
Not you,

225
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,229
the guy you live with!

226
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:36,620
Live with?

227
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:39,472
Oh... Kai.

228
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:41,479
Kai?

229
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:43,300
Ah, it's Kai,

230
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:44,018
Got it.

231
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,268
Good.

232
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:46,917
Here it is.

233
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:49,565
Huh? You're lying. Oh gosh.

234
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:50,784
You're calling him?

235
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:51,417
Oh my!

236
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:52,815
What about the last train?

237
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,042
Hello,

238
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:57,534
is this Kai-san?

239
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:01,003
Umm...

240
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:02,370
Hello.

241
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:03,823
Hello, hello.

242
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:05,183
Did he pick up?

243
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:06,619
He did, but he's just

244
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:07,846
huffing and puffing.

245
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:08,714
Huffing and puffing?

246
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:13,495
Who?

247
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:16,518
Sorry, I'm a colleague of Watari-kun,

248
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:18,097
my name is Kaneko.

249
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:22,510
Well, we were all drinking

250
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,268
with colleagues from work,

251
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:26,175
but Watari ended up completely wasted.

252
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:27,245
So, I'm thinking of

253
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:28,221
calling a taxi for him,

254
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:30,690
but could you tell me your home address?

255
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:33,956
Where are you right now?

256
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:37,511
Oh.

257
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:40,190
Then I'm close, I'll pick him up.

258
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:43,565
Yes.

259
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:46,018
Well, then.

260
00:13:57,408 --> 00:14:00,315
I wonder what kind of person Kai-san is.

261
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,901
Seems like he's an old acquaintance.

262
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,081
Is that so?

263
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,526
An old acquaintance.

264
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:07,231
That's a bit unexpected.

265
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:08,182
Why's that?

266
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:10,025
Well, Watari-san used to give off

267
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,339
this aura of not wanting

268
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:12,901
to be involved with anyone.

269
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,440
I mean, to put it bluntly,

270
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:16,925
he seemed gloomy,

271
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:18,502
it was hard to imagine

272
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:19,643
him having friends.

273
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:21,745
I see.

274
00:14:22,636 --> 00:14:24,050
Don't you guys know?

275
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,492
Know what?

276
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,940
When he first joined the company,

277
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:29,714
he wasn't like that.

278
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:33,089
He used to talk a lot

279
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:34,589
and was cheerful.

280
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,448
Really?

281
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,565
He came up with a lot

282
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,338
of ideas for new projects

283
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:44,042
and was rather proactive,

284
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:48,393
but little by little, he changed.

285
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:51,409
That scared me.

286
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:54,456
Kaneko-san!

287
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,487
I'm here for pickup.

288
00:14:58,636 --> 00:14:59,276
Ah.

289
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:00,979
Kai-san, right?

290
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,643
Sorry for the trouble.

291
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:03,401
No,

292
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:07,557
I'm sorry for the
inconvenience he caused,

293
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,925
my Hirokuni.

294
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,695
No.

295
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:16,128
Alright, let's go,

296
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,847
the taxi's waiting.

297
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:21,979
- Alright, hurry up.
- Here's the stuff.

298
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:25,222
Alright then.

299
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:32,254
Did I do something wrong?

300
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:34,669
Excuse me!

301
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,278
Another bottle of sweet potato shochu!

302
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:45,161
Are you awake?

303
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:47,669
Kai?

304
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,060
Deal with my sweaty mess.

305
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:53,278
Um...

306
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:55,153
You got wasted at the drinking party.

307
00:15:55,794 --> 00:15:56,770
Ah...

308
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,208
But why?

309
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,614
I got a call, so I came to pick you up.

310
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:04,036
I happened to be nearby.

311
00:16:04,942 --> 00:16:06,302
Nearby?

312
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:08,903
You're playing around at night, you!

313
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:10,911
Do you have a weak tolerance?

314
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:12,474
No,

315
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:14,677
it's just tiredness,

316
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:17,106
lack of sleep,

317
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,958
and...

318
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:21,825
And...

319
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,527
Kaneko-san said he was quitting!

320
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:26,716
Keep it down.

321
00:16:26,872 --> 00:16:27,591
But...

322
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,247
Kaneko-san said he was quitting!

323
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:30,989
Be quiet.

324
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,317
But...

325
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,669
Ouch, that hurts.

326
00:16:37,302 --> 00:16:38,442
Dammit.

327
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,278
Is Kaneko

328
00:16:53,981 --> 00:16:54,965
the one with glasses?

329
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,099
I...

330
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,505
without Kaneko-san,

331
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,474
it's impossible.

332
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,802
Then quit.

333
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,185
I can't quit.

334
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:13,888
Why?

335
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:16,825
Kai.

336
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:19,146
I'm sorry.

337
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:21,669
I am

338
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,638
not the same as before.

339
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:27,700
I'm not cool anymore.

340
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,474
You must be disillusioned, right?

341
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:34,138
You probably

342
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:36,372
regret meeting me again.

343
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:38,747
No.

344
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:40,958
You're not different from before.

345
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,021
How?

346
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:45,130
I'm completely different!

347
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:48,692
I can't make any important

348
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:50,317
decisions by myself!

349
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:52,599
Because of that,

350
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,332
I'm just causing trouble

351
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:56,684
to everyone around me!

352
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:01,357
Even though...

353
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,046
When I was a kid,

354
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:06,148
I used to think adults like

355
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:07,343
that were total jerks,

356
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,476
but now

357
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:11,453
I'm just resigning myself

358
00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:13,656
to being like that...

359
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,288
I hate

360
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,156
myself for it.

361
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,132
I didn't want to

362
00:18:30,671 --> 00:18:31,796
be seen like this by you.

363
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:47,054
I

364
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,257
had a bad family environment.

365
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:54,663
A lot of guys cared about me.

366
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:56,968
But

367
00:18:58,601 --> 00:18:59,929
it was suffocating.

368
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:06,429
I felt like

369
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:09,601
I was being pitied.

370
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:13,390
So...

371
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:17,703
when Hiro first talked to me,

372
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:19,976
I thought, 'Here we go again...'

373
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:22,093
Hey.

374
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:24,616
You're always alone,

375
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:26,574
don't you have any friends?

376
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:32,427
How about being my conversation partner?

377
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:35,388
You know, when you're in 8th grade,

378
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:37,137
there are many things happening...

379
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:38,669
Talk to your friends.

380
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:40,224
You don't understand,

381
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:42,091
sometimes you can't talk to your friends

382
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,739
or family about certain things.

383
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,130
Come on, you're the only one I've got.

384
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:01,763
So, you started coming

385
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,468
to the park regularly.

386
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:05,731
I thought, 'this guy must

387
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:06,778
be really bored,

388
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,052
I was cautious,

389
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,388
but it made me happy.

390
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,035
It was the first time

391
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:23,622
I felt needed by someone,

392
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:27,279
the first time I could trust someone.

393
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:31,638
That's why

394
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,122
Hiro is cool.

395
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:39,357
Idiot.

396
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:40,880
Don't make a big deal out of it.

397
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:42,068
Even so,

398
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:44,474
it helped.

399
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,411
But

400
00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:49,161
that's in the past.

401
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,177
The current me

402
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,185
can't help you at all.

403
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,583
You asked me

404
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:01,950
to make dinner, didn't you?

405
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:04,661
Dinner,

406
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:09,161
from now on, can you make it?

407
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:11,317
You can stay until that

408
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:13,005
person gets out of the hospital.

409
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,317
You haven't changed at all

410
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:32,856
since back then.

411
00:21:48,777 --> 00:21:50,293
What an awful face.

412
00:21:58,511 --> 00:21:59,667
Take a bath and go to sleep.

413
00:22:00,323 --> 00:22:02,112
I'll bring you a change of clothes.

414
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:05,440
Kai.

415
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,393
Thank you.

416
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,768
Yeah.

417
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:23,886
What is it? Dammit.

418
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm the one

419
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,401
being helped.

420
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:05,479
Good morning.

421
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:07,011
Good morning.

422
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:24,753
What's this?

423
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,706
It's called hydroponic farming.

424
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:32,784
What can you make with it?

425
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:35,886
Food that can fix your awful face.

426
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:39,619
It takes about a month for it to grow.

427
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:42,948
A month...

428
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:45,597
I see.

429
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,120
Breakfast will be ready soon.

430
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:54,847
Wash your face.

431
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:56,479
Yeah.

432
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:08,245
(Next episode)

433
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:08,869
I don't want it.

434
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:10,815
Please hurry and return.

435
00:24:11,057 --> 00:24:12,612
Please focus.

436
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:13,956
You're a leader.

437
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,370
Why do I have to be the leader?

438
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:17,456
You feel like returning?

439
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:20,112
Please return.

440
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:23,042
I want to hear his voice more than this.

441
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:24,300
No.

442
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:26,495
I'll complete it.

443
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,073
Definitely.

444
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:29,789
After being with you like this.

445
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:32,276
I thought when we were young.

446
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,016
You were quite cute.
