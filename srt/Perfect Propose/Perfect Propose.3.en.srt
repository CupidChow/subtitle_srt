1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,630
I know everything about Hirokuni.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,290
Prefer meatballs over hamburgers,

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,360
likes sweet omelets,

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,097
can eat unlimited rice

5
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:12,394
with just pickled plum,

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,160
It feels like

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,650
I've never been stressed around him.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,410
A relaxed relationship?

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,740
You know, festival yakisoba and stuff,

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,040
they're delicious.

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,210
I don't know.

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,550
I've never tried it.

13
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,020
Huh? You haven't?

14
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:34,090
Well, I've never been to a festival.

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,100
How about this?

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,990
Let's go together?

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,100
To the festival.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,320
I'm done.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,544
No time to go back home today,

20
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:44,671
meet you at the venue!

21
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,510
You got some free time, right?

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,080
Oh, no, it's not that I'm free...

23
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,486
Make a design document

24
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:51,446
for the revised part.

25
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,991
We'll need it by tomorrow, it's urgent.

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,420
Sorry.

27
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,550
I'll be about two hours late.

28
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,820
(Yakisoba, shaved ice
Chocolate covered bananas)

29
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:31,990
Welcome back.

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,910
Kai, you see...

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,400
That is...

32
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,750
I bought it.

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,110
It was the last one. Lucky, right?

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,190
Did you go alone?

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,470
Since it seemed you couldn't make it.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,670
Then...

37
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,603
Why? You like festival yakisoba,

38
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:09,627
don't you?

39
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,160
Well, but...

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,720
I thought festivals would be livelier,

41
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,120
but it felt surprisingly subdued.

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,180
Maybe because we went near closing time?

43
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,750
Sorry.

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,750
I invited you, but I broke the promise.

45
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,090
Oh, it's fine.

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,498
But you said you were

47
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:40,787
looking forward to it.

48
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,040
Well, I didn't really mean it.

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,280
What?

50
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,420
But I was looking forward to it.

51
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:52,940
I see.

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,880
Exactly.

53
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,710
I was bummed out.

54
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,640
Well, I didn't really mean it.

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,570
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,900
Why are you apologizing?

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,040
Normally, you'd be mad, right?

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,750
Why?

59
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,430
Why? You should be a little angry.

60
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,690
For a broken promise.

61
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,710
But it couldn't be helped, right?

62
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,180
It wasn't intentional.

63
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,050
Yeah, you're right.

64
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,467
But I could have asked someone

65
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,084
to take over for me,

66
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,940
but I put off our promise for later.

67
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,040
That's normal, isn't it?

68
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,540
Want to heat it?

69
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,970
No need.

70
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,240
Is it words or emotions?

71
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't know whatever it is,

72
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,640
but something just didn't click.

73
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,440
"Perfect Propose"

74
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,460
"Episode 3"

75
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,230
You see...

76
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,380
What is it?

77
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,060
Ah, I'm sorry.

78
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,810
- I need you to confirm something.
- Alright, let me take a look.

79
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,340
Been a while since we've

80
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:24,441
seen that side of him.

81
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,660
Yeah, it's like he's putting up a wall.

82
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,752
That used to be normal for

83
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:33,955
Watari-san, right?

84
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,315
But in the past month,

85
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,807
he's become a bit easier to talk to.

86
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,120
I wonder if something happened.

87
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,930
Oh my, Kai-kun?

88
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,070
Oh, hello there.

89
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,300
It's been a while, hasn't it?

90
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,227
I heard about Kenji-san,

91
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:08,711
he's been hospitalized, right?

92
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,090
Oh, is he discharged?

93
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,700
Oh, no,

94
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:14,445
I just came to pick up some things.

95
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,410
Oh, I see...

96
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,522
When this place is closed,

97
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:19,827
it feels lonely.

98
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,270
How are you doing these days, Kai-kun?

99
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,140
I'm staying with an acquaintance.

100
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,720
That's good. I was worried

101
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,210
when you suddenly disappeared.

102
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,130
Did Kenji-san kick you out?

103
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,570
Can't you just leave the house?

104
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,790
Probably not.

105
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,930
Kai-kun is just like a son, after all.

106
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,680
Wear this.

107
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,160
Can you make anything?

108
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,860
No.

109
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,730
Cook my meals.

110
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,250
Not for yourself.

111
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,290
But for someone else's sake.

112
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,000
For someone else's.

113
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,300
Does it taste bad?

114
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,330
Huh?

115
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,530
Oh, no, it's delicious.

116
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,950
Really.

117
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,878
It's nice, huh?

118
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:11,214
My wife used to make it for me too.

119
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,340
- Oh, your wife.
- Yeah.

120
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,664
But when she was busy with work,

121
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:17,477
I used to complain.

122
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,780
Like, I wanted more greens

123
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,336
or I didn't want the stew juice

124
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:22,368
on the rice.

125
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,540
Oh.

126
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,649
She got really mad and told me

127
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:27,469
she won't make a lunchbox anymore.

128
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,110
Did you get to say thank you?

129
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,630
Well, once.

130
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,310
Unconditional love is an illusion.

131
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,861
If someone does something for you,

132
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:40,576
you should do something in return.

133
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,490
Husband and wife...

134
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,540
No, not just husband and wife.

135
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,440
But all relationships between people.

136
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,180
Now that you mention it...

137
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,420
I haven't given back anything.

138
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,590
But you let him stay at your place.

139
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,770
Well, yes, but...

140
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,745
Maybe being friends is

141
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,917
different from being spouses.

142
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,510
Oh no, I've said too much.

143
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,660
That's not much, is it?

144
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,490
Excuse me.

145
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,221
Aren't we supposed to

146
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:09,245
leave at normal hours?

147
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,292
I can go!

148
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:12,823
I can finally get my nails done!

149
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,359
Oh, I'm gonna cry!

150
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,100
Watari.

151
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,520
Yes?

152
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,240
We've added some UI features,

153
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:23,792
can you make sure they're ready

154
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:24,924
for testing by tomorrow?"

155
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:26,469
- Understood.
- Yeah.

156
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,790
Why aren't you angry?

157
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,407
I mean, not that you should

158
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:41,736
get mad at the supervisor,

159
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,134
but don't you feel annoyed,

160
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,557
frustrated, anything?

161
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,840
Cut it out.

162
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,030
Yeah, actually it's frustration.

163
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,040
Maybe...

164
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,210
it's inevitable.

165
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,000
My work being slow is a fact,

166
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,161
so from the start,

167
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,998
expecting to leave on time...

168
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,030
is just a wish.

169
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,720
I don't really feel lonely.

170
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,470
Well, I'm

171
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,200
an outsider,

172
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,660
so it can't be helped.

173
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,730
Normally, you'd be mad, right?

174
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,530
For a broken promise.

175
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:31,055
But it couldn't be helped, right?

176
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,265
It wasn't intentional.

177
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,960
I think I understand now.

178
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,910
Why Kai doesn't get angry.

179
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,333
The reason why the relationship

180
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:47,038
with Kai feels easygoing.

181
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,620
- You went to the shop?
- Hmm?

182
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,860
Oh.

183
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,040
Well, that boy, Fukaya, right?

184
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,120
He wanted to come pick up

185
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:25,237
his stuff at the store.

186
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,030
I see.

187
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,359
Just so you know,

188
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:32,165
I've turned down his request to visit.

189
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,370
So you can focus on your treatment.

190
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:36,710
Do as you like.

191
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,890
When I asked him to leave the store,

192
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,890
his reaction was as indifferent

193
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,160
as when I told him not to visit.

194
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,240
He probably doesn't expect much.

195
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,170
You've given up on everything.

196
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,560
That's how you've been living, right?

197
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,030
I'm home...

198
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,900
Oh, sorry.

199
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,340
- When did you get back?
- Just now.

200
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,630
I see.

201
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,920
- I'll prepare dinner.
- Yeah.

202
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,330
Hey.

203
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,150
Hmm?

204
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,830
Please, let me make it up to you.

205
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,610
Make it up?

206
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,010
I feel bad about missing the festival.

207
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,010
Oh, it's fine.

208
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,160
Please.

209
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,080
I really feel guilty.

210
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,180
I bought this earlier.

211
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,843
It has information

212
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:51,265
about summer festivals,

213
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,510
fireworks displays,

214
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,690
yakisoba street food style.

215
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,028
It tastes better when you

216
00:17:59,053 --> 00:18:00,465
eat it outside with someone else.

217
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,390
Then...

218
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,960
Oh, well, where should we go?

219
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,760
Sleep with me.

220
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,210
Huh?

221
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,620
Hey,

222
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,541
about making it up, I thought we

223
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:27,676
could go to a different festival

224
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,790
or something, you know.

225
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,985
Does Hirokuni want to

226
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:31,282
go on a date with me?

227
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,950
Well, when you put it that way.

228
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:36,900
Then, it's settled.

229
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,760
This way, you won't need

230
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:39,932
to rush your work.

231
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,090
Well, but...

232
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,040
What?

233
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,750
Hiro, you've gotten smaller.

234
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,490
No, it's just that you've gotten bigger.

235
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,280
Really?

236
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,640
- Hey, let go.
- No.

237
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,020
You're sweating.

238
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,500
Well, it's hot.

239
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,030
Your heartbeat is racing.

240
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,990
Well, that's...

241
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,910
Do you feel something with me?

242
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,590
Be conscious of it.

243
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,080
Hiro.

244
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,320
I like you.

245
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,950
What are you saying?

246
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:06,390
Stop it, that's not funny.

247
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,030
Who said it was a joke?

248
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,110
But...

249
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,201
You're the one who wants

250
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:15,545
to treat it like a joke.

251
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,123
Because you find it

252
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:21,475
inconvenient to face me.

253
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,380
It's not like that.

254
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,710
Well, Hirokuni, you're straight.

255
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,200
I will not cross the boundary.

256
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,513
But when you're kind to me

257
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:33,841
like you were just now...

258
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,970
I'll start getting carried away.

259
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,839
Don't make it so obvious

260
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:51,019
that you're flustered.

261
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,400
No, it's not...

262
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,910
Sorry for scaring you.

263
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,260
You...

264
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,810
I have to wake up early tomorrow.

265
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,450
Goodnight.

266
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,580
By creating an escape route like this,

267
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,542
that's why I want to keep on

268
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:21,607
spoiling him.

269
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,350
But...

270
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,570
(Summer Fireworks Festival
Special Information)

271
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,110
Done.

272
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,460
An apron.

273
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:11,930
Aren't you wearing it?

274
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,500
You're up early.

275
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,800
I need to talk to you for a bit.

276
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,870
What you said to me yesterday,

277
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,290
it's true that I

278
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,650
want it to be a joke.

279
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,495
I cannot think of you as

280
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,653
a love interest all of a sudden.

281
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,870
Even now...

282
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,010
I don't know how to interact

283
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:01,475
with you properly.

284
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,250
But...

285
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,880
I need time.

286
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,410
Time to properly face you

287
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,720
and then give you an answer...

288
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,190
even though it sounds selfish.

289
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,310
It doesn't matter.

290
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:32,137
What? I was thinking about it seriously.

291
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,300
It's useless to think about it.

292
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,640
Because, in the end,

293
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,410
you're going to be mine.

294
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,010
Huh?

295
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm off.

296
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
You've gone overboard, brat!

297
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,440
(Next episode)
Come find faster then.

298
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,974
Searching for me when

299
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,679
I'm this grown is okay?

300
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,716
In fact, I thought I won't be

301
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:27,841
meeting Hiro again.

302
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,350
Watari-san only drank that much.

303
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,900
Kaneko-san.

304
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,710
Oh, seems like he's causing trouble.

305
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,790
Hirokuni is mine.

306
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:39,710
You're going out at night?

307
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,840
Kai, I'm sorry.

308
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,760
Currently, I

309
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,870
can't help you out at all.
