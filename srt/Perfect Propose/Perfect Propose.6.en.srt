1
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:09,336
What?

2
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:11,680
I think that was kind of cute.

3
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:23,531
What are you...

4
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:39,421
What are you doing?

5
00:00:40,313 --> 00:00:41,414
You seduced me.

6
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:44,148
- I did not.
- But

7
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,305
you didn't resist, did you?

8
00:00:49,156 --> 00:00:51,148
Where do you get the confidence from?

9
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:02,547
Hirokuni,

10
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,914
have you found your answer yet?

11
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:08,195
No,

12
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:09,828
not yet.

13
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:11,656
Sorry.

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,172
I...

15
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:18,211
might not be able to wait much longer.

16
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:23,750
The old man is going to be discharged.

17
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,648
We agreed it would be until then, right?

18
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:28,780
That I'd stay at your place.

19
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:37,984
I'll leave by next Sunday.

20
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,804
Are you going back to

21
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,898
the old man's place?

22
00:01:44,148 --> 00:01:45,977
The old man's going to his son's place,

23
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,106
and he's closing the shop.

24
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:51,297
Huh, so what are you gonna do?

25
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,805
What do you want me to do?

26
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:03,562
Don't ask me.

27
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:10,984
Right.

28
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:14,219
Well,

29
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:15,914
I'll figure something out.

30
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,500
I've saved up some money from work,

31
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:20,492
and I'll find a place to stay.

32
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:23,664
Let's go home.

33
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,492
I'll make breakfast.

34
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:53,867
"Perfect Propose"

35
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:03,187
"Episode 6"

36
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,720
(Error)

37
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,250
Ah.

38
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,690
(Release date)

39
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:30,242
Watari-san.

40
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:32,258
Watari-san.

41
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:36,391
The meeting is starting now.

42
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:37,555
Ah, yes,

43
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:38,508
I'll be right there.

44
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,440
Umm, can I really?

45
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:04,039
I heard from my father the other day,

46
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:06,766
you

47
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:09,967
don't have any family, right?

48
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,578
That's when it finally made sense to me.

49
00:05:17,773 --> 00:05:19,530
My father was planning to

50
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:21,140
close the shop six years ago.

51
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:23,546
My mother passed away,

52
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:24,820
and he was really down.

53
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:26,461
At his age,

54
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,695
it was too much to run the place alone.

55
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:32,390
It was also decided that

56
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,687
he would live with me.

57
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,781
I also renovated my home and

58
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:38,563
made preparations to welcome him.

59
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:42,234
But when it came time to move,

60
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,000
he suddenly said he wanted to

61
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:45,422
continue running the shop.

62
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:00,218
He said he found someone promising

63
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:01,750
and wanted to nurture them.

64
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:07,687
My father is not very verbal in any way.

65
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,156
Back then, he wouldn't explain anything,

66
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,835
he just kept saying

67
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:14,132
'I've already decided,'

68
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:15,554
He wouldn't listen to

69
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:16,804
anything I had to say.

70
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,758
I got angry,

71
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:24,391
we became estranged from each other.

72
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:27,180
But

73
00:06:28,297 --> 00:06:29,398
it seems like you had

74
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:30,562
similar circumstances.

75
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:34,586
I apologize for my immature behavior.

76
00:06:35,422 --> 00:06:36,320
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,850
I'm leaving the hospital tomorrow.

78
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:49,461
It's in the way.

79
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,867
I figured you'd say that.

80
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,648
Trying to annoy me?

81
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:55,882
It's a thank you for

82
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:56,867
everything you've done,

83
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:57,781
sort of.

84
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:04,469
I don't remember being thanked.

85
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:12,718
Hey.

86
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:14,672
Hmm?

87
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:20,031
Nothing.

88
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:23,617
Well then.

89
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:25,352
Yeah.

90
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:45,727
(Release date)

91
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:51,688
Alright then.

92
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,905
(Release this version, Yes, No)

93
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:56,015
(Uploading)

94
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,523
(Distribution complete)

95
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:00,429
What a relief.

96
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,578
That's great.

97
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:02,882
I feel like crying.

98
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:04,289
Good job.

99
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:05,969
Watari-san, thank you.

100
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,523
Yes, you've covered for

101
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:09,467
Sakamoto-kun as well.

102
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:11,523
You're a god of software engineering!

103
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:13,125
Thank you.

104
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,453
You guys.

105
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,023
We've got new projects coming in

106
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:18,501
next week, so don't slack off.

107
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:20,539
Watari, you've got a meeting tomorrow.

108
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:21,992
Yes.

109
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,820
But hey, tomorrow's Sunday.

110
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:28,914
He says it like it's nothing.

111
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:31,015
Alright,

112
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:33,624
how about we go for drinks tonight?

113
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:35,695
- Sounds good!
- Let's drink!

114
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:38,711
What about you, Watari-san?

115
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:40,281
I have something I want to do,

116
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:42,381
so I'll stay a bit longer at the office.

117
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:45,148
You really love your work, don't you?

118
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,500
It's not exactly like that.

119
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,328
With Kaneko-san gone

120
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:52,265
and Sakamoto-kun not coming anymore,

121
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,054
I thought it would be impossible,

122
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,070
but somehow we manage anyway.

123
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,406
Yeah.

124
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,844
But

125
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,187
this time,

126
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:02,780
it's all thanks to Watari-san.

127
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:04,203
Definitely.

128
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:07,734
If Watari-san had disappeared too...

129
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,000
That's not true, really.

130
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:12,555
Always so modest.

131
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,539
Alright! Shall we go then?

132
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,242
- Yes.
- Let's go.

133
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:20,430
Sure.

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,875
Probably,

135
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:30,781
we'll manage somehow,

136
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:32,726
no matter who's gone...

137
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:43,227
Even if Kai is gone...

138
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,750
I'll wake up in the morning...

139
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:48,508
eat...

140
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:51,125
go to work...

141
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:58,422
and come home and sleep...

142
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:00,883
That's all...

143
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:07,828
That's all.

144
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:33,625
No,

145
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:36,266
it's not just that.

146
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,953
I'll definitely try

147
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,219
to find Kai.

148
00:10:46,023 --> 00:10:47,391
Every time I wake up...

149
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,594
Good morning.

150
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:54,148
Every time I eat...

151
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,977
Is it to your liking?

152
00:10:56,226 --> 00:10:56,976
Yeah.

153
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,414
It's ridiculously delicious.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,570
Every time I look up at my room...

155
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:13,266
"Welcome back"

156
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:22,984
Every time I open the door.

157
00:11:31,602 --> 00:11:33,156
You look terrible.

158
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:38,219
Take a bath and go to sleep.

159
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,281
I'll bring you a change of clothes.

160
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:43,852
Kai,

161
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,711
thank you.

162
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:53,164
Mhmm.

163
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:58,945
I... To him...

164
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:07,388
Welcome back.

165
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:09,693
You're early.

166
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,099
Ah, today, with the release...

167
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:18,373
Are you going somewhere?

168
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:22,255
I'm leaving today.

169
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:24,779
Huh?

170
00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:27,802
But he' getting discharged tomorrow.

171
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,662
Why the rush?

172
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,818
They said I can go back to the shop

173
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,271
until I find a place.

174
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,185
But...

175
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,419
There's no reason for me to be in

176
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:39,974
Hirokuni's care anymore.

177
00:12:44,294 --> 00:12:45,201
Well then.

178
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,130
Stay here.

179
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,654
I want you to stay here.

180
00:12:58,373 --> 00:12:59,763
I've made you wait for a long time

181
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,083
and I'm being brazen,

182
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,826
- but I intend to tell you this today...
- It's impossible.

183
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:11,771
I knew it.

184
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:14,802
You've really run out of patience.

185
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:19,162
That's not it.

186
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:26,638
I...

187
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:29,794
six years ago,

188
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,552
I tried to dine and dash

189
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:33,755
at the old man's shop,

190
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,396
and that's how I ended up working there.

191
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,623
But I think...

192
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:46,044
If I hadn't gone

193
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,873
to the shop back then,

194
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:51,911
he would have quit the shop

195
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:54,076
and lived with his son.

196
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:56,904
Then,

197
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,731
he probably would have found out

198
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,036
about his illness sooner.

199
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:03,084
No.

200
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:07,490
Accepting you was his decision,

201
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:11,419
- and it's not your responsibility...
- But it's still not unrelated.

202
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:19,458
I'm horrified.

203
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,669
What if the old man didn't recover?

204
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:28,809
And hadn't regained consciousness

205
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:29,786
after collapsing.

206
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:36,584
I

207
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:39,513
had nothing.

208
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:44,685
I thought whether I was alive or dead,

209
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,912
nothing around me would change.

210
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:57,677
But being here,

211
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,973
I realize that I can influence

212
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,036
someone else's life.

213
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:10,748
Hirokuni,

214
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,560
being involved with people is heavy.

215
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,974
I shouldn't

216
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:33,716
have come to see you either.

217
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,310
I'm sorry for being selfish.

218
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:45,701
Wait.

219
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:51,966
Thank you for everything.

220
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,693
Indeed, being involved

221
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,568
with people is heavy.

222
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:22,880
Hey.

223
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:27,834
But...

224
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:33,521
Are you dead?

225
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:03,685
Isn't that obvious!

226
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:07,794
Being involved with people is heavy!

227
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:09,255
It's scary!

228
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:10,732
But

229
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:13,974
isn't that what you wanted?

230
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:22,560
That's why you came to me, right?

231
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:26,107
But...

232
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,505
- But because of me...
- Yeah,

233
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:30,232
it's because of you.

234
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:33,732
I just

235
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:36,294
submitted my resignation letter.

236
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,430
(Resignation letter)

237
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,412
(Resignation letter)
If I keep on going like this,

238
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,410
(Resignation letter)
I don't think I can give you an answer.

239
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,997
It's too late to

240
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:48,778
cut ties now.

241
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:52,661
You've already been shaping my life,

242
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:55,294
so take responsibility properly.

243
00:17:56,895 --> 00:17:57,747
How?

244
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:02,637
Come back to me.

245
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:09,856
That's...

246
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,270
Oh come on!

247
00:18:11,497 --> 00:18:13,473
Why don't you understand?

248
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,544
No matter what you do to my life,

249
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:17,567
it's fine!

250
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:19,919
I told you my life is like

251
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:21,653
a waste of time anyway!

252
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,286
I'll give you

253
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:27,614
my remaining years!

254
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:40,802
Dammit!

255
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:56,312
It feels like a proposal, doesn't it?

256
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:01,544
It is a proposal.

257
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:12,966
Hiro.

258
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,692
Stop calling me that now.

259
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,137
It reminds me of when we were kids.

260
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:21,364
I'm not a kid anymore.

261
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,716
Of course I know that.

262
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:23,544
Hiro.

263
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:35,809
Dammit.

264
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:37,238
I want you.

265
00:19:40,153 --> 00:19:41,036
Me too.

266
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,180
Hey! Wait, wait!

267
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:52,426
Leg cramped.

268
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,528
It can't be helped.

269
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:58,231
I don't exercise much.

270
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,309
- Oww.
- Dammit.

271
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:27,691
(Chief Sato)

272
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:33,895
Hirokuni.

273
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:35,348
A call.

274
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:36,314
Hmm?

275
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:48,080
Work?

276
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:50,080
Is it okay?

277
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:54,884
Just because you submitted

278
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:56,001
your resignation letter

279
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,228
doesn't mean you can quit

280
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:58,330
right away, right?

281
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:04,377
Nah, it's fine.

282
00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:07,455
Because

283
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,205
today's Sunday.

284
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:37,986
Oh!

285
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:38,853
Oh!

286
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:40,760
Isn't that Kaneko-san?

287
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,244
- Long time no see!
- Long time no see!

288
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,158
Are you here with your family?

289
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:46,588
- Or...
- I'm here with my family.

290
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,658
Alright.

291
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,330
Hey, can you give me a hand...

292
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:52,502
Oh, Kaneko-san!

293
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:57,666
But it's quite a coincidence, isn't it?

294
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,986
Watari-san is around here somewhere too?

295
00:22:00,283 --> 00:22:03,025
He said he has something to do today.

296
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,103
Is that so?

297
00:22:17,197 --> 00:22:18,111
Alright.

298
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,166
At this point,

299
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:29,108
I've grown attached to them,

300
00:22:29,275 --> 00:22:31,314
almost like family.

301
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,783
You're exaggerating.

302
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:41,408
Harsh.

303
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,259
Letting them wither without

304
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:44,486
eating them is harsher.

305
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:47,439
For dinner?

306
00:22:48,627 --> 00:22:49,439
Yes.

307
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:51,111
Looking forward to it.

308
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:05,361
It's Kaneko-san.

309
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:08,541
Everyone...

310
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,182
Wait! Hey!

311
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:14,682
Right now,

312
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:16,425
we're doing something important.

313
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,908
I'm just going to reply...

314
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:20,603
It's always Kaneko, Kaneko.

315
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:23,689
Well, he was my boss, so...

316
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:25,385
What?

317
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,283
Hirokuni is already mine now.

318
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,213
I know.

319
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:34,142
I'll reply later.

320
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,478
You're easy to trick.

321
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,642
Wait...

322
00:23:45,244 --> 00:23:46,908
I give up, I give up!

323
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,110
Ah!

324
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:51,799
Can you calm down first?

325
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,900
Please?

326
00:23:58,984 --> 00:23:59,820
Look.
