1
00:00:15,523 --> 00:00:17,414
I can't catch up with the situation.

2
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,055
Was he

3
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,765
always like this?

4
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,531
But, these eyes,

5
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:41,867
since the old days, these eyes...

6
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:47,375
Who gave you permission

7
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:49,305
to look so worn out,

8
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,492
Hiro?

9
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:13,539
"Perfect Propose"

10
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:20,242
"Episode 1"

11
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,688
What a relief.

12
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:29,055
It's not

13
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,117
tomorrow yet.

14
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:38,398
When I go home,

15
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:40,125
take a bath...

16
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:42,445
I wonder how many hours I can sleep.

17
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:44,430
Ah.

18
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:45,750
But...

19
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,268
I have to do

20
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:48,956
the secret release tomorrow...

21
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,461
wait, tomorrow

22
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,219
is Sunday, huh...

23
00:02:58,398 --> 00:02:59,672
I've been living like this

24
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:01,554
for five years already.

25
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:06,781
Beautiful.

26
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:15,445
I'll continue living this way.

27
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:22,133
Are you dead?

28
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,516
What, you're alive.

29
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:30,946
Oh, sorry,

30
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,470
I was just so sleepy,

31
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:34,454
and before I knew it...

32
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,649
But it's okay,

33
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:38,009
don't worry about it.

34
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:39,712
Really sorry,

35
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:42,954
Well, then, excuse me.

36
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:45,001
How mean,

37
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,719
did you forget about me?

38
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:53,360
We promised each other to get married.

39
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:57,345
It's Kai,

40
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,306
Fukaya Kai.

41
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:03,462
Kai?

42
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:05,235
Do you remember?

43
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:07,454
Hiro.

44
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:10,438
In the future,

45
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:12,517
I'll marry Hiro.

46
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:16,587
That Kai?

47
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:21,368
It's been about 10 years, right?

48
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:23,626
No, maybe even more.

49
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,368
You've grown a lot,

50
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:28,868
I didn't notice at all.

51
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:30,789
You haven't changed,

52
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:31,977
I noticed right away.

53
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,360
I see.

54
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:39,337
But...

55
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:43,829
You lost weight, huh?

56
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:50,586
So, what were you doing there?

57
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,485
Any business there?

58
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:52,626
No,

59
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,282
I asked Hirokuni's mother

60
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,730
for your address.

61
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:56,579
Huh,

62
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,102
you came to see me?

63
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:00,774
Well...

64
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:03,977
Can I stay here for a while?

65
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,329
Huh?

66
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,032
I suddenly had nowhere to go,

67
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:08,665
I don't know where else to go.

68
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:11,743
Wait, no place to live?

69
00:05:12,915 --> 00:05:13,837
What about your family?

70
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,024
No longer there.

71
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:17,477
No,

72
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,735
but

73
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:21,235
- that's so sudden...
- It's fine, right?

74
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:23,157
We're engaged.

75
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:25,477
That's just a kid's joke,

76
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,259
and besides, we're both guys.

77
00:05:27,587 --> 00:05:28,500
I'm gay.

78
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,282
It's okay, then...

79
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:38,719
No, it's even worse!

80
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,782
Come on,

81
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:42,962
I'm not going to eat you or anything.

82
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:44,868
Well,

83
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:46,493
One step at a time.

84
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:48,240
One step at a time?

85
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:51,063
What one step at a time?

86
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:55,337
Ah...

87
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:03,524
Anyway,

88
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,181
this is too sudden,

89
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:06,626
and living together is...

90
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:13,399
You can sleep over there.

91
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:16,556
The bed is big.

92
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:19,142
You can stay for tonight, but...

93
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:20,345
Do you have a girlfriend?

94
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:25,586
When I bought...

95
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:28,235
Poor thing,

96
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,243
want to sleep together?

97
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:33,040
I have work tomorrow,

98
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:35,438
and I want to sleep as much as possible.

99
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:37,485
Please don't disturb me.

100
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,813
Just kidding,

101
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,785
I'm tired too.

102
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,355
Hey.

103
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:54,339
Yeah?

104
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,417
Thanks.

105
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:00,785
Yeah.

106
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:16,493
Dammit...

107
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,868
Couldn't sleep a wink again.

108
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:07,251
You wake up early.

109
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:09,626
I have work to do.

110
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:29,685
Take care.

111
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,391
Take care.

112
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:57,477
Another all-nighter?

113
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,844
Sorry.

114
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,102
I keep telling you,

115
00:10:00,242 --> 00:10:02,289
if it's tough, you can let me help...

116
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,649
No,

117
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:05,774
it's not about work.

118
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,297
Friend suddenly showed up

119
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:08,422
and stayed over.

120
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:09,344
Huh?

121
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:11,094
No, not like that.

122
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:12,882
He's a guy...

123
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,500
Huh?

124
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:18,656
What?

125
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,274
No, it's nothing.

126
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,758
He had nowhere to go all of a sudden.

127
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:24,656
I don't get him.

128
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:26,377
If it's bothering you,

129
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,916
just tell him it's inconvenient.

130
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:30,461
You're right.

131
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:31,867
Watari.

132
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:38,117
Yes.

133
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:40,203
That thing you're working on,

134
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:41,945
we've switched to the GVG model.

135
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,234
Finish it today.

136
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:45,524
Umm...

137
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:47,320
Today...

138
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,953
might be impossible...

139
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:50,031
Huh?

140
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:51,633
Ah, it's nothing.

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,563
Watari, how long have you been with us?

142
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,211
For 5 years.

143
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:58,399
Right.

144
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:01,625
I thought you could handle this much.

145
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,132
What do you want then?

146
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,297
Even if we get more help,

147
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:12,414
others have more workload than you.

148
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:22,078
Hey, Sakamoto.

149
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:23,461
Yes.

150
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:27,984
Umm...

151
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,641
Sorry...

152
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,125
I'll handle it.

153
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:33,008
Is that so?

154
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:53,383
I need to find something to eat.

155
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,649
(Energizing lunch box)

156
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:15,867
Welcome back.

157
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:18,211
Do you always return this late?

158
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:21,078
I forgot...

159
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:23,062
A black corporation, huh?

160
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:24,391
Hirokuni's company.

161
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:25,746
Seriously, how long

162
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:27,146
are you planning to stay?

163
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:28,984
It's only been a day.

164
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:30,805
What's that?

165
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:32,524
Dinner.

166
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:49,734
I made it.

167
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:51,295
Guess you don't want it

168
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,469
since you already bought it.

169
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:03,625
Mmm!

170
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,758
I never knew you had such a skill.

171
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:10,797
It's normal, isn't it?

172
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:12,429
It's amazing.

173
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:14,139
I can't cook anything like this.

174
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:14,946
That's what I thought,

175
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,836
you only had soy sauce for seasoning.

176
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:20,054
Ah.

177
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:21,414
Right.

178
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:23,477
I bought some extras.

179
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:24,805
Huh?

180
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:26,383
You went shopping?

181
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:27,899
What about the keys?

182
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,602
Left it open.

183
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:31,625
Didn't seem like anything

184
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,813
valuable was inside.

185
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,811
Well, yeah, but...

186
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,195
Anyway,

187
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:41,024
does it suit your taste?

188
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,047
It's good.

189
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:45,633
It's really delicious.

190
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:48,000
I haven't thought a meal

191
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:48,992
could be this tasty

192
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:50,594
in a long time.

193
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:52,094
Is that so?

194
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:53,648
I usually

195
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,234
eat instant stuff,

196
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:56,500
convenience store meals...

197
00:13:58,063 --> 00:13:58,969
That kind of thing.

198
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:01,360
(Install Energy)

199
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,540
They're convenient and nutritious,

200
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:04,274
and should be tasty,

201
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:06,304
but eating them every day,

202
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:08,984
everything starts tasting the same...

203
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,617
Is that so?

204
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,828
You're always eating that.

205
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:26,304
Well, it's the only thing at home.

206
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:27,851
Why don't your parents

207
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:28,968
make something for you?

208
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:31,304
Mom's not around,

209
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,539
and Dad only comes home occasionally.

210
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:34,687
Seriously?

211
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:38,898
It's not lonely or anything.

212
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,836
No, I didn't say anything.

213
00:14:43,976 --> 00:14:44,882
Is it good?

214
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:46,929
Same as always.

215
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,429
What have you been up to since then?

216
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:57,273
You moved suddenly, right?

217
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,257
When we were kids.

218
00:14:58,718 --> 00:14:59,406
Oh,

219
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,772
that was because of

220
00:15:00,796 --> 00:15:01,921
my dad's job transfer.

221
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:03,554
I see...

222
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:05,171
But

223
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,046
when I was in middle school,

224
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:08,773
my dad got laid off,

225
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:10,351
turned into a drunk,

226
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:12,171
disappeared suddenly,

227
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:13,273
and we lost contact.

228
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:16,554
I see.

229
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:20,359
So right after middle school,

230
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:21,843
I started working at a diner,

231
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:22,988
living there.

232
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:25,023
Oh, that's why...

233
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:27,296
But yesterday,

234
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,193
the owner suddenly...

235
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:34,773
Old man!

236
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:37,679
Old man!

237
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:39,304
Hey!

238
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:43,140
So, he stayed in the hospital.

239
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:45,906
Wait, does that mean

240
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,655
you have no place to stay?

241
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,585
Well, I can't just stay there

242
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:50,679
without the owner.

243
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,093
And about that old man...

244
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,437
Is he alright?

245
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,867
No idea.

246
00:15:57,211 --> 00:15:59,031
I just brought him to the hospital,

247
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:01,273
his son is handling everything.

248
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:06,147
I see.

249
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,132
Dinner.

250
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:16,726
Keep cooking for me.

251
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,100
Until that guy gets out of the hospital,

252
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,620
you can stay at my place.

253
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:22,656
It would

254
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,875
help me out a lot.

255
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:31,421
You haven't changed at all,

256
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:33,059
Hiro.

257
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:34,914
Huh?

258
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,507
What do you mean?

259
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:38,578
Want seconds?

260
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:42,078
Sure.

261
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:01,132
Still awake?

262
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:03,359
Yeah, sorry,

263
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:04,507
did I wake you?

264
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,320
You didn't sleep last night either.

265
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:08,726
Well...

266
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,569
Is it because of me?

267
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:11,625
No...

268
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:14,257
Well...

269
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:17,601
Maybe a bit,

270
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:20,523
but I've always had

271
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,227
trouble falling asleep.

272
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:23,937
Why?

273
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:26,812
Why?

274
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:30,562
I don't know.

275
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:43,117
Maybe I don't want to sleep.

276
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,640
You said you want to

277
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:47,077
sleep as long as possible.

278
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:47,937
Yeah,

279
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,140
but...

280
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:55,226
if I wake up,

281
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,437
it'll be tomorrow.

282
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:00,203
Even if you don't sleep,

283
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:01,874
tomorrow will still come.

284
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:04,984
I guess so...

285
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:21,687
I'll rub it out for you.

286
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:24,593
Huh?

287
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,070
It'll help you sleep.

288
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:27,203
Huh?

289
00:18:27,328 --> 00:18:28,929
You think that'll work?

290
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:30,375
It'll work if you're a guy.

291
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:32,875
Don't mock my insomnia!

292
00:18:33,414 --> 00:18:34,452
When was the last time

293
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:35,717
you've gotten off?

294
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:36,601
Huh?

295
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,453
- Why do I have to tell you?
- Come on.

296
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:40,781
When?

297
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:44,062
When?

298
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:47,132
Umm...

299
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:50,242
- That's what I thought.
- Whoa!

300
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:53,148
Keep it down. It's late.

301
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,162
What are you doing?

302
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:56,492
Stop that!

303
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:00,109
I told you,

304
00:19:00,562 --> 00:19:02,195
I'm not going to eat you or anything.

305
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:04,272
Wait, don't move.

306
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,593
If you have work tomorrow,

307
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:07,757
it's better to get some rest, right?

308
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:09,023
No,

309
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:10,351
Still...

310
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,577
Just trying to make you

311
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:12,844
feel comfortable.

312
00:19:13,804 --> 00:19:14,765
Stop!

313
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,054
That was quick.

314
00:19:41,187 --> 00:19:42,539
Who gave you permission

315
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:44,336
to look so worn out,

316
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:45,554
Hiro?

317
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,851
Are you still crying?

318
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:04,953
Pathetic.

319
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:06,343
But, Kana-chan

320
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,507
said she likes someone else.

321
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:11,101
Getting dumped by a girl...

322
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,531
Don't downplay it!

323
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,054
Relax.

324
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:17,890
In the future,

325
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:19,749
I'll marry Hiro.

326
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:25,937
Promise?

327
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,664
Yeah.

328
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:54,742
Hey!

329
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,514
You turned off my alarm, didn't you?

330
00:20:57,062 --> 00:20:57,867
Huh?

331
00:20:58,234 --> 00:21:00,264
You turned it off yourself.

332
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:00,937
That's a lie!

333
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:03,273
- That's never happened before!
- Look.,

334
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:05,179
hurry up or you'll be late for work.

335
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:07,015
I'm already late!

336
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,772
I'm going to get scolded by

337
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:14,866
the supervisor again.

338
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:24,968
My face seems...

339
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:28,215
Eat proper meals, get enough sleep,

340
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,790
and it will happen.

341
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,770
Your usual face is abnormal,

342
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:35,648
this is the normal one.

343
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,390
Come to think of it,

344
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,218
when was the last time

345
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:48,078
I slept for such a long time?

346
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:50,648
Every day,

347
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:52,320
I don't feel like sleeping,

348
00:21:53,414 --> 00:21:54,757
and I dread tomorrow.

349
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:59,570
But now...

350
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:04,929
You're welcome.

351
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:08,031
I haven't said anything yet.

352
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:09,375
It's fine,

353
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,726
I can tell.

354
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,039
Don't interpret it as you like!

355
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:18,875
Hey,

356
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:20,273
raise your face.

357
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:32,109
Alright, it's done.

358
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,241
Why did you grow up to be

359
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:43,991
such an arrogant bastard?

360
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:45,734
He used to be cheeky,

361
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:47,515
but more charming back then...

362
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:48,125
Hiro.

363
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:50,898
What do you want

364
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,078
for dinner tonight?

365
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:52,937
Ginger pork.

366
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:02,445
Take care.

367
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,187
Spare key.

368
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:33,304
I'm off.

369
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:53,546
(Next episode)

370
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:54,288
Good morning.

371
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,655
You must be thinking

372
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,180
that I'm a good fiance.

373
00:23:57,296 --> 00:23:58,304
You're not cute at all.

374
00:23:58,468 --> 00:23:59,820
I'm sorry

375
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,910
but could you not visit for a while?

376
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,780
Want to go together?

377
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:04,836
The festival.

378
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:05,640
Hey!

379
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,023
Ah, sorry.

380
00:24:07,117 --> 00:24:09,445
Then I look forward to it.

381
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,039
That guy and a caramel apple,

382
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:12,211
must be funny.

383
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:13,406
Watari.

384
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:15,812
Sorry,

385
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:17,328
I'm going to be two hours late.
