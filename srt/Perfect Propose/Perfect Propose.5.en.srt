1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,014
Kaneko-san said he was quitting!

2
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:19,218
Keep it down.

3
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:23,048
Ouch, that hurts.

4
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,132
Kai.

5
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:27,305
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:29,859
I am

7
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:32,766
not the same as before.

8
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:35,750
I'm not cool anymore.

9
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:38,648
You must be disillusioned, right?

10
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,477
I didn't want to

11
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:43,578
be seen like this by you.

12
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:46,695
The current me

13
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,656
can't help you at all.

14
00:00:52,914 --> 00:00:53,875
You asked me

15
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:56,430
to make dinner, didn't you?

16
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:00,328
But

17
00:01:01,203 --> 00:01:02,374
Kai has been the same

18
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:03,749
as always afterward,

19
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:05,078
unchanged.

20
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:08,719
To be honest, I'm kind of grateful.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,273
I still haven't been able to

22
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,461
answer or respond to his feelings.

23
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:20,094
I need to think about it.

24
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:23,922
Hirokuni.

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,593
When did you come back?

26
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:29,695
Oh, around 3 a.m.

27
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:32,453
So, you're going to work today too?

28
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:34,898
Are you a masochist?

29
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:36,680
Shut up.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,461
Hey,

31
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,141
don't worry about my meals for a while.

32
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:46,414
I'll return around this time every day,

33
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:48,241
and I don't know if

34
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:49,742
I'll be able to come home,

35
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:51,961
it would be a waste if I couldn't eat.

36
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:58,805
No.

37
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,500
Come home soon.

38
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:07,844
Kai,

39
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:09,758
you see...

40
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:14,484
How gullible.

41
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:24,680
Give up, give up,

42
00:02:24,738 --> 00:02:25,496
give up.

43
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:27,422
- It'll fall.
- He's always like this

44
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:29,922
and always taking care of me.

45
00:02:31,148 --> 00:02:32,444
I really shouldn't be

46
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:34,398
depending on him anymore.

47
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:36,406
Give up, give up, give up, give up.

48
00:02:36,664 --> 00:02:37,516
Give up.

49
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:56,085
"Perfect Propose"

50
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,830
"Episode 5"

51
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:11,773
Watari.

52
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:13,250
Yes?

53
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,047
The one you did yesterday isn't working.

54
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:18,094
Ah, I'm sorry,

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,133
I'll check it.

56
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,710
Get it together,

57
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:22,430
you're the team leader.

58
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:23,492
Yes.

59
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:35,945
Sakamoto-kun,

60
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,575
there's an error in the file

61
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:38,685
you shared with me.

62
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:41,578
Sorry, I'll fix it right away.

63
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:48,539
If there's anything you don't get,

64
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:49,922
feel free to ask anytime.

65
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:51,297
Yes.

66
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,510
Why am I the leader?

67
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:18,906
My juniors work much faster and are

68
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:20,405
more talented than me.

69
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:23,414
You're excellent, you always have been.

70
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,710
Get it together,

71
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,477
you're the team leader.

72
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:36,258
I don't get it.

73
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:52,914
(Dinner)

74
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:56,656
Looks delicious.

75
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,530
Bon appétit.

76
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:21,633
Oh, good morning.

77
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,531
You didn't go home?

78
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:26,578
I'm constantly causing trouble.

79
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:28,453
No, it's not like that.

80
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,719
It's okay,

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,430
I just took a nap earlier.

82
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:34,391
Umm...

83
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,008
Please don't overwork yourself.

84
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:38,961
Yes.

85
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,438
Hey, cut it out.

86
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:58,742
Ah, sorry,

87
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:00,531
my PC is lagging.

88
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:02,734
Are you shutting it down properly?

89
00:07:02,977 --> 00:07:04,219
Sometimes.

90
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,468
Well, we can't even put it

91
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:07,531
to sleep though.

92
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:34,133
(Dinner)

93
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:36,234
Again?

94
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:40,125
(Dinner)

95
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,102
Looks delicious.

96
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:11,046
(Food)

97
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:00,445
It's always my favorite

98
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,593
dishes every day.

99
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:03,906
What kind of harassment is this?

100
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:11,711
I want to go home.

101
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:16,508
I forgot

102
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,258
I had such feelings.

103
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,130
Since when did not

104
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,648
being able to go home become the norm?

105
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:40,984
Umm...

106
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,203
I brought some snacks.

107
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,227
Wow.

108
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:46,953
- Is it alright?
- Feel free to take some.

109
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:48,938
Thank you so much.

110
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,273
Wow, amazing.

111
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:52,633
There's so much.

112
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,234
- What is in here?
- What would you like?

113
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:56,320
I'll go for the chocolates.

114
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:59,047
Oh, Sakamoto-kun, take some...

115
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:05,906
Watari-san.

116
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,891
I can't finish it.

117
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,313
It's impossible.

118
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:21,703
I want to quit.

119
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:25,344
Let's go home!

120
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:26,687
Everyone, leave for today,

121
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:27,796
and get some rest!

122
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,867
But the work...

123
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:30,133
It's alright,

124
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:31,320
don't worry about work.

125
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,695
I'm sorry. I really...

126
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,742
It's okay,

127
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:36,172
just focus on resting,

128
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:37,812
don't worry about anything else.

129
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:41,883
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:53,734
Is Sakamoto-kun okay?

131
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:56,656
He might not come back anymore.

132
00:10:58,898 --> 00:10:59,656
Umm...

133
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:02,656
Everyone, please leave early today.

134
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:03,680
But...

135
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,062
If you don't get enough sleep,

136
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:06,531
mistakes will only increase.

137
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:17,398
I've made him cry.

138
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,695
It's because of me.

139
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,570
No,

140
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:26,750
it was impossible from the start,

141
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:28,578
this kind of schedule.

142
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:31,305
Even Kaneko-san said so.

143
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:33,344
But...

144
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:36,383
If Kaneko-san were the leader...

145
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:49,086
(Midnight snack)
Again. What is it this time?

146
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:55,969
Yes?

147
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,398
You, cut it out already!

148
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,406
- What are you...
- Do you feel like coming home?

149
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:07,031
Come home.

150
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:16,344
Hirokuni.

151
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:18,852
Ah, no...

152
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:20,508
Hearing this voice

153
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,750
after so long...

154
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,992
I bet you haven't had

155
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,179
anything decent to eat.

156
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,969
Well, I do want to go home.

157
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,063
When I visited Hirokuni's family home,

158
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:36,438
Auntie seemed worried.

159
00:12:37,553 --> 00:12:38,771
She mentioned that you

160
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:40,054
always comes home late.

161
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:44,210
She said she'd appreciate it if someone

162
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:46,117
could check on him from time to time.

163
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,688
So,

164
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,148
if you collapse or something,

165
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:54,063
I'll be in trouble.

166
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:57,203
You won't get in trouble.

167
00:12:57,523 --> 00:12:58,733
I don't think you would

168
00:12:58,742 --> 00:12:59,890
get in trouble either,

169
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,672
if you quit your job.

170
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,600
No,

171
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,288
I'm not staying because

172
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:06,741
I'm afraid of getting in trouble.

173
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:09,008
Then why?

174
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:13,063
Well...

175
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,422
You don't have to say it,

176
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,632
but it's a problem if you

177
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,046
collapse like that old man,

178
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:20,656
so don't overdo it.

179
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:23,086
Got it.

180
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,047
Okay then, I'm hanging up.

181
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,367
Ah, wait...

182
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:30,359
Hmm?

183
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,984
No,

184
00:13:32,383 --> 00:13:33,008
well...

185
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:35,468
I was just wondering about

186
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:36,945
the uncle's condition.

187
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:38,359
No idea.

188
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,914
I'll ask his son about it next time.

189
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,070
Oh, is that so?

190
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,812
Well, sorry.

191
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,641
It's fine.

192
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:50,563
Well then,

193
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,625
goodnight.

194
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:08,430
Why did I try to keep him on the line?

195
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:12,562
My head must be messed up

196
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,609
from exhaustion.

197
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,054
I just wanted to hear

198
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,226
his voice for a bit longer.

199
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:40,305
Hello.

200
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:42,328
It's me.

201
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:44,789
I see.

202
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:48,383
I'll be discharged this weekend.

203
00:14:52,156 --> 00:14:53,438
Are you listening?

204
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:55,633
I see.

205
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:57,578
That's good,

206
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,117
really.

207
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,359
So, about the shop...

208
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:07,367
I've decided to close it.

209
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,336
I see.

210
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,055
You're going to your son's place, huh?

211
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:16,891
Sorry about that.

212
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,047
That's not like you.

213
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,898
You haven't healed yet, have you?

214
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,023
Yeah.

215
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:25,586
That's all. Goodbye.

216
00:15:25,945 --> 00:15:26,617
Yeah.

217
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,344
See you.

218
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:10,523
Watari.

219
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:12,414
Yes?

220
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:13,586
Where's Sakamoto?

221
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:16,297
Huh?

222
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,742
Are you doing his work?

223
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:22,383
Yesterday Sakamoto seemed unwell,

224
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,594
so I asked him to go home,

225
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:25,594
and I decided to take over.

226
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,344
What?

227
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,141
Don't just do as you please

228
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,922
when you have your own workload.

229
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:32,265
- I'll handle that as well...
- You can't possibly handle it.

230
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,852
(Release date)
It's release weekend, you know?

231
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,977
And what's this about

232
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:37,673
Sakamoto feeling unwell?

233
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,742
Hey, call Sakamoto now.

234
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:42,094
Call him over.

235
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:43,102
Come on.

236
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,586
But...

237
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,358
It's because you coddle them like this

238
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:47,304
that they develop

239
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:48,453
a habit of slacking off.

240
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:49,641
A habit of slacking off...

241
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,179
- Sakamoto is...
- Enough. Just make the call.

242
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:52,984
And tell him.

243
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,359
"Do it, even if you can

244
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:55,499
only work half as much."

245
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:57,320
"Tell him it's for his own good."

246
00:16:59,109 --> 00:16:59,852
Come on.

247
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,547
Come on, hurry up.

248
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:07,086
I refuse!

249
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:10,460
Huh?

250
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,039
Sakamoto has been working hard enough.

251
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:18,086
I don't want to push him any further.

252
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:22,086
I'll get it done, no matter what.

253
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:30,594
Just so you know,

254
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,343
'I tried my best but couldn't finish'

255
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,452
doesn't cut it in the real world.

256
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,398
Um, are you okay?

257
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:51,555
If it's not okay,

258
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:54,266
if you want to run away,

259
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,523
it's better to run away

260
00:17:57,383 --> 00:17:58,875
before you end up like me.

261
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:40,422
Watari-san, excuse us...

262
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,016
It's okay.

263
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:43,281
Good job.

264
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:45,507
Please don't overwork yourself.

265
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,610
- Good job.
- Good job.

266
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:34,117
(Hirokuni)

267
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,000
How long have you been running?

268
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:41,656
Hmm?

269
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,008
Were you on the first train back?

270
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:46,625
Yeah.

271
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:47,828
Good job.

272
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:49,453
Thanks.

273
00:21:02,992 --> 00:21:04,383
Being here with you like this

274
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,680
reminds me of when we were kids.

275
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:09,805
Yeah.

276
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,305
Back then,

277
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:18,062
I never imagined I'd end up like this.

278
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:21,641
Like what?

279
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:24,961
Everything like sleep,

280
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:27,391
good food,

281
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:30,477
time with friends and family,

282
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:34,219
being with someone special,

283
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:39,305
I sacrificed everything for work.

284
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,914
But I don't feel anything anymore.

285
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,695
Not getting any satisfaction from work.

286
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:51,406
How should I put it?

287
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:55,445
It's like living a futile life.

288
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:04,352
I wonder if there's a life that isn't.

289
00:22:07,477 --> 00:22:08,227
Guess not.

290
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:16,836
Honestly,

291
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:18,922
I think I'm afraid.

292
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:20,625
That's why I can't quit.

293
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,562
I'm afraid of worrying my parents,

294
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:28,664
of not having another job lined up.

295
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:31,133
There are many things to consider.

296
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:34,602
I think in the back of my mind,

297
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:38,414
I believe that if I quit,

298
00:22:38,813 --> 00:22:40,008
everything will be okay,

299
00:22:40,977 --> 00:22:41,945
I'll feel better.

300
00:22:46,602 --> 00:22:49,296
It's like having something to hold onto.

301
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:52,273
That's why I want to keep it.

302
00:22:54,516 --> 00:22:55,789
If it's gone, I don't know

303
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:57,039
what will happen to me.

304
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,758
Stupid, right?

305
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,641
I kinda get it.

306
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,078
That's how it was for me with Hiro.

307
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:28,898
What?

308
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,375
I think that was kind of cute.

309
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,398
Like...

310
00:23:46,031 --> 00:23:46,914
What are you...

311
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,938
What are you doing?

312
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:04,625
You seduced me.

313
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:06,766
I did not.

314
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:07,523
But

315
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:09,477
you didn't resist, did you?

316
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,391
Where do you get the confidence from?

317
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:25,914
Hirokuni-san,

318
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,195
have you found your answer yet?

319
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,469
No,

320
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,008
not yet.

321
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:34,992
Sorry.

322
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:38,492
I...

323
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:41,570
might not be able to wait much longer.

324
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:46,891
The old man is going to be discharged.

325
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:49,835
We agreed it would be until then, right?

326
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,109
That I'd stay at your place.

327
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:00,297
(Next episode)

328
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:01,500
What do you want me to do?

329
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:03,141
Don't ask me.

330
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:06,031
Next Sunday, I will move out.

331
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:07,742
Hey.

332
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:09,445
Hirokuni.

333
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,227
I wanted to make you wait for a while.

334
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:23,562
Being involved with

335
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,429
other people is serious.

336
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:26,429
It's all futile anyway.

337
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:27,226
You said it yourself,

338
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:28,336
the rest of my life,

339
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,742
I'll hand it over to you!
