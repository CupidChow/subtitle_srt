1
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:19,736
You're awake.

2
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:23,217
Are you hungry? I'll get you some food.

3
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:34,337
It's okay.

4
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:36,376
First time making medicine, no experience.

5
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:37,497
Accidentally got burned.

6
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:46,376
In order to save me,

7
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:50,297
you told Wan Zhuo the clue of the map.

8
00:00:50,577 --> 00:00:52,057
Fake clue of course.

9
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:54,857
Wolves and tigers always fight.

10
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:59,257
But Wan Zhuo will retaliate if he finds out.

11
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,097
He might not get the chance.

12
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:12,777
What did the imperial decree say?

13
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:19,097
It says you are to become my crown princess.

14
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:21,457
Become the mistress of this prince’s mansion.

15
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:24,057
But we are...

16
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:25,537
My mother was...

17
00:01:25,537 --> 00:01:26,337
I know.

18
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:27,297
You've long known that.

19
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:29,137
But your father might not be Song Yanxing.

20
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:32,537
Look.

21
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:35,136
You, me, and Song Yanxing.

22
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,457
We don’t look alike at all.

23
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:43,617
But even so...

24
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:46,177
You and I.

25
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:48,977
only have the bond of master and servant.

26
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:51,616
And the bond of family.

27
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:54,897
Just that?

28
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,337
Yes.

29
00:01:57,337 --> 00:01:58,577
Nothing else?

30
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:01,577
No.

31
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:10,376
Good.

32
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,377
Don't feel burdened.

33
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:29,097
It's just giving you a title.

34
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,817
As long as we don't marry,

35
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,057
it doesn't count.

36
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:33,697
But Wan Zhuo will have to be cautious.

37
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,217
This is the best way I can think of

38
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:41,457
to ensure your safety.

39
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:02,257
Rest well.

40
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:04,097
I'll have the kitchen make you some food.

41
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:16,817
Song Chen.

42
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:19,697
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:31,896
Master.

44
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:36,257
Father.

45
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:37,057
Father.

46
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:39,537
Father.

47
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:40,737
So flustered.

48
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:41,737
What makes you so hysterical?

49
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:42,617
Father.

50
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:43,857
The extermination of the Li family.

51
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,177
How much do you know about it?

52
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:47,857
Everyone knows about it.

53
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:49,697
As much as everyone knows

54
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:50,777
that's how much I know.

55
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:51,737
Did you participate?

56
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:54,937
Yue'er.

57
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,537
If you have any questions,

58
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,457
I can answer them.

59
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:00,977
But.

60
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,136
Why do you sound like you're accusing me?

61
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:06,857
I didn't mean that.

62
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,377
I just want to know

63
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:11,657
if you were involved.

64
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:16,256
Then let me ask you.

65
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,457
What does 'involved' mean?

66
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:21,457
And what does 'not involved' mean?

67
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:24,137
The Emperor sent an imperial decree

68
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,337
ordered me and Wan Zhuo to act.

69
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,417
Did I dare to refuse?

70
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:35,257
But fortunately.

71
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:37,577
The killing and burning

72
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,937
were all done by Wan Zhuo.

73
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:41,937
My hands are clean.

74
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:46,057
Father.

75
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:49,457
Li Yunzhi is from the Li family.

76
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:53,297
Not surprising.

77
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:57,856
It must have been Ye Wan who secretly helped.

78
00:04:58,377 --> 00:04:59,177
Ye Wan.

79
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:00,657
My aunt.

80
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:02,457
What aunt?

81
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:06,417
She was just an adopted daughter.

82
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:11,736
No blood relation.

83
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:13,457
No doubt she was unreliable.

84
00:05:15,337 --> 00:05:16,136
By the way.

85
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:17,697
Don't be like her.

86
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:20,337
For men and sisters,

87
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:22,057
forgetting her own identity.

88
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:25,097
Kid.

89
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:29,377
Those who act on emotions can't achieve great things.

90
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:30,577
Understand?

91
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:32,736
Father.

92
00:05:33,337 --> 00:05:34,337
Coincidentally,

93
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:38,817
Li Yunzhi's scar on her back
 is similar to my birthmark.

94
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:41,297
Really?

95
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:45,457
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

96
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:52,537
Look at you.

97
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:54,616
You finally came home.

98
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:56,657
Yet you brought me nothing

99
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:58,577
except a belly full of anger.

100
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:00,577
Sorry, father.

101
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:02,256
Forget it.

102
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:04,817
There are new kites in the room.

103
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:07,417
And freshly made snacks in the kitchen.

104
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:09,657
Especially for you.

105
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:13,136
Thank you, father.

106
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:15,817
It's good to have you back.

107
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:42,496
The chief of the White Bird Society wants to cooperate with me.

108
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,256
Now she has the lower half of the map,

109
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:47,257
and I have the upper half.

110
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:49,177
Is she trustworthy?

111
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:50,257
We'll know what

112
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,137
when we meet.

113
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:54,217
We need the treasure map,

114
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:57,657
not that person.

115
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,337
Old buddy,

116
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:09,617
I hope this is our last battle together.

117
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,496
Father.

118
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:13,057
Can I come in?

119
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:15,937
Come in.

120
00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:19,177
Father, Yue asked me to bring you this fruit.

121
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:20,336
Just picked.

122
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:22,017
Very fresh, try it.

123
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:28,016
Father.

124
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,457
Why are you still up so late?

125
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:33,617
Why aren't you asleep?

126
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:35,017
What?

127
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:37,057
Is your wife abandoned you?

128
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:43,097
Father.

129
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,057
Don't keep making mistakes.

130
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:48,097
Stop now, we are all family.

131
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:49,577
Let's live well together, okay?

132
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:01,457
Just live your life with Ye Lingyue.

133
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,257
Don't worry about other things.

134
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:07,297
Once I get the lower half of the map.

135
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,457
Everything will be settled.

136
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,056
Leave.

137
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:18,177
Father.

138
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:26,497
Leave.

139
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:43,457
I am like a dragon trapped on the sand,

140
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:49,897
a horse that can't stop at the cliff.
