1
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:24,329
You're so boring,

2
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:26,849
that's childish.

3
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:29,049
You're so smart,

4
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:31,649
you knew it was me at once.

5
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,049
I asked my father in law,

6
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,249
and he said that you like flying the kite the most.

7
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:38,409
I made this myself,

8
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,129
let's go fly it tomorrow.

9
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:47,649
A kite can only be flown when the weather is good,

10
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:50,489
it won't be nice

11
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,249
when the environment is poor,

12
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:56,769
I didn't like it a long time ago.

13
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,808
They say,

14
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,929
a man is just like a kite of a woman,

15
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:02,569
why don't you fly me?

16
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:04,969
I'll be so nice.

17
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:11,649
You wanna join me?

18
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:16,489
Then do it.

19
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:00,689
I'm done washing,

20
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,529
enjoy.

21
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,929
You look delicate,

22
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:32,569
but in fact trying to control everything in the dark.

23
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,489
Ye Lingyue, can I trust you?

24
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:44,129
Lady, take a look at this hairpin.

25
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:54,729
No need to change.

26
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,009
How about it, is it pretty?

27
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,649
Everything looks pretty on you.

28
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,169
Let's go, go check over there.

29
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,369
Is there any new progress?

30
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,049
Not exactly,

31
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,169
I just want to know that,

32
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:28,969
why that Bai Yunwei is quite wary of you and me.

33
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,769
Bai Yunwei,

34
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,488
he's just a stubborn, disobedient donkey.

35
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,809
As for his highness,

36
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,089
he has been very weak since little

37
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:39,369
and seldom interact with people.

38
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:41,929
However, talk about men,

39
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,328
some tactics are always universal,

40
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:46,929
for example,

41
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:50,569
do you know what is called
having an evil thought at the sight of a beauty?

42
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,449
Of course,

43
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:55,729
the reason I let you go the first time I saw you

44
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,729
is because I thought you're a beautiful girl.

45
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,209
However.

46
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,569
Why don't I take this chance
and test if she's really that delicate?

47
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:36,649
Who's going after you?

48
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:38,489
Wan Zhuo's underlings, I guess.

49
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,009
He should be suspicious,

50
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:41,489
I saved you.

51
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:45,889
Sorry,

52
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:47,929
I got you into trouble.

53
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:52,769
That's okay, he would do it anyway, with or without you,

54
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,129
it's just a matter of time.

55
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:57,729
Besides, you just saved me, right?

56
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:00,249
Let's just call it even.

57
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:08,529
What a pretty girl,

58
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:12,529
you both look beautiful.

59
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:17,248
Wow, what happened to your hand?

60
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,929
Let me help you blow it.

61
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:26,969
Get lost.

62
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:31,688
Sorry, I'm sorry.

63
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:37,329
I'll officially introduce myself, I'm Ye Lingyue,

64
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,089
the daughter of the righteous king Ye Guangmao,

65
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,249
I'm pretty, but I am definitely not some good girl.

66
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,809
That's funny, I'm not some good person either.

67
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,529
I'm Li Yunzhi.

68
00:06:57,929 --> 00:07:01,849
Like the poem said, there's always someone
who would understands you even apart far away.

69
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,649
If we became alliance because of interests before,

70
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,929
now we can be friends in life and death,

71
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,249
I'll help you take down Wan Zhuo.

72
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:23,289
I have a plan that needs Ye family's power,

73
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:25,609
we can impeach Wan Zhuo together.

74
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,969
Boss, that girl is so fierce,

75
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:32,089
look at my face,

76
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:34,448
it can't be done, I need to raise the money.

77
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,729
That's right, we need to raise the money.

78
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,448
I need my hands to earn money,

79
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:40,849
just look at my hands now.

80
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:42,089
Ouch, it hurts.

81
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:48,649
Let's go.

82
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:01,049
Bastard, who dare to impeach me,

83
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,289
and even spread rumors that
I colluded with the White Bird Society,

84
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,289
I'll kill them all

85
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,649
if I ever find it out.

86
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:14,409
Four, five, six,

87
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:17,129
seven, eight, nine.

88
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:36,089
Your highness, all the things reported here

89
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:37,849
are all false,

90
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:40,689
those little bastards

91
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,369
framed me on purpose.

92
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,889
I said the same to father,

93
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,049
but he insisted me to investigate it,

94
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,249
I don't know how,

95
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,569
I am happen to be upset by it,

96
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:56,009
and your came.

97
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,769
The emperor doesn't trust me anymore?

98
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,129
Why don't you let me to meet him in person,

99
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:11,488
so that I can clarify it to him face to face.

100
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:15,128
Em, father hasn't feeling very well,

101
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:17,249
if something bad happened after you met him,

102
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,609
I'm afraid it's gonna be even more unfavorable to you.

103
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:20,849
Father said that,

104
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:23,489
he also tried to convince everybody to trust you.

105
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:25,889
So as long as you destroy the White Bird Society,

106
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,729
then the rumor of you trying to collude with it,

107
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:28,929
hide the Treasure Map

108
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,249
and the intention of plotting would be dispelled.

109
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:36,489
Your highness, the righteous king is here.

110
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:48,248
Your highness, I can testify to General Wan that

111
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:51,169
there's no way he would collude with the White Bird Society,

112
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:52,369
hide the Treasure Map

113
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,209
and trying to plot.

114
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:56,209
Yes, I definitely believe you two.

115
00:09:59,049 --> 00:09:59,968
May I dare to ask you, your highness,

116
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:04,409
who were the people falsely accused of me?

117
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:10,569
Father didn't tell me that,

118
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:12,529
you two should know that,

119
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,849
father has been in a coma for half a year,
sometimes he would wake up but not for long.

120
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:17,369
He gave me this impeachment and went to sleep again.

121
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:19,329
No one knows when will he wake up.

122
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:19,929
Okay.

123
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,249
If you two can bring

124
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,729
the head of the lord of the White Bird Society to him,

125
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:26,209
maybe he'll be happy and wake up.

126
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:27,609
Okay.

127
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:36,489
Farewell.

128
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:43,609
You old thing, you're quite well-informed,

129
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:46,209
did you impeach me?

130
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:48,049
What are you talking about?

131
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:49,689
How can it be me?

132
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:51,209
Think about our relationship.

133
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,329
That better be the case,

134
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:54,449
don't you forget that

135
00:10:54,729 --> 00:10:56,329
we are now on the same boat.

136
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,089
If I suffered,

137
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,929
you would suffer too.

138
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,329
Stop it,

139
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:21,449
you're the new female officer.

140
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,008
Yes.

141
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,049
What's your name?

142
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:40,489
You're so slow, it's just a cup of tea.

143
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:41,929
Your highness,

144
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:43,089
go bring it inside.

145
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:43,849
Yes.

146
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:55,488
Confirmed?

147
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,009
I found out that her name is Li Yunzhi.

148
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,929
She's the thief girl
who broke into Wan's mansion the other night.

149
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:01,729
That's her then.

150
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,848
The one who came up with the idea of impeaching me

151
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:05,689
must be her.

152
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:08,169
Did you find out her background?

153
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:09,848
I'm on it.

154
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:11,249
This his highness of ours

155
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,329
must enjoy the days of ease for too long

156
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:17,449
and forgot about the feeling of being fear.

157
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,249
It's time to remind him of that again.

158
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:22,849
What about Li Yunzhi?

159
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,569
The eyesore, of course

160
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,569
needs to be taken out.
