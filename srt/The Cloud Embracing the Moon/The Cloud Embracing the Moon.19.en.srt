1
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:17,732
Wan Xingzhu could not be saved.

2
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,732
And if Ye Guangmao dies,

3
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:22,092
I don't think Yue could bear it.

4
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:25,252
She was just pregnant.

5
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:28,332
I'll keep him alive.

6
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:31,892
But,

7
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,812
Wan Xingzhu really surprised me.

8
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:37,092
He finished writing "Ye".

9
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:38,332
He wrote only one stroke of the second word.

10
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:40,212
What do you think it will be?

11
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:42,452
Guang.

12
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:45,732
I don't know yet.

13
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:48,012
But a storm is coming.

14
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:50,412
The fish will come to the surface.

15
00:01:04,372 --> 00:01:05,172
Dad.

16
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:08,972
Dad.

17
00:01:10,772 --> 00:01:11,572
Dad.

18
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:13,732
Where have you been?

19
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:15,412
Have you seen Xingzhu?

20
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:20,492
No.

21
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:23,531
Dad.

22
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:25,572
If there's something you're not telling me,

23
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:27,972
What could I not tell you?

24
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:30,212
Are you hungry?

25
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:31,492
I'll get you some food.

26
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,291
No.

27
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:34,212
There must be something you're not telling me.

28
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:36,172
Whether I'm your daughter or not,

29
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:37,372
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:38,771
Of course, you're my daughter.

31
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:40,412
Okay, I'll get you some food.

32
00:01:40,412 --> 00:01:40,852
Dad.

33
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,372
Let me go!

34
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:44,652
What are you showing me?

35
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:46,172
Give it to me!

36
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:46,932
Let me go!

37
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:47,692
Give it to me!

38
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:52,212
Dad.

39
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,132
Xingzhu.

40
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:06,531
What did you do to Xingzhu?

41
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:08,492
Nothing.

42
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,412
Dad, it stopped ringing.

43
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:18,492
It stopped.

44
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,092
You killed Xingzhu.

45
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:36,612
No, it wasn't me.

46
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,732
Did you kill Xingzhu?

47
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:41,531
No, it wasn't me.

48
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:42,492
Then who?

49
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:44,452
It's Madam Flower.

50
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:02,692
Young man.

51
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:11,692
Dad.

52
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:15,332
I grew up without a mother.

53
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:19,772
But I've always felt very happy.

54
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:26,132
Because I have the most loving dad in the world.

55
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:30,771
He fed me my first bite of food.

56
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:32,572
He helped me take the first step.

57
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:34,212
He taught me my first word.

58
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:38,172
I love him.

59
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:40,612
I look to him as a benchmark.

60
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:41,692
I'm proud of him.

61
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:43,452
But.

62
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:46,331
Everything is fake.

63
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:49,092
It was all a lie.

64
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,332
He raised me.

65
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:55,571
Just to use me.

66
00:03:55,572 --> 00:03:56,692
No.

67
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,332
But the only one in the world.

68
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:05,252
And the one who really loves me.

69
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:08,332
And expects nothing from me.

70
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,892
Was killed by him.

71
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:15,291
I'm like this bell.

72
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:18,732
It won't have any more sound.

73
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,332
It won't.

74
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:38,052
Wait for me.

75
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:39,852
Fine.

76
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,532
You're here.

77
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:55,532
Don't you want to know about the old days?

78
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:58,412
Song Yan cheated away Li Ya's feelings.

79
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:01,011
But he said he had a marriage contract with Ye Wan.

80
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:02,492
He had a lover.

81
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:03,571
A confidant.

82
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,372
And he cheated on her.

83
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:07,612
After Song Yan ascended to power,

84
00:05:07,852 --> 00:05:09,252
he started weeding out the dissenters.

85
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:11,692
He wasn't going to kill them all.

86
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:13,652
But it was Ye Guangmao.

87
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:16,412
Who encouraged him to orchestrate the murder of
the Li family.

88
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:18,932
The aim was just to help his sister, Ye Wan,

89
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:20,852
to ascend to the throne of queen

90
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:22,572
and secure the entire Ye family.

91
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:27,892
So you're soft on the Li family's real enemy.

92
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:30,572
You're lying. Why didn't you say anything before?

93
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:33,011
Because I found out after Wanzhuo died,

94
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,612
and learned about it from Ye Guangmao.

95
00:05:37,052 --> 00:05:39,812
Men will only tell their secrets,

96
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:42,132
when they are concerned about
confusion and self-preservation

97
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:45,012
and self-confidence.

98
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:52,852
Boss of the Flower House.

99
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:55,732
It's you.

100
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,331
I should have thought of that.

101
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:05,212
The second word Wan Xingzhu wants to write is "flower".

102
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,692
So you teamed up with Ye Guangmao.

103
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:13,291
The reason the White Bird Society
has a fake list of Wanzhuo's

104
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:16,251
is that you are the chairman.

105
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,531
You really want to know about the past.

106
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,012
Because you wanted your father.

107
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:26,652
It's not Song Yan.

108
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:32,011
My mother used to tell me.

109
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:34,772
that if I met her best friend, Song Yan.

110
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:36,932
I must tell him something.

111
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:39,732
Ya.

112
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:41,812
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,692
I shouldn't have fallen in love with the same person as you.

114
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:46,212
And I shouldn't hurt you because of a man

115
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:47,011
who we both love.

116
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:50,412
I saved your life, but it's not out of guilt.

117
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:51,892
It's because I love you.

118
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,012
But I don't want to see you.

119
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,772
because I don't want you to come back.

120
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:09,012
There is no fault in this world.

121
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,811
That is all that can be forgiven.

122
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:15,732
He is not Li Ya anymore.

123
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:18,932
And Li Ya,

124
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:22,212
is not in this world anymore.

125
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:26,012
I am just paraphrasing.

126
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:28,291
My mother would never have known

127
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,692
if you had not forgiven me.

128
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,932
But I want to know

129
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:33,932
is Li Yunzhi's father?

130
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:35,692
really Song Yanxing.

131
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:41,412
What?

132
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:44,331
Didn't Ye Wan tell you?

133
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:47,612
She was dead.

134
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:49,092
She deserved it.

135
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:51,892
All the men who helped Song Yanxing

136
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:54,052
are all dead now.

137
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:55,531
Yeah.

138
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:57,772
How could women like you

139
00:07:57,772 --> 00:07:59,012
expect Song Yanxing

140
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:01,692
love another guy.

141
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:03,132
Let's go.

142
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:06,252
Please.

143
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,492
Let's go.

144
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,292
Let's go.

145
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,092
Okay?

146
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:11,452
Miss.

147
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:12,972
Only one can be taken.

148
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:13,771
Who is Li Ya?

149
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:16,932
It must be Ye Wan.

150
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:17,811
Stop!

151
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:18,612
Hurry up!

152
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:20,772
I don't need you.

153
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:21,892
I don't need any mercy.

154
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:23,412
especially from Ye Wan.

155
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:26,372
But the kid is innocent.

156
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:37,612
Just go.

157
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:40,772
I'm sorry for being from the Li family.

158
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:41,772
I'm not going.

159
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:42,372
Ye Wan.

160
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:43,372
I'm not going.

161
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:44,012
Song Yanxing.

162
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:48,332
I'll be waiting for you.

163
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:55,652
Miss.

164
00:08:56,932 --> 00:08:58,212
You are Li Ya's maid.

165
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:00,011
Yeah.

166
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:01,812
What?

167
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:05,212
You're in love.

168
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:08,492
I know you've been taking chances.

169
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:11,771
hoping Li Yunzhi's father isn't Song Yuanxue.

170
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:14,212
Now you have to kill that heart for good.

171
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:16,332
You're never going to be together.

172
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:23,011
But if you die,

173
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:26,732
who knows we can't be together.

174
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:32,692
Who?

175
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:38,372
You're brother and sister.

176
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:40,291
You're from the Song family.

177
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:42,852
And you should know the feeling.

178
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:08,092
What are you doing?

179
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:14,132
You're leaving.

180
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:18,492
Where?

181
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:21,452
Where?

182
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,332
Wanzhuo is dead.

183
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,812
I have no reason to stay.

184
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,092
Li Yunzhi.

185
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:42,932
You're not leaving.

186
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,372
You'll never get out of here.

187
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:47,011
What's the point of all this?

188
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:51,092
Then why are you still wearing it?

189
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,492
I forgot. I'm giving it back now.

190
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:59,412
You want to run away for a good reason?

191
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:00,732
What reason?

192
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:02,412
Because you are my sister.

193
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:04,412
Your Highness, wake up.

194
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:06,732
You need to stop letting your emotions fester.

195
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:17,292
I know.

196
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:19,612
But why do you have to go?

197
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:25,212
I'm not.

198
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,771
What's the point of staying?

199
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:32,332
Li Yunzhi.

200
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:36,011
Why can't you just face it with me?

201
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,212
Why do you always run away?

202
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,211
Li Yunzhi.

203
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,572
Don't you believe in destiny?

204
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:58,611
It's all destiny.

205
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,011
I don't believe that, Yunzhi.

206
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:04,932
If it's because of destiny

207
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,131
then why did God arrange you

208
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:09,372
to save me when I was at my lowest.

209
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,812
then why did He arrange for us to meet again?

210
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:16,131
It's been 12 years.

211
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:19,091
I've waited 12 years for you.

212
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:25,012
You're my only light.

213
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:29,091
in my last 12 years of darkness.

214
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:33,292
I don't have to ask so much.

215
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:35,972
But.

216
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,012
Could you please stay?

217
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:42,492
We.

218
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,292
Didn't we say we were going to be a family?

219
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:47,012
Yunzhi.

220
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:50,731
Just be family.

221
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,892
Fine.
