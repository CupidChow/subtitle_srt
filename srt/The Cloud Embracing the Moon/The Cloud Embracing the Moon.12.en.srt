1
00:11:18,732 --> 00:11:19,532
Yue,

2
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,412
how's it going?

3
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:26,012
Not feeling alright?

4
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:36,212
Don't touch it. It's so dirty.

5
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:39,332
Wang, are you hungry?

6
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,412
I'll find you something to eat. Stay here.

7
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:47,332
What are you doing?

8
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:48,732
Taking it home.

9
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:50,292
Will you raise it?

10
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:51,332
Yes.

11
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,812
I'll raise it and you.

12
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:56,412
I also want to raise a child.

13
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:00,892
Good?

14
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:02,091
Wang, what do you think?

15
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:05,052
Wang.

16
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,492
Why are you so cute?

17
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:09,611
When it's over,

18
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:12,492
you need to divorce Wan Xingzhu.

19
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:18,932
Wang.

20
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:23,131
Let's call it Wang.

21
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:25,052
How about it?

22
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:26,132
Good.

23
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:27,532
Give it to me.

24
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,612
Come home with us.

25
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:40,852
Look at its belly.

26
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:48,932
Song Chen didn't do anything to people on the list.

27
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:51,572
But the White Bird Society did, right?

28
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:52,332
Yes.

29
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:55,172
Is Li Yunzhi related to the White Bird Society?

30
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:56,892
I head that she was badly injured.

31
00:12:57,212 --> 00:12:58,332
Should we seize the chance to...

32
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:02,932
How could we use her if she's dead?

33
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:05,212
Go track the White Bird Society to find the Treasure Map.

34
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,292
Keep them alive.

35
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:11,532
Remember,

36
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:13,771
shake off the loyal dog Bai Yunwei in advance

37
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,012
and keep an eye on Ye Lingyue.

38
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:16,691
Yes.

39
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:57,772
Do you want to die?

40
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:00,292
You barely know how to fight, how can you risk it?

41
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:04,252
You taught me that

42
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:07,212
when faced with a formidable opponent,

43
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:08,532
I should be patient

44
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:10,412
and fight back

45
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,612
with a fatal blow.

46
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,012
What, what are you doing here?

47
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:50,132
Li Yunzhi.

48
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:52,572
Let me be your family

49
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:54,812
and stay by your side.

50
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:57,412
You probably don't know

51
00:14:58,452 --> 00:14:59,852
that we're really families.

52
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:01,372
Brother.

53
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:07,892
Maybe our best choice is to become families.

54
00:15:20,092 --> 00:15:21,852
Madam.

55
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:24,212
It's late at night. Where are you going?

56
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:33,612
Are you looking for this?

57
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,132
What is this?

58
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:42,412
I'm just hanging around.

59
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:45,892
I'm sleepy now.

60
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:47,172
I'll go to sleep.

61
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:47,972
Great.

62
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:53,372
You must be tired.

63
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:55,211
Let me walk back for you.

64
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,332
I need to take a bath before sleep.

65
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:01,372
I'll escort you, Madam.

66
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:24,251
Don't you come along, husband?

67
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:56,132
Again?

68
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:10,492
Yue.

69
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:18,732
Father.

70
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:19,332
Yue.

71
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:20,932
Open the door, father!

72
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:24,612
Open the door! Yue! Father!

73
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:25,572
What did you do to Yue!

74
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:26,691
Everything is set.

75
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,572
Please don't hurt Yue!

76
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:29,732
Father!

77
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:30,892
Father!

78
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:33,052
Father!

79
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:35,732
It's time to inform Li Yunzhi.

80
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:38,812
Father!

81
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:39,852
Yue!

82
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:46,171
I'm happy as long as you can stay with me.

83
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,092
Why are you mad?

84
00:18:09,892 --> 00:18:11,052
What were you thinking about?

85
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:11,932
So careless.

86
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:16,012
Why did the White Bird Society have Wan Zhuo's list?

87
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:18,412
The White Bird Society has been active among the folk

88
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:19,532
to win popular support.

89
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:21,532
They hardly target on officials.

90
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:23,732
Maybe it means Wan Zhuo has colluded with them.

91
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:29,892
No.

92
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:32,211
Then Wan Zhuo didn't need to send the list.

93
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,052
Maybe

94
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:40,052
the White Bird Society tried to aggravate your dispute with Wan Zhuo.

95
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:42,612
If the rumor were true

96
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,332
that the White Bird Society had the volume two of the Treasure Map,

97
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,852
why did they bother to do so?

98
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:49,612
They want to be a free rider.

99
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:52,532
No matter who is the winner, you or Wan Zhuo,

100
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:54,412
their enemy will be less.

101
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,012
That means

102
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:58,731
the White Bird Society doesn't have the volume two at all.

103
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:03,091
So it's our chance to break through.
