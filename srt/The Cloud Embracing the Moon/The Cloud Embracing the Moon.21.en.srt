1
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:15,647
It's me who secretly

2
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:18,327
forged an identical birthmark.

3
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:29,888
I will kill you!

4
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:32,967
You faked your death?

5
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:38,368
I congratulate you on recognizing your father and daughter.

6
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:40,928
But I forgot to tell you.

7
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:44,727
Your fake daughter invited me to
meet alone at the Flower House.

8
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:46,208
But I'm not available.

9
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:48,328
So I sent a few people there.

10
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:53,368
I, I will kill you!

11
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:01,288
Madam flower. Where are you?

12
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:07,848
Madam flower. Come out!

13
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:13,248
Madam flower. Come out!

14
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:27,608
Don't come over here.

15
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:53,768
Who are you?

16
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:56,848
Why did you save me?

17
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,008
Dad?!

18
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,688
If there is a next life,

19
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:29,808
I still want to be your father.

20
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:34,647
This lifetime,

21
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:37,728
I am wrong.

22
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,327
I am wrong.

23
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:49,568
Dad. Dad. Dad.

24
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:51,487
Don't scare me. Dad.

25
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:53,647
Don't scare me.

26
00:02:54,528 --> 00:02:55,328
Dad.

27
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:59,248
Dad. Look at me. Dad.

28
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:03,328
Dad. Look at me.

29
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:04,568
Dad.

30
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:05,528
Dad.

31
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:15,808
Dad!

32
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:38,208
Dad.

33
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:40,487
He loves you very much.

34
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:41,688
Yes.

35
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:45,328
I can get anything I want.

36
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:48,088
I can do anything I like.

37
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:52,887
Do you like kites?

38
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:00,487
This is Whistle kite,

39
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:02,728
also known as Banzuo kite,

40
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:04,887
produced in Zhi Gao.

41
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:06,688
When it is a little bigger,

42
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:09,927
the whistle can resound through the sky and earth,

43
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:11,528
and the crane can sound nine high,

44
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:13,008
and the sound can be heard in the sky.

45
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:16,528
I really enjoy listening to that sound.

46
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:19,408
Unfortunately,

47
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,328
I only liked it when I was young.

48
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:27,968
He thought I always liked it

49
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:30,688
and kept giving it to me.

50
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:35,448
From small one to big one.

51
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:39,888
But in fact, I never use them when I grew up.

52
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,008
All of this should have belonged to you.

53
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:53,968
Yunzhi.

54
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:55,648
Do you hate it?

55
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,647
I don't hate anyone.

56
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:07,128
This world has always been like this.

57
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:09,528
The god of destiny makes fools of the people.

58
00:05:10,648 --> 00:05:11,448
Yue.

59
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:14,048
You don't have to bear any psychological burden.

60
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:18,088
Some things are not desirable.

61
00:05:21,328 --> 00:05:23,448
But you are suffering the punishment

62
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,368
that I should have received.

63
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:27,247
The favor you should have
received is something I am enjoying.

64
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,328
The man who gave me everything, even life,

65
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:32,728
destroyed my family people,

66
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:33,928
and killed my lover.

67
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:36,848
I've been proud for so many years, it's just a joke.

68
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,448
How could I not have a psychological burden?

69
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,568
I even feel like.

70
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,728
I shouldn't be living in this world.

71
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:46,368
Yue.

72
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,448
Yunzhi.

73
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:53,328
I can't get through this mental hurdle.

74
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,887
You can leave now.

75
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,688
Let's not meet again for now.

76
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:10,488
Your Highness.

77
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,928
Your Highness and Li Yunzhi are not siblings.

78
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,288
Don't keep secret from me anymore in the future,

79
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,128
let alone sacrifice yourself to protect me.

80
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:43,128
What should I do if something happens to you?

81
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:45,488
OK.

82
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:49,248
I knew God wouldn't be so cruel

83
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,448
to send you to me and then take you away.

84
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:54,168
I won't leave anymore.

85
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:02,888
Let's go home.

86
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:24,408
Comply with the mandate of heaven
and follow the trend of the times.

87
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:29,007
Prince Song Chen is proposed to
be appointed as the heir to the throne.

88
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:04,808
Have you caught the lord of society?

89
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,208
Don't worry.

90
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:09,688
Although we haven't caught it yet,

91
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:10,888
the overall situation is settled.

92
00:09:11,488 --> 00:09:13,408
All she can do is struggle to the death.

93
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:16,088
Well.

94
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:18,688
You've been too tired lately.

95
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:20,848
Now you have to rest.

96
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:23,848
OK.

97
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:46,847
What's wrong?

98
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,247
I was clearly tired just now,

99
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:51,688
but when I see you,

100
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:53,847
suddenly I am not tired anymore.

101
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,127
Let me sing you a lullaby.

102
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,328
That's how my mother coaxed me to sleep in my memory.

103
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:26,487
OK.

104
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:34,007
Shy and shy, pick your face.

105
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,168
Dig a trench and plant beans.

106
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:41,368
Shy and shy, pick your face.

107
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:44,448
Bury your face and hide in your arms.

108
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:46,967
Shy and shy.

109
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:09,128
I'll go to the palace first.

110
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:10,928
Remember to have breakfast when you wake up.

111
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:20,488
Jellied beancurd served with
sauce has been replaced with sweet.

112
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,928
There's no shredded radish in the buns either.

113
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:29,128
Drink the soybean milk.

114
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:30,928
I know you don't like it.

115
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:32,328
But it's nutritious.

116
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:38,727
The newly launched beauty care service at Huanyan Building.

117
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,408
I have already arranged for you.

118
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:46,608
Wait for me at the Lover's Bridge tonight.

119
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:21,328
Yunzhi.

120
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:04,848
Today is your birthday.

121
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:06,288
How could I forget?

122
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:08,248
Make a wish.

123
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:09,808
I'll help you achieve it.

124
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:13,967
I only have one wish.

125
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:15,728
It's in the next twenty years,

126
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,128
in the next, next twenty years, we can all stand together.

127
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:22,368
So we'll become old men and old women, won't we?
