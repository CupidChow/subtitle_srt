1
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:20,899
Your, Your highness.

2
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,659
You did that to Li Yunzhi, am I right?

3
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,379
Your highness.

4
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,379
Because you like me,

5
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:31,058
so you're jealous of her.

6
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,739
You want to use Wan Zhuo to take her down, am I right?

7
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,699
But why would Wan Zhuo believe you.

8
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:49,019
Unless, you actually belong to him to begin with.

9
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:51,098
No, I'm not.

10
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:54,699
I heard that Wan Zhuo has been looking for people
from the White Bird Society,

11
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:57,099
so I pretended to be one and said to him,

12
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:59,499
as long as he killed Li Yunzhi,

13
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:02,419
I would introduce him to the lord of the society.

14
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:08,099
I never thought you're quite capable, Ping.

15
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:10,899
Your highness,

16
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,179
I've always liked you.

17
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:16,699
Then you must Li Yunzhi is the girl I like.

18
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:17,939
But I found out

19
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,659
Li Yunzhi's true identity.

20
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:29,979
What's her true identity?

21
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:32,739
She's from Li family,

22
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:35,578
her mother is Li Ya.

23
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:37,939
Who told you that?

24
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,659
Li Ya's midwife.

25
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:41,579
Where is she?

26
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:44,819
I killed her.

27
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:53,619
Good job.

28
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,459
Never do that again.

29
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:08,099
What a shame,

30
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,179
she's an infanta,

31
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:11,939
yet she's been with that kind of woman all the time,

32
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:13,578
and even spent the night.

33
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,499
The Ye family can bear that,

34
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:17,779
but not our Wan.

35
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,019
Lingyue is kind and righteous,

36
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:21,739
she's not like that.

37
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,539
I won't allow you to slander her.

38
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,098
What right do you have to say something like that to me?

39
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,739
Everything you have is from Wan family,

40
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:29,539
do you even have a little bit of contribution to it?

41
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,379
They call you the young master Wan,

42
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,339
but to me,

43
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,019
you're nothing but a cowardly bug.

44
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,258
You think I like being a Wan?

45
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,139
Other kids got to choose

46
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:43,698
what they want to do when they were little,

47
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:46,899
only me, just because I am your son,

48
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,659
everything expected me to learn martial arts,

49
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:54,059
I like study the nature of things and astrology,

50
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:57,979
but you said only a trash would like that.

51
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,219
If I don't even get to decide my own life,

52
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,019
why would I even try?

53
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,299
You think you're the only one
who wants to decide his own life?

54
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:12,259
You think our Wan family gets to what it's like today

55
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,179
because of me alone?

56
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,219
This is the several generations of our Wan

57
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,459
sacrificed their lives

58
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,939
hard fought down.

59
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,699
You say everything you did is for the Wan,

60
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:28,499
but is what you did

61
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,098
really for the good of the Wan family?

62
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,059
General Wan,

63
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,499
your greedy will eventually get us all killed.

64
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,819
How could I have

65
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,979
such a naive and foolish son like you?

66
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,259
You think it was me who can not stand others?

67
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:48,019
It's others who can not stand us.

68
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,659
This Li Yunzhi always tried to get me killed,

69
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,658
and Ye Lingyue is just like a sister to her.

70
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:59,259
Yet you defend her so deadly.

71
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:05,058
You really plan to finally wake up

72
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:08,419
when she cuts my head off?
What are you gonna do by then?

73
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:16,539
I won't let Lingyue hurt Wan family,

74
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,379
but in the meantime,

75
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:23,138
I hope you don't hurt her either.

76
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,059
Out,

77
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:28,899
out.

78
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:33,379
If you really want to protect her,

79
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,779
you'd better get her pregnant,

80
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,339
or I plan to change a daughter in law.

81
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,339
Today, let's talk about our dreams.

82
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:51,379
The new student, why don't you say something?

83
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:55,059
Hey, look,

84
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,099
she's a girl. She really is.

85
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,939
So I am a girl, so what?

86
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,618
What I seek is the equality between men and women,

87
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:04,939
girls can be officials, can be warriors,

88
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:05,979
can do business,

89
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:07,618
can rule and share the world

90
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:08,739
with men.

91
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:10,419
A girl dare to dream about ruling the world?

92
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,459
That's ridiculous.

93
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:18,779
Wan Xingzhu, what's your dream?

94
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:20,379
What else?

95
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,299
He just likes doing handicrafts

96
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:23,339
and looking at the stars.

97
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,058
General Wan is gonna pissed off by him.

98
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:31,098
Everyone should allow to have his own dream,
so what's wrong if it's different?

99
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:33,499
You'll have your power to seek,
he'll have his stars to reach,

100
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,939
there shouldn't be any high or low, it's all equal.

101
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:45,499
Yue, you may long forgot about it,

102
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,139
but I'll always remember it,

103
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:51,659
you're the first one who didn't laugh at my dreams.

104
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:59,219
Ah. A dead man.

105
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:07,539
It's the mark of the White Bird Society.

106
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:20,099
It's fake.

107
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,299
I saw her in and out of Wan's mansion.

108
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,179
She must be the one
who told others about that scar on your body.

109
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:29,859
How could she die here?

110
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:33,139
She slandered others, and it got caught,

111
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,299
thus someone killed her.

112
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:38,499
We'd better leave here soon,

113
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,578
it's gonna be bad if we're recognized as murderers.

114
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:47,899
This bitch, how dare she
pretend to be a member of the White Bird Society.

115
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,218
Do you think Li Yunzhi planed this?

116
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:55,939
That's not possible,

117
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:58,899
no women would
sacrifice her reputation to set up a trap.

118
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:05,098
Did Ye lingyue come back?

119
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,658
Ye Lingyue, you've already married into our Wan family,

120
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:42,219
you should know that from now on,

121
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,379
everything you do, you do it for Wan.

122
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:47,419
But how dare you collude with others tried to slander me.

123
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,339
We can't let you stay here anymore.

124
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:51,258
I didn't do that.

125
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,179
Do you have any proof?

126
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,819
Those old bastards who impeached me,

127
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,179
didn't you gather them?

128
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,659
And on the Poetry Congress,

129
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:05,699
Li Yunzhi got on the top under my watch,

130
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:08,419
didn't you plan that too?

131
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:11,459
I know nothing about impeachment,

132
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,299
as for the Poetry Congress,

133
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:16,579
didn't Li Yunzhi win that with her talent?

134
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:18,899
You're quite stubborn.

135
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,819
The marriage between Ye and Wan
was decreed by the imperial,

136
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,459
I don't think what you're about to do

137
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,339
is gonna do you any good.

138
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,739
You clearly know that,

139
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:36,699
it was your father who asked for this marriage,

140
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:38,219
you think I am really afraid of

141
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,099
the power of Ye?

142
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,939
Since ancient times, it's the most taboo
that a subordinate overshadows his master.

143
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:46,539
We Ye family may not be as powerful as you,

144
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,659
we're still a royal relative.

145
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,578
Only by marry our Ye,

146
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,259
your loyalty

147
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,419
can be seen by the emperor.

148
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:57,739
How dare you speak so wildly to me.

149
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:00,499
As long as she's not dead,

150
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,218
I can teach my own daughter in law all I want.

151
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:08,339
What are you doing? Let me go.

152
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,139
Let me go.

153
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,059
No.

154
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:24,339
Let me go.
