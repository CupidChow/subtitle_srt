1
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,610
Where's the treasure map

2
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,570
Hand it over

3
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,250
Let's go

4
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,090
I'm not sure I can get rid of them

5
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,010
So I just hide it away

6
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,450
Once we get rid of them

7
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,530
I'll go back and get it

8
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,770
But when I came back

9
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,209
It has already gone

10
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,850
Who would have taken it

11
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,929
The White Bird Society?

12
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,090
It does not matter

13
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,890
It's good to be okay

14
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,570
The fish have come to the surface

15
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,290
We'll know the truth soon enough

16
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,570
Just have someone keep an eye on it

17
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,970
I let Wan Xingzhu go

18
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,490
Today is the Lantern Festival

19
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,490
We can just let it all go

20
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,010
Let's hang out

21
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,330
Good idea

22
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,490
I've never do this before with anyone else

23
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,810
This is my first time, too

24
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,570
Bang

25
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,010
Bang

26
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,889
Bang

27
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,010
Bang

28
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,730
Xingzhu

29
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,050
Xingzhu

30
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,890
Nice tea

31
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,330
This is Wan Zhuo's old favorite tea

32
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,490
You a big old man

33
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,890
But all you want to do is learn how to behave

34
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,290
You're not that type of one

35
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,890
Yeah

36
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,210
You'll just fool yourself around

37
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,410
Dad

38
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,610
He just gone

39
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,690
Can you be quiet for a moment?

40
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,530
Alright

41
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,970
You finally know how to dress up

42
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,530
Yue just beat up the Wan family

43
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,050
You contributed a lot

44
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,770
I see who dares to laugh at me now

45
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,890
Girls are no worse than boys

46
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,130
The one who wrote the letter

47
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,970
maybe the one who collude with the White Bird Society

48
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,370
Or maybe it's the one who's been lurking in the background

49
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,769
Dad

50
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,850
What are you doing now

51
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,890
I'm writing something

52
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,410
It's written by you

53
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,210
Yes

54
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,730
But how is that different

55
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,490
Because I'm copying everyone else

56
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,610
I guess I can't read Daddy's handwriting

57
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,650
You won't

58
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,850
Because imitation is imitation

59
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,170
One's habits do not change easily

60
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,090
Dad

61
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,850
Is that gonna work?

62
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,450
By the way, Wan Zhuo has already passed away

63
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,970
It's none of your business

64
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,650
You should get rid of Wan Xingzhu as soon as possible

65
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,530
I'll go

66
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,250
You must do that

67
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,130
Luckily, I'm smart

68
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,210
You two don't have kids yet

69
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,290
But you will write the letter, right?

70
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,290
Don't forget to imitate my handwriting

71
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,050
Otherwise he won't believe that

72
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,930
It's easy for you

73
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,850
Uh

74
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,450
Wang

75
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,410
I need you to stay with him for me
