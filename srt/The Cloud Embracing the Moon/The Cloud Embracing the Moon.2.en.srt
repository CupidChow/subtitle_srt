1
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:23,654
Your Highness, why are you here?

2
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:26,934
Is she the assassin back then?

3
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:29,814
It's one thing for Wan Zhuo to meddle.

4
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:32,894
You're not qualified to manage His Highness's affairs.

5
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:41,694
General, the young master and young madam have returned.

6
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:43,014
The Master requests your immediate return.

7
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:47,054
It's snowing heavily, you shall return to rest early.

8
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:48,374
I'll take my way.

9
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:31,893
Hey!

10
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:40,974
How should I return your umbrella and clothes?

11
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:43,293
No need.

12
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:46,934
Your Highness. You shouldn't protect her.

13
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:50,214
It's fine. Looked like her target was Wan Zhuo.

14
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:07,014
We gave you the identity of a showgirl to kill Wan Zhuo.

15
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,974
Such a good opportunity, yet you failed.

16
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:12,294
This is your punishment.

17
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:13,774
And a reminder.

18
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:16,254
Don't forget who you are.

19
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:18,574
Who are you?

20
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:20,694
Who are you?

21
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:24,413
I am Li Yunzhi.

22
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:26,854
My mother, Li Ya, pregnant,

23
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:28,614
was abandoned and betrayed.

24
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:31,413
Family Li was loyal to the country,

25
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,014
yet was annihilated.

26
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:39,094
All because of Wan Zhuo and Song Yanxing.

27
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:41,334
I seek revenge.

28
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,654
This scar, though only the size of a palm,

29
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:45,854
causes you unbearable pain.

30
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:49,653
While hundreds of our relatives were burned alive.

31
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:51,934
This scar

32
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:54,694
is to make you remember everything.

33
00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:57,134
Until your great revenge is achieved,

34
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:59,334
it will not disappear.

35
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:02,734
I won't fail again.

36
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:05,574
I can't fail again.

37
00:03:12,854 --> 00:03:15,054
All other Princes died one by one.

38
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:18,534
You're the only prince left now.

39
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:20,974
Now that His Majesty is seriously sick.

40
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:23,094
He intends to let you take charge of the court.

41
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:25,934
But you rely on gods and fate,

42
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:27,974
showing no sign of being a prince.

43
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:33,414
It is a great fortune.

44
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:44,894
In the current situation,

45
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:46,574
Wan Zhuo holds power internally,

46
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,414
and The White Bird Society eyes us externally.

47
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:49,734
How can divination solve this?

48
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:54,174
Now that I have married into the Wan family,

49
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,374
we should work together inside and out,

50
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:58,214
to eliminate that Wan Zhuo.

51
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:04,854
Your Highness.

52
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:20,294
Cousin.

53
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,534
Your mother left this for you

54
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:25,854
to encourage you.

55
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:50,854
Ya.

56
00:04:54,614 --> 00:04:57,334
I heard the emperor wants to
 select female officials for you.

57
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:01,254
You've secluded in the deep palace,

58
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:03,214
knowing nothing about the court.

59
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:07,414
Thus you shall let me handle the selection.

60
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:11,094
This list,

61
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:13,494
is full of mediocre people.

62
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,173
They can't take on such important roles.

63
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:18,894
But they're appointed by Father.

64
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,854
If the Emperor knows I'm handling this.

65
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,574
I think he won't object.

66
00:05:27,174 --> 00:05:27,974
Your Highness,

67
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:29,534
what do you think?

68
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:34,773
Then, thank you, General Wan.

69
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,494
That's what I should do.

70
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:00,214
The wedding was disturbed yesterday,

71
00:06:00,214 --> 00:06:01,934
we haven't finished the ceremony.

72
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,014
I didn't expect

73
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:07,614
you to care about those formalities.

74
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:09,574
It's not the formalities I care about,

75
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:11,254
but the one with me.

76
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:20,053
Do not bring the fan before the curtain.

77
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,334
It blocks the brilliance of talent.

78
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:25,053
Young master.

79
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:26,374
The treasure map is lost.

80
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:27,494
Treasure map?

81
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:31,653
The one that father has mentioned?

82
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:32,534
I'll go take a look.

83
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:33,694
Wait me here for a moment.

84
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:13,654
Don't even think of shouting or escaping.

85
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:14,773
Otherwise...

86
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:23,574
You seem completely different today.

87
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:27,893
I don't know your background or skills,

88
00:07:28,294 --> 00:07:31,334
but Wan Zhuo has fought on the battlefield for decades.

89
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:33,254
People call him The Hell King Wan.

90
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:35,134
Killing him

91
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:37,294
is nearly impossible.

92
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:40,813
Living is already nearly impossible.

93
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:45,614
Sometimes, a difficult task

94
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:47,734
becomes easier if you look at it

95
00:07:48,174 --> 00:07:50,054
from a different angle and approach.

96
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:54,454
Trying to kill him now
 is like an ant shaking a tree.

97
00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:57,054
But if you reach a certain height,

98
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:00,614
you can use leverage

99
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,574
to uproot the tree.

100
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:05,694
For example?

101
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:09,134
For example, the center of royal power.

102
00:08:10,254 --> 00:08:11,854
As long as you choose the right person.

103
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:13,614
The thing you want to do

104
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,574
would be much easier.

105
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:19,254
This is the list Wan Zhuo prepared for Prince Song Chen.

106
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:21,494
No matter who the prince chooses,

107
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:23,574
they are all Wan Zhuo's people.

108
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:25,533
The female officials are meant to

109
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:29,374
assist the prince in becoming a qualified heir.

110
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:33,534
Wan Zhuo wants to use this key piece

111
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:37,174
to gradually control the kingdom.

112
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:38,974
But conversely, it could also be

113
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:43,494
a weapon for the prince against Wan Zhuo.

114
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:46,294
Why should I trust you?

115
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:10,094
I put your name on the list.

116
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,654
You imitate the handwriting quite well.

117
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:25,734
This is a secret code between me and the prince.

118
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:29,814
Now we are accomplices.

119
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:36,294
Even if you were forced
 to marry into the Wan family.

120
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:39,254
Now that you've married to Wan Xingzhu.

121
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:41,254
If Wan Zhuo dies,

122
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,174
your life would be rough also.

123
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:46,494
That doesn't matter.

124
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:48,934
As long as Wan Zhuo disappear,

125
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:50,734
His highness will be better off,

126
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,494
and so will the Ye family.

127
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:57,494
Go check the study.

128
00:09:57,854 --> 00:09:58,374
Yes.

129
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,214
Young madam, why are you here?

130
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:12,694
heard a lot of noise outside,

131
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:14,173
so I came to check.

132
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,214
But I forgot my way back.

133
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,534
I was scared.

134
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,454
You may send be back now.

135
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:21,654
Yes.

136
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:47,734
It seems to be over there.

137
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,734
On the eaves, hit it! Come quickly!

138
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:50,694
Hurry!

139
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:51,654
Come on.

140
00:10:52,174 --> 00:10:53,134
That way.

141
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:55,734
Hurry, here.

142
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:58,334
Why is there another person below?

143
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:00,574
Doesn't matter.

144
00:11:00,814 --> 00:11:01,613
Escape first.

145
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,214
Over there.

146
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,214
Chase!

147
00:11:06,614 --> 00:11:07,414
Oh, shit.

148
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:09,814
Don't run. Stop.

149
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:17,853
Take them away.

150
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:19,054
Lock them up.

151
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:29,534
The thief has been caught.

152
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,654
I heard a lot of noise outside.

153
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:34,613
Did it scare you?

154
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:37,653
Don't worry, the thief has been caught.

155
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:39,574
Father will personally interrogate her later.

156
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,774
A woman? Could it be Li Yunzhi?

157
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:44,414
I must find a way to save her.

158
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:45,694
I've been tired all day.

159
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,574
I need a bath now.

160
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:53,574
Even without a bath,

161
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:55,774
you still smell fragrant.

162
00:11:58,414 --> 00:12:00,134
After I finish inscribing the poem

163
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:03,454
shall we bathe together?

164
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:06,294
Sure.

165
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:18,654
Since the poem is for me,

166
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:21,454
it should naturally be inscribed for me.
