1
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:38,213
Turn around.

2
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:05,252
Tie my waistband.

3
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:08,772
Serving me is part of your job.

4
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:09,733
I don't know how to serve people.

5
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,572
Then I'll be the first man you serve.

6
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,973
I plan to spread the word,

7
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:46,413
let officials impeach Wan Zhuo.

8
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:49,013
With Wan Zhuo's temperament, he'll surely investigate.

9
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:51,293
We can follow his actions.

10
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,012
Those not found out

11
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,853
are his cronies.

12
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:01,853
Are you always in such a hurry?

13
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:03,453
Done.

14
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:08,933
You really are in a hurry.

15
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:14,733
How about I fulfill your wish now?

16
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:33,292
Don't move.

17
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:36,333
Is there some secret here?

18
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:38,893
The mark of White Bird?

19
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:20,893
Let's go.

20
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:33,773
Your Highness, I'm just following orders.

21
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:35,293
It's just your bad luck.

22
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:58,933
Are you okay?

23
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,533
I'm fine.

24
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,533
Facing a much stronger opponent,

25
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:04,333
remember to endure,

26
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,973
and strike back with a deadly blow.

27
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,013
Okay.

28
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:12,973
The scars on your back.

29
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,133
It's fine, they're old wounds.

30
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,973
Really, my home is right there.

31
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:24,893
I'll take you home.

32
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,333
Aren't you going home?

33
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:27,973
No.

34
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:30,733
I have no family nor relatives.

35
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:41,133
From now on, I'll be your family.

36
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:45,172
My mother said,

37
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:48,173
one men and women get married, they'll be families.

38
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:49,813
Marry me in the future.

39
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:52,132
Okay, I'll marry you in the future.

40
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:10,973
We met briefly back then, and lost touch.

41
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:14,293
12 years, I've been looking for you.

42
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,253
Finally we meet again.

43
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:21,573
Just no one knows if she's still the same.

44
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:23,813
I still need to test her.

45
00:05:50,573 --> 00:05:53,853
Bodyguard Bai, you should change your move.

46
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:01,413
Your Highness, no need to test me.

47
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,453
As your female official,

48
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:05,973
I will loyally protect you.

49
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:15,093
Did she pass the test?

50
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:16,373
She won't harm me.

51
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:19,453
She is still the same.

52
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:23,533
But I've changed.

53
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:26,053
So you're not going to tell her who you are?

54
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:31,573
No. My situation will bring danger to her.

55
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,373
Besides, her purpose of coming here remains unknown.

56
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:38,933
But no matter your purpose,

57
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,373
I will protect you

58
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:42,493
just as you did.

59
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:50,893
Your Highness.

60
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,173
May I come in?

61
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,493
Please.

62
00:06:58,973 --> 00:06:59,893
Have you had breakfast?

63
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,413
I never eat breakfast.

64
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:05,692
When I was little,

65
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:07,333
my mother always made me eat breakfast,

66
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,493
saying it's the most important meal of the day.

67
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:13,013
Come, have breakfast with me.

68
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:33,133
This medicine is colorless and tasteless.

69
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,893
Taken in small amounts daily, it's hard to detect.

70
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,013
Once Wan Zhuo is dealt with,

71
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,613
Song Chen will also be incurable.

72
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:06,732
Your Highness, luckily you're awake.

73
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:09,013
Just take the medicine.

74
00:08:09,453 --> 00:08:10,373
Leave it there.

75
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:26,813
Take it.

76
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:30,613
That's against the rule.

77
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:36,493
At my place. I'm the rule.

78
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:22,653
Spit it out.

79
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,013
Is it poisoned?

80
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:48,013
Even if it were, I'd still drink it.

81
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:03,093
Your strategy isn't foolproof.

82
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,933
Wan Zhuo is not easy to deal with.

83
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:06,373
It's easy to get caught up.

84
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:10,213
I'll have others do it.

85
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:11,573
You mustn't act rashly.

86
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,533
The sunset is beautiful.

87
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:55,093
The sunset is beautiful.
