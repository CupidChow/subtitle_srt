1
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:16,415
Since the poem is for me,

2
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,294
it should naturally be inscribed for me.

3
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:45,975
Write it well.

4
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,535
Don't shake.

5
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,655
Are you coming to save me?

6
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:07,135
Clever. Guessed it right away.

7
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:10,855
What's this?

8
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:18,055
The epitaph of Li Yunzhi.

9
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:21,655
You can't die.

10
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,415
I've put your name on the list,

11
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:25,975
if you die, my work would be wasted.

12
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:28,655
Let's go.

13
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:32,855
Why are your hands so cold?

14
00:02:37,855 --> 00:02:38,935
You saved me.

15
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,575
What if we get discovered?

16
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:44,735
I saved you for our grand plan.

17
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:46,495
Taking a bit of risk is nothing.

18
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:49,935
Hurry before anyone notices, let's go.

19
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:58,895
Since that's the case,

20
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:00,695
happy cooperation.

21
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:19,775
Where's the thief?

22
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:21,415
Did you catch them?

23
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:23,175
One got away.

24
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:24,814
We only caught a female thief.

25
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,094
But didn't find any useful clues.

26
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:30,294
Rumor says that The White Bird Society
 holds the next half of the treasure map.

27
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:33,574
Could it be that they came to steal this half?

28
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:36,975
The White Bird Society

29
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:39,415
has grown rapidly in recent years.

30
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:42,095
Now they even

31
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:43,655
dare to target me.

32
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,095
You came back half an hour later than I expected.

33
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,055
People of the Wan family. They're hard to deal with.

34
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:53,615
You're injured.

35
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:56,655
It's nothing, just some scrapes.

36
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:59,535
If Wan Zhuo didn't have that ability,

37
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:01,895
he wouldn't be in his position today.

38
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:04,535
Did you get the treasure map?

39
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:05,855
Got it.

40
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:12,935
It's fake.

41
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:18,614
It's not your fault.

42
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:21,655
The treasure map is

43
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:23,295
is a coveted item for those with

44
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:24,495
rebellious intentions.

45
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:26,055
The Li family was

46
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:28,215
exterminated because of it.

47
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,575
After the Li family was annihilated,

48
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:32,975
the treasure map disappeared.

49
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:36,055
We don't have much time left.

50
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,415
I found this.

51
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:06,295
Investigate further.

52
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:07,535
Yes.

53
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:19,575
Are you going to do as Ye Lingyue said?

54
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:22,335
Female officials are so important.

55
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:24,054
Her arrangement

56
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:26,614
at least would be better than Wan Zhuo's.

57
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,015
We'll be cautious.

58
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:31,175
Alright, I'll follow your lead.

59
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:33,055
As long as I'm here,

60
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,255
no one can hurt you.

61
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:05,735
Song Chen, after you eliminate Wan Zhuo,

62
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:09,215
I'll kill you.

63
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,095
Our prince was born weak,

64
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:15,375
though he is a prince,

65
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:17,575
he's the kindest and most gentle one.

66
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:18,855
However,

67
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,895
that pair of his jiaobei,

68
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:22,215
you must not touch.

69
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:24,375
They were his mother's relics,

70
00:06:24,695 --> 00:06:25,975
his treasured possessions.

71
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,855
Your Highness, the new female official is here.

72
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,815
Leave us. Yes.

73
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:47,575
It's you.

74
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:51,215
Why do you look so familiar?

75
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:55,695
Thanks for the umbrella that day.

76
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:02,895
What's your relationship with Ye Lingyue?

77
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:05,295
Why did she recommend you as a female official?

78
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:06,975
Can you handle it?

79
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,415
No special relationship.

80
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,255
I just didn't want to be confined to domestic chores,

81
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,375
and was lucky to earn the Infanta's favor.

82
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,215
I just want to be a female official.

83
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:21,455
And, Your Highness, to help you get rid of Wan Zhuo.

84
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:23,495
You? Kill Wan Zhuo?

85
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:24,535
What?

86
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,135
Isn't that why you

87
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:29,015
cooperated with the Infanta?

88
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:30,655
Yunwei.

89
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,655
You're so rude. Be gentle with ladies.

90
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:38,294
Okay, I'll be gentler.

91
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:03,055
How dare you put the prince in danger for victory.

92
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:05,855
Sorry, Your Highness.

93
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:08,695
I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't confident.

94
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:11,735
If I'm confident, then it's not really a danger.

95
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:14,415
Ye Lingyue found a good knife.

96
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:17,615
This person is too dangerous to keep around.

97
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:18,935
If I wanted to,

98
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:21,334
I could pretend to be weak and harmless.

99
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,295
I dare to show my strength

100
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:26,334
to reassure the prince.

101
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:30,375
I, Li Yunzhi, am capable of
 standing by the prince's side.

102
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:36,935
Let me do a divination.

103
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:38,054
A divination will tell.

104
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:42,935
Yunwei, look, it's great fortune.

105
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,614
You'd better behave.

106
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,975
If I find out you're plotting something.

107
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:55,294
I'll do whatever I can to...

108
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,455
Don't be so pessimistic。

109
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:59,455
You, Li Yunzhi, and I won't die.

110
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:00,695
We'll live well.

111
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,295
This Song Chen is nothing special.

112
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:08,215
You should rest now.

113
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:14,175
To replace Wan Zhuo's person

114
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:15,495
right under his nose.

115
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:24,255
Could she be the female thief that night?

116
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,295
Possible.

117
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,015
First the assassination, then sneaked into the Wan house.

118
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:32,614
She does have some capabilities.

119
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:33,815
With her here.

120
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:35,575
Wan Zhuo's plan to place a spy here

121
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,975
is foiled.

122
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,854
Replacing Wan Zhuo's person

123
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:40,935
with her own.

124
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:46,975
But the timing is too convenient.

125
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:48,894
Could it be related to White Bird Society?

126
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:50,375
I'll investigate.

127
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:50,895
Wait.

128
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:53,895
I'll handle it.

129
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:01,094
Your Highness.

130
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:02,175
Your clean clothes are here.

131
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:04,055
Take this opportunity to check

132
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:06,255
if she has any connections with that society.

133
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,095
Help me change clothes.

134
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:29,054
Why not watch?

135
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:33,335
Such a good opportunity.

136
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:38,335
Shouldn't you make use of it?

137
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:42,455
Just like you did that day, right?
