1
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:22,054
All right, Your Highness.

2
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,415
Get out.

3
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:43,135
The scroll of the treasure map is in Song Chen's hand.

4
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:46,255
This is his route back to the house after the blessing.

5
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:48,255
This is where we set up camp.

6
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:49,855
If we catch him

7
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:52,055
then we can get what we want.

8
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:56,415
Even if the whole world

9
00:00:56,895 --> 00:00:58,455
we can get it too.

10
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:29,935
The Emperor is very ill.

11
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:31,455
The temple fair of Xi this year

12
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:33,054
calls His Highness to bless the country.

13
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:34,895
According to the tip.

14
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:37,215
The White Bird Society will try to
ambush the road back to the city.

15
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:38,055
and take His Highness.

16
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:39,015
just to find the treasure map.

17
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:40,455
At the temple fair,

18
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:43,134
you can take Song Chen after the prayer.

19
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:45,054
I'm going back the same way he came.

20
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:47,694
Let's just tell Your Highness to cancel the blessing.

21
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:50,655
No, this is Song Chen's chance to win people's hearts.

22
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:51,695
Don't worry about me.

23
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,614
She raised me up anyway.

24
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:55,455
And we still have some connections.

25
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,574
Yes.

26
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:02,655
Please don't let Yue know.

27
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:05,695
Wan Xingzhu's death has made her pained.

28
00:02:05,815 --> 00:02:06,935
I can't relieve her

29
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:09,535
and can't make her more worried.

30
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:29,975
How could it be you, Song Chen.

31
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,455
Your Highness has been summoned.

32
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:33,415
He drove me back in his car.

33
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:35,455
I doubt it.

34
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,735
Perhaps he did it intentionally

35
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:38,175
and instructed you to take the blame.

36
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:39,295
Nevertheless,

37
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:40,815
And I am prepared to.

38
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:41,935
And I have no grievances.

39
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:43,255
Individuals like him.

40
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:45,655
Regardless of your importance to him

41
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:47,335
depend on their leverage.

42
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:50,615
I would like to witness both the world and you.

43
00:02:50,815 --> 00:02:52,455
which path he would choose.

44
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,855
If I am arrested, please inform Ye Guangmao

45
00:03:04,855 --> 00:03:06,415
and let Ye fight with the chairman.

46
00:03:06,415 --> 00:03:08,134
Just let them fight.

47
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,415
You, Madam Flower.

48
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:14,135
You went behind my back and arrested Li Yunzhi

49
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:15,935
and you want to hide the treasure map.

50
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:18,015
No way.

51
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:19,295
Where are they?

52
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:20,895
They're in the fox's cave outside of town.

53
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,174
Let's go.

54
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:23,455
OK.

55
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:47,375
You must be disappointed.

56
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:49,855
You really are Song Yan's child.

57
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:53,935
He doesn't take any chances.

58
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:56,415
Not to mention dying to save you.

59
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:58,054
If that's what makes you happy.

60
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:00,654
You can feel that way.

61
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:02,015
What's the point of being tough

62
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:04,375
I was merely stating the facts.

63
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:07,535
Madam Flower, get out of here!

64
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:09,815
It's Ye Guangmao.

65
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:11,215
Open the door.

66
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:12,175
In Song Chen's eyes.

67
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:12,975
Open the door.

68
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:15,335
You're just tools of his power.

69
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:16,135
Madam Flower.

70
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,815
Choose between love and revenge.

71
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:23,654
I think you know what you're doing.

72
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:32,415
If you figure it out

73
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,855
then I'll kill Ye Guangmao.

74
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,095
Madam Flower, where are you hiding?

75
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:55,255
Get out!

76
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:31,455
Is your future more important

77
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:32,694
than the birth of your child.

78
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:35,415
If it doesn't give you two

79
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:36,735
a good future.

80
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:38,215
She was born

81
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:41,015
just to suffer.

82
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:44,055
Besides, it's a royal order.

83
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,335
For the future of the Ye family and my daughter

84
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:47,655
I have to go.

85
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:03,935
Let him stay with you both for me.

86
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:12,535
Ye Guangmao.

87
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,375
I know it now.

88
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:32,455
Why the first time I saw you

89
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:34,655
that I had a special feeling.

90
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:37,935
Because you killed so many of us, Li's.

91
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:40,815
And because I'm going to kill you today.

92
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,975
to tell me the whole truth about the Lee family.

93
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:47,375
I can tell you the truth.

94
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:50,614
But I have a request.

95
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:56,215
If I could just take a look at the birthmark on your back.

96
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:58,255
No.

97
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:17,895
Now.

98
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,495
We're even.

99
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:30,055
Ye Guangmao.

100
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,135
Guess what?

101
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,054
You will die at the hands of your own daughter.

102
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,455
What.

103
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,375
We're not even.

104
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,615
And you can't start over.

105
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:50,055
You just killed your own father with your own hands.

106
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:55,775
There's nothing I love more than
watching relatives kill each other.

107
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,015
What.

108
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:00,535
You hate me.

109
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:02,895
You might as well hate where you came from.

110
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:05,775
Ye Guangmao caused the Li family's extermination.

111
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:08,295
Why should he have a whole family

112
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:09,615
a beautiful wife

113
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,495
and a lovely kid.

114
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,455
He doesn't deserve it.

115
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,375
What?

116
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,375
I was the one

117
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,335
who secretly forged the exact birthmark.

118
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:37,255
Who are you?

119
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:38,455
What are you going to do?

120
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:43,655
Just remember, it's because of Ye Wan.

121
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,575
The Ye family owes the Li family.

122
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:48,655
Don't touch my baby.

123
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:50,535
Don't touch my baby.

124
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:14,135
Ye Guangmao's child has birthmarks.

125
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,575
But the miss's child did not.

126
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,694
Candles.

127
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:20,815
Right.

128
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:24,655
I made a birthmark on the lady's baby.

129
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:33,855
Ye Guangmao.

130
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,174
Your baby is mine.
