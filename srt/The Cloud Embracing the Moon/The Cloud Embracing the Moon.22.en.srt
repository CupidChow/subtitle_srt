1
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:27,573
Don't know if Your Highness can accept this suggestion.

2
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,093
Ministry of Revenue has also
entrusted me to report to Your Highness.

3
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,933
Your Highness's new policy is truly
beneficial to the country and the people.

4
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:35,733
Yes.

5
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:38,493
The floods in the north are flooding again.

6
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:41,532
Let's listen to Your Highness for some good strategies.

7
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:49,413
You finally arrived. This journey,

8
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:50,653
I'm exhausted.

9
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:33,253
The style of wedding attire

10
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,613
is naturally chosen by the bride herself.

11
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:36,573
Yes.

12
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:07,973
Take action.

13
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,572
Kill me.

14
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:11,092
Why would I kill you?

15
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:13,413
I worked so hard to save you.

16
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:18,853
Did Li Yunzhi tell you

17
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:22,253
that your mother asked me to take you away?

18
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,733
Actually, it's not.

19
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:27,052
Your mother hates herself.

20
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:28,532
She also hates you.

21
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:31,093
She's going to die with you.

22
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:32,333
It's me.

23
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:36,173
I save you.

24
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:37,453
What do you want to explain?

25
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:41,853
When people are confused,

26
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,813
they should think about their birth.

27
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,773
The moment I saved you

28
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,973
was the true beginning of your life.

29
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:51,253
Your birth

30
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:53,053
was accompanied by the downfall of the Li family

31
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:54,933
and the death of your mother.

32
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,733
Your more than twenty years of prosperity

33
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:59,373
were given by me,

34
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,493
not by the Ye families,

35
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:01,573
or Li families.

36
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:02,612
And this beginning itself

37
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:04,573
existed for revenge.

38
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,133
Do you want me to seek revenge?

39
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:13,093
You should have sought revenge.

40
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,853
You became Ye Guanglang's daughter

41
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:17,373
for revenge,

42
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:20,893
so you don't have to feel any guilt at all.

43
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,413
Yue's thing.

44
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:27,773
I want to personally deliver it over.

45
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,332
I'll be with you.

46
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:39,693
Yue.

47
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:42,413
Yue.

48
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:45,253
Yue.

49
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:13,573
Now the Ye family and Wan family have been eliminated.

50
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:18,013
Only the father and son of the
Song Yanxing and Li Yunzhi are left.

51
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,493
I can seek revenge.

52
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,612
But what does what happened back then have to do

53
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:24,693
with Song Chen and Li Yunzhi?

54
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,973
You two are really good sisters.

55
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,973
Even if what happened back then
has nothing to do with Song Chen,

56
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:31,253
what about what's happening now?

57
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:32,893
You don't just think that

58
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,173
you and Li Yunzhi can easily

59
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:37,293
defeat Wan Zhuo and Ye Guangmao, do you?

60
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:39,973
The death of Wan Xingzhu and Ye Guangmao.

61
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:43,693
Which one wasn't caused by Song Chen?

62
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:46,852
Besides, he Song Yanxing and Ye Guangmao

63
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:48,493
can execute the nine clans of the Li family.

64
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,813
Why should we forgive their descendants?

65
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:53,453
OK.

66
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:55,733
I obey you.

67
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,933
I lost my lover,

68
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,173
I lost my family.

69
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,773
They should also experience this feeling.

70
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,373
If only your mother could be like you, that would be great.

71
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,773
To prove your determination,

72
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:20,693
kill Li Yunzhi first.

73
00:06:21,613 --> 00:06:23,533
She trust you so much.

74
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,573
It must be easier to deal with than Song Chen.

75
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:29,893
OK.

76
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:33,213
Yunzhi.

77
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:55,453
I think this one is good.

78
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:57,693
Well, it's pretty good.

79
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:02,332
Yue.

80
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:07,973
Don't drink it. Go with me.

81
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:09,813
Go?

82
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:11,852
Where?

83
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:14,852
Go home.

84
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:17,013
Home?

85
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:21,493
Return to Ye's family?

86
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:24,253
or Wan's family?

87
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:29,253
Is a place without relatives still called home?

88
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:32,573
You have Song Chen now.

89
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:35,533
Of course you have a home to return to.

90
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:38,293
I have nothing.

91
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,253
Where can I go?

92
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:42,852
Yue!

93
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:46,053
We have been forced to go through twenty years.

94
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:49,733
No one can distinguish right from wrong.

95
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:51,692
Look ahead.

96
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:53,533
Think about your ideals.

97
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:54,453
Your aspirations.

98
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:57,173
That is your own life.

99
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:05,493
And I am also your family.

100
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:07,733
I will be with you together.

101
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:11,893
Yue.

102
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:23,773
Didn't you always want to learn that move?

103
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:27,172
Today I will teach you again.

104
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:30,612
You should take good care of it.
