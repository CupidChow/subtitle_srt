1
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,740
Let me go!

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,660
Get out!

3
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,380
Father, what did Lingyue do that you need to punish her for?

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,660
What did she do?

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,220
She colluded with outsiders to frame Family Wan. 
She deserves to die!

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,180
No! Lingyue wouldn't do that! I promise!

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,500
How do you promise?

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,460
Do you really know her?

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,660
Do you really think that she married to you

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,820
just because of an imperial edict?

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,380
She's here for Family Ye!

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,300
Hit her!

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,820
Even a woman knows to sacrifice for her family.

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,540
But you, as a man, only cares about love.

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,660
How could I

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,180
have a useless son like you!

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,220
Yes, you're right, father.

18
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,940
I'm willing to be punished.

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,020
Since you were born,

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,500
the first time that you volunteered to get punished is for a woman.

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,460
Woman, woman!

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,740
Don't you have other aspirations except for women?

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,740
Hit! Hit him to death!

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,620
No!

25
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,060
Stop it!

26
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,900
Please, stop it!

27
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,020
I'm begging you!

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,860
I’ll pay for what I have done.

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,379
Stop it!

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,820
Don't hit him!

31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,500
Please!

32
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,820
Shut up.

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,219
General.

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,379
Stop it.

35
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,380
Stop it.

36
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,740
Xingzhu.

37
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,860
Xingzhu.

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,900
Xingzhu.

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,580
Ouch! It hurts.

40
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,460
Gently.

41
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,059
Now you feel the pain.

42
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,900
Why didn't beg your father for mercy?

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,620
He is my father.

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,060
If he didn't take it out on me,

45
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,500
how could he spare you?

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,140
Besides,

47
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,820
I only groan with pain in front of the one who loves me.

48
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,779
Who loves you?

49
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,059
Sorry.

50
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,820
I don't know who loves me.

51
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,339
But I was really heartbroken.

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,900
Don't get too close with Li Yunzhi.

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,340
Or my dad wouldn't spare you even if he beats me to death.

54
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,580
You've been keeping an eye on me?

55
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,380
It's not like that.

56
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,460
I just want to protect you.

57
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,540
For real?

58
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,339
What?

59
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,140
Listen to it

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,700
and you'll know it's true.

61
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,300
If you really want to protect her,

62
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,579
then make her pregnant as soon as possible.

63
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,820
Or I'll choose another wife for you.

64
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,899
You're not well today. We've got plenty time in the future.

65
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,180
It's too bright.

66
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,340
When did you come?

67
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,779
Just now. Where's Ping?

68
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,220
I haven't seen her lately.

69
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,340
Her family arranged a marriage for her.

70
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,140
So she quitted and went back.

71
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,620
That's pathetic.

72
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,940
She's dead, in the hotel.

73
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,860
This is found from under her fingernails.

74
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,020
I've found your secret.

75
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,699
What secret?

76
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,580
They said you're a sick coward.

77
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,300
In fact, you're anything but like that.

78
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,180
Your Highness,

79
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,100
please be assured.

80
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,699
No one knows your secret anymore.

81
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,740
Be careful.

82
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,620
You protected me

83
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,940
so I'll protect you as much as I can.

84
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,220
Why is your star black?

85
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,580
Yeah.

86
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,780
My mom said that

87
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,980
someone will help me polish it in the future

88
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,060
and that I should wait for that person no matter what.

89
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,380
Here, take it. I'm your family from now on.

90
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,820
Yes!

91
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,300
It was you.

92
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,420
The star will shine after all.

93
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,540
Did you recognize me long before?

94
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,060
Don't risk yourself like that.

95
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,979
I protect you of my own accord.

96
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,300
I don't need you to repay.

97
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,739
Then what do you want?

98
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,420
Me?

99
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,740
It belonged to His Highness's mother.

100
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,420
It's His Highness favorite.

101
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,700
Your mother is Li Ya.

102
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,700
Does this Ya

103
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,940
mean something?

104
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,660
Nothing. Just the name of the craftsman.

105
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,379
Is Song Chen's mother my mother?

106
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,940
Is Song Chen

107
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,980
my brother?

108
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,580
You rarely turned to me. What happened?

109
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,660
Who is my father?

110
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,380
Is he the Emperor? Song Yanxing?

111
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,499
You want me to kill my father and brother!

112
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,540
Li Ya.

113
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,660
Mother.

114
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,460
I'm not your mother!

115
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,500
Over the past twenty years,

116
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,060
you've read this before sleep every night.

117
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,780
You never let me touch it.

118
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,220
Yan is the name of the Emperor.

119
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,580
This Ya

120
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,380
and the one on Song Chen's divination block

121
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,500
are clearly made by the same person!

122
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,180
I don't know how a mother

123
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,420
could pretend not recognizing her own daughter

124
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,140
and how she

125
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,020
could torture her daughter

126
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,980
just to turn her into a revenge machine!

127
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,900
How can you blame me!

128
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,180
Right, you're my mother.

129
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,499
Unless I could be like Nezha

130
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,900
who killed himself to pay back to parents,

131
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,820
I couldn't say no to you.

132
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,780
But I'll still defend Song Chen.

133
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,979
No matter it's about your revenge

134
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,260
or the hatred of Family Li,

135
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,180
he has nothing to do with all of this.

136
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,020
You love him, don't you?

137
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,379
Li Ya was betrayed by Song Yanxing

138
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
is her best friend Ye Wan.

139
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,220
Song Chen is their son

140
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,979
and your brother.

141
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,460
I know.

142
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,900
Exactly because he is my brother

143
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,140
and the only one who gave me warmth,

144
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,660
I don't want him to die.

145
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,619
I can spare him.

146
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,300
But you have to kill Wan Zhuo.

147
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,380
I hope you keep your words.

148
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,619
I remind you again

149
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,859
that don't take any chances.

150
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,300
You and Song Chen

151
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,380
can never be together.

152
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,300
Because the men of Family Song

153
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,500
don't deserve love.
