1
00:00:13,418 --> 00:00:15,177
I am merciful.

2
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:20,858
Out of these two cups, only one is poisoned wine.

3
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:30,538
Do you think Song Chen will come?

4
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:33,938
One person came to die.

5
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:37,698
I have never seen such sincerity

6
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,937
in my decades of life.

7
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:42,177
The deal we agreed upon.

8
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:43,978
If you poison us,

9
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,938
what will you exlain to Song Chen?

10
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:47,058
What explanation do I need?

11
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:49,578
I didn't say to trade him with living person.

12
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,178
Then we can also choose not to drink.

13
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:57,058
Not drinking?

14
00:00:57,818 --> 00:00:59,458
Then I'll help you drink.

15
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:01,618
Stop it!

16
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:04,058
We'll play.

17
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:08,058
Don't be afraid.

18
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:11,778
This poison won't make you die immediately.

19
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,458
I still want to appreciate

20
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,978
the feeling of waiting for death that you all have.

21
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:21,818
Yunzhi.

22
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:24,458
You shouldn't have missed the opportunity

23
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:26,898
to kill the The lord of society just to save me.

24
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,457
You should shoot along with me and The lord of society.

25
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:33,618
This is the choice of the strong.

26
00:01:34,258 --> 00:01:36,618
Yue. But I don't think

27
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,498
only the strong should live.

28
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:43,018
More kind people should be allowed to live.

29
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,138
Yue.

30
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,457
The trick you taught me.

31
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:50,098
Guess if I have learned it?

32
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:52,098
If you guess right,

33
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:53,458
I'll drink.

34
00:01:54,018 --> 00:01:56,738
If you guess wrong, you'll drink.

35
00:01:57,898 --> 00:01:58,697
I don't guess.

36
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:02,378
I haven't learned it yet.

37
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:07,538
Can you teach me again?

38
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:27,018
Yunzhi!

39
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:35,858
Yunzhi!

40
00:02:47,698 --> 00:02:49,338
How amazing do you think you are?

41
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,778
Sisters love each other deeply?

42
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,858
That's because you haven't fallen in love with the same man!

43
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,378
Why?

44
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,178
Why doesn't Miss

45
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:06,698
have such good luck?

46
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:22,578
Yue.

47
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:26,378
Your hands are so warm.

48
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:29,938
Why are your hands so cold?

49
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,778
I'll warm you.

50
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:33,818
I'll warm you.

51
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:42,898
I hope to see him,

52
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:46,018
but I am also afraid that he will come.

53
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:48,378
Do you think

54
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:51,018
I am stupid?

55
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:00,938
Yun. This...

56
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,258
Kneel down.

57
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:12,898
I let you kneel down.

58
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,538
You born nobles

59
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:32,258
should also experience the life of us lower class.

60
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,418
The days of kneeling down to make a living.

61
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:36,057
We have been living from birth.

62
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:37,617
You people

63
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:39,298
who hold the power of life and death over others,

64
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:42,258
kneeling down is no different from ordinary people.

65
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:45,898
Where is the treasure map?

66
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:56,218
Open it.

67
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:04,178
Throw it over.

68
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:13,018
Then you are useless people.

69
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:18,098
I never keep useless people.

70
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:19,697
Wait.

71
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,978
What trick do you want to play?

72
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:24,217
I am thinking,

73
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:26,378
according to Li Ya's temperament,

74
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:29,098
if she choose to die with all her heart,

75
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:32,898
why would she still keep this thing?

76
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:36,137
Give me. Give me!

77
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,738
So the volume two is here.

78
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:56,858
Yunzhi.

79
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:03,338
Don't act rashly.

80
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:06,458
She drank my poisoned wine.

81
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:08,978
Only I have the antidote.

82
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:15,738
Yunzhi!

83
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:16,698
Yunzhi!

84
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:20,658
Where is the antidote?

85
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:23,858
Where's this?

86
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:26,498
Where's this?!

87
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:30,498
Why are you laughing?

88
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:36,258
I laugh at you for using bamboo
baskets to fetch water, but it's all in vain.

89
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,458
There's no treasure map at all.

90
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,738
It's just a mirror of the Geomantic map of the capital city.

91
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:42,978
Impossible.

92
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:46,058
Impossible. Impossible!

93
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:49,658
Where's this?! Tell me.

94
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:52,698
Where's this? Where's this?

95
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:20,658
Li's family.

96
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:25,538
Because it brought about the disaster of genocide.

97
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:32,738
And I pursued fame and fortune
for half my life because of it.

98
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:35,698
In the end, it's nothing.

99
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:41,058
Joke.

100
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:43,177
What a huge joke.

101
00:07:43,178 --> 00:07:44,738
I'll ask you one last time.

102
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:47,178
Where is the antidote?

103
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:52,098
There is no antidote.

104
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:55,698
Where is the antidote?

105
00:07:56,378 --> 00:07:57,698
There is no antidote.

106
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:17,138
Yunzhi.

107
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:19,178
Go.

108
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:23,298
Let's go back and find the imperial physician.

109
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,858
Kill Song Chen,

110
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:28,738
I will

111
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:32,098
achieve

112
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:34,178
achieve my wish.

113
00:08:42,218 --> 00:08:43,018
Yunzhi!

114
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:45,018
Yunzhi!

115
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:59,818
Let's go home.

116
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:02,498
OK.

117
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:04,458
Let's go home.

118
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:12,858
What did you just say?

119
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:13,738
Say it one more time!

120
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:16,298
Say it one more time!

121
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:18,978
The poison of poisonous wine can be detoxified.

122
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:20,777
The dart injury is not a big deal.

123
00:09:21,138 --> 00:09:24,978
The deadly thing is that the poison on the dart

124
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:27,018
is incurable.

125
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:29,178
Your Highness.

126
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:31,898
She is experiencing rapid heart failure.

127
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:34,577
You should go and accompany her.

128
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,538
Why aren't you looking at me?

129
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:56,898
What did the imperial physician say?

130
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:04,058
The imperial physician said you will recover soon.

131
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:11,577
Then don't worry too much.

132
00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:15,618
OK.

133
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:47,858
Time has passed so quickly before.

134
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:53,657
Look.

135
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:56,538
Your hair has turned white.

136
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,577
Now

137
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:03,177
we'll already be gray headed.

138
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:15,658
The sunshine is so beautiful.

139
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:40,978
When you're healed,

140
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:48,698
When you're healed,

141
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:50,818
let's go to the flower sea we visited when we were children.

142
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:52,978
See it from the sunrise to sunset, okay?

143
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:57,498
OK.

144
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,458
Let's get married.

145
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:07,378
OK.

146
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:15,018
OK. Let's get married.

147
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:49,338
After combing my hair,

148
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:52,698
I am your family member.

149
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:13,098
Yunzhi!

150
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:18,698
Yunzhi!

151
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:21,697
Yunzhi!

152
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:26,298
Yunzhi!

153
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,298
Yunzhi!

154
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:32,258
Yunzhi! Yunzhi!

155
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:48,818
Yunzhi!

156
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:53,818
The stars

157
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:56,218
have turned red.

158
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:13,458
I will

159
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:17,338
become a star in the sky

160
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,978
and look at you.

161
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:38,978
Yunzhi.

162
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:40,898
Yunzhi.

163
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:19,978
Come on. Come on. Come on.

164
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,898
I'll perform a trick for everyone.

165
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:24,658
Mom.

166
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,978
Didn't you teach me tricks?

167
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,418
Then you need to look it carefully.

168
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:34,298
Like this.

169
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:36,378
Then this.

170
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:38,938
OK.

171
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:43,418
Have you learned it? Yes.

172
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:59,938
Good. Good. Good. Good.

173
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:07,738
Good.

174
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:18,097
Did the stars get scared away by the fireworks?

175
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:19,018
I can't see them.

176
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:21,338
No. The stars have always been there.

177
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:22,778
It will always light up.

178
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:25,378
Fireworks are so beautiful.

179
00:16:25,378 --> 00:16:26,898
Let's go. Let's go watch the fireworks.

180
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:28,978
Go.

181
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:45,858
Peng. Pa.

182
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:50,898
Pa.

183
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:56,577
Pa.

184
00:16:56,978 --> 00:16:57,938
Peng. Pa.

185
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:13,378
Peng.

186
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:20,418
Pa.
