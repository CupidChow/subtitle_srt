1
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:24,211
What nonsense.

2
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,051
I'll go save Li Yunzhi. Yunwei.

3
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,211
Quick, go to the Flower House.

4
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:30,771
To spread the news that the lower part

5
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:32,490
of the treasure map is still at the Li Family.

6
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:33,490
Yes.

7
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:35,731
It's been a long time since you last came.

8
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:37,251
We should have a good time.

9
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:38,531
Please come inside.

10
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,251
Sir, please go in and rest.

11
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:51,171
I'm not drunk! Get me more!

12
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:53,091
The lower part of the treasure map is at the Li house.

13
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:54,411
Notify the chief. Yes.

14
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:59,090
You truly can drink.

15
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,251
Another cup.

16
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:12,131
Yue.

17
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:15,971
Watch out.

18
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,810
I stole the list.

19
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:27,011
Why are you capturing her?

20
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:30,011
She was supposed to be here, wasn't she?

21
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,010
She should come in the same way

22
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,171
as she had managed to get out.

23
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:43,291
Li Ya. Li Yunzhi.

24
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:47,691
I should have thought of that.

25
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:49,971
The Li family.

26
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:52,811
Unexpected, right?

27
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,251
The honorable Infanta Lingyue

28
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:57,210
doesn't even know such important information.

29
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:02,491
Li Yunzhi.

30
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:05,131
You are here for revenge, right?

31
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:08,411
Even infiltrating Song Chen's side.

32
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:11,411
It's all for revenge on the Song family, right?

33
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:13,611
What do you think His Highness

34
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:15,211
will think is he knows

35
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:17,331
your identity?

36
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:18,811
If you are to be executed,

37
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:21,531
It would be more fitting for him to do it.

38
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,171
And it would be more interesting.

39
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,091
Yes.

40
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:27,891
I'm here for revenge against you.

41
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:31,451
Ye Lingyue was also deceived by me.

42
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,171
She was deceived by you.

43
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,491
She brought it upon herself.

44
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:42,131
Reap what she sowed.

45
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,451
She wanted to use you.

46
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:48,891
But she ended up being used by you.

47
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:51,931
I know very well why

48
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,731
she came to my Wan family.

49
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:55,491
Let her go.

50
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:58,771
Let her go? Are you speaking for her?

51
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:06,971
Do you think the Ye family

52
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,451
was not related to the extermination of the Li family?

53
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:14,251
Do you think your Ye family

54
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:17,371
had nothing to do with that?

55
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:22,251
Ye Guangmao, you're so good at pretending innocent.

56
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:25,371
I don't want to waste words with you.

57
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:27,651
Li Yunzhi.

58
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:30,451
What is your relationship with the White Bird Society?

59
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:32,691
As a descendant of the Li family,

60
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:35,651
Do you have the lower part of the map?

61
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:40,451
I know nothing about what you said.

62
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,491
Don't waste my patience.

63
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,011
I, Wan Zhuo, while on the battlefield,

64
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:48,811
have forced countless spies to talk.

65
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:50,930
Qin Zhong.

66
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:51,611
Yes.

67
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:56,171
Father.

68
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,131
The pain of being involuntary

69
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,291
you know that best.

70
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:00,571
Please understand me.

71
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:16,011
Please understand me.

72
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:33,171
Dig.

73
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:36,531
Keep digging. Yes.

74
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:52,851
Open it.

75
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:56,971
Looks... Looks like dog poop.

76
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:00,211
Useless thing.

77
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:01,651
Dare to tell me fake news.

78
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:04,251
Wasted my time.

79
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,811
Tell Wan Zhuo.

80
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,291
I've got the lower part of the map.

81
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,611
Let him bring the upper part to change.

82
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:11,051
Yes.

83
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:12,371
Stop hitting.

84
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:13,611
Yunzhi,

85
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:15,731
just tell him where is the map.

86
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,851
Please.

87
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,450
I don't know.

88
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:21,011
Yunzhi.

89
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:23,491
You're truly stubborn.

90
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,851
You two are so close.

91
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:27,411
Since beating you is useless,

92
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,211
I'll beat her.

93
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,091
She is your daughter-in-law!

94
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:34,690
So?  That means nothing.

95
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,450
Plenty of women want to marry

96
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,051
into our Wan family.

97
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:45,611
Don’t come closer.

98
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:51,211
I'll tell.

99
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:56,811
Come closer.

100
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:01,171
Close.

101
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,451
Stop.

102
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,291
Your Highness.

103
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:39,091
General Wan. The imperial decree is here.

104
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,451
Crown Princess.

105
00:07:21,971 --> 00:07:23,691
What about the imperial decree?

106
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,491
It only temporarily spares her life.

107
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:29,691
Your Highness, you might not know.

108
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,931
Li Yunzhi is one of the Li family.

109
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:34,570
I'm dealing with the remnants of criminals.

110
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:36,611
Even the Emperor can't punish me for this.

111
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:38,250
But if Father knows you missed the chance to

112
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,691
eradicate the White Bird Society,

113
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:41,771
just because of your own motives.

114
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:44,971
It won’t be a simple punishment.

115
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:47,091
What do you mean, Your Highness?

116
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:50,331
According to the informant,

117
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,291
the chief led people to the Li house

118
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,051
and found the lower part of the map.

119
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,851
I take my leave.

120
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:14,131
Yunzhi.

121
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:25,251
Yunzhi.

122
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:27,531
Yunwei.

123
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:29,491
Send Infanta back.

124
00:08:58,251 --> 00:08:59,051
Get on.

125
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:01,490
I can manage on my own.

126
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:04,651
Be good.

127
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,211
Get on.

128
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:13,730
Let’s go.

129
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:16,571
Let's go home.

130
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,211
Your forehead wound...

131
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:26,970
Nothing, just a small injury.

132
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:29,811
Are you tired?

133
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:32,051
No.

134
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,371
You need to eat more.

135
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:36,291
Or my strength won't show.

136
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:45,091
Since I met you,

137
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,211
you have been so reckless with your life.

138
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:49,851
If you don’t cherish your life, I will.

139
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:53,691
If you weren’t injured,

140
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:57,091
I do want to carry you out of the capital.

141
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,291
Like we did when we were kids.

142
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:04,331
To see the flower sea, sunrise and sunset.
