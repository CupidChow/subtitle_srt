1
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,610
Chase! Hurry!

2
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,290
Catch up!

3
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,089
Hurry.

4
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,530
Hurry, move.

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,930
Chase.

6
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,570
Your Highness. It's time.

7
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,250
Okay.

8
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:16,090
The wedding ceremony begins now.

9
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,370
First bow to heaven and earth.

10
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,930
Second bow to the elders.

11
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,450
Bow to each other.

12
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,730
Wan Xingzhu.

13
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,170
That's the Showgirl from the The Flower House.

14
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,010
Young Master must be there for her.

15
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,610
Wan Xingzhu, didn’t you say you’d marry me?

16
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,090
Princess Lingyue, I've heard of your talent and ambition.

17
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,530
How come you've turned yourself into a tool for power.

18
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,050
Spending your rest life with this useless man?

19
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,650
I was ignorant before,

20
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,090
but we never had inappropriate actions.

21
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,610
Why cause such a scene?

22
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,610
So that's what you used to describe yourself.

23
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,170
As the ancients said,

24
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,290
When one hears of betrayal.

25
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,889
Burn it all.

26
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,929
Burn it, and scatter its ashes to the wind.

27
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,329
Today.

28
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,530
I’ll scatter your ashes.

29
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,810
Xingzhu!

30
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,730
Targeting me?

31
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,850
Hey. What are you doing?

32
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,330
Don’t hurt Yue'er, let her go!

33
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,450
Move aside!

34
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,250
Move!

35
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,010
Wh...

36
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,090
Father, Lingyue was...

37
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,530
Search the whole city! Capture her!

38
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,290
Yes.

39
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,650
Sorry for disturbing you, Your Highness.

40
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,130
Keep moving. Don't stop.

41
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,410
You captured me all this way,

42
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,770
but didn’t kill me.

43
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,730
What do you want?

44
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,050
What are you plotting?

45
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,930
You came to kill Wan Zhuo.

46
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,050
You're not just an ordinary showgirl.

47
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,330
Who are you?

48
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,010
Tell me!

49
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,889
Who are you?

50
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,850
I am...

51
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,330
Li Yunzhi.

52
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,770
You're Li Yunzhi. What do you want?

53
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,010
I want...

54
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,129
The drug didn't work. Got to find another way.

55
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,330
Please.

56
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,050
Let me go.

57
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,890
Why go back?

58
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,889
To continue being a political pawn?

59
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,010
I'm willing to.

60
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,370
That's not a sacrifice.

61
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,370
If your family’s lives

62
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,770
were constantly threatened,

63
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,890
what would you do?

64
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,570
Don’t you have family?

65
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,570
f you don’t let me go back,

66
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,170
I'll die here.

67
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,530
Go.

68
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:45,210
She’s here!

69
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,090
Have you searched over there?

70
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,690
Not yet.

71
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,410
Go.

72
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,370
Someone's over there.

73
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,329
Go check quickly.

74
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,090
Yes.

75
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,290
Don’t you have family?

76
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,850
I’m not going home.

77
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,610
I have no home, no family.

78
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,170
From now on, I’m your family.

79
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,490
Family, where are you?

80
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,730
Are you okay?

81
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,090
Where is my starry handkerchief?

82
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,050
Search there with me. Yes.

83
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,770
Come. This way.

84
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,290
General, that woman

85
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,050
just ran this way.

86
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,650
Help!

87
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,730
Search carefully, don’t miss anyone.

88
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,690
Come, this way.

89
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,410
Everyone, search carefully.
