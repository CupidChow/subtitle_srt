1
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:52,101
As the lord of society,

2
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:54,301
but you dare not show your true face to others.

3
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,181
People are not the protagonists,

4
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,661
things are.

5
00:00:58,501 --> 00:00:59,861
We both let go,

6
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:00,901
and open at the same time

7
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,461
to show sincerity.

8
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,061
You speak quite straightforwardly,

9
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:36,861
but unfortunately you are not honest in your actions.

10
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:41,701
What's going on?

11
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:42,981
Where are my people?

12
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,301
Throwing a bowl is useless.

13
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:48,701
Don't wait, there's no one left.

14
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:51,981
All the people you brought

15
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:54,661
have already been killed by me.

16
00:01:59,181 --> 00:01:59,980
Tell me.

17
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:02,261
Where is the Treasure Map?

18
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:04,901
Hand it over and I'll spare your life.

19
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,061
This place is so lively.

20
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:21,941
Your Highness.

21
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,101
Your Highness, your arrival is just in time.

22
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:39,381
I have designed to catch the lord of society of the White Bird Society

23
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,381
But how did I receive the report that

24
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:47,301
General Wan, you are conspiring withthe White Bird Society to rebel?

25
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,261
How is this possible?

26
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:51,300
This is a letter from Wan Zhuo to me,

27
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,701
It was written by him personally.

28
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:54,980
This is the proof that he wants to cooperate with us to collect the treasure map,

29
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:56,301
find treasures,

30
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,980
and share the world.

31
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:00,821
Nonsense! I haven't written it before!

32
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:01,901
This is a forgery!

33
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,101
Is this Wan Zhuo's handwriting?

34
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,461
Your Highness can tell at a glance.

35
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:21,060
Capture them all!

36
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,701
She can't run far. Chase.

37
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:53,461
So both of you want to use empty hands to trap a white wolf.

38
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,981
Why does General Wan's face look so bad?

39
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,981
The so-called treasure map, Volume 2.

40
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:02,621
It was supposed to be false news released

41
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:04,421
to make you compete with the White Bird Society

42
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:06,540
and fight against each other.

43
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:13,221
General Wan. The evidence of rebellion is conclusive. Please.

44
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:17,060
Your Highness has so falsely accused me.

45
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:20,781
I'm afraid the courtiers won't agree either.

46
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,901
Then please ask General Wan

47
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,701
to go to the prison and ask them in person.

48
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:32,020
Zhong.

49
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,741
Where is the general? Where am I?

50
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:36,501
You have to protect Xingzhu for me.

51
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:38,780
Childe has his own path.

52
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:42,501
But Zhong's path is to follow the general's path.

53
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:45,741
I'll lead the general out!

54
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:47,821
Zhong!

55
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:07,181
Song Chen.

56
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,381
You put in a lot of effort to hide.

57
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:12,101
I used to underestimate you.

58
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,580
I didn't expect cousin Lingyue

59
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:38,781
to be so skilled at imitating handwriting.

60
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,220
She can write such a long letter

61
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,901
that could be mistaken for real.

62
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:46,261
If it weren't for the special markings

63
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:47,661
on her official roster at that time,

64
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:49,101
I wouldn't have been able to distinguish it.

65
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:16,221
The letter to the White Bird Society was not written by me.

66
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:21,181
I know you didn't marry into Wan family

67
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:23,381
willingly.

68
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,101
I also know that you always come to father's study

69
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:29,421
with ulterior motives.

70
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:32,381
I just didn't expect.

71
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:33,941
You would use this method.

72
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:36,101
Father is right.

73
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:38,581
I am too naive.

74
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,541
Even if he has no intention of rebellion,

75
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,141
as long as you are willing,

76
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:48,181
he must have it.

77
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:51,061
It wasn't me!

78
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:51,781
Not you?

79
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:56,301
It's Li Yunzhi?

80
00:06:58,021 --> 00:06:59,221
Or The White Bird Society?

81
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:03,381
It doesn't matter anymore.

82
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:06,141
Anyway,for Wan family,

83
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:08,861
the ending is the same.

84
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,701
I know,

85
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,061
no matter what I say now.

86
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:17,260
You won't believe me.

87
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:21,021
It's no longer important.

88
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,581
Because I will tell Song Chen.

89
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,581
That letter was written by me.

90
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,261
What do you mean?

91
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:42,061
If my father died,

92
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:45,301
at your hands.

93
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:48,621
Even if I love you,

94
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:49,821
I cannot face you,

95
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:52,461
let alone continue to love you.

96
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,220
It will only be like a thorn,

97
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:59,740
deeply inserted into my heart,

98
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:01,980
never able to be pulled out.

99
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,261
It's better for me to die than

100
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,301
to live like this.

101
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:13,901
No matter what,

102
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,260
my father will always be my father.

103
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:19,621
So I will tell Song Chen that

104
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:21,261
the letter was written by me.

105
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:24,301
I have always been the one with the intention of rebellion.

106
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,861
Father just wanted to catch the lord of society.

107
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:30,501
You want to take the blame for Wan Zhuo.

108
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:31,461
I disagree!

109
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:44,780
Why don't you agree?

110
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:49,901
Baby.

111
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:52,021
Sorry.

112
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:55,221
You didn't come at the right time.
