1
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:58,345
You're indeed like her.

2
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:00,104
Like who?

3
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:04,425
Li Ya.

4
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:07,305
You've met my mother?

5
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:11,104
Yes,

6
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:13,465
she's elegant.

7
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:17,705
Is my mother

8
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:20,985
still alive?

9
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:26,624
I've always wished
I could have a mother since I was little,

10
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:28,905
and I've took my benefactor as my mother,

11
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:31,104
but why at this moment,

12
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:34,745
I'd rather hope Wan Zhuo told me that

13
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:35,945
my mother has already dead.

14
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:40,144
She should be dead now.

15
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:44,305
What are you doing here?

16
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:48,185
Wan Zhuo,

17
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:49,425
tell me,

18
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:52,185
is it you give me an explanation

19
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:54,265
or is it Wan family?

20
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,185
Can you decide that?

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,345
I'll do my best.

22
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:15,505
Is it you

23
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:19,065
who suggest to take down all of the Li family?

24
00:02:25,065 --> 00:02:26,585
Maybe for you,

25
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:29,705
it's just something you could easily done,

26
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:31,905
but for me,

27
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,665
this hatred has taken up most of my life.

28
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:44,825
You're still young,

29
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:48,505
you still have the time to have your own life,

30
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:49,985
in the meantime,

31
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:52,745
I hope that you will keep your words,

32
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:56,185
and let Xingzhu

33
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:58,345
to have the life he wants.

34
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:03,985
Lastly,

35
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,505
I have a request,

36
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:12,265
can I borrow your sword?

37
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,825
Me, Wan Zhuo, the guilty minister,

38
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:44,385
will now go die to confess my sins.

39
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:02,105
I have to take this revenge,

40
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:03,985
but now when I've done it,

41
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:06,945
it's not happy as I thought it would be.

42
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:13,705
You have a grandson.

43
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:38,665
Dad,

44
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:40,185
dad,

45
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:43,425
dad,

46
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:48,745
dad,

47
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:51,745
I'm here, dad.

48
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:54,465
Doctor,

49
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:57,945
please,

50
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:00,505
I'm begging you,

51
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:04,185
save him.

52
00:05:22,785 --> 00:05:24,144
What did you just say?

53
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:28,185
I say, your highness,

54
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:30,384
please let Wan Xingzhu go.

55
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:34,745
Why is Wan Xingzhu so lucky?

56
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:41,105
Why was there no one ever begged for my brothers

57
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:43,145
when they were about to die?

58
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,545
I seem to be kinda lucky among them,

59
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:49,265
have been assassinated several times,

60
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,864
and still be alive till this day.

61
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,145
God bless me.

62
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:58,665
Do you think I need to take another divination

63
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,864
to see whether I should release this guilty minister's son?

64
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:08,025
Your highness,

65
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,545
your highness.

66
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:15,105
Why don't you

67
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:17,544
do it?

68
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:57,465
You have always despised it the most, haven't you, my cousin?

69
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:06,705
Your highness,

70
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:09,305
I've never been involved in

71
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,105
what Wan Zhuo has done.

72
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,345
And you know it very well, your highness,

73
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,865
that Xingzhu has always been very loyal to Song family.

74
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,545
and he never has any ambitious towards power.

75
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:24,745
I beg you, your highness,

76
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,945
please forgive him.

77
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:33,145
Get up.

78
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:50,945
Your royal brother Song Zhen intended to kill his father
and conspire against the emperor,

79
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:54,305
I have to follow my order and kill him.

80
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:09,825
I remember it was you who taught me that,

81
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,225
if you're going to get rid off the evil,

82
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,144
you have to kill them all.

83
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:17,104
If I don't kill Wan Xingzhu now,

84
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:20,865
what if someday he chase after me
to take revenge for his father?

85
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:23,785
But if you do this,

86
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:26,305
what's the difference between you
and the people who killed all of Li family?

87
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,185
Your highness,

88
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:36,465
Yue.

89
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:43,625
You should go back.

90
00:08:57,065 --> 00:08:57,945
I'll take the divination.

91
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:16,785
Yunzhi,

92
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,225
Li Yunzhi.

93
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:42,585
I beg you, let Wan Xingzhu go.

94
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:45,105
Wan Zhuo is already dead now,

95
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:48,265
with him as a forewarning,

96
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:52,504
anyone who's ambidextrous will keep their head down.

97
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,225
If one day, you have to choose one

98
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,225
between me and Ye Lingyue,

99
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:08,825
who would you choose?

100
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:20,505
I don't like the way you are now at all.

101
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:25,065
I'll choose who's right.

102
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:34,265
I need to have a reason to let him go.

103
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:38,345
Wan Zhuo private the treasure map,
he has the ambitious that he shouldn't have.

104
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:43,265
Then he should show me his loyalty.

105
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:51,585
Okay,

106
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:54,185
okay.

107
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:01,345
Is the memorial done written?

108
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:03,865
Almost done.

109
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:06,945
Should I mention the treasure map?

110
00:11:06,945 --> 00:11:08,745
Song Yanxing wouldn't be able to sleep at night even more

111
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,105
if you do that.

112
00:11:29,905 --> 00:11:30,705
How's it going?

113
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:32,665
Did Song Chen promise to release Xingzhu?

114
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:34,305
Yes he did.

115
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:36,225
It's just that,

116
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,785
you need to give him the treasure map.

117
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,305
Song Chen,

118
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:45,984
he hides very deep,

119
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:48,865
but it's good,

120
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:50,945
only by this,

121
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:52,905
his Song family can really own the world.

122
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:57,545
Xing Zhu gave me the treasure map

123
00:11:57,865 --> 00:11:59,225
before he left.

124
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:05,945
Yunzhi, I don't trust Song Chen,

125
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:07,345
but I trust you.

126
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:10,345
You have to bring Xingzhu back.

127
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:12,225
Okay.
