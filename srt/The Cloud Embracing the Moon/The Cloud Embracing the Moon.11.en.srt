1
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:16,332
The next one in danger

2
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:17,892
is Ding Chaozhong, right?

3
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:24,052
I'd like to see

4
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:25,332
who's hiding in the dark.

5
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:42,052
Who's there!

6
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:42,852
Stop!

7
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:44,812
Yun Wei!

8
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:49,532
Oh no, he was lured out.

9
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:50,452
Censor Ding.

10
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:42,692
Be quiet. He's in danger.

11
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,012
It's The White Bird Society.

12
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:08,732
You finally woke up.

13
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,012
I'm fine.

14
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:17,572
Your Highness, please leave.

15
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:22,252
No.

16
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:24,572
I'll be here with you.

17
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:27,292
Your Highness.

18
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:30,012
I'm just a female official.

19
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:31,812
We have different statuses.

20
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:35,932
Your Highness, please go.

21
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:07,052
I could have reached out and touched him.

22
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:10,092
But I can't.

23
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:14,572
No!

24
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:18,252
Old man.

25
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,092
You can't do it as well.

26
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:01,932
Your Highness.

27
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:04,132
The death of these officials on the list

28
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,092
has caused panic.

29
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,292
Should we try to ease the public?

30
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:34,292
No matter how many times you throw it,

31
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:36,292
the result would remain the same.

32
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:38,092
Give it to me.

33
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:40,332
Give it to me!

34
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:44,731
I don't believe it.

35
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:48,812
Heaven has sent her to me for many times.

36
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:56,972
Heaven just like to tease people.

37
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,372
One more time.

38
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:04,652
I'll try one more time.

39
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:25,772
No!

40
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:27,652
No!

41
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:37,211
Yun Wei.

42
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:40,372
You know what,

43
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:46,491
she tried to protect me so hard.

44
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,172
The moment when she fell into my arms,

45
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:56,692
the only thought occurred to me was that

46
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:01,052
I don't want anything,

47
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:06,692
anything!

48
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:09,692
As long as she's alright,

49
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:16,652
I really can give up everything.

50
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:31,971
Why are you always here with me?

51
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:34,172
I'm your husband.

52
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:35,572
Who else could I be with?

53
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:37,692
Instead of keeping an eye on me,

54
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:39,132
you'd better persuade your father.

55
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:40,972
As long as he can give up,

56
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,452
maybe I can beg mercy for him

57
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:44,452
and spare him.

58
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:45,812
OK.

59
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,771
Why are you still following me?

60
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,211
Just going the same way.

61
00:07:54,652 --> 00:07:55,852
I'm going to get dressed.

62
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:57,852
I.

63
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:08,491
Does it look good on me?

64
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:10,412
Yes.

65
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:13,532
Not at all.

66
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,092
We'll take it. Keep the change.

67
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:24,612
That's pretty.

68
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,092
Can you stop

69
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:28,292
following me?

70
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:29,892
I just happened to go the same way with you.

71
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,412
I'll go back to my home.

72
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:33,212
OK, I'll go with you.

73
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:36,932
My father doesn't want to see you.

74
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:39,091
I'll wait outside the door.

75
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:48,212
Yue.

76
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:51,812
I'm here waiting for you.

77
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:04,892
I heard that

78
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,292
you've been hanging out with Wan Xingzhu for days.

79
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:12,692
The progress is slow.

80
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,412
Maybe it's like others said

81
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:18,812
that no matter how strong you are,

82
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:21,252
you also have weaknesses of women.

83
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:22,692
You're stuck with

84
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:24,412
love.

85
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,052
No, I won't.

86
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:29,372
Go on lying to me.

87
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,492
But you can't lie to your heart.

88
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:32,972
Just ask yourself

89
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:36,252
if you have to kill Wan Xingzhu now,

90
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:37,372
can you do that?

91
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:39,972
Father.

92
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:42,692
To take down Wan Zhuo,

93
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:44,052
we don't need to kill them all.

94
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:45,892
Naive! If we spare them,

95
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:46,972
they'll become hidden hazards.

96
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:48,452
Aren't you afraid that Wan Xingzhu will

97
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:49,611
come back to take revenge on our family!

98
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:58,292
Actually, that's not the biggest concern.

99
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:00,292
What matters is that

100
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:02,612
if he really wants to

101
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:03,772
rebel against Family Song,

102
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:07,452
he would bring disaster to all the people.

103
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,372
Since our family came down,

104
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:19,772
you've been the only adult who is brave and astute

105
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:21,892
and could be counted on.

106
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:25,012
You can't let me down, daughter.

107
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:28,452
Father,

108
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:30,892
I won't let you down.

109
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:36,211
In front of your mother and ancestors,

110
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:37,172
say that again.

111
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:42,692
Mother,

112
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,612
I won't let you and father down.

113
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:50,972
Daughter,

114
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:52,852
you probably don't know that

115
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:56,412
the list you took was false.

116
00:10:57,172 --> 00:10:58,812
You fell into Wan Zhuo's trap.

117
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:02,132
Li Yunzhi was also badly hurt because of it.
