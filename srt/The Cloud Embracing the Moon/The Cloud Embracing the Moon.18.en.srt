1
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:29,422
You such a poor man

2
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:30,862
I hear that you are very capable

3
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:32,462
But you still got beat by a woman

4
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:33,782
You're right

5
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:35,342
You didn't just hurt your Dad

6
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:37,102
And you lost your wife

7
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:39,022
Poor

8
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:43,782
What smell?

9
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:46,782
I think I smelled it in the flower house before

10
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:09,101
You already got the treasure map

11
00:02:09,942 --> 00:02:11,582
Let me have a look

12
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:12,982
What's the hurry?

13
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:16,302
You can read it when I get the second half

14
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:18,461
It's no use looking at it now

15
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:20,662
It's just a paper

16
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:24,941
What?

17
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:27,581
You don't trust me

18
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:30,182
You are still guarding me

19
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:31,981
Didn't I promise you

20
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:34,782
I would share the world with you

21
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:41,422
About the second half

22
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:43,582
How can you get it

23
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:46,662
Since Li Yunzhi is Li Ya's daughter

24
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:48,902
We can start with her

25
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:50,902
I hope you're satisfied

26
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:57,622
How could be her

27
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:19,182
When we have a baby

28
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:24,102
One for Wang, one for him, right?

29
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:45,262
And how are you going to get the second half

30
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:47,782
Since Li Yunzhi is Li Ya's daughter

31
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,502
We can start with her

32
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,142
It's me

33
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:06,022
Come in

34
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:21,582
What are you doing here

35
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:22,142
If my dad know it

36
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:23,142
You must be dead

37
00:04:24,582 --> 00:04:26,742
Yue. We have a kid now

38
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:29,342
We have a kid, right?

39
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:34,542
Why are your hands so cold

40
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,662
I warm you up

41
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:42,182
We're not splitting up

42
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,782
Let's go home

43
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:47,981
I'm gonna be a good husband and father

44
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:51,822
That's what my dad wanted

45
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,502
Make him change his mind

46
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:56,062
we need more time

47
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:01,341
Xingzhu, help me to send a message to Yunzhi

48
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:03,382
Tell her to watch out for Madam flower and my dad

49
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:04,702
But you're here

50
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:05,502
No

51
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:07,341
If I leave

52
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:08,702
he will be suspect me

53
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:11,302
Hurry up

54
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:14,422
I'll get back to you

55
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:15,542
Okay

56
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,461
Yue

57
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,062
Are you still up?

58
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,782
Dad, I'm going to sleep

59
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:32,622
Open a window and let some air in

60
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,222
Go

61
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:41,422
Wait for me

62
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:00,982
Your excellency Ye

63
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,101
I gave you a chance

64
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:09,981
As long as you stop pestering Yue

65
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:12,502
I can let you live

66
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:15,182
But you didn't seize the chance

67
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,782
Then don't blame me for being cruel

68
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:34,101
father-in-law

69
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,102
My dad's dead

70
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:38,862
You know it

71
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:41,341
I pose no threat to you

72
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,542
I really love her

73
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:47,182
Please keep me alive

74
00:06:47,182 --> 00:06:48,581
She's pregnant

75
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:50,462
I'll take good care of them

76
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:56,062
Is she pregnant?

77
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,182
Is she?

78
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:16,701
Thank you, father-in-law

79
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,822
You such a coward

80
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:02,062
I'm a father

81
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:03,582
Right?

82
00:08:04,262 --> 00:08:06,702
We have a kid, right?

83
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,422
Let's go home

84
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,782
I'll be a good father

85
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:19,782
Wait for me

86
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:21,102
Yes

87
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:05,542
Yunzhi

88
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:11,421
Li Yunzhi. Let's meet at the flower house

89
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:14,901
Okay

90
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:20,862
Yue

91
00:09:30,662 --> 00:09:31,462
Yue

92
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:53,381
Li Yunzhi

93
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:56,542
Tell me where the next volume of the treasure map is

94
00:09:57,502 --> 00:10:00,862
Ye Ganyuan, you are the one hiding behind it

95
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,142
Aren't you afraid I'll tell Your Highness

96
00:10:03,982 --> 00:10:05,062
Don't worry

97
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,542
How can a dead man complain

98
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:11,822
But if I die

99
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:14,942
you won't get what you want

100
00:10:17,502 --> 00:10:18,462
It's okay

101
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:19,901
If I can't get it

102
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:21,982
then other won't get it too

103
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:25,782
What if I already gave it to someone else

104
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:27,222
What

105
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:28,982
Who

106
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:34,421
Mr Ye

107
00:10:36,342 --> 00:10:37,582
Don't move. Get down on your knees

108
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:44,102
I know

109
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:46,902
You set me up

110
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:51,342
No, it's not

111
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:53,901
We're just acting for you

112
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:55,782
Ye

113
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,102
About the Lee family

114
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:05,622
how much you know

115
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,062
At that time

116
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:10,662
I just found out the secret to the Lee family treasure map

117
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:13,302
The emperor issued a decree to destroy the Li family

118
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,462
I don't want anything to do with it

119
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:17,942
So I chose Wanzhuo to carry it out

120
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:21,542
Then I found the treasure map

121
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:23,382
But it was only the first half

122
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:27,381
So I deliberately let Wanzhuo have it

123
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,421
Kill them all

124
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:35,462
Kill them all

125
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:51,942
Don't you kill them all?

126
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,182
Why are there omissions?

127
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:55,862
When we counted the bodies

128
00:11:56,542 --> 00:11:58,582
we found the body of a baby missing

129
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:00,982
Then I realized

130
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:04,982
Your mother Ye Wan had arranged to save Li Ya mother and daughter

131
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:09,182
I didn't report it

132
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:14,702
After all these years

133
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:20,862
I didn't expect the baby girl to come back

134
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:26,022
Ye Guangmao

135
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:31,262
I can let this treasure map thing go

136
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,982
But you're gonna help me get rid of the White Bird Society

137
00:12:37,662 --> 00:12:39,182
So you can redeem sins by good deeds

138
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:40,342
Are you serious?

139
00:12:42,702 --> 00:12:43,502
Yes

140
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:47,902
Thank you, Your Highness

141
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:49,502
Thank you, Your Highness

142
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:51,102
Thank you, Your Highness
