1
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:17,223
Song Chen is their son and your brother!

2
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:18,022
Is it toxic?

3
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:19,983
I'll drink it anyway.

4
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:22,023
Li Yunzhi is mine.

5
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,183
I want her.

6
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,223
It's really sweeter with the plums.

7
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,543
But even though he's not my mother's son.

8
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:48,223
He's still my half-brother.

9
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,423
Does this Ya have any special meaning?

10
00:00:58,663 --> 00:01:01,383
Even if you're Li Ya's daughter,

11
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:04,623
your father might not be Song Yanxing.

12
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:06,262
Your Highness.

13
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:11,583
Why are you here? Where's Li Yunzhi?

14
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:14,743
You'd better ask her yourself.

15
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,543
Your Highness.

16
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:30,903
Stop.

17
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:43,823
Your Highness, I have a lot to do today.

18
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:52,103
Really?

19
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:56,303
Are you too busy to bring me the medicine?

20
00:01:58,303 --> 00:01:59,383
Yes.

21
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:04,343
You're hiding from me.

22
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,063
If I dismiss you from your post,

23
00:02:11,743 --> 00:02:12,903
you wouldn't so busy, right?

24
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:19,663
Your Highness, you've planed to do so before, right?

25
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:22,703
Maybe Ping just followed your order.

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,103
You used me as a bait to prove that Wan Zhuo colluded with The White Bird Society.

27
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,823
Sadly, you got nothing on Wan Zhuo

28
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:29,423
but saw my embarrassment.

29
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:33,463
I could take advantage of anyone

30
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:35,223
but you.

31
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,183
But I used you to get rid of Wan Zhuo.

32
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,103
Can't you tell that?

33
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:40,622
I'm willing to do so.

34
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:42,743
I'm willing to be used by you.

35
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:47,063
Aren't you afraid that after Wan Zhuo

36
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:48,343
my next target would be you?

37
00:02:54,263 --> 00:02:58,543
Yes. But I'm more afraid of losing you.

38
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:08,143
Please behave yourself, Your Highness.

39
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:36,223
I know that you didn't use me.

40
00:03:36,903 --> 00:03:38,343
But

41
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,943
our relations and ending are destined.

42
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:03,542
Li Yunzhi, I don't care who you are

43
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,622
or why did you come to me,

44
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:09,342
I'm grateful that I met you.

45
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:17,822
General, I've found it that

46
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,463
Li Yunzhi is from the Family Li.

47
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,503
Kill them all.

48
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:28,663
Kill them all.

49
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:41,263
She is Li Ya.

50
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:42,503
Now everyone is here.

51
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:44,583
She probably just delivered a baby.

52
00:04:44,903 --> 00:04:46,623
But we didn't find the baby.

53
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:47,823
Didn't find it?

54
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:50,023
Then she didn't have a baby.

55
00:05:03,943 --> 00:05:04,983
There's one more thing.

56
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:06,503
Say it.

57
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:09,743
Pink pills are found in the young madam's place.

58
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:11,903
The one who let Li Yunzhi go

59
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:12,863
was the young madam.

60
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:14,463
And

61
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:16,543
she's been taking contraceptives.

62
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:22,302
I wanted to give her a second chance, but now...

63
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:41,383
Li Yunzhi,

64
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:46,343
do you believe in destiny?

65
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:51,303
Never.

66
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:56,623
If you know that you'll become unfortunate after meeting someone

67
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,863
and now you have a second chance,

68
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:02,463
will you choose to meet that person?

69
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,143
No.

70
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:05,783
I won't meet that person.

71
00:06:07,623 --> 00:06:09,263
But I can't start my life again,

72
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:15,183
so I decide to cut loss in time.

73
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:18,263
I'll choose to meet.

74
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:20,142
Despite the doomed ending,

75
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:21,903
it's still a blessing to meet.

76
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:25,223
Father, you're in a good mood today.

77
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:28,903
A wise man submits to fate.

78
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,863
After the Poetry Congress,

79
00:06:30,863 --> 00:06:33,263
we've got many valuable talents.

80
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:35,943
Zhong,

81
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:39,062
I'll draw up the visiting list later,

82
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:42,023
and you need to visit everyone on the list in person.

83
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:43,463
Yes.

84
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:48,903
Have more.

85
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:50,463
Take care of yourself.

86
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:53,143
I want a cute grandson as soon as possible.

87
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,263
Give it to me.

88
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:46,903
What?

89
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:48,543
The visiting list.

90
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:50,943
I don't know what you're talking about.

91
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:54,743
Why do you have to force me like that?

92
00:07:55,383 --> 00:07:56,863
Do you have to kill us?

93
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:02,063
Your father deserves all of this.

94
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:04,663
Fine.

95
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:06,423
What about your father?

96
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:08,663
He sacrifices his own daughter.

97
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:10,223
He's nothing good.

98
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,863
Why haven't we have any baby?

99
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:13,783
You might as well go to ask him.

100
00:08:13,783 --> 00:08:17,503
My father? No way.

101
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:19,983
You're one of the Family Wan.

102
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:23,302
Do you really have no affection

103
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:27,223
towards this family or me?

104
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:38,823
Yue, I can't be your enemy,

105
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,983
nor my father's.

106
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:45,423
When you're to kill each other,

107
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:47,983
the only thing I can do

108
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:51,342
is to be his shield.

109
00:08:59,063 --> 00:09:00,503
When the day really comes,

110
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,503
even if you stand in front of me,

111
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:07,503
I won't take my sword back.

112
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:13,582
Good.

113
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,463
I hope that you'll

114
00:09:20,783 --> 00:09:22,023
stab at me hard like this.

115
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:22,463
Let me go!

116
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:23,263
No.

117
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:31,903
Get out!

118
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,023
I won't let you send message to Li Yunzhi.

119
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:44,423
What's this?

120
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:45,623
It's contraceptive.

121
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:47,383
The Lord told me to do so.

122
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:49,582
No wonder Wan Xingzhu said that.

123
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:52,423
He knew it all along.

124
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,183
I don't feel well today.

125
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:59,543
Bring this to the Prince's Mansion for me

126
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:01,223
Make sure you give it to Li Yunzhi yourself.

127
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:04,103
I'll pretend I don't know this.

128
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:10,463
My lady, what's wrong?

129
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,263
I'm fine. Just go.

130
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:14,783
Yes.

131
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,943
Bring it to Li Yunzhi.

132
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:27,703
Remember, don't tell the Lady that I've seen it.

133
00:10:32,503 --> 00:10:34,302
No one is here. Come out.

134
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:44,143
The list Wan Zhuo gave is somehow weird.

135
00:10:45,503 --> 00:10:48,582
But the first few people on the list

136
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:51,263
are indeed my rivals.

137
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:54,582
Since you want to cooperate with me,

138
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:58,423
then show me your sincerity

139
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,423
by helping me kill them.

140
00:11:01,063 --> 00:11:03,743
Your excellency, what a scheme.

141
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:07,063
You use me to take out your rivals

142
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,983
and make Song Chen and Wan Zhuo attack each other.

143
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,903
No one would suspect you.

144
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:16,423
I'm flattered.

145
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:23,023
Your Highness, you've been reading it for a while.

146
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,463
Is there anything wrong with the list?

147
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,543
Yue said this includes all the people that have

148
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:27,943
turned to Wan Zhuo after Poetry Congress.

149
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:30,823
People llike Zhang Jingren and Zhou Yi

150
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:33,743
are all used to get along well with Family Li.

151
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:35,662
I just don't know

152
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:37,463
why they would turn to Wan Zhuo?

153
00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:39,383
Especially Ding Chaozhong.

154
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:42,943
He used to be the fiercest critic of Wan Zhuo.

155
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,743
Your Highness, Zhang Jingren

156
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:47,263
Zhou Yi and Xu Qiusheng were just killed.

157
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,303
I'll leave it to Yun Wei.

158
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,743
You don't have to handle it.

159
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:03,062
It's neither me nor Wan Zhuo.

160
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,103
Who would it be?

161
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:11,543
The waves are rising and the fish has shown up.

162
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:14,183
It's getting more dangerous.

163
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,143
I don't want her to risk.
