1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,770
I ordered it as your birthday gift.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:05,730
Wow,

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,010
it’s so lovely.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,520
A good person like Dr. Kan couldn’t kill anyone.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,570
Then who’s the murderer?

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,290
Director Somsak.

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,770
I forced him to confess,

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,470
but he threatened to take his own life.

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:19,590
Doctor.

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,460
On.

11
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,090
Actually, today is our wedding day.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,050
We found this near the bed.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,490
The pen you gave me—

14
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,790
I’ve kept it safely at home.

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:38,650
Captain.

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,050
Captain.

17
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,170
Please wait outside.

18
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,690
You have to believe me, Captain.

19
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,010
The doctor didn’t do anything. He’s being framed.

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,760
You know the doctor well.

21
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,170
He’s a good man.

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:50,870
Please, step outside.

23
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:54,410
Alright.

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,590
I’ve only known Dr. Kan for a short time.

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,910
On,

26
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,410
are you coming?

27
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,580
Where to?

28
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,700
The New Year’s party.

29
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,450
They’re welcoming a new doctor today.

30
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,009
Go ahead. I’ll stay here and keep watch.

31
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,479
But

32
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,930
will you be okay staying alone?

33
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:48,740
Oh,

34
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,220
they’re setting off fireworks tonight.

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,330
The doctor prescribed mild sleeping pills for the patients, worried they might not sleep well.

36
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,990
I’ll be fine.

37
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,020
Go on.

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,410
You’re an angel.

39
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,450
Thank you.

40
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:04,810
Let’s go, quickly!

41
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,350
But I know well

42
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,789
that in the doctor’s heart,

43
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,890
there’s only love and compassion for others.

44
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,250
Hey, On,

45
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,710
today the doctor mentioned

46
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,170
he’d let me meet the palliative care doctor.

47
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,870
What’s a palliative care doctor?

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,970
A doctor who looks after

49
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,130
terminally ill patients.

50
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,790
How much longer do I have?

51
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,200
Four to five months.

52
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,930
Four to five months, maybe.

53
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,580
On,

54
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,130
I don’t want to stay like this.

55
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,410
I don’t want to see you cry every day.

56
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,890
Let me go play music in heaven, please?

57
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,060
Please?

58
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,960
On the worst day of my life,

59
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,640
when I couldn’t save the one I loved from suffering,

60
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,960
Air embolism

61
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,970
can cause the patient to die in extreme agony.

62
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,029
That day,

63
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,060
Dr. Kan extended a helping hand.

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,630
Today,

65
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,870
no matter what happens,

66
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,170
I won’t abandon the doctor.

67
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,890
What was that, Doctor? Say it again.

68
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,730
I said…

69
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,890
I had dinner with Captain Wasan at 7 PM.

70
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,310
We finished around 9 PM

71
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,020
and parted ways.

72
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,010
Parted ways to where?

73
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,100
I went home.

74
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:57,590
Home?

75
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,110
Then why was your pen found at Ms. Urai’s house?

76
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,790
Lieutenant,

77
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,970
I have no idea how my pen ended up there.

78
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,850
I lost it around noon.

79
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,670
I even asked the nurses to help me search for it, but we couldn’t find it.

80
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,910
Didn’t you say you kept it at home?

81
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,570
I didn’t dare tell you.

82
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,010
I was afraid you’d be mad.

83
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,670
Tew,

84
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,290
but I’m sure

85
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,140
someone deliberately stole my pen from my room and placed it there.

86
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,810
Who would dare steal your pen?

87
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:37,830
Captain,

88
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,050
come talk to me.

89
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,460
I’m not taking sides with the suspect.

90
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,330
I’m just asking routine questions.

91
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,830
But aren’t you two acting a little too suspiciously?

92
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,130
Lieutenant,

93
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,470
if you’re referring to my personal relationship with Dr. Kantapat,

94
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,750
I don’t think it’s relevant.

95
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,159
But I think it is.

96
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,470
I don’t know, sir. I’m uneasy about this.

97
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:58,960
Alright,

98
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,770
to put everyone at ease,

99
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,190
Captain, step away from this case.

100
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,990
Let Sergeant Joe assist Kawin instead.

101
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,170
But Director.

102
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,930
That's it—

103
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:08,570
Case closed!

104
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,610
Captain, how is the doctor?

105
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,310
I’m no longer on this case.

106
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,890
Sorry.

107
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,049
Ms. Onanong Saengpeng, please proceed.

108
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,150
I can confirm this.

109
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,490
You can ask the entire nursing staff if needed.

110
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,760
The doctor complained all day about losing the pen.

111
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,330
It was very important to him because…

112
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,560
Captain Wasan gave it to him.

113
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,630
Who do you think

114
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,000
could have stolen the doctor’s pen?

115
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,850
Anyone could have—

116
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,030
nurses,

117
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,890
patients, relatives, or

118
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,310
anyone else.

119
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,450
I really don’t know.

120
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,270
The doctor tends to leave his pen lying around,

121
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,300
so it wouldn’t be hard for someone to pick it up.

122
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,730
the doctor is a very good person.

123
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,370
Very very good.

124
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,490
He could never kill anyone—

125
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,450
please believe me.

126
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,970
The doctor is still a suspect.

127
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,730
Understood.

128
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,420
In the meantime, stay low-profile

129
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,810
and don’t leave anything behind at someone else’s house.

130
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,570
Then help me find who stole my pen,

131
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,590
so I can clear my name.

132
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,370
I’ve asked everyone, Doctor—

133
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,490
no one saw anything unusual.

134
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:45,710
I…

135
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,470
can’t believe

136
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,510
someone could sneak in and steal my pen without anyone noticing.

137
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,430
Doctor.

138
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,670
If it were an outsider, someone unfamiliar,

139
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,950
someone must have seen them.

140
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,710
It has to be someone from the hospital.

141
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,760
Do you suspect anyone

142
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,120
who might want to kill someone and frame you for it?

143
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,150
Honestly, On,

144
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,370
I only suspect one person.

145
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,530
Why do you think Pharmacist Boss is the murderer?

146
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,080
Because I believe

147
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,850
he’s the one capable of stealing KCL

148
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,930
and knows how to use it.

149
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,050
He works nearby

150
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,520
and could have taken my pen without anyone suspecting.

151
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,470
What’s his motive?

152
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,550
Why would he kill someone and frame you?

153
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,850
That, I’m not sure about.

154
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,690
But I do feel that

155
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,340
Boss is highly suspicious.

156
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,790
The murderer of terminally ill patients

157
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,500
is described as a tall man

158
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,810
in black clothing

159
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,100
who knows how to use potassium chloride.

160
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,530
That’s all the police know.

161
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,470
I’m going into Pharmacist Boss’s house.

162
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,970
- You can't do that.
- That’s risky.

163
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:26,880
On,

164
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,480
don't forget.

165
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,790
If Boss is the killer,

166
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,490
it means he’s capable of murder.

167
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,550
Doctor.

168
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,710
Don’t worry. I can handle myself.

169
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,690
Ms. Onanong,

170
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,770
if you happen to find something,

171
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,450
that evidence could become inadmissible in court

172
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,290
as it wouldn't be legally obtained.

173
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,730
If I find something,

174
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,750
I won't touch it.

175
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,320
I’ll inform the police

176
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,070
and let them issue a search warrant.

177
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,010
Okay?

178
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,780
Why send Ms. On in?

179
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,810
If Pharmacist Boss is the murderer,

180
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,710
his house will likely have syringes and potassium chloride.

181
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,010
Remember what

182
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,440
Mr. Som said? The murderer was wearing black running gear.

183
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,110
If we find such gear at Boss’s house,

184
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,510
it strengthens the case

185
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,150
that he is the murderer.

186
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,160
Alright.

187
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,070
What do you need me to do?

188
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,850
I need Mr. Som.

189
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,080
He’s the only person who has seen the murderer’s face and can identify him.

190
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,430
Be careful, On. Let us know if anything happens.

191
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,570
Don’t worry about me, Doctor.

192
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:13,550
Tew,

193
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,280
what’s on your mind?

194
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,520
I think…

195
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,200
I’m ready.

196
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,370
For what?

197
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,910
What you once asked—about us living together.

198
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,640
I think I’m ready.

199
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,930
Now?

200
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:47,680
Yes.

201
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,030
I’m not on the case anymore—

202
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,340
suspended.

203
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,350
I have some free time now.

204
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,610
If I move in and you take care of me,

205
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,050
how do you feel about that?

206
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:31,830
Hey,

207
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,520
Som!

208
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,890
Som, are you home?

209
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:46,970
Lieutenant,

210
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,650
it looks like Mr. Som hasn’t been home for several days.

211
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:37,970
On!

212
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:39,780
Yes?

213
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,530
Nam, what brings you here?

214
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,250
Oh, Grandma Samorn asked me to drop off some durian for you.

215
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,970
The smell is all over the ward.

216
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,710
Since you’re off today, I figured I’d bring it over before it overripe.

217
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,020
Oh, thank you!

218
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,130
Mmm, smells so good.

219
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,570
Thanks!

220
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:03,390
I came all this way—aren’t you going to offer me a drink?

221
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,329
Oh, right,

222
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,730
of course! Come in for a drink.

223
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,839
It’s so hot, and I’m thirsty too.

224
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,390
Thirsty?

225
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,890
Yes, thirsty.

226
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,109
- Let me help you carry that.
- Sure, thanks.

227
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,930
Someone brought him in last night.

228
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,970
He probably overdosed on cannabis.

229
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,650
We also found that he has coronary artery disease.

230
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,590
When will he regain consciousness?

231
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,190
Oh, it might take a while—he just fell asleep.

232
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,970
But even

233
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,890
if he wakes up, there’s no guarantee he’ll make sense.

234
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,290
Some people are confused or hallucinate.

235
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,330
Is he coherent enough for questioning?

236
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,750
Will he be reliable?

237
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,070
You really don’t want me to stay and watch him, Lieutenant?

238
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,530
No need—

239
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:05,590
let’s avoid unnecessary attention.

240
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,320
I’ve already told the nurses to call me as soon as Som wakes up.

241
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,640
- Alright.
- Mmm.

242
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,420
You go ahead.

243
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,750
I’ll catch up.

244
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:18,800
Got it.

245
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,330
Supatrinicha.

246
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,650
Hello, Captain.

247
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,850
I found Som—

248
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,050
he’s in the hospital, overdosed on cannabis.

249
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,620
What’s happening on your end?

250
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,710
Ms. Onanong is likely entering Pharmacist Boss’s house.

251
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,930
And what about you, Captain?

252
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,470
I went all out to get you off the case.

253
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,130
What’s your next move?

254
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,840
Don’t worry, Lieutenant—

255
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,470
I’ve got it under control.

256
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,150
Alright,

257
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,370
when Som wakes up,

258
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,370
we’ll get him

259
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,870
to identify the man in black.

260
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:12,690
Okay.

261
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:40,670
Come here.

262
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,690
Let me help.

263
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,030
What do I need to add?

264
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,720
Oh, I’ve already prepared the sauce.

265
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,480
Tew, can you…

266
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:51,990
Black outfit.

267
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:56,900
Tew!

268
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,970
On found—

269
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,490
What are you doing?

270
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:10,400
Oh,

271
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:11,780
sorry.

272
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,130
I was just looking for some comfortable pants to wear.

273
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,020
Ah,

274
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,200
alright.

275
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,050
What did you just say?

276
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,590
Oh.

277
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,510
On said she found KCL in Pharmacist Boss’s room.

278
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,230
What now?

279
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,460
On has gone silent.

280
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:00,740
Don’t call—

281
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,420
it’s dangerous.

282
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,790
Mot available. Will contact you back.

283
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,630
What does this mean?

284
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,830
Is this good or bad?

285
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,530
Joe,

286
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,180
I need your help.

287
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:09,730
Over there.

288
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,410
It’s all dark.

289
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,610
Wait—the motorbike is still here.

290
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:34,600
What’s going on?

291
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,210
Let’s go in and check.

292
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,070
Wait, wait!

293
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:39,890
Lieutenant.

294
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,230
Boss saw the police. He’s suspicious.

295
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,890
Tew, this is bad!

296
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,670
If the police don’t leave, you’ll definitely get caught.

297
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:34,990
Yes, Captain.

298
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,090
Hello, Joe.

299
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,900
Get out of there right now.

300
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,850
Yes.

301
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,140
What’s up?

302
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,980
The Captain said to leave immediately.

303
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,400
Alright, let’s go.

304
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,930
Why are the police here, On?

305
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,010
Who told them about this?

306
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,250
You’ve ruined me.

307
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,210
You’re dead.

308
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,530
Stay still.

309
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,630
Why did Dr. Kan tell the police about this?

310
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,050
Why make it so complicated?

311
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,710
I told you to keep quiet.

312
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,480
Boss is gone.

313
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,180
I'm safe.

314
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,290
Thank you, Tew.

315
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,670
Thank you for…

316
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,460
being by my side today.

317
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,910
Whatever your reason for being here,

318
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,670
I’m grateful.

319
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,770
It’s okay now.

320
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,060
What are you doing in the dark?

321
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:02,870
I should ask you the same.

322
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,060
I couldn’t sleep—

323
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,010
just not used to it.

324
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,480
I’ve never shared a bed with anyone before.

325
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,070
Someone once told me,

326
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,610
everything has a first time.

327
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,870
And after that,

328
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,210
it gets easier.

329
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,210
Not talking about relationships, though—

330
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,450
nothing like that.

331
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,750
The person who said it to me

332
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,750
was someone I deeply respected.

333
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,850
I’m sorry.

334
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,900
You couldn’t sleep because of me.

335
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,250
It’s okay.

336
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,070
If you’re not sleepy yet,

337
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,580
it’s only midnight.

338
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,010
How about a movie?

339
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,120
Just coffee for me, please.

340
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,430
I need to get to the hospital.

341
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,410
Is someone hurt?

342
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,710
No,

343
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,670
it’s just the Prayoon Temple case.

344
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,030
This time, the criminal is strange.

345
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,940
They drugged the monks,

346
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,560
tattooed them,

347
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,180
and stole all the temple's money.

348
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,190
What?

349
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,850
They even took the donations meant for casting the Naga coins.

350
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,740
The suspect you’re tracking

351
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,070
isn’t a petty thief.

352
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,330
They wouldn’t steal from a temple.

353
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,570
We’ll find out soon enough.

354
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,070
Professor Golf, once I finish this last medicine delivery, I’m heading home.

355
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,370
Finally free of this shift.

356
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:43,830
Alright.

357
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,850
You look half-asleep, Professor.

358
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,510
Get some coffee.

359
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,440
Ghost!

360
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:34,960
Ghost!

361
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,740
Whoever

362
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,410
meddles

363
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,040
in my business…

364
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,970
will die.

365
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,280
Ghost!

366
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,080
Ugh!

367
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,330
Doctor.

368
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:26,700
If I could choose,

369
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,130
I’d stop time right here.

370
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,110
I’m sleepy.

371
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,570
But in reality,

372
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,890
it’s impossible.

373
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:50,250
Doctor,

374
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,130
five more minutes.

375
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,060
Just five minutes.

376
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,530
Both Tew

377
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,770
and I,

378
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,530
we have to keep living.

379
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,990
Hey, On got everything.

380
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,320
Where is she?

381
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,450
So we can go.

382
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:49,880
Maybe not.

383
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,010
Why?

384
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,250
On…

385
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,240
set up a meeting at her house.

386
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,770
Her house is close to…

387
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:01,800
Boss’s place.

388
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,410
If the police show up there, Boss might get suspicious.

389
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,790
What’s up, Joe?

390
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,040
What?

391
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,640
Captain, Mr. Som had a heart attack last night.

392
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:31,290
Where’s the body?

393
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,350
Was there an autopsy?

394
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:33,570
I checked already.

395
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,010
No needle marks were found.

396
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,710
No foreign substances were found in the blood,

397
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,840
only THC.

398
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,530
He was the only person I believed had seen the killer’s face.

399
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:41,500
I’m sorry.

400
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,630
Now there’s no one left to identify the killer for you, Captain.

401
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,200
You only have one option left.

402
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,300
Yes.

403
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,190
I have to catch them in the act.

404
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:36,990
On.

405
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:38,750
On.

406
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,170
She’s safe.

407
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,810
I’ll release her as soon as we finish talking.

408
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,830
I killed Director Somsak.

409
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:11,920
Why?

410
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,450
To protect you.

411
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:20,330
Director Somsak was going to turn you in to the police.

412
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,230
He was going to expose your euthanasia of patients. Don’t you remember?

413
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,450
I saved you, Dr. Kan.

414
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,590
Ms.Onanong hasn’t come to work.

415
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:47,850
Dr. Kan is also on leave.

416
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,890
I sent him a message, but he hasn’t replied.

417
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,170
Pharmacist Boss didn’t come to work either, Captain.

418
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,260
He called in sick this morning.

419
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:17,810
And the others?

420
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:22,290
Nipon Kongkham.

421
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,170
Urai Dansom.

422
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,290
They helped the doctor too.

423
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,970
Helped with euthanasia?

424
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,070
You don’t understand, Boss.

425
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,040
You don’t even know what euthanasia really is.

426
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,970
- I did exactly what you did.
- No!

427
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,120
What you did

428
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,690
was inject KCL, causing patients to die in agony.

429
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,290
I didn’t do that.

430
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,490
Then teach me!

431
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,890
Teach me how to do it right,

432
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,630
so I can help

433
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,650
like On did.

434
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,370
We could be a team.

435
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,650
Are you crazy?

436
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:18,100
Ms. On!

437
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:20,930
Ms. On!

438
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:34,190
Captain,

439
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,200
there’s no one here.

440
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:49,610
Boss!

441
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:50,850
Who?

442
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,260
Who!

443
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:54,630
Calm down, Boss.

444
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:55,930
It’s nothing.

445
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:56,610
If I’m done,

446
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:57,230
listen to me—

447
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,110
you’re done too.

448
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,680
Should we check Pharmacist Boss’s house?

449
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,530
Doctor!

450
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:26,920
(OneD Original)

451
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,200
When you say you killed everyone,

452
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,540
does that include my mother?

453
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,220
Stay strong.

454
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,120
And don’t forget, our duty

455
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,540
is to uphold the law.

456
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,500
I can help you if you stay silent.
