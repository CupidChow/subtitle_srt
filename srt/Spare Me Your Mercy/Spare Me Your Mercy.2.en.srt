1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:03,880
I'm Dr. Kan.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,320
I was the physician taking care of Mrs. Raweewan before she passed.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,360
Sa said she was supposed to have months left.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,450
Why, doctor?

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,080
For terminal patients, I have to say…

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,280
anything can happen.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,050
However, in this case, we found a syringe lying nearby.

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,600
The last doctor to care for the patient

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,840
was Dr. Kantapat Akkaramethee.

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,750
Do the police suspect it’s a murder?

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,630
Someone spotted a suspect near the house of Mr. Nipon Kongkham.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,490
What does it look like?

13
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,230
Dressed in black, something like...

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:28,930
Doctor!

15
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:34,840
Doctor!

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,040
Excuse me, Sergeant Narong.

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,280
Hello, Sergeant.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,670
Yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,539
Yeah.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,880
Yeah.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,560
Are you sure?

22
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,620
Alright.

23
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,760
I'll leave the station to you.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,060
I’m with the Captain right now; I’ll head there myself.

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,730
Okay, got it.

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,800
Captain,

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:30,780
let’s go.

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,640
Go where?

29
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,000
Early this morning, someone spotted the suspect near Nipon’s house.

30
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,200
And now we know who it is.

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,240
Let’s hurry!

32
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,270
Hey, wait!

33
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:42,200
Lieutenant.

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,220
Where exactly

35
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,120
is the suspect’s house?

36
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,360
Is it far from here?

37
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,259
Not far,

38
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,479
just behind Boonman Temple.

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,640
A man named Grandpa Som lives there—he’s the undertaker.

40
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,090
Let’s go.

41
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,829
Wiang Singh Hospital

42
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,960
Thursday, July 2, 2024

43
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,430
5:23 PM

44
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,510
Autopsy Results for Nipon Kongkham.

45
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,300
Lung cancer was found in an advanced metastatic stage, spreading to the brain and liver.

46
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,340
Fluid was detected in the pleural cavity

47
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,500
likely caused by heart failure.

48
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,910
There's bruising,

49
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,980
abrasions, and a needle-like puncture wound

50
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,570
at the left elbow crease,

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,940
Let me go!

52
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,990
Consistent with the syringe found at the scene.

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,170
The syringe has been sent for testing

54
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,840
to match its contents with the substances found in the blood.

55
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,019
Fire! Help!

56
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,680
- There’s a fire! Help!
- Fire!

57
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,440
Wiang Singh Police Station.

58
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,570
It’s the start of the month—let’s grab something hearty to eat.

59
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,050
No thanks, Sergeant. I’ve got this.

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,370
I’m good.

61
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,510
Captain, are you hungry?

62
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,430
Not yet.

63
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,360
I admire you, Lieutenant.

64
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,390
You can still eat after visiting that house.

65
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,420
No problem, Captain.

66
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,970
That Grandpa Som guy, the undertaker,

67
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,210
has gotten worse

68
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,190
in recent years.

69
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,630
He claims to see ghosts

70
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,490
and even sacrifices animals,

71
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,310
like dogs and cats,

72
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,110
to appease them.

73
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,860
These days, whenever he sees the police, he runs off like what you saw earlier.

74
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,090
So,

75
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,070
you don’t believe what he says?

76
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,070
Don’t tell me you do!

77
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:51,590
I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do believe in the man in black.

78
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,830
That night, at Songkran’s house,

79
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,840
I found shards of broken tiles near the bed.

80
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,460
Later, I found pieces of a broken coffee cup discarded elsewhere.

81
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,780
His wife mentioned she

82
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,440
had placed the coffee cup on the bedside table, but it disappeared.

83
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,790
This means someone entered Songkran’s room that night,

84
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,750
broke the coffee cup, and escaped through the balcony.

85
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,500
- Then they got rid of the cup…
- Hold on,

86
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,130
calm down, Captain.

87
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,610
Wait, so you haven’t heard about this?

88
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,440
This just came in this afternoon

89
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,790
while we were at the hospital.

90
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,090
Wait a second, Madam, calm down. Let’s head to the station.

91
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,880
That’s the guy who’s been live-streaming and selling stuff on his page. I recognize him!

92
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,800
Are the items he’s selling ours?

93
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,700
They’re definitely Songkran’s belongings.

94
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,770
Like the gold-encased Khruba Siwichai medallion—

95
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,670
it has a distinct mark on the frame. I’m sure of it.

96
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,159
Hey, calm down. No need for that.

97
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,950
So, Mr. Songkran was a collector of amulets.

98
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,190
He had an old Khruba Sriwichai medallion that he always carried with him.

99
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,120
After he passed away, his relatives noticed that the medallion was missing,

100
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,810
so they reported it to the police.

101
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,410
Believe it or not, the very next day, a page selling sacred objects was live-streaming

102
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,470
and selling it.

103
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,530
So dumb—

104
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,000
stealing and then live-streaming it themselves.

105
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,620
That’s why he got caught.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,700
And the autopsy results from Dr. Rin confirmed, didn’t they, that it wasn’t a murder case?

107
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,050
So the conclusion is…

108
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,700
It’s just a plain theft case,

109
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,550
nothing more.

110
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,270
And…

111
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,510
What else?

112
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,890
Just make sure you collect the evidence, alright?

113
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,580
Why don’t you collect it yourself?

114
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,420
I’m heading back.

115
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,110
But if there’s anything,

116
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,240
call me anytime. I’ve moved to live in the city now.

117
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,460
Oh, good for you, Captain.

118
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,920
If you’d stayed at your mom’s house, I’d bet you’d have a wife within three months.

119
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,590
Maybe even a kid too.

120
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,179
It’s quiet up here, not much else to do.

121
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,130
See you, Captain.

122
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,600
See you.

123
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:41,659
Captain!

124
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,080
By the way…

125
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,710
I need to talk to you.

126
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,900
Go ahead.

127
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,230
I think…

128
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,470
We…

129
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,080
should talk somewhere else.

130
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,250
What I need to talk about isn’t really appropriate for here.

131
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,130
What is it?

132
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,180
Go ahead.

133
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,620
Aren’t you going to eat first?

134
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,480
The food here is really good.

135
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,630
Want to look at the menu?

136
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,420
If you’re not going to talk,

137
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,680
I’ll go first.

138
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,520
Why did you follow me to Som’s house today?

139
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,290
You didn’t just pass by by coincidence.

140
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,720
I intentionally said where I was going,

141
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,270
so you could hear it.

142
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,950
And then you followed me there.

143
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,320
You're lying.

144
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,150
Why did you go there?

145
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,470
What do you want?

146
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,550
I like you.

147
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,320
What?

148
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,390
It’s true that I followed you.

149
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,010
But the truth is…

150
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,730
I just wanted to meet you.

151
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,620
I just wanted to…

152
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,180
develop our relationship.

153
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,190
Uh…

154
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,030
Your mom always talks about you to me,

155
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,490
so I feel like I’ve known you for a long time.

156
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,980
If I’ve crossed a line, I’m sorry.

157
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,100
But honestly, you’re at fault too.

158
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,460
You’re too cute.

159
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,820
- Wasan!
- I’m leaving.

160
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,270
Wait, Captain.

161
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,960
Wait!

162
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:50,970
Wait!

163
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:55,830
Captain!

164
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:57,490
Look.

165
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,360
I don’t want to talk about this.

166
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,580
Hey.

167
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,030
I know.

168
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,710
You feel the same way I do.

169
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,010
We don’t need to hide it. We don’t need to deny it.

170
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,760
I’m not denying anything.

171
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,620
I just don’t want to talk about it.

172
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,990
Fine.

173
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:18,930
We won’t talk about it.

174
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,510
I just wanted to let you know how I feel about you.

175
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,190
What is it?

176
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,390
Yes.

177
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,010
- Mine?
- Yes.

178
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,830
- Thank you.
- Alright.

179
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,020
Don’t skip meals, okay?

180
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,800
Take care of yourself

181
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,520
if you don’t want to see the doctor often.

182
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,190
Why take the risk, Doctor?

183
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,480
It’s necessary, Orn.

184
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,230
Otherwise, the Captain won’t stop being suspicious.

185
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,150
And? Did it work?

186
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,590
I think so.

187
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,710
I think the Captain…

188
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,380
believes everything I’ve said.

189
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,920
Hello.

190
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,870
Have the results come in from this morning’s test?

191
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:46,960
Yes.

192
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,930
Okay, thank you.

193
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,350
Lieutenant,

194
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,290
I know now what caused

195
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,710
Mr. Nipon Kongkham’s death.

196
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,060
Director.

197
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,580
You’re here to hear the autopsy results?

198
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,550
Why?

199
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,870
Mr. Nipon Kongkham was one of my patients.

200
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,070
I’d like to know the cause of death to use it as reference for other cases.

201
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,360
It might be useful as a reference for treating other cases.

202
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,710
No, it’s not allowed.

203
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,430
Autopsy results are confidential

204
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,750
because it’s already confirmed that…

205
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,270
the death of Mr. Nipon Kongkham

206
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,380
was a murder.

207
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,300
At the crook of his arm,

208
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,950
we found a needle mark.

209
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,020
From examining the wound and bruises,

210
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,010
it’s believed that the victim was injected within a short time before death—

211
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,810
no more than six hours before the police discovered the body.

212
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,650
The injection likely happened between midnight and 6 AM

213
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,110
while the victim was asleep.

214
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,830
The analysis of the liquid in the syringe

215
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,030
revealed it was potassium chloride.

216
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,630
I hypothesize that

217
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,310
the victim was injected with potassium chloride,

218
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,710
which caused an irregular heartbeat, leading to death.

219
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,840
It’s definitely a murder. But why would someone kill a terminally ill patient

220
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,590
who was going to die anyway?

221
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,630
The perpetrator’s motive could be one of two things:

222
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,720
A deep personal grudge

223
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,950
that made them want to kill the victim with their own hands.

224
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,590
Second,

225
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,740
a desire to send some sort of message through the victim’s death.

226
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,900
At the scene, we found a footprint,

227
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,890
approximately size 42.

228
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,810
Based on the stride length, it’s likely a man

229
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,530
about 175–180 cm tall.

230
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,340
Then let’s start by investigating those close to the victim.

231
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:09,790
Alright.

232
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,310
Kawin, take the folder with you.

233
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,030
Alright.

234
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,880
172 cm, Lieutenant.

235
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,270
Father had been bedridden for years and never went anywhere.

236
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,840
He didn’t have any issues with anyone.

237
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,550
Did you make a mistake?

238
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,770
Did he cause the fire

239
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,970
and then crawl out and die by himself?

240
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,350
Who would want to kill him?

241
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,110
He’s already dead—do we really need to take this to court?

242
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,530
It’s a waste of time and resources!

243
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,240
How much is this?

244
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,910
Hearing this, you can’t help but feel sorry for him.

245
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,250
It seems like his children feel more relief than sadness now that their father has passed.

246
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,710
They probably couldn’t handle taking care of him anymore.

247
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,580
It must’ve been too much for them, given their daily struggles to make ends meet.

248
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,050
Sergeant.

249
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:16,870
Yes, sir!

250
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,030
Did the deceased have any inheritance or assets?

251
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,220
We’ve checked, sir. No, he didn’t.

252
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,510
Even his farmland is still mortgaged.

253
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,430
Oh, come on, his kids didn’t kill him.

254
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,310
People around here…

255
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,200
if they were going to poison their father for inheritance,

256
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:35,930
at most, they’d use rat poison.

257
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:36,590
Right?

258
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,530
Nobody around here would know anything about potassium chloride.

259
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:52,150
Wow, a bachelor’s room is really empty, huh?

260
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,810
Not even a rice cooker.

261
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,750
Why would I need one? I just buy food—it’s easier than cleaning.

262
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,920
Too lazy to clean, huh? And too lazy to take out the trash, too?

263
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,890
If you leave it, ants will get into it.

264
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,130
Oh, did Dr. Kan drop something off?

265
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,990
Yeah, he was just passing through.

266
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,880
Dr. Kan is such a good person.

267
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,220
Did you know that sometimes, even when it’s not his duty to visit homes,

268
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,310
he brings medicine to our mom

269
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,170
and takes care of the patients better than their own children?

270
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,050
I'll leave now.

271
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,230
I don't want you to be late for work.

272
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,710
Hey, Sa.

273
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:44,970
What?

274
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,640
What kind of person

275
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,010
is Dr. Kan?

276
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,940
Dr. Kan?

277
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,750
The villagers say he’s like an angel.

278
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,310
Everyone loves him.

279
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,510
Why are you asking?

280
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:02,990
Nothing.

281
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,320
I'm leaving now.

282
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,250
Potassium

283
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,170
is an essential nutrient for the body,

284
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,260
especially for heart function.

285
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,330
Normally, we get potassium from the food we eat daily.

286
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,060
However, what we’re looking at here is potassium chloride—

287
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,680
a mixture of potassium and chlorine.

288
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,330
It’s a dangerous drug.

289
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,410
In some countries, it’s used in lethal injections for executions

290
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,810
because it stops the heart.

291
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,970
Did the killer get this from a prison?

292
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,000
I don’t think so.

293
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,630
It’s more likely they got it from a hospital,

294
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,820
where potassium chloride

295
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,510
is used to treat patients

296
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,230
with severe potassium deficiencies.

297
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,820
Can ordinary people buy this?

298
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,080
No, they can’t.

299
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,930
It’s a High Alert Drug that requires a doctor’s prescription.

300
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,850
But the key clue here

301
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,080
isn’t where the drug came from—

302
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,620
it’s the needle mark.

303
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,220
The perpetrator didn’t inject randomly

304
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,370
but directly into the vein.

305
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,460
This means the perpetrator knew

306
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,210
that injecting the drug into a vein

307
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,940
would yield the most effective result.

308
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,580
The perpetrator also knew how to properly administer the injection.

309
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,690
The killer is likely connected to a hospital

310
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,330
or could even be a medical professional.

311
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,300
Ms. Rayong,

312
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,820
just like before—deep breaths.

313
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,100
Come here.

314
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,750
He seem tired today.

315
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,180
Well, he work every day, and the hospital doesn’t have enough doctors.

316
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,260
Does he ever make mistakes?

317
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,920
What are you two talking about?

318
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,830
Nothing, just concerned about the doctor.

319
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,790
Seems like a lot of your cases end in death lately.

320
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,010
All terminally ill patients are bound to die. It would be strange if they didn’t.

321
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,470
If you’ve got something to do, go do it—it’s almost noon,

322
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,640
Let Nam handle over here.

323
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:40,800
Alright.

324
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,070
The police are currently investigating all departments.

325
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,790
Anyone who withdraws potassium chloride frequently is under scrutiny.

326
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,430
That’s bad news.

327
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,840
Yes, Orn.

328
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,550
Come on in. I’m at home already.

329
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,600
I’ll leave the door unlocked for you.

330
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,810
Yes, Orn.

331
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,490
Doctor, I can’t make it today.

332
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,680
No problem at all.

333
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,340
Let’s leave it at this for now.

334
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,310
Captain, is there something

335
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,630
I can help you with?

336
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,290
Just a small matter I need assistance with.

337
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,410
Come on in.

338
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,160
What would you like to drink?

339
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,820
I’ll get you some water.

340
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,570
Are you living here alone?

341
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,790
I’d love to have someone move in with me.

342
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,130
Here.

343
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,020
I came here

344
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,000
because I need more information.

345
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,790
The director mentioned…

346
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:27,610
that you

347
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,670
were quite close to Mr. Nipon, the deceased.

348
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,240
It’s common for a palliative care doctor.

349
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,130
I have to take care of both the physical and mental health of my patients,

350
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,230
as well as their families.

351
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,750
So naturally, I get to know a lot about their family situations.

352
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,940
In Nipon’s family,

353
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,090
is there anyone who might have had a motive to kill him?

354
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,630
Even if his children are struggling to make ends meet,

355
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,880
I don’t think they’d be cruel enough to kill their own father.

356
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,370
The person who killed Nipon Kongkham

357
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,920
used potassium chloride, injecting it into a vein.

358
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,650
Dr. Rin believes the perpetrator is likely someone who works in a hospital

359
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,490
or is part of the medical field.

360
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,110
Among the hospital staff who handled Nipon’s case,

361
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,740
do you think

362
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,020
anyone might have had a motive to kill him?

363
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,350
I think I drank too much water.

364
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,300
Where’s the bathroom?

365
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,580
Over to the right, inside.

366
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,220
Excuse me.

367
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,680
Captain,

368
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,010
my bathroom isn’t very tidy today.

369
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,870
The housekeeper didn’t come to clean.

370
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,420
Let me tidy it up for you first.

371
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,390
All done?

372
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,270
Please, feel free to use it.

373
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,480
Thank you.

374
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,570
Thank you, Doctor,

375
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,870
for the information.

376
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,230
Take care on your way back, Captain.

377
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,130
Next time,

378
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,270
please call ahead—

379
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,100
I’d love to cook for you.

380
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,610
Hey, Joe.

381
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,690
I’ve sent you the pictures you requested on Line.

382
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,570
Got it, thanks a lot.

383
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,500
Are you living here alone?

384
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,550
All done?

385
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,360
Hi, Director.

386
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,100
Orn!

387
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,890
Are you okay? Why did you lock the door?

388
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,420
I must have forgot, sorry about that.

389
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:52,640
Okay.

390
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,110
Grandma,

391
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,370
you can eat mangoes, but only half a fruit at a time.

392
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,710
No sticky rice with it, okay?

393
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,510
Promise.

394
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,630
Great.

395
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,930
Please also provide her with a Diet Control plan.

396
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,160
Yes, Doctor.

397
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,870
Please, go ahead.

398
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,710
Please.

399
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,190
The police are at the palliative care ward.

400
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,120
And what about the items?

401
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,400
Let’s go.

402
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,440
Doctor,

403
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,230
I need to talk to you.

404
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,150
Sorry, Captain, I’m in a rush today.

405
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,150
Let’s talk another time.

406
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,060
Stop! Stop!

407
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,130
What are you doing?

408
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,990
I request permission to conduct a search.

409
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,010
Excuse me?

410
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,110
What’s in this box? I’d like to see.

411
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,750
You can’t.

412
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,430
These are medications meant for the patients.

413
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,390
They’re sealed and must not be opened.

414
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,670
- But I…
- It’s the rule—

415
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,010
for safety.

416
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,480
Captain,

417
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,830
please step aside. I’m really in a hurry today.

418
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:53,390
(OneD Original)

419
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,240
Anyone who kills another person with premeditation,

420
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,490
tortures them,

421
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,910
or acts with extreme cruelty

422
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,270
shall face the death penalty.

423
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,920
What if the patient wanted to die?

424
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:03,710
I know

425
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,150
who stole the potassium chloride.

426
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,250
Who did you give it to?

427
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,870
Director, calm down.

428
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,840
Director…

429
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,880
Please help me.

430
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,050
I know

431
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,970
who the murderer is.

432
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,640
I’m not accusing you of being the murderer.

433
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,350
But hypothetically, if it were me,

434
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,690
what would you do?

435
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:22,960
I’d arrest you.
