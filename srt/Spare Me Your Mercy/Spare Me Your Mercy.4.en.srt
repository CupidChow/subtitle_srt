1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,150
Life is short.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:04,910
If I like someone,

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,410
I’ll just say I like them.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,290
But I don’t like casual relationships.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,890
I have something important to discuss with you, Captain.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,010
Don’t you think I could be the murderer?

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,220
You’re not like them.

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,180
Who?

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,690
Director Somsak asked me to meet him at his house.

10
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,020
He said he would hand over the killer of the terminally ill patients to the police.

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,240
Do you remember?

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:23,970
Do you know who this is?

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,250
Your very first victim—

14
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,270
Dr. Pirot Kunawan,

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,720
your own mentor.

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,770
How did you know the professor, Director?

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,270
Dr. Pirot and I were…

18
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,490
friends.

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,300
Dance Club for Health

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,840
Year 2007

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,370
We were very close.

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,180
Those three years were the best time of my life,

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,930
until…

24
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,509
Doctor!

25
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,120
Oh!

26
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,710
You startled me!

27
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:49,800
Are you alright?

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,250
Oh, I’m fine.

29
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,850
Just need to sit for a moment.

30
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,289
It’s joint pain—

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,850
symptoms of early-stage bone cancer.

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,440
I met the professor during my internship.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,460
At that time, he was already in the terminal stage.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He was my patient.

35
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,680
And one day,

36
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,190
he called me.

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,560
He said he’d found someone who could take his pain away.

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,940
So, you knew then, didn’t you?

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,550
You knew that…

40
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,120
the professor was willing.

41
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,070
But you had no right!

42
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,620
You’re a doctor!

43
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,210
A doctor’s job is to save lives, not to take them!

44
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,570
I didn’t take a life.

45
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,460
The professor only had two months left,

46
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,880
but those two months meant so much to me.

47
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,550
For him, though, those two months were unbearable.

48
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,300
Director, do you know?

49
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,700
If he wasn’t lying there, immobilized by the medication,

50
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,460
every time he woke up,

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
he was in unbearable pain.

52
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,270
The professor was suffering so much

53
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,460
he couldn’t take it anymore. That’s why he begged me to do it.

54
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,210
But it’s wrong!

55
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,950
It’s against the law, against medical ethics, against morality—against everything!

56
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,840
You killed someone.

57
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,940
You’re not just damning yourself;

58
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,220
you also helped Pirot take his own life,

59
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,110
dragging him to hell with you!

60
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:31,940
Dr. Kan,

61
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,220
you need to stop.

62
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:37,700
Hey.

63
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,660
What are you doing, Director?

64
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:02,820
Let’s go.

65
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:03,660
Hey.

66
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,280
Are you gonna be alright?

67
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,650
If anything comes up, let me know immediately.

68
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,230
Understood.

69
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,610
Director?

70
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,720
Director?

71
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,040
To me,

72
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,380
life is the most precious thing.

73
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,000
Doctor,

74
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,290
the patient is arresting!

75
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,530
Doctor,

76
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,500
move aside, please!

77
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,570
Doctor, we’ve completed 5 cycles of CPR!

78
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,460
Step back!

79
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,680
Step back!

80
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,330
Step back!

81
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,220
Alright.

82
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,480
No pulse detected.

83
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,090
EKG shows VF.

84
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,680
Defibrillator at 200 joules, now!

85
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,480
Got it!

86
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,850
As a doctor,

87
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,790
I must do everything I can…

88
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,270
to keep a person alive.

89
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,780
When life hangs by the thinnest thread

90
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,810
between life and death.

91
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,320
I am the hand that holds that thread, keeping it intact until the very end.

92
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,540
Thank you, Doctor.

93
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,690
Mom, sit up. It’s okay now. Don’t worry anymore.

94
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,270
Because every life has value.

95
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,549
I despise

96
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,409
those who fail to see the value in life.

97
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,630
On.

98
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,050
What is it, Doctor?

99
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,120
On,

100
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,400
the Director knows about us.

101
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,290
He’s going to tell the police.

102
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:17,990
That can’t happen!

103
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,980
We can’t let the police…

104
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,420
We can’t let them find out about this at all. If they do, we’re in big trouble.

105
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,400
I know.

106
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,650
I’m trying to figure out what to do.

107
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,130
Whatever it takes,

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,370
we have to make sure he can’t tell anyone.

109
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,440
- Sergeant, check upstairs.
- Got it.

110
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,900
- Check the backyard.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,740
This is strange.

112
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,420
It looks like Director Somsak might have called the killer to this room,

113
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,010
and then an argument broke out.

114
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,450
If they were here in this room,

115
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,890
then where did they go?

116
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,130
I’ll call the Director again.

117
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,050
Corporal,

118
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,430
request access to all CCTV cameras around the neighborhood

119
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,790
from 7 to 8 PM.

120
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,140
Yes, sir.

121
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,340
Doctor, come in! Don’t be shy!

122
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:46,870
Ouch.

123
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,160
- Take it easy.
- Sorry! Ouch, please, sit down. Sit down first.

124
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,400
Hello there!

125
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,580
Doctor, how did you even walk into the door like that?

126
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,690
Good question.

127
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,130
Did the professor really walk into the door? That must hurt!

128
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,490
Just a little.

129
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,310
Oh, Nam.

130
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,550
Let’s clean the wound quickly.

131
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,130
- Sorry to trouble you.
- It’s no trouble.

132
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,660
Doctor,

133
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,760
are you okay?

134
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,990
I’m fine, thank you.

135
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,170
Wiang Singh Police Station

136
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,970
I arrived at Director Somsak’s house at 8 PM sharp, as planned.

137
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,750
But by then, the Director was no longer at home.

138
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,420
His phone signal had disappeared too.

139
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,200
I’m afraid the killer might have harmed him.

140
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,310
We’ve got CCTV footage from the road in front of Director Somsak’s house.

141
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,080
Here it is—let’s watch.

142
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,080
Tew,

143
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,250
is something wrong?

144
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,900
I’m not good at picking out gifts,

145
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,690
but I remember you like coffee.

146
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,920
Happy birthday.

147
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,390
You’re acting like a kid excited about a new toy.

148
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,890
Just a little.

149
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,840
Eat it with the cake.

150
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,280
And what happened to your head?

151
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,570
I slipped and fell in the bathroom,

152
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,490
hit my head on the door.

153
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,000
Let me see…

154
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,940
whoa,

155
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,240
the wound still looks fresh,

156
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,390
like just a few hours ago.

157
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,170
Yeah,

158
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,830
it still hurts.

159
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,310
Did you just touch it?

160
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,920
What were you doing to slip and fall like that?

161
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:47,760
Well,

162
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,290
I finished a meeting with some higher-ups and went to use the restroom.

163
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,430
I accidentally slipped, hit my head on the door,

164
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,370
and when I came to,

165
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,970
I went back to the hospital to get medicine and returned home.

166
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,800
It’s been such a frustrating day,

167
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,610
but you’re the best thing that’s happened today.

168
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,280
After the cake,

169
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,570
let me apply some medicine for you.

170
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,440
Let’s eat the cake first.

171
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,170
We’ve got the CCTV footage from the road in front of Director Somsak’s house.

172
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,400
Stop, stop!

173
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,130
Wait, is that Director Somsak’s car?

174
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,960
Who’s driving it?

175
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,830
This angle isn’t clear,

176
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,100
but the license plate matches.

177
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,530
It left at 19:30,

178
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,870
just before the captain arrived.

179
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,560
After that, there was another car.

180
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,800
Play it forward.

181
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:55,890
Stop!

182
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,430
Can you zoom in on this image?

183
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,860
Can you go back to when this car entered?

184
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,940
This car headed to Director Somsak’s house at 19:02

185
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,490
and left at 19:38,

186
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,700
after the owner’s car had left.

187
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,370
Check the license plate—whose car is it?

188
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:23,780
No need.

189
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,890
I recognize it.

190
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,810
I know whose car this is.

191
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,750
The owner of this car is…

192
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,030
Dr. Kantapat Akkaramethee.

193
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,530
He was the last person to visit the director’s house

194
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,620
before he disappeared.

195
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,280
Mmm.

196
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:04,970
Mmm.

197
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,230
Mmm.

198
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,000
I’m glad

199
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,520
you came today.

200
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,660
It's delicious.

201
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,490
Director,

202
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,050
Director!

203
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,330
Help!

204
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,440
Help, please!

205
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,040
Excuse me, clearing the area now.

206
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,800
Clear the area now, make space.

207
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,230
Excuse me, please step aside, make way.

208
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,210
Please, everyone, move aside. If you’re not involved, head upstairs.

209
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,370
- Sergeant, block the area.
- Got it.

210
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,070
Secure the perimeter.

211
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,920
Please, step aside.

212
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,080
- Let the officers do their work.
- Quickly, please.

213
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,030
Step aside, everyone.

214
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:54,890
Step aside, everyone.

215
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,880
We’re clearing the area first.

216
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,150
Stay where you are.

217
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,050
Let’s take photos of the vehicle,

218
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,800
get every angle.

219
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,020
Sorry, excuse me.

220
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:19,860
Sorry, excuse me.

221
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,680
Captain,

222
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,360
we got a report this morning,

223
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,000
but it looks like the car’s been parked here

224
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,490
since last night.

225
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,160
So that’s where it went—

226
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,690
it’s likely been here all along.

227
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,490
Sorry, excuse me.

228
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,210
Dr. Rin,

229
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,290
are you handling the scene yourself?

230
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,490
I don’t trust anyone but myself.

231
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,530
Go ahead, Doctor.

232
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,410
Thank you.

233
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,770
You're welcome.

234
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,850
The director had asked to meet me at his house at 7 PM.

235
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,830
He said he had something to discuss.

236
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,900
Do you know what it was about?

237
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,630
Yes.

238
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,810
He said I was making too many home visits for patients

239
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,260
and planned to cut the budget for that.

240
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,840
Did you have any arguments or conflicts?

241
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,750
No physical altercation, if that’s what you’re asking.

242
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:43,500
You’re sure?

243
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,650
I noticed…

244
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,230
you have a wound.

245
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,170
I…

246
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,410
had asked to use the restroom,

247
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,580
but I slipped and fell.

248
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,130
My head hit the door handle.

249
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,190
Aha.

250
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,160
The bruise is from hitting something hard,

251
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,410
not from a fight.

252
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,290
What happened next?

253
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,140
I sat there, dazed, for a while.

254
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,660
When I came out,

255
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,920
the director was already gone.

256
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,380
I didn’t know what to do—

257
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,650
I was in pain.

258
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,660
So I decided to stop by the hospital to get medicine.

259
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,510
The emergency room nurse can confirm this.

260
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,130
So you went back to the hospital,

261
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,030
and Director Somsak went there too?

262
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,030
Quite the coincidence.

263
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,640
After getting your wound treated,

264
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,450
did you went anywhere?

265
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,480
It was

266
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,330
my birthday yesterday,

267
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,770
so I stayed in and didn’t go anywhere else.

268
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,860
Is there a witness?

269
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,530
So, Doctor?

270
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,190
Captain Wasan,

271
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,020
should I explain myself, or…

272
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,330
would you like to?

273
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,600
Dr. Kan was indeed at home.

274
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,620
I was there with him from 10:55 PM to midnight.

275
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,060
Yup.

276
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,380
Tew,

277
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:05,310
you’re

278
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,380
not mad at me, are you,

279
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,400
for bringing up our situation?

280
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,490
I’ve never been angry with you for speaking the truth.

281
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,300
- Tew.
- Get home safely.

282
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,400
See you later.

283
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,420
Doctor.

284
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,260
The autopsy results for Director Somsak are in.

285
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,500
We found a needle mark on the back of his left hand.

286
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,380
I believe the killer injected potassium chloride into his vein

287
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,290
to kill him,

288
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,600
the same method used on Mr. Nipon Kongkham.

289
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,020
What’s the motive?

290
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,090
A serial killer?

291
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,730
I don’t think so.

292
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,930
In Director Somsak’s case, the killer likely knew he was going to tell the police their identity

293
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,530
and killed him to silence him.

294
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,570
Why use this method? Both the director and Mr. Nipon

295
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,210
died the same way.

296
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,890
Have you heard of euthanasia?

297
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,850
Injecting potassium chloride into a vein

298
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,190
is a method used for euthanasia.

299
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,510
Director Somsak was strongly opposed to euthanasia.

300
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,890
It’s possible…

301
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,140
the killer

302
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,210
wanted to perform euthanasia on terminally ill patients,

303
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,210
but the director wanted to stop them,

304
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,530
so they killed him as revenge.

305
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,740
Captain, I’m going to speak to some villagers around here

306
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,810
to see if anyone noticed anything unusual.

307
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,300
I’ll come with you. I know this area well.

308
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,360
My mother’s house is just a bit up the hill.

309
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,210
People here are mostly older, so if a stranger comes by,

310
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,450
someone’s bound to notice.

311
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,280
Drive safely, Doctor.

312
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,500
The road is steep.

313
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,630
Don’t worry, I come here often.

314
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,220
By the way, for my mother's stuff,

315
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,650
next time let me know, so you don’t have to come here.

316
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,130
Actually, I also stopped by to see a patient

317
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,010
who happens to live nearby.

318
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,610
Euthanasia refers to a doctor ending the life of a terminally ill patient

319
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,410
to relieve them from pain and suffering.

320
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,370
This term

321
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,040
has sparked significant debate in society.

322
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,210
Today,

323
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,990
I’ve invited a doctor specializing in palliative care to discuss

324
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,290
what euthanasia truly means

325
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,330
and whether Thailand is ready for euthanasia laws.

326
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,450
If you're ready.

327
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,490
Let’s welcome our guest.

328
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,330
How did you get here?

329
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:32,980
Somsak…

330
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:51,650
Hello, Kawin.

331
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,280
Get out here right now, it’s urgent.

332
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,720
I received an email from Director Somsak.

333
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,420
Alright.

334
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,410
Wiang Singh Police Station

335
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,520
July 8th, 8:30 PM.

336
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,650
I received an email

337
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,690
from an account named Somsak Dr.

338
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,490
I verified

339
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,090
that this account belongs to Mr. Somsak La-amornchai,

340
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,720
or Director Somsak.

341
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:19,710
I,

342
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,420
Dr. Somsak La-amornchai,

343
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,420
wrote this letter while in full possession of my mental faculties

344
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,950
and of my own free will,

345
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,290
without any coercion.

346
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,850
I promised the police

347
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,780
I would reveal the identity of the killer targeting terminally ill patients,

348
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,780
but I couldn’t.

349
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,250
I fled

350
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,540
because the killer is me.

351
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,980
I killed Mr. Nipon Kongkham

352
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,410
by injecting potassium chloride into his vein

353
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,520
because I wanted to eliminate them.

354
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,970
Patients who cannot be cured

355
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,020
but are a heavy burden on doctors and nurses,

356
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,110
as well as their loved ones.

357
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,290
What’s wrong with you? Let me go now!

358
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,210
I realize now that what I did was wrong.

359
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,910
I had no right to take someone else’s life.

360
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,830
But I’m too much of a coward to face legal consequences.

361
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:40,940
Let go!

362
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,890
So I’m ending my own life,

363
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,770
using the same method I used to kill them.

364
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,060
I ask for forgiveness

365
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,210
from everyone.

366
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,810
Who would have thought that a doctor could kill patients?

367
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,170
I’ve verified that

368
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,580
this email was indeed sent from Director Somsak’s account,

369
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,130
from the device left in his car.

370
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,409
Judging by the timing,

371
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,290
he likely took his own life immediately after sending the email.

372
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,219
We’ve investigated for so long,

373
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,850
and it ends just like that?

374
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,969
Alright, case closed.

375
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,560
What do you mean?

376
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:24,980
No matter what,

377
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,530
the suspect confessed.

378
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,460
It all adds up.

379
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,420
Kawin,

380
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,570
prepare to close the case.

381
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,020
Yes, sir.

382
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,180
The director killed the patients

383
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:11,970
and then killed himself.

384
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,130
That’s what the police concluded, right?

385
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,080
The police haven’t officially concluded yet, but the nurses are gossiping about it non-stop.

386
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,670
Concluding it that way is careless.

387
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,890
Here they come.

388
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,770
Good day, everyone.

389
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,590
Thank you for coming.

390
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,830
Let me read the statement first, and then you can ask your questions.

391
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,180
This isn’t a major story, but it’s quite intriguing.

392
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,530
At Wiang Singh Police Station in Lampang Province,

393
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,760
there’s a case involving terminal patients dying prematurely.

394
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,330
The police have been investigating the suspect.

395
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,740
Today, at 10 AM, at Wiang Singh Police Station in Lampang,

396
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,390
Police Colonel Tienchai Wirultham, the station chief,

397
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,250
provided an update on the case.

398
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,740
The police attempted to arrest Dr. Somsak,

399
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,930
but he fled

400
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,740
and committed suicide by injecting himself with a toxic substance.

401
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,930
He passed away

402
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,010
before officers found his body the following morning.

403
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,570
What’s wrong,

404
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,650
Captain? Calm down.

405
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,500
Don’t you think this is a little too easy?

406
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,210
Hey.

407
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,550
Sometimes it’s fine to have a simple conclusion.

408
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,330
No one else is dead,

409
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,500
so let’s wrap this up. There are plenty of other cases to handle.

410
00:36:59,110 --> 00:36:59,410
Wow,

411
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,560
so full of energy!

412
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,260
Who would believe that a doctor, someone who cares for patients,

413
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,780
could turn out to be the one killing them?

414
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,170
Could this be linked to the issue of the shortage of medical staff?

415
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,490
Indeed, this problem has been ongoing for a long time—

416
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,570
whether it’s the insufficient number of doctors being trained

417
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,170
or the inability to retain them in the system.

418
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:29,850
This has led to medical personnel being overworked to the breaking point.

419
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,810
But none of that justifies this.

420
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,370
Doctor,

421
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,770
are you okay?

422
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,540
That letter in the news—it’s fake. You know that.

423
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,120
So what?

424
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,040
I believe…

425
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,780
the person who wrote that letter is

426
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,690
the one who killed the director.

427
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,000
I’m also quite sure they’re the one who killed Mr. Nipon Kongkham.

428
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:29,780
Doctor,

429
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,150
the police have closed the case,

430
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,180
and you’re in the clear now.

431
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,460
Why act suspicious?

432
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,230
On.

433
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,210
Doctor,

434
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,220
the person who killed Director Somsak may be guilty,

435
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,560
but they also helped you.

436
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,210
From now on, things will be easier for you.

437
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,320
Your relationship with Captain Wasan

438
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,020
won’t face any obstacles.

439
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:15,880
But…

440
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,330
Doctor,

441
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,740
trust me.

442
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,090
Don’t bring the police into this.

443
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,090
I know

444
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,530
who stole the potassium chloride.

445
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,560
I know

446
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,140
who the killer is.

447
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,170
Lieutenant,

448
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,410
I’m sure.

449
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,970
The day the director talked to me about the killer, he definitely wasn’t referring to himself.

450
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,590
Captain,

451
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,750
I followed the boss.

452
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,900
But if you can’t settle this,

453
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,670
you’ll have to go out turn right

454
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,490
go upstairs to the second floor and talk about it yourself.

455
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,000
Got it.

456
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,530
Won’t the superintendent be angry, Lieutenant?

457
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,010
He won’t.

458
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,090
He’s not here.

459
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,890
He’s probably at his kid’s school event today.

460
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,730
He's choosing this option, huh?

461
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:57,900
Did you get to talk?

462
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,270
Don’t move.

463
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:37,930
Turn around slowly!

464
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,010
Turn around slowly!

465
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:56,870
Tew.

466
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,250
Doctor!

467
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,150
What are you doing here?

468
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,670
If I tell you,

469
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,410
will you believe me?

470
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,200
Try me.

471
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:34,680
That day,

472
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,580
when I was unconscious,

473
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,920
I think I heard voices.

474
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,280
I couldn’t make sense of it because I was too dizzy,

475
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,330
but I’m sure

476
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,520
someone else came in after me.

477
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,740
I think that person is the one who took the director out.

478
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,080
But the CCTV footage

479
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,770
only shows your car entering the premises at that time.

480
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,140
Then it’s possible…

481
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,550
that person came in and drove the director’s car out.

482
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,710
It’s possible.

483
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,850
I came back here

484
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,930
because I want to find out who that person is.

485
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,290
I came to see if there’s any evidence left behind.

486
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,160
Alright,

487
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:38,930
follow me.

488
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:04,740
You probably went to the restroom

489
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,710
and lost consciousness there because it’s the closest.

490
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,320
I had the officers check for fingerprints everywhere.

491
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,130
There’s nothing.

492
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,270
No one used that restroom

493
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,490
except Director Somsak.

494
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,640
Are you saying…

495
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:33,720
you didn’t believe me from the start?

496
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,600
Don’t pretend to be mad.

497
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,530
That tactic won’t work on me this time.

498
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:42,580
I just don’t believe

499
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,790
Director Somsak killed himself.

500
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:46,880
And I think the same as you—

501
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,170
that someone might have come in and taken him out of here.

502
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,330
I even considered

503
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,870
that your slip and fall

504
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,530
might have been caused by someone making the floor slippery.

505
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,130
I’ve come up with all sorts of hypotheses.

506
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,340
But there’s one thing I never thought of.

507
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:10,800
I never thought you would lie to me.

508
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,490
(OneD Original)

509
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,020
Tew,

510
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,210
you have to trust me.

511
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,320
Director Somsak would never kill himself, Tew.

512
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,760
The director and I were in love.

513
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,840
I don’t think he would really do that.

514
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,450
I heard the director calling someone’s name.

515
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,660
That’s impossible.

516
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:05,520
On,

517
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,110
do you believe in karma?

518
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,980
If I could turn back time,

519
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:12,460
I would do the same thing.

520
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,730
That person must be the one who killed the director.

521
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,100
This time, give me the truth.

522
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,080
There’s nothing truer than this.
