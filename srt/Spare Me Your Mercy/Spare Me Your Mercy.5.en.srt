1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,970
And what happened to your head?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,790
I slipped and fell in the bathroom,

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,770
hit my head on the door.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,750
Help, please!

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:08,940
I received an email

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,530
belongs to Mr. Somsak La-amornchai,

7
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,010
but he fled

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,760
and committed suicide by injecting himself with a toxic substance.

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,410
That letter in the news—it’s fake.

10
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,800
the police have closed the case,

11
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,510
Why act suspicious?

12
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:21,680
Don’t move.

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,730
Tew.

14
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:23,890
Doctor.

15
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,170
I had the officers check for fingerprints everywhere.

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,810
No one used that restroom

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,020
except Director Somsak.

18
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,460
I never thought you would lie to me.

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,210
These handcuffs are…

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,960
pretty sexy, Tew.

21
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,260
But not really my style.

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,090
Or should we head to the station?

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,350
Answer me.

24
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,810
On July 8th, between 7 PM and 9 PM,

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,870
what were you doing and where were you?

26
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,800
This time, tell the truth.

27
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,560
That day,

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,120
the director asked me to meet him at his house at 7 PM.

29
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,840
He accused me of killing Mr. Nipon Kongkham.

30
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,329
Because you’re a doctor,

31
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,950
you know how to use that substance,

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,470
and you believe in euthanasia.

33
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:13,970
Yes,

34
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,070
but I didn’t do it, Tew.

35
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,850
That day, I tried to leave,

36
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,650
but the director threatened me with a gun.

37
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,010
The wound on my head? That’s from when the director hit me with the gun.

38
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,840
Before I lost consciousness,

39
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,720
I heard someone else come into the house.

40
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,480
But when I woke up, everyone was gone.

41
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,680
The next day,

42
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,850
the director was dead.

43
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,070
There’s no way the director killed himself, Tew.

44
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,230
He opposed abortion, euthanasia—everything.

45
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,440
He’d be the last person on earth to commit suicide.

46
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,780
That letter is fake.

47
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,180
I thought the same.

48
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,170
I went back there

49
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,310
because I believed

50
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,380
the person who came in was the one who killed the director.

51
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,750
I wanted to see if there was any evidence left that could reveal who they were.

52
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:26,830
Tew,

53
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,740
you have to trust me.

54
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,460
There’s nothing more truthful than this.

55
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,320
What is it, Joe?

56
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,140
Do you have more leads?

57
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:17,840
What’s your blood type?

58
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,210
Why are you asking?

59
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,850
I’m asking what your blood type is.

60
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,810
O.

61
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,030
Do you have proof?

62
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,190
I have my blood donor card in my pocket.

63
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,030
I’ll let you go this time.

64
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,570
Tew,

65
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,940
the person you’re looking for—what’s their blood type?

66
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,250
Tew.

67
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,920
Wiang Singh Police Station.

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,380
Captain,

69
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,310
reporting in.

70
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,250
We found hair at the scene

71
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,300
that doesn’t belong to the victim.

72
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,760
Lab results show it belongs to someone around 25 to 30 years old,

73
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,250
blood type AB.

74
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,250
Who is it?

75
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,050
Here,

76
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,010
is this you trying to make it up to me?

77
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,300
I actually ordered this for your birthday,

78
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,710
but with everything going on, I didn’t get a chance to give it to you.

79
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,210
Wow,

80
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,880
this is cute.

81
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:24,730
Perfect.

82
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,180
Now I can stop borrowing the nurses’ pens to chew on.

83
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,040
Thanks.

84
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,720
Now,

85
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,300
answer my question.

86
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,040
Umm.

87
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,990
So much for the sweet moment.

88
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,230
The person you mentioned,

89
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,530
what do you remember about them?

90
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,570
I didn’t see his face,

91
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,300
and I didn’t hear his voice clearly.

92
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:02,930
Him?

93
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,580
It was a man, wasn’t it?

94
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,900
I’m not sure.

95
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,890
But I think I heard the director speaking.

96
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,870
Professor!

97
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,250
How did you get here?

98
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,299
What did you do, Somsak?

99
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,450
What are you planning to do to Dr. Kan?

100
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,760
Stay out of this.

101
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,270
What did you do?

102
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,450
What’s wrong?

103
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,730
Professor!

104
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,820
How did you get here?

105
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,490
Boss!

106
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,550
Impossible.

107
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,010
What?

108
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,820
What did the director say?

109
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,700
I think…

110
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,010
I heard the director

111
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,490
calling someone’s name.

112
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,560
Boss.

113
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,890
Boss?

114
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,480
Captain Wasan

115
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,740
is very persistent.

116
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,490
That’s how young, ambitious people are.

117
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,980
Suddenly, there’s a lead

118
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,650
suggesting that Director Somsak didn’t commit suicide

119
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,900
but was murdered.

120
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,590
Aren’t you going inside?

121
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,930
Did you come to see the director?

122
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,850
No,

123
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,850
I came to see you.

124
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,810
Mr. Chanchai Maneerat,

125
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,570
on July 8, 2024,

126
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,210
between 7:30 PM and 9 PM,

127
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,420
what were you doing and where were you?

128
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,790
I was at home.

129
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,010
Do you have a witness?

130
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,340
Then I might need to take a sample of your hair and DNA

131
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,100
to include in the case review.

132
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,640
What crime am I being accused of?

133
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,890
A strand of male hair was found in Director Somsak’s room.

134
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,210
And witnesses confirm that

135
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,330
someone met with the director before he disappeared and later died.

136
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,850
We have information that you, Mr. Chanchai, were close enough to the director to have access to his house.

137
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,970
Additionally, Director Somsak’s phone records

138
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,130
show that he contacted you daily

139
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,900
before his death.

140
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,610
So, I need your cooperation.

141
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,280
Do you think I killed the director?

142
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,090
A DNA test will confirm if you, Chanchai Maneerat, were at the scene that day.

143
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,610
I’ll give you until Friday, Captain.

144
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,450
If there’s no concrete evidence by then,

145
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,090
you must drop this matter entirely.

146
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,240
Understood.

147
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,330
I’ve heard that Director Somsak personally helped Pharmacist Boss get his job at the hospital.

148
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,450
You could say he was a benefactor.

149
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,210
Doctor, are you sure you heard correctly?

150
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,770
I’m not sure.

151
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,800
But what I am sure of is that the person who entered the director’s house that night

152
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,070
must have been someone close to him, someone who frequently visited that house.

153
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,930
Then we’ll have to wait for the test results to confirm.

154
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,400
In the meantime, if you remember anything,

155
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,430
let me know immediately.

156
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,210
I only have two days left.

157
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,740
Joe, what’s the result?

158
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,920
The hair belongs to Pharmacist Chanchai Maneerat?

159
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:58,890
Good.

160
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,390
Notify the investigators. See you soon.

161
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,450
So, it really was Pharmacist Boss?

162
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,900
That night, I was at the director’s house.

163
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,890
The director planned to hand Dr. Kan over to the police.

164
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,710
Professor!

165
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,680
How did you get here, Boss?

166
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,970
I couldn’t let him do that.

167
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,150
Why not?

168
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,270
Because Dr. Kan isn’t the murderer.

169
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,730
Someone as good as him couldn’t kill anyone.

170
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,540
Then who is the murderer?

171
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,410
Director Somsak.

172
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,730
The KCL that went missing

173
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,450
from the pharmacy room—

174
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,820
I stole it

175
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,730
under his orders.

176
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,250
I didn’t know what he planned to do with it until…

177
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,820
until Mr. Nipon Kongkham died.

178
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,050
That night, the director tricked Dr. Kan into coming to his house

179
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,340
to hand him over to the police,

180
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,940
making him take the blame.

181
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,880
I couldn’t let that happen.

182
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,170
I stopped him.

183
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,740
I forced him to confess.

184
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,240
Professor, turn yourself in to the police.

185
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,300
But he refused.

186
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,060
Calm down, Professor.

187
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,010
He said

188
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,690
he’s a doctor,

189
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,730
a person of honor.

190
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,000
I have dignity and pride. You can’t treat me like a criminal.

191
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,290
He won’t rot in jail.

192
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,750
Then he threatened to kill himself.

193
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,740
If I go to jail, I’d rather die.

194
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,050
I didn’t think he’d actually do it.

195
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,060
If Director Somsak was the murderer,

196
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,710
wouldn’t it have been easier for him to kill you to silence you?

197
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,060
Why would he commit suicide?

198
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,810
He couldn’t kill me, Captain.

199
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,810
Director Somsak and I…

200
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,550
we were in love.

201
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,150
He loved me too much to kill me, Captain.

202
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,990
We found evidence of what Chanchai claimed.

203
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,250
Director Somsak’s phone

204
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,800
had several photos of the two of them together.

205
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,850
Additionally, Chanchai’s financial records show years of transfers

206
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,270
to support him, confirming his claim.

207
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,590
Is this case closed now, Captain?

208
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,330
If there’s nothing more, I’m done here.

209
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,610
The personal matters of Director Somsak don’t need to be discussed further.

210
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,420
He was a good doctor.

211
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,170
I feel sorry for him.

212
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,290
Thank you for your cooperation.

213
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,340
I wouldn’t dare pursue this

214
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,690
if I didn’t know him well.

215
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,100
What Somsak hated most

216
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,950
was death.

217
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,090
Professor!

218
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,120
How did you get here?

219
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:54,960
Boss!

220
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,610
What are you doing, Somsak?

221
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,750
What are you planning to do to Dr. Kan?

222
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,330
Stay out of this!

223
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,520
I’m going to turn him over to the police.

224
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:13,820
No!

225
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,450
I won’t let you do that.

226
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,200
This is between me and Dr. Kan. It’s none of your business.

227
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,140
Let him go, Somsak.

228
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,790
Let Dr. Kan go!

229
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,380
It’s pointless.

230
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:27,990
It’s pointless.

231
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,100
In a few minutes, the police will be here.

232
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,360
You can’t save him.

233
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,360
I’ll tell them everything I know.

234
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,250
Dr. Kan will go to jail.

235
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,000
And if you don’t want to get in trouble too,

236
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,220
drop the gun!

237
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,280
Why?

238
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,560
Boss, what are you doing?

239
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,580
What’s going on?

240
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,330
Come with me peacefully, Somsak.

241
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,490
Let go.

242
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,970
Let me go!

243
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,500
Somsak, listen to me.

244
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,290
Trust and follow what I say,

245
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,720
and you’ll be safe.

246
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,020
What’s wrong with you?

247
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,420
Let me go now!

248
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,620
Dr. Kan did the right thing.

249
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,690
Those patients were terminally ill.

250
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,050
They were going to die soon, Somsak.

251
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,580
But they weren’t dead yet!

252
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,420
We’re doctors! Our duty is to prolong the lives of our patients!

253
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,090
For what?

254
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,490
The longer we extend their lives,

255
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,390
the more everyone suffers.

256
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,650
Their families suffer.

257
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,850
Doctors and nurses are overwhelmed.

258
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,300
Sometimes, lives are ruined because of a single terminally ill patient.

259
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,210
For what?

260
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,570
For humanity, Boss!

261
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,180
Everyone has the right to live,

262
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,210
no matter how dire their life may be.

263
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,140
Boss.

264
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,650
Boss.

265
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,520
Boss, you’re misguided.

266
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,450
Do you think Dr. Kan is a hero?

267
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,660
He’s a murderer!

268
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,860
He broke the law!

269
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,250
We can’t let him go!

270
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,210
Let me go.

271
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:35,870
Let me go.

272
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,170
Let me go.

273
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,260
Let me go, Boss!

274
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:57,970
Oh.

275
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,190
Hello, Doctor. On.

276
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,030
- Hello.
- Hi there.

277
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,840
Please, come inside.

278
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:10,980
You all wait here for now.

279
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,080
Take turns going up so the patient doesn’t feel overwhelmed.

280
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,290
Got it.

281
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,700
Urai Dansom, a terminal lung cancer patient.

282
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,820
Hello, Ms. Urai.

283
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,850
Hello.

284
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,800
I heard from Cream that you wanted to make a Living Will?

285
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,950
Yes.

286
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,430
I heard…

287
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,790
there’s a document

288
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,490
that…

289
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,740
we can prepare

290
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,170
to instruct doctors not to intervene when we’re dying, to just let us go peacefully. Is that true?

291
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,490
Right, Doctor?

292
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,330
Yes.

293
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,970
That’s correct. It’s called a Living Will.

294
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,920
Another term for it is

295
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,110
a Declaration of Intent Not to Receive Life-Prolonging Medical Treatment.

296
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,650
It’s meant to prevent unnecessary suffering

297
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,770
in the final stage of life.

298
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,870
Or simply, a Declaration of Intent.

299
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,290
Here you go.

300
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,470
This is what it looks like, Urai.

301
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:57,530
Alright,

302
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,410
download the form and fill it out like this.

303
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,530
But…

304
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,190
if something happens to me suddenly,

305
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,420
and neither the doctor nor On is around,

306
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,060
will they let me go peacefully?

307
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,830
Here’s an idea:

308
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,210
fill out this form and save the file on your phone.

309
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,680
Then have Cream keep it safe.

310
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,700
If the time comes,

311
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,770
show that file to the medical staff.

312
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,300
Under Section 12 of the National Health Act,

313
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,500
healthcare professionals

314
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,280
are legally required to respect your wishes without any legal consequences.

315
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:02,960
That’s good.

316
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,530
If staying alive only burdens Cream, I’d rather not stay.

317
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,450
You’re not a burden to me.

318
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,060
Don’t cry so much. I’m not going anywhere yet.

319
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,690
They’ve passed a law allowing us to get married now.

320
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,090
I’ll

321
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,130
marry you before I go.

322
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,150
We’ve done our best, Doctor.

323
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,810
Whatever happens next is up to karma.

324
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,850
Karma?

325
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,250
Urai

326
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,160
has lung cancer because of PM 2.5 pollution.

327
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,060
No one should have to die just from breathing.

328
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,330
Urai

329
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,380
is surely suffering greatly—I know.

330
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,930
But she’s just choosing not to say anything.

331
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,060
Should we ask her

332
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,490
if she wants our help?

333
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,490
The Captain isn’t suspicious of you anymore, right?

334
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:17,550
Wiang Singh Hospital

335
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:23,790
Oh,

336
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,480
Grandma,

337
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,000
wasn’t your appointment next month?

338
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,950
She lost her medication, Doctor.

339
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,280
I see.

340
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,090
Here you go.

341
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,090
Thank you.

342
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,220
Hello!

343
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,690
So, did you lose the meds, or

344
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,300
did you throw them away?

345
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,930
Doctor, you’re so perceptive.

346
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,770
I’ll write a new prescription.

347
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:57,770
Alright?

348
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,030
Here you go, Professor.

349
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,630
What about my pen?

350
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,180
Do you have one?

351
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,090
Usually, you borrow ours.

352
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,190
I have one today,

353
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,050
but I must have left it in the ward.

354
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,740
- Can I borrow yours for now?
- Sure.

355
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,990
Let me see.

356
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,890
I don’t see it here.

357
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,740
Maybe someone else took it, and we didn’t notice?

358
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,810
I was planning to meet him today

359
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,480
and wanted to bring it to show off.

360
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,780
Then should you just say it’s missing?

361
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:45,760
No,

362
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,010
it’s my birthday gift.

363
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,890
It wouldn’t feel right to say that.

364
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,440
- Doctor?
- Yes?

365
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,930
Do you have a moment before your date?

366
00:29:59,480 --> 00:29:59,680
What’s up?

367
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,470
It’s about Urai.

368
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,810
Has she completed her Living Will?

369
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,390
I had her redo it,

370
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,850
- but Cream isn’t on board with the idea.
- Urai, wait.

371
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,410
Cream, please, hold on.

372
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,000
It’s okay. We can redo it.

373
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,810
Living Wills can be made at any time.

374
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,350
She'll delete it anyway.

375
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,380
Everyone has the right to decide for their own body.

376
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,210
No matter how much we love them,

377
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,890
we have to respect their decisions.

378
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,370
If the family doesn’t agree, it’ll be difficult to do anything,

379
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,970
even if they’re admitted to the hospital.

380
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,850
Or should we help her?

381
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,890
One moment.

382
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:36,970
Doctor,

383
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,040
you work tirelessly at the hospital

384
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,890
and don’t even run a private clinic like others.

385
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,010
How are you so wealthy?

386
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,570
Actually, my family owns a medical equipment company.

387
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,940
I’m the only son.

388
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,370
Do you know you’ve hit the jackpot?

389
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,120
The pen you gave me—

390
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,970
I keep it safe at home.

391
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,440
I don’t dare use it; I’m afraid it’ll wear out.

392
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,240
I don’t dare use it.

393
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,030
Hey.

394
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,320
Use it.

395
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,410
I’ll get you a new one next year.

396
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,810
Now you’re making me wish it were next year already.

397
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,260
So...

398
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,410
why didn’t you stay in Bangkok and live the life of a privileged heir? What brought you here?

399
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,640
My dad doesn't approve of my preferences.

400
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,890
Tew, you’re lucky to have had such an open-minded mother.

401
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,110
If she were still here, it would be wonderful.

402
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,880
If she’s watching over you from the heavens

403
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,220
and sees you with me,

404
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,020
I think she’d be happy.

405
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,380
Doctor,

406
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,440
give me a little more time.

407
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,320
I understand.

408
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,770
Let’s head back.

409
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,840
It’ll get late by the time we reach Wiang Singh.

410
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:26,449
Sure,

411
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:29,659
I’ve got some things to do too.

412
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,440
Doctor?

413
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,140
Not today, Doctor.

414
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,210
Cream!

415
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,450
Yes, On?

416
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,060
Ms. Cream.

417
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,530
Doctor, On.

418
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,660
Today is actually our wedding day.

419
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,970
And where’s Urai?

420
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,330
She’s still in bed.

421
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,920
No one has touched her.

422
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,400
I told her to wait for you.

423
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,610
Alright, may I?

424
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,890
Better not.

425
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,380
Tew,

426
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,720
was there a report to the police?

427
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,320
Given the circumstances,

428
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,160
I suggested to the authorities that…

429
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,410
in cases of reported deaths

430
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,490
involving terminally ill patients,

431
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,700
a post-mortem examination should be conducted in every case.

432
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:41,970
Excuse me.

433
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,090
I didn’t expect to see you here, Doctor.

434
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,770
Ms. Urai was under my care.

435
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,010
That’s right—

436
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,420
you oversee all terminal patients in this hospital.

437
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,220
I forgot.

438
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,130
Captain, please come this way.

439
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,160
Sergeant.

440
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,820
Ms. Urai Dansom,

441
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,570
passed away last night around midnight.

442
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,800
I need to take the body for an autopsy

443
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,460
to determine the exact cause of death.

444
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,570
But this isn’t normal.

445
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:39,850
Why is that?

446
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,030
We found this item next to her bed.

447
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,530
(OneD Original)

448
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,320
Captain,

449
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,640
the doctor didn’t do anything. He’s being framed.

450
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,410
You know him well.

451
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,890
I’m not taking sides with the suspect.

452
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,890
I’m just asking routine questions.

453
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,810
But aren’t you two acting a little too defensive?

454
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,530
Captain, you should step away from this case.

455
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,780
The doctor is still a suspect.

456
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,320
Doctor, do you suspect anyone?

457
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,650
Honestly, On,

458
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,350
I think I only suspect one person.

459
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,060
I need Mr. Som.

460
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,750
He’s the only one I believe has seen the killer’s face.
