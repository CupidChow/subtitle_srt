1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,480
Doctor!

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,690
Does the Captain know how his mother died yet?

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:14,970
How is Boss?

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,210
He’s still alive.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,430
Mr. Chanchai Maneerat.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,170
When you say you killed everyone,

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,780
does that include my mother?

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,050
He can’t know about this.

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,320
If you don’t want the Captain to know the truth,

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,360
shut up

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,770
and kill me.

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,600
I’ve never felt guilty

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,900
about performing euthanasia.

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,940
On the contrary, I felt relief

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,390
knowing I ended my patients' suffering,

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,810
even though it was risky.

17
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,680
When a horse is injured,

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,730
we can euthanize it.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,940
But doing so for humans is still illegal.

20
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,010
Just the fact that you risked helping me,

21
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,300
I don’t know how to repay you.

22
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:50,890
Doctor.

23
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,130
Yes?

24
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,320
I carry this sacred monk medallion with me all the time.

25
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,280
I’d like to give it to you.

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,840
Um, Mr. Songkran,

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,830
I really can’t accept this.

28
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,250
If you don’t take it, I won’t rest in peace.

29
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,050
Please, keep it.

30
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,870
No, please take it.

31
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,650
Wiang Singh Hospital

32
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,730
Are you Captain Wasan?

33
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,410
Yes, that’s me.

34
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,550
I’m Umaporn,

35
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,490
the new director.

36
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,110
Hello.

37
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,530
We’ve been informed by the hospital

38
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,730
that Pharmacist Chanchai Maneerat has passed away.

39
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:47,870
Yes.

40
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,350
It seems he suffered complications after surgery.

41
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,780
The doctors tried their best to resuscitate him, but they couldn’t save him.

42
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,170
Pharmacist Chanchai passed away at 3:15 AM.

43
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,380
Like they said, Tew,

44
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,340
Pharmacist Boss was a critical patient.

45
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,490
Death due to complications is common.

46
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,209
It all seems normal.

47
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,410
Before he died…

48
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,730
Boss confessed to all charges, didn’t he?

49
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,080
So…

50
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,200
why are you still worried?

51
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,630
I just want to know

52
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,600
if he killed my mother too.

53
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:50,890
Why

54
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,980
do you think someone

55
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,700
killed your mom?

56
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,620
Her profile

57
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,090
matches all the victims:

58
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,490
a terminally ill patient

59
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,610
who died prematurely.

60
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:14,630
But

61
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,050
you don’t have evidence to prove your mom was murdered,

62
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,210
do you?

63
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,850
Not really, no.

64
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,610
But it still bothers me.

65
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,420
Tew,

66
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,650
don’t get mad if I’m honest.

67
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,120
Could it be that you feel guilty

68
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,030
for not being there for your mom’s final moments?

69
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,490
Is it?

70
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,090
Sometimes

71
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,750
we want to blame someone else

72
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,530
for how things turned out.

73
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,030
Your mom’s at peace now, Tew.

74
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,810
You need to move on,

75
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,570
or

76
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,490
you won’t be happy.

77
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,330
And what do you think?

78
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,910
About my mom, I still trust my instincts.

79
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,910
But since there’s no evidence,

80
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,370
maybe I should do what the doctor said—

81
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,770
move on.

82
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,130
That’s good.

83
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,090
Welcome home.

84
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,420
Didn’t you say you’re not good at things like this?

85
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,370
I can do it,

86
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,919
just don’t want to do it often.

87
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,690
Wouldn’t want you falling for me too much.

88
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,110
Stay with me, Tew.

89
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,330
I’m here, aren’t I?

90
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,350
No,

91
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,020
I mean…

92
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,810
stay with me, Tew.

93
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:23,820
Oh.

94
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,050
Why?

95
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,630
Or…

96
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,670
have I been imagining things all along?

97
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,650
No,

98
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,110
you haven’t.

99
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:36,910
Oh.

100
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,730
Then…

101
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,780
I

102
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,810
don’t fall for people easily, Doctor.

103
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,090
Can I trust you, Doctor?

104
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,850
Hmm…

105
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,550
I won’t let you down, Tew.

106
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,200
I promise.

107
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:08,690
Sorry,

108
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:09,640
I…

109
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,670
I’ll go grab your meds.

110
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,590
Uh…

111
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,170
No need.

112
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:49,600
I allow it.

113
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,250
Coffee.

114
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,920
Dr. Kantapat Akkaramethee

115
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,490
Dr. Pirot Kunawan

116
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,880
Nontrarak Hospital

117
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,120
Patient ID: HN012482/2557

118
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,130
Patient name: Mr. Pirot Kunawan

119
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,770
Dr. Pirot Kunawan

120
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,390
was my professor during medical school.

121
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,800
I met him again

122
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,770
while training in palliative care.

123
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,720
He was a terminal cancer patient under my care.

124
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,940
That’s Kantapat, isn’t it?

125
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:29,590
Yes.

126
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,210
I studied under you, Professor.

127
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,950
I remember you.

128
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,470
You really became a palliative care doctor, just like you said.

129
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,030
Dr. Pirot was the first patient

130
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,850
I euthanized.

131
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,110
Apart from Director Somsak,

132
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,060
I didn’t think anyone knew about this.

133
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,250
A blank paper.

134
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,300
Why would it send this?

135
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
What’s it trying to say?

136
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,920
I think it’s a threat,

137
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,290
like it’s trying to mess with my head.

138
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Doctor, can you guess who it might be?

139
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,650
I’m really not sure.

140
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,130
But

141
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,330
I can’t tell Tew about this.

142
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,270
Especially now.

143
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,180
Things between us are going so well.

144
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,070
I don’t want to ruin it.

145
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,690
Doctor, it’s just a blank piece of paper.

146
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,849
There’s no evidence. Don’t let it bother you.

147
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:29,980
Oh.

148
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,930
Hello, Doctor. Back already?

149
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,460
Yes.

150
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:21,940
Oh.

151
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:22,890
Doctor!

152
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,890
Hello, are you feeling better?

153
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,530
Much better now.

154
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,030
Doctors don’t take long breaks; they worry about their patients.

155
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,050
Take care!

156
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,590
Thank you.

157
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,610
Welcome back to the hospital.

158
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,020
Eh!

159
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,570
The monk passed away.

160
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,480
While you were recovering.

161
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,470
He refused all treatment.

162
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,420
It must have been painful.

163
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,690
Not at all.

164
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,910
On the morning he passed,

165
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,890
he was so clear-minded,

166
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,230
he blessed everyone in the ward.

167
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,330
Then he meditated.

168
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,490
By evening, he passed away peacefully.

169
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
He left a message for you, Doctor:

170
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,890
Don’t cling to the pain.

171
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,890
The mind and body

172
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,710
can be separate.

173
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,670
If the mind doesn’t acknowledge the pain,

174
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,330
it remains with the body.

175
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,330
And thus, it doesn’t cause suffering.

176
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,950
I’m back.

177
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,740
Right here.

178
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,140
Oh.

179
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,970
Hey, Tew, did you visit your mom’s house again?

180
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:51,790
No,

181
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,890
Sa went.

182
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,210
This was probably the last time.

183
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:57,030
Oh.

184
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,470
Why?

185
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,400
Sa said she sold it to someone in the village.

186
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,060
No one was left to take care of it.

187
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,410
I see.

188
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,770
It’s okay.

189
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,610
We can

190
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,370
plant it ourselves at our house.

191
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:20,820
Sure.

192
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,570
I’ll put these

193
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,870
in a vase first.

194
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,010
Sure.

195
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,010
Doctor,

196
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,150
you got some mail.

197
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,880
Dr. Kantapat Akkaramethee.

198
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,350
What’s mine is with you.

199
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,880
In the event that I

200
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,690
am permanently unconscious,

201
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,030
or second

202
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,010
I

203
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,250
am permanently confused

204
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,870
and unable to remember anything,

205
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,610
or third

206
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,050
unable to live

207
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,230
normally anymore,

208
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,280
consider that

209
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,670
as the final stage of my life.

210
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:23,590
Professor,

211
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,250
does this Living Will

212
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,660
really work?

213
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,650
It does.

214
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,340
But whether I’ll endure until that day, I’m not sure.

215
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,550
This bone cancer…

216
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,950
it’s unbearable.

217
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,410
Then…

218
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,290
should I increase your sleeping meds?

219
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,050
Why don’t you just give me something

220
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,170
to make sure I never wake up again?

221
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,410
Professor,

222
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,710
what did you just say?

223
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,050
Professor.

224
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:49,680
Hmm?

225
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,500
Are you certain about this?

226
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,570
You realize…

227
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,610
this would make me

228
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,430
your executioner.

229
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,130
Kan,

230
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,190
do you remember the nightmare you told me about?

231
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,630
Do you recall

232
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:19,610
how much pain

233
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,650
your mother endured that night?

234
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,210
Think of me as your mother.

235
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,370
Inject me,

236
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,950
and let’s end this suffering together, Kan.

237
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:56,810
Yes, Professor.

238
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,690
Take the record sleeve with you.

239
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,850
You just touched it with your bare hands,

240
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,690
so your fingerprints

241
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,090
are on it.

242
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:30,000
Understood.

243
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:35,970
Remember, Kan,

244
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,530
you must be very careful,

245
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,310
just as I taught you.

246
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,650
That way, no one will ever catch you.

247
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,170
Yes, Professor.

248
00:29:59,760 --> 00:29:59,970
Oh,

249
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,010
leaving already?

250
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,570
Giving up so easily.

251
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,820
When someone’s near death,

252
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,370
some cases show a brief period of remarkable clarity.

253
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,270
Tew, did you stop by your mother’s house?

254
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,670
If she’s watching you from above,

255
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,690
and she sees you with me,

256
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,400
I think she’d be happy.

257
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,190
Why do you think

258
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,550
your mother was murdered?

259
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,510
Your mom has found peace now, Tew.

260
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,410
You need to move on.

261
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,490
I like the meaning behind it.

262
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,730
Blue hydrangeas—

263
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,950
they symbolize forgiveness.

264
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,830
Hello.

265
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,590
Oh, Doctor!

266
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,090
I just came to check on something I left here.

267
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,690
Oh, it’s

268
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,810
untouched.

269
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,650
I made sure no one went near it

270
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,400
as per your instructions.

271
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,210
Thank you.

272
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,380
No problem.

273
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,290
Doctor Rin,

274
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,489
you actually came.

275
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,630
You summoned me;

276
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,270
how could I not?

277
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,490
I didn’t expect

278
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,690
you’d remember your father’s typewriter.

279
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,000
That typewriter

280
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,250
reminded me of

281
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,590
when I typed your father’s daughter’s name:

282
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,250
Supaporn Duangnet.

283
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,390
You use your mother’s surname, don’t you?

284
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:35,920
Yes.

285
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,090
My mother hated my father so much

286
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,950
that she refused to let me have anything to do with him,

287
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,090
even sharing his name.

288
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,110
But I guessed right—

289
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,310
you were close to my father.

290
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:53,150
Yes.

291
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,570
He was both my professor

292
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,070
and my patient.

293
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,010
Then you must remember

294
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,140
his favorite song,

295
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,250
Northern Breeze.

296
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,520
Of course.

297
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,170
He played it until the day he passed.

298
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,540
When his body was found,

299
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,630
the record was still on the player.

300
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,740
But the sleeve wasn’t in his hand

301
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,510
or even in the room.

302
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,010
It ended up with you.

303
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,990
You were the last person with him before he died, weren’t you?

304
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,770
Tew.

305
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,300
My father—

306
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,330
Did you perform euthanasia for him?

307
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,270
Your father passed away peacefully,

308
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,130
in accordance with his wishes.

309
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,240
Alright.

310
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,420
Got it.

311
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,750
My father told you to do it.

312
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,000
No wonder

313
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:38,670
it was flawless;

314
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,210
the police never caught you.

315
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,420
This record sleeve,

316
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,930
the professor gave it to me to keep.

317
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,520
It holds sentimental value to me.

318
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,030
But if this

319
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,070
is what you need,

320
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,750
I’m happy to return it.

321
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:10,560
No,

322
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,090
I just wanted to know how my father died.

323
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,270
Now I know.

324
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,920
Father was selfish, just like Mother said.

325
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,290
Even in death,

326
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,730
all he left us was a Living Will.

327
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,170
Not a single word to me,

328
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,670
despite knowing how much I loved him.

329
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,530
He didn’t even say goodbye.

330
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,650
The professor had reasons for keeping to himself.

331
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,670
But as for a farewell,

332
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,440
he wrote you a letter.

333
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,930
I typed and sent it with my own hands.

334
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:08,670
If you didn’t receive it,

335
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,490
maybe

336
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,790
you should ask your mother about it.

337
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:30,860
Would you like to keep this?

338
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,450
My father gave it to you;

339
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,900
he must have wanted you to have it.

340
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,110
Is that all?

341
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,070
As for my father,

342
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,330
I respect his wishes.

343
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,030
I won’t talk about it anymore.

344
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,670
But if someone else dies in the future,

345
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,220
I’ll do my job as a forensic doctor to the best of my ability.

346
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,150
Don’t make any mistakes.

347
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,490
Tew.

348
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,350
How did you get here?

349
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:46,970
I followed you.

350
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,970
When did you put a tracker on my car?

351
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,950
The first night I stayed at your house.

352
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,930
So,

353
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,450
who’s really deceiving whom?

354
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,450
That was before.

355
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,330
After we opened up to each other,

356
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,040
I believed everything you said.

357
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,800
I never once doubted

358
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,770
you were a murderer.

359
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,850
Don’t say that word to me, Tew.

360
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,120
I’m not.

361
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:47,870
Euthanasia,

362
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,930
no matter how you sugarcoat it,

363
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,480
is still about ending someone’s life.

364
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,670
It’s about freeing patients from unbearable suffering, Tew!

365
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,630
It’s legal in other places.

366
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,970
But here, it’s against the law.

367
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,220
Or is the law wrong?

368
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,010
Hmm?

369
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,950
Because the law never understands the inequality,

370
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:10,070
the lack of resources, the suffering.

371
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,870
The law has no feelings. It has no heart.

372
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,710
But the law is the law.

373
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,580
If euthanasia is illegal,

374
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,150
you still have no right to do it, even if someone wants to die.

375
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,670
That’s because you’ve never seen what I’ve seen.

376
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,790
Bedridden patients who can’t move, patients in constant pain,

377
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,550
those suffering so much

378
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,160
that even morphine doesn’t help.

379
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,170
You’ve never felt it because you’ve never seen it.

380
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,330
Not even with your mother. You didn’t come back to see her.

381
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,770
If you had seen how much she suffered,

382
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,370
you wouldn’t be saying this.

383
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,910
So that’s why you killed my mother, isn’t it?

384
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,510
That’s why you killed her, isn’t it?

385
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,700
The flower on her hair—

386
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,890
if she was that close to death,

387
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,730
how could she have picked it herself?

388
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,570
And who knew she loved those flowers?

389
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,330
How could you do this to me?

390
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:33,890
I…

391
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,300
just did everything

392
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,190
your mother wanted.

393
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,170
You want to know about your mother?

394
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:52,470
Fine.

395
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,130
Did you know

396
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:56,880
she never wanted

397
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,450
you to come back?

398
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,210
She wanted to see you succeed in your career.

399
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:05,810
Have you ever realized

400
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,880
that every thought, every bit of happiness your mother had, was always about you?

401
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,590
On your mother’s last day,

402
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:14,610
all she asked of me was to help her pass away peacefully.

403
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,450
She had no lingering concerns, but what I always felt from her was that she constantly thought of you.

404
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,710
She wanted to see you have a bright future,

405
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,530
a good life, good friends,

406
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,200
and someone wonderful by your side.

407
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,340
Your mother,

408
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,920
and every patient I’ve cared for,

409
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:46,750
have reinforced my belief that everyone has the right to their own life,

410
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,130
the right to their own body.

411
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,910
Everyone has the right to choose whether to live

412
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,900
or to end their life peacefully and with dignity.

413
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,870
But the law you stand by—

414
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,190
it has never made this possible.

415
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,680
That’s why I had to act.

416
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,210
And for everything I’ve done,

417
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,290
I’m sorry

418
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:37,570
I broke my promise.

419
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,730
In the end…

420
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,300
I made you sad, Tew.

421
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,270
Doctors are tasked with saving lives,

422
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,330
and police with upholding the law.

423
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:09,040
But you don’t have any evidence

424
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,090
that I performed euthanasia,

425
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,770
aside from my confession.

426
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,090
Will you confess, Doctor?

427
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,890
If it’s you asking.

428
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:35,250
Sa,

429
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,190
you look pale today.

430
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:39,910
Didn’t get enough sleep, did you?

431
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,350
I haven’t been sleeping well, Doctor.

432
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,070
Take this.

433
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:49,000
Here,

434
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:52,530
take one of these tonight.  It’ll help you sleep soundly.

435
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,010
Sa,

436
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,230
the health of caregivers is important too.

437
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,770
If you fall ill,

438
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:04,660
who will take care of your mother?

439
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,760
Alright, I’ll take it tonight.

440
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,530
Are you ready, Mother?

441
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:35,590
Mother,

442
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,550
if I give you this injection,

443
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:40,470
you will fall asleep

444
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,500
and never wake up again.

445
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,330
Knowing this,

446
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,490
do you still want me to do it?

447
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:51,590
Yes.

448
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,840
This is truly what you want?

449
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,030
No one is forcing you?

450
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:23,310
Yes.

451
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:48,440
Do you have any lingering concerns or worries?

452
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,770
I know what’s going on with Tew.

453
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,260
I want to tell him

454
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:01,630
I’m okay.

455
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,680
I want him to have good friends,

456
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,730
a happy life like everyone else.

457
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,640
Please look after him for me, Doctor.

458
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:36,690
Yes, Mother.

459
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:15,610
Focus on the good things,

460
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,410
the things that bring you joy.

461
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,560
I love you, Doctor.
