1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,360
Someone once said…

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,390
Every decision

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,340
comes with both gains and losses.

4
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:30,730
I…

5
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,140
Police Lieutenant Colonel Wasan Khambunrueang,

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,250
I filed for a transfer from Bangkok back to my hometown,

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,670
so I could take care of my mother,

8
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,420
who is battling terminal cancer.

9
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,490
Stop!

10
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,130
Mr. Weerachai, please come in.

11
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:44,820
What happened to you?

12
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,350
Well, I had a minor accident.

13
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,420
- Uh... I got a head injury and a sore wrist.
- Have you been registered here before?

14
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,040
Not yet.

15
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,070
Tui, please help with the patient's records.

16
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,030
Fill out this form here, please.

17
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,710
Wait for your turn, okay?

18
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,510
Thank you.

19
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,950
Have a safe trip home, uncle.

20
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,510
You did great today.

21
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,680
Can we give him medicine to help him sleep, doctor?

22
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,920
Mr. Nipon Kongkham, a terminal lung cancer patient.

23
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,330
Uh...

24
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,550
The delirium, confusion, and agitation seen in terminal cancer patients,

25
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,240
especially when the cancer has spread to the brain

26
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,050
it’s a normal occurrence.

27
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,790
I’ll prescribe some medication for the night to help improve his condition.

28
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,840
Would that be okay?

29
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,040
Can we just leave him here, doctor?

30
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,250
Every night, my father is loud and disruptive; no one can sleep.

31
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,830
He’s terminal anyway, isn’t he?

32
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,260
Only a few months left to live, right?

33
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,100
Let’s all be patient for a little while longer.

34
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,710
Think of this as the last chance you have...

35
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,250
to repay the debt of gratitude to your parents.

36
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,160
Thank you.

37
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,450
Come on, let’s go home.

38
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,930
Take him to your place.

39
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,720
Why my house?

40
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,250
Mrs. Kampoon Singhso.

41
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,490
Doctor.

42
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,840
Oh,

43
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:49,960
thank you.

44
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,180
This way, please.

45
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,030
(Mae On Hospital)

46
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,990
What’s up, Sa?

47
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,250
Hello, Tew

48
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,280
where are you?

49
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,740
I’m almost there. There was a minor accident, so I’m running late.

50
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,440
How’s mom?

51
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,380
Mom?

52
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,580
I’ll go check on her.

53
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,000
Raweewan Khambunrueang, a terminal ovarian cancer patient.

54
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,530
She’s asleep.

55
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,440
Hmm.

56
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:35,940
Mom?

57
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,690
Mom?

58
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,409
Mom!

59
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,440
Sa,

60
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,110
what’s wrong with Mom?

61
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,900
- Hello, Tew.
- Sa!

62
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,780
Mom’s not doing well.

63
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,580
Poor her.

64
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,850
When Sa saw her,

65
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,700
she looked like she was just sleeping.

66
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,960
Teacher Wan was fortunate—she passed away peacefully.

67
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,990
But I think…

68
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,470
it’s kind of strange.

69
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,480
Because lately, she’d been bedridden.

70
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,210
But this morning, when I found her,

71
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,170
her hair was neatly combed.

72
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,540
No idea when she managed to gather the strength to get up and do that.

73
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,470
Your mother must have wanted to leave looking beautiful.

74
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,150
It’s not uncommon for terminal patients

75
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,250
to have a sudden burst of clarity.

76
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,070
It’s a shame you didn’t make it in time to say goodbye, Tew.

77
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,860
Here’s a clean handkerchief.

78
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,220
I haven’t used it.

79
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,270
I’m fine.

80
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,830
It’s okay to cry

81
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,560
if you’re sad.

82
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,800
I’m Dr. Kan.

83
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,540
I was the physician taking care of Mrs. Raweewan before she passed.

84
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,160
Sa said she was supposed to have months left.

85
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,410
Why, doctor?

86
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,940
For terminal patients, I have to say…

87
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,570
anything can happen.

88
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,260
But I can assure you,

89
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,270
your mother passed away peacefully.

90
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,620
She has nothing left to worry about.

91
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,480
Wasan’s mother was one of my patients.

92
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,360
Three days prior…

93
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,800
The role of a palli,

94
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,750
an abbreviation for doctors trained in Palliative Care,

95
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,300
or providing care focused on supportive and palliative treatment for patients.

96
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,300
is to ensure the comfort of terminal patients.

97
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,500
Living each day well,

98
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,300
with the least pain and suffering.

99
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,160
Oh! Doctor, hello.

100
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,020
Oh!

101
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,450
Good day, On.

102
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,310
Good day.

103
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,340
My mom woke up asking for you right away.

104
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,780
Alright, let's go then.

105
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,330
Huh?

106
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,480
Mmm-hmm.

107
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,960
Take a deep breath, please.

108
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,860
One more time.

109
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,580
You seem much stronger today, ma'am.

110
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,330
Well done!

111
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,120
That's really good, ma'am.

112
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,820
Let's go check on the patient’s medication.

113
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:12,840
Doctor.

114
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:17,820
Yes?

115
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,470
It hurts.

116
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,030
It really hurts a lot.

117
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,010
I understand.

118
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:31,930
Then…

119
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,240
I’ll increase your morphine dose for you.

120
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,180
I can’t take it anymore.

121
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,340
I really can’t.

122
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,200
Good day.

123
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,600
I’m Police Captain Wasan Khambunrueang,

124
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,230
serving as Deputy Inspector in Investigations,

125
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,440
reporting for duty.

126
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,600
You can call me Captain Wasan,

127
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,000
or just Wasan or Tew, whatever works for you.

128
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:16,570
Ah,

129
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,050
I’m Thienchai,

130
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,360
Chief of Wiang Sing Police Station.

131
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,740
So, how’s it here, Chief?

132
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,890
Wiang Sing, huh? It’s a small town.

133
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,190
We live quite comfortably here.

134
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,230
Excuse me, please.

135
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,490
Guin,

136
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,830
This is Captain Wasan, just transferred here.

137
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,740
Perfect timing.

138
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,570
There's been a death.

139
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,090
The deceased's wife said there was an intruder last night,

140
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,570
so she suspects…

141
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,200
it might be a murder.

142
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,770
The deceased's name is Mr. Songkran Jomjai,

143
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,700
aged 52.

144
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,260
His wife's name is Ying, and she discovered the body this morning.

145
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,490
That's her, right?

146
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,600
Yes, that's correct.

147
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,140
- Go talk to her.
- This way, please.

148
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,190
Mr. Songkran Jomjai, a terminal-stage bile duct cancer patient.

149
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:03,930
CSI team, please.

150
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,410
Yes, sir.

151
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,109
There are glass shards under the bed.

152
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,839
Let me see.

153
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,670
Normally, Ms. Ying would stay with Mr. Songkran every night,

154
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,850
but for the past two or three nights, she wasn't feeling well.

155
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,300
Is that right?

156
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,380
So the doctor advised her to sleep in another room.

157
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,970
I took the medicine and slept deeply through the day.

158
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,420
Around

159
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,530
3 a.m.,

160
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,220
I heard a sound like something falling,

161
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,120
probably a glass.

162
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,460
I found glass shards under the bed.

163
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,180
But at the time, I was groggy from the medication

164
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,000
and didn’t see anything.

165
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,570
In the morning…

166
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,460
I found him…

167
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,850
passed away.

168
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
It's okay. It's okay.

169
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,670
Let her rest for now.

170
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,510
Take your time.

171
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,080
We'll need to conduct an autopsy

172
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,300
to determine the cause of death.

173
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,370
Go ahead, Captain.

174
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,910
I want to know who killed Mr. Songkran.

175
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,350
Take it easy. We haven’t concluded it’s a murder yet.

176
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,130
It’s obvious!

177
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,900
He was bedridden, how could he die like this?

178
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,560
Dr. Kan said

179
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,090
he still had months left, didn’t he?

180
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,050
Dr. Kan?

181
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,800
Yes, two weeks ago, Dr. Kan visited to check on him

182
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,470
and said that with proper care, he could live another three to four months.

183
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,700
So Mr. Songkran

184
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,260
was in the final stage of bile duct cancer, Captain.

185
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,490
That disease again…

186
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,720
My mother passed away from it just last week.

187
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,700
Sorry to hear that, Captain.

188
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,730
Was it cancer?

189
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,390
Yes,

190
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,890
she was treated at this hospital by the same doctor.

191
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,200
And she also passed away earlier than expected.

192
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,610
Hello.

193
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:48,920
Hello.

194
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,250
Director's here.

195
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,150
- Hello, Director.
- Hello.

196
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,070
Ah, Director.

197
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,150
Oh.

198
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:24,900
Hello, Director.

199
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,080
Hello, Captain.

200
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,740
What brings you here today?

201
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,350
Oh, I’m fine,

202
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,430
but I need a favor.

203
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,010
We’d like to speak with one of the doctors.

204
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,060
There was a death last night,

205
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,330
and we believe the deceased was a patient here.

206
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,270
Was it one of our outpatients?

207
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,490
He was in the terminal stage.

208
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:56,830
Right this way, sir.

209
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,130
Oh, thank you.

210
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,160
(Palliative care unit)

211
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,130
It makes me think of drunk people who can’t walk properly, Captain.

212
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,110
Too drunk to walk, so they need doctors to support them?

213
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,160
Well, I’d be happy to help if,

214
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,870
someday, Captain Wasan can’t walk and needs a doctor’s help to hold him up.

215
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,340
Just call me.

216
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,460
This is Dr. Kan that you’ve been wanting to meet.

217
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,180
Oh, perfect.

218
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:35,600
Hello.

219
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:36,850
I am…

220
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,670
Police Sub-Lieutenant Kawin Kongthong, Deputy Inspector of Investigations at Wiang Sing Police Station.

221
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,660
Today, I need to interview Dr. Kantapat Akkaramethee.

222
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:47,950
Sure thing.

223
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,000
Please wait your turn, officer.

224
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,340
Ms. Hatthaya Insane.

225
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:00,760
Oh,

226
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,070
mother.

227
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,730
Please, come this way.

228
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,560
Sorry.

229
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,500
It seems you’ll have to wait a bit, Captain.

230
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,100
Miss, does the doctor have a long queue today?

231
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,870
Officer, please come in.

232
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:50,870
Please sit down.

233
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,100
Wow,

234
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,770
Dr. Kan's patients are so many in a single day!

235
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,200
Actually, today isn’t that busy.

236
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,650
If we compare the doctor-to-patient ratio in this area,

237
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,810
it’s about 2,500 patients per one doctor.

238
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,050
This morning, I’ve only seen around 30 patients.

239
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,580
Are there really that many palliative care patients?

240
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,190
Not quite, but here we don’t just take care of palliative patients.

241
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,090
We also handle patients with Non-Communicable Diseases.

242
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,890
Which means...?

243
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,160
I mean…

244
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,000
chronic non-communicable diseases

245
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:34,550
like diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, obesity, and so on.

246
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,090
But if we’re talking specifically about palliative care patients…

247
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,290
There are

248
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,820
40 people here.

249
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,490
39, actually. Mr. Songkran Chomjai passed away just last night.

250
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,600
Mr. Songkran Chomjai?

251
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,200
He had end-stage bile duct cancer with jaundice,

252
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,470
bile duct inflammation, and ascites.

253
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,370
But his family had been taking good care of him all along.

254
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,150
But didn’t you say Mr. Songkran could live another two or three months?

255
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:18,250
Yes, that’s correct.

256
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,030
Then shouldn’t he still be alive?

257
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,450
Not necessarily.

258
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,400
We need to understand that in end-stage cases,

259
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,200
anything can happen.

260
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,920
Do you say this about every case?

261
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,840
I mean, anyone can say that without being a doctor.

262
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,890
Yes, I say this to every patient’s family.

263
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,080
They’re very fragile.

264
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,060
Even a minor infection can lead to death.

265
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,370
That’s why

266
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,940
we must make every moment they have left count.

267
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,520
Grief after a loss can be managed.

268
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,860
Supporting the emotional well-being of the patient’s family is also part of the role of a palliative care doctor.

269
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:28,710
Here.

270
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,060
What’s this?

271
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,640
My Line contact.

272
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,010
In case you want to consult about…

273
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,000
the case.

274
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,470
Alright, I’ll add you myself.

275
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,370
Done. Dr. Kan, I’ll send you a message.

276
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,770
Thank you very much, Doctor.

277
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,100
If there’s any update on the autopsy results,

278
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,430
please keep me informed.

279
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:20,940
Why?

280
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,210
Mr. Songkran was one of my patients.

281
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,460
I’d like to know how he passed away too.

282
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,120
Alright, Doctor.

283
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,090
If there’s anything, I’ll contact you on Line.

284
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,320
- I’ll take my leave now.
- Thanks.

285
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,030
Do the police suspect it’s a murder?

286
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,520
Not yet.

287
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,790
Everything depends on the autopsy results.

288
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,760
Mr. Songkran Jomjai, Doctor.

289
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,310
End-stage bile duct cancer.

290
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,770
Why is an autopsy needed?

291
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,730
The family suspects he may not have died naturally.

292
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,400
Let me see.

293
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:13,970
Oh, Tew!

294
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,370
You’re just in time.

295
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,270
I was about to call you.

296
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,250
What’s up?

297
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,610
It’s nothing, I just wanted to ask if you’ll be staying here tonight.

298
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,980
My rented room isn’t ready yet, so I’ll stay here for now.

299
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,660
That’s good. I actually have an errand to run downstairs today.

300
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,710
Kai is coming to pick me up.

301
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,580
So, I’ll leave the house in your care, Tew.

302
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:33,910
Sa,

303
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:34,730
shall we go now?

304
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:36,930
I don’t want to drive when it’s dark.

305
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:37,980
- Let’s go.
- My eyesight isn’t great.

306
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,290
Hello.

307
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,690
Let’s go, hurry and load the stuff.

308
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,190
Alright, I’ll leave now, doctor.

309
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,460
Kai,

310
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,150
and about your eyes,

311
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,980
when you have time, let a doctor check them out.

312
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,040
Will do, doctor.

313
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,660
How come you’re here?

314
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,530
Oh, I forgot I had something that belongs to Raweewan.

315
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,170
I just remembered, so I came to return it.

316
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,780
Since it’s late, I invited him to stay for dinner.

317
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,710
As for the food, it’s already prepared in the kitchen.

318
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,010
You can have it with the doctor.

319
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,090
Let’s go.

320
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,090
Are you hungry?

321
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,470
I just peeked into the kitchen earlier.

322
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,140
She made larp kua and gaeng om.

323
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,850
It looks delicious.

324
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,560
By the way, how’s the progress on Mr. Songkran case?

325
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,960
I can’t reveal much yet.

326
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,160
Mr. Songkran was a good person; I don’t think anyone would want to kill him.

327
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,520
But his relatives don’t feel the same.

328
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,860
Doctor, are you going to fry the eggs or not? You said you were hungry.

329
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,060
Should I add oyster sauce?

330
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,710
Or perhaps I should add some care instead?

331
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,430
Care, right?

332
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,180
Do you come here often, doctor?

333
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,660
I usually come to visit your mom once a month,

334
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,890
sometimes more.

335
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,760
I only get to come back during Songkran.

336
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,840
So…

337
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,440
does she complain about me much?

338
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,680
She doesn’t complain,

339
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,920
but she does talk about you often.

340
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,740
Your mom loves you a lot.

341
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,500
And she’s very proud of you.

342
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,980
I’m not a good son.

343
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,240
You know,

344
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,920
transferring to a rural area isn’t difficult.

345
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,660
But the delay was because I kept hesitating.

346
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,290
I worried about career advancement.

347
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,220
I was afraid I’d be stuck here.

348
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,710
Your mom understands.

349
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,710
She doesn’t want you to return

350
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,420
if it means hardship for you.

351
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,120
She loves you so much.

352
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,870
But I never told her I loved her.

353
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,290
I should have said it,

354
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:40,790
but now it’s too late.

355
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,860
Tell the lab that I need the results urgently.

356
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Got it, doctor. Don’t worry.

357
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,210
Director.

358
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,920
How’s the autopsy report, Dr. Rin?

359
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,960
Is there anything concerning?

360
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,710
From what I’ve seen, nothing abnormal.

361
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,590
It aligns with the symptoms of the disease.

362
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,510
But to be certain, I sent it for further testing.

363
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,520
Who was the attending physician?

364
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,030
The last doctor to care for the patient

365
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,250
was Dr. Kantapat Akkaramethee.

366
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,060
Make sure

367
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,600
to check thoroughly.

368
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,220
Of course, don’t worry.

369
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,440
Could you watch the kids? I’ll go check on Dad.

370
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,080
Ah,

371
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,860
my head hurts.

372
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,550
It’s good you’re here, Dad. When you scream, you won’t bother anyone.

373
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,160
Headache, headache.

374
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,630
Headache, headache.

375
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,930
The cancer has probably spread to the brain now, Dad.

376
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,040
Should we get you more painkillers?

377
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,000
No, leave me.

378
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,270
Go away!

379
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,080
Headache, headache.

380
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,590
Excuse me.

381
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,410
Mr. Nipon stayed at the granary last night.

382
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,170
His daughter saw the mosquito net on fire, so she came down to check.

383
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,280
That’s when she found him dead.

384
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:44,910
We found this, Captain.

385
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,260
Father was unwell.

386
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,240
At night, he would scream and shout.

387
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,300
So, my partner suggested he stay at the granary.

388
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,790
He had late-stage lung cancer.

389
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,200
You’re Dr. Supaporn, right?

390
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,010
I’m Police Lieutenant Colonel Wasan. I called earlier.

391
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,600
Please, come in.

392
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,180
There are no chairs here

393
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,510
because most people who come in are lying down.

394
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,090
What’s the autopsy result for Mr. Songkran?

395
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,050
The autopsy found a liver mass, massive ascites.

396
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,430
The cause of death was stage 4 cholangiocarcinoma.

397
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,720
In summary, Mr. Songkran Jomjai died of cancer.

398
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,480
From the blood test, we didn’t find any substances

399
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,390
except morphine and sleeping pills,

400
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,460
which the patient was regularly taking.

401
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,470
It wasn’t murder.

402
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,540
From the test results, we cannot determine if it was a murder.

403
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,820
However, in this case, we found a syringe lying nearby.

404
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,590
Oh, here it is, Doctor.

405
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:02,930
Let’s take a look.

406
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,380
Just a moment, Sergeant Narong.

407
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,580
Hello, Sergeant.

408
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,010
Yeah, yeah.

409
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,850
Alright, then I’ll leave it with you at the station.

410
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,530
Ah, okay, okay.

411
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,100
Captain,

412
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,140
let’s go together.

413
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:46,580
Go where?

414
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,160
Early this morning, someone spotted a suspect near the house of Mr. Nipon Kongkham.

415
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,040
And now they know who it is.

416
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:53,690
Come on, let’s hurry.

417
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,070
Whoa,

418
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:07,900
is this the place, Lieutenant?

419
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:08,780
Yeah,

420
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,060
over there.

421
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,720
Grandpa Som!

422
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,640
Grandpa Som,

423
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,190
are you there?

424
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,580
Whoa,

425
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,110
what is this?

426
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,960
I’m going to throw up!

427
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,230
Grandpa Som,

428
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,210
are you there?

429
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:55,770
Som!

430
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:56,980
Police officers!

431
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:01,880
Som, stop!

432
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,460
Stop!

433
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:04,550
Som!

434
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,280
I’ll shoot!

435
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,360
Stop! Don’t move!

436
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:31,510
Grandpa Som,

437
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,610
where were you around 4 a.m. last night?

438
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,060
Someone saw you at the house of Mr. Nipon Kongkham, right?

439
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,520
Why were you there?

440
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,060
To summon a spirit.

441
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:43,760
Oh,

442
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:44,810
spirits again.

443
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,970
I’ve seen him slaughtering a goat at the middle of a three-way junction before.

444
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:49,670
Yeah,

445
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,110
spirits. Spirits come out at dawn.

446
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:54,880
Why do they come out?

447
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,830
Go out and find something to eat.

448
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,380
The ghost is hungry.

449
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,740
This is a Phi Kra Na. It likes to drink blood.

450
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,340
If we offer sacrifices and it’s not satisfied,

451
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,430
it will come out and kill people.

452
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,280
How do you know, that the ghost kills people?

453
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,730
Have you ever seen it?

454
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,080
What does it look like?

455
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,400
It looks just like us.

456
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,270
The ghost possesses people.

457
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:26,620
Really?

458
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,460
And do you remember,

459
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,120
what the possessed person looked like?

460
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,440
I couldn’t see.

461
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,110
Its face was covered.

462
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,610
But I know it was a man, tall,

463
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,420
wearing black clothes.

464
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,060
Som,

465
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,460
think carefully.

466
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,150
How old was that man?

467
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:51,430
Young or old?

468
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,850
And the black clothes you mentioned,

469
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,130
what kind of outfit was it?

470
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:59,510
What kind? Well, it was black clothes, so he was wearing black... like…

471
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,290
Doctor…

472
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,620
I was passing by here and saw the Lieutenant's car parked outside,

473
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,240
so I stopped by to say hello.

474
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,720
We’re in the middle of duty right now.

475
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,430
I can help.

476
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:29,580
Som here

477
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,570
used to be a psychiatric patient at the hospital.

478
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:33,630
I think…

479
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,040
I can talk to him.

480
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,400
Please, go ahead.

481
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,390
Som,

482
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:47,520
you remember me, don’t you?

483
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,280
You were just about to tell the Lieutenant something.

484
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:55,190
Go on, say it.

485
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,020
No... I wasn’t saying anything.

486
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,230
I heard you. Just now, you mentioned a man in black clothes.

487
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,520
Where did you meet him?

488
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,880
- I didn’t meet him. I didn’t say anything.
- At that time, what was he doing?

489
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,720
No, no, I didn’t say anything.

490
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:20,730
Som,

491
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,420
don’t lie to me.

492
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:27,830
No.

493
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,960
No, not anymore! I won’t talk anymore!

494
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,570
Hey, hey, hey!

495
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,830
- Enough! That’s enough.
- Doctor, stop.

496
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,510
That’s enough.

497
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,030
I think you should go home for now.

498
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,850
I just wanted to help.

499
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,770
You’re not helping.

500
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,360
You’re scaring him.

501
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,070
(OneD Original)

502
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,970
Doctor, why did you follow me to Som’s house today?

503
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,620
You didn’t just happen to pass by.

504
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,690
Why did you take such a risk?

505
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,760
It was necessary.

506
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,690
Otherwise, the Lieutenant wouldn’t stop being suspicious.

507
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:05,620
Doctor Kan…

508
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:06,560
what kind of person is he?

509
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,690
He’s like an angel.

510
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:08,750
Everyone loves him.

511
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:11,010
I want to know the reason... how he died.

512
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:11,760
You can’t.

513
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,000
Because it’s already certain that…

514
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,550
Nipon Kongkham’s death

515
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,820
was murder.

516
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,190
Why were you there, Doctor?

517
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,110
What did you want?

518
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,190
I like you.
