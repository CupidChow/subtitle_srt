1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,660
Why did you follow me to Som’s house today?

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,850
What do you want?

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:06,800
I like you.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:07,550
What?

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,950
I just wanted to…

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,390
develop our relationship.

7
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,390
And? Did it work?

8
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,060
I think…

9
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,990
he believes everything I’ve said.

10
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,610
The killer is likely connected to a hospital

11
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,790
The person who killed Mr. Nipon Kongkham

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,270
used potassium chloride, injecting it into a vein.

13
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,330
Do you think

14
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,770
anyone might have had a motive to kill him?

15
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,990
Wiang Singh Hospital

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,160
Hello.

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,110
Hi, Ko.

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:53,650
Oops.

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,710
Careful!

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,430
Dr. Kantapat Akkaramethee is my idol.

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:05,990
Oh!

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,550
Sorry, Doctor, I spilled it all over you.

23
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,110
It’s okay, Boss.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,650
Next time, just be more careful while walking.

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,460
He’s a smart and talented

26
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:15,640
new-generation doctor.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,150
Alright, let’s go.

28
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,070
More importantly,

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,510
he’s so dedicated to his patients.

30
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,270
Mr. Phat, please follow me.

31
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:25,910
Nop!

32
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,270
Hot black.

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,990
But it spilled a little.

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:29,830
Thank you.

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,470
Here’s your hot latte.

36
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,750
Thank you.

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,100
Anne, your green tea.

38
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:38,830
Sure.

39
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,009
Alright.

40
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,280
- Thanks!
- No worries.

41
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,640
When I was a kid, I dreamed of becoming a doctor

42
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,509
because I thought doctors had the power

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,690
to decide if a patient lived or died.

44
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,020
But in reality,

45
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,250
you don’t have to be a doctor to make a difference.

46
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,730
Mr. Noppadon.

47
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,810
Noppadon Techo, your prescription is ready at counter 3.

48
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,590
Regarding the death of Mr. Nipon Kongkham,

49
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,390
the police require information about the dispensing of potassium chloride.

50
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,470
Please cooperate with the authorities.

51
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,310
Sorry for the trouble.

52
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,250
Of course.

53
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,270
Lieutenant,

54
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,710
I think we should also check the medicine stock in other departments right now.

55
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:53,990
Alright.

56
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,480
I’ll take you there myself

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,000
to avoid any confusion.

58
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,829
- Sure.
- Follow me, please.

59
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:58,829
Let’s go.

60
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,990
Sergeant, accompany the director.

61
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,590
Regarding the potassium chloride,

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,110
if it’s not kept in the pharmacy room,

63
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,750
can it be stored by the doctor?

64
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,950
No, it can’t.

65
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,029
KCL is a High Alert Drug.

66
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,269
It must be stored in the hospital and used only under strict supervision.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,190
The police are in the palliative ward.

68
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,370
Let’s go.

69
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,030
Doctor,

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,980
I need to talk to you.

71
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,410
Sorry, Captain, I’m in a rush today.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,510
Let’s talk another time.

73
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,380
Stop! Stop!

74
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,510
What are you doing?

75
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,350
I request permission to conduct a search.

76
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,240
Excuse me?

77
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,140
What’s in this box? I’d like to see.

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,810
You can’t.

79
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,710
These are medications meant for the patients.

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,710
They’re sealed and must not be opened.

81
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,070
- But I…
- It’s the rule—

82
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,570
for safety.

83
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,030
Captain,

84
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,310
please step aside. I’m really in a hurry today.

85
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,550
Fine...

86
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,140
If you’re in a hurry, just go.

87
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,360
I’ll go with you.

88
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,330
I’ll watch you administer the medication to the patient.

89
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,590
Aren’t you in a hurry? Go ahead!

90
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,470
Sit in the front, please.

91
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,520
Captain, please.

92
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,270
Captain.

93
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,190
Go ahead!

94
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,200
For safety purposes.

95
00:06:59,260 --> 00:06:59,780
Pharmacist Boss!

96
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,320
Come and talk to me first.

97
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,390
We’ll talk right here.

98
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,060
I checked the medication dispensing records from two months ago.

99
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,790
You dispensed potassium chloride in a way that didn’t match the doctor’s prescription.

100
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,210
That’s impossible.

101
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,180
Dangerous drugs must only be dispensed according to a doctor’s prescription.

102
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,170
Exactly.

103
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,150
You dispensed it based on the doctor’s prescription,

104
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,830
but then you entered a new order

105
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,659
and dispensed additional medication—more than what the doctor prescribed.

106
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,430
You know

107
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,430
no one has time to cross-check medication stock against prescriptions.

108
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,030
He made a mistake,

109
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,550
and it happened to one of my regular patients.

110
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,890
Who did you give the medication to?

111
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,270
Who did you give it to?

112
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:01,710
Director.

113
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,110
- Director!
- Director!

114
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,070
Who did you give it to?

115
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,630
- Director, calm down.
- Director!

116
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,510
- Please, calm down!
- Who did you give it to?

117
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,510
Director. Director.

118
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,140
Admit it, Boss.

119
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,630
You stole the KCL—who did you give it to?

120
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:16,510
Hey!

121
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,270
Answer the question, Mr. Chanchai!

122
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,830
Mr. Chanchai!

123
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,230
Confess now!

124
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,850
Hey!

125
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,100
Sergeant!

126
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,900
Mr. Chanchai!

127
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,700
Sergeant!

128
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,549
Mr. Chanchai!

129
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,750
Mr. Chanchai, open the door!

130
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:38,980
Mr. Chanchai!

131
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,790
Boss!

132
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,040
Please leave a message after the tone.

133
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,070
Professor, please help me!

134
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,300
Are you not answering the phone?

135
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,150
It’s an unknown number.

136
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,750
Come back with me now.

137
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,770
I admit I wrote a prescription for more than what the doctor ordered.

138
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,860
But it was just numbers—

139
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,850
I didn’t take the medication.

140
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,470
About six months ago,

141
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,750
the hospital ordered a new batch of potassium chloride.

142
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,470
It arrived while I was on duty.

143
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,340
But I didn’t put it in the storage immediately.

144
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,350
I just left it in the room.

145
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,070
And when I came back…

146
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,770
the KCL that used to be three packs is now only two.

147
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,950
I honestly don’t know who took it, but I was afraid the director would scold me.

148
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,610
So I…

149
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,340
I altered the prescription to exceed what the doctor ordered,

150
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,390
thinking that after some time,

151
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,600
the numbers would align with the remaining stock.

152
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,670
That way, no one would notice the medication was missing.

153
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,230
It’s a shame that there’s no CCTV in the pharmacy room.

154
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,880
I’m certain

155
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,300
the person who stole the drug is the murderer!

156
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:45,820
I’ll help.

157
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,090
You just follow me.

158
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,070
Don’t complain.

159
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,970
Come on, hurry up.

160
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,730
The doctor’s here!

161
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,900
Stay calm, alright? The doctor is here.

162
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,610
Zapa,

163
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,510
how are you?

164
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:10,170
Hmm.

165
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,270
What’s his condition?

166
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,200
Prostate cancer.

167
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,790
It’s spread to his bones.

168
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,910
He hasn’t been able to move for a year.

169
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,510
Zapa was a hunter.

170
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,510
Every day, he had to go into the forest to hunt.

171
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,910
When he couldn’t hunt, he’d collect honey, vegetables, and herbs.

172
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,240
For someone like Zapa, not being able to enter the forest is like being dead.

173
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,890
Please step outside.

174
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,070
Zapa is near death.

175
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,070
The family needs to discuss.

176
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,130
- Oh, and you…
- I’m family.

177
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,830
As for the doctor, Zapa respects him like a parent.

178
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,590
You’re an outsider—this doesn’t concern you. Please leave.

179
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,900
Zapa.

180
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,810
Zapa, you’re still aware, aren’t you?

181
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,150
You need to respond to me, okay?

182
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,540
Zapa, is there anything you’re still worried about?

183
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,450
No, nothing anymore.

184
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,950
If I give you the injection,

185
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,110
you’ll fall asleep

186
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,470
and won’t wake up again.

187
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,520
Do you still want me to give you the injection?

188
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,610
Yes.

189
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,430
This is your decision, right?

190
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,089
No one is forcing you?

191
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,230
No one.

192
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,520
Zapa,

193
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,069
the elders always said:

194
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,590
Bones are like stones.

195
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,430
Flesh is like soil.

196
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,470
Blood is like water.

197
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,770
Our breath is the air.

198
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,470
Zapa, you will leave everything behind and return it to this world.

199
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,130
Then you will set off on a journey,

200
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,190
passing the tree of remembrance,

201
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,860
passing the tree of forgetting,

202
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,240
seven times, seven steps.

203
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,130
And you will find a new world,

204
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,220
where your parents and family are waiting for you.

205
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,590
Go in peace, Zapa.

206
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,650
Why is everyone so calm?

207
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,000
It’s like they already knew the patient was going to die.

208
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,710
The people here have been preparing themselves for a while now.

209
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,070
Besides…

210
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,260
their belief up here is that

211
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,000
death is like moving from an old home to a new one.

212
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,510
That’s a nice way to think about it.

213
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,100
When you die,

214
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,070
you don’t have to end up in hell like the rest of us.

215
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,550
A skilled honey hunter like Zapa,

216
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,520
back in the day,

217
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,330
no matter how high

218
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,210
the big honeycombs were on the trees,

219
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,350
he could always bring them down.

220
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,110
But once the cancer spread to his bones,

221
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,930
even moving his fingers was painful.

222
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,550
I think that’s

223
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,040
the real hell—without even having to die.

224
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,770
But now,

225
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,350
he’s at peace.

226
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,360
Wait, Doctor.

227
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,350
Hmm?

228
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,130
Now let’s talk about us.

229
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,970
About us?

230
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:22,790
Sure.

231
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,040
It’s about why I followed you here.

232
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,790
It’s morphine and anesthetic.

233
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,790
Sometimes I need them to treat wounds for patients with bedsores.

234
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,820
But what I saw in the fridge yesterday wasn’t these two bottles.

235
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,950
It was potassium chloride.

236
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,170
Are you sure?

237
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,130
You can read medication labels, Captain?

238
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,750
Why would I have potassium chloride?

239
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,070
What are you implying?

240
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,650
That I’m the murderer who killed Mr. Nipon Kongkham?

241
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,790
Listen carefully.

242
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,940
The murderer injected potassium chloride into the victim’s vein.

243
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,070
The result was an arrhythmia,

244
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,020
followed by convulsions, spasms, and extreme suffering before death.

245
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,470
Do you think I would do that to my own patient?

246
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:01,690
Next person, please.

247
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,220
- Okay.
- Here’s your blood pressure medicine.

248
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:07,950
Here it is.

249
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,650
Mmm.

250
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,890
- Take it to the nurse, okay?
- Got it.

251
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,320
Good.

252
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,350
Hello, doctor.

253
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,600
- Hello!
- Little one.

254
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,910
Oh, thank you.

255
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,870
Your neck is red.

256
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,630
What did you do to make it so red?

257
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,330
I remember you, uncle. Are you still in pain?

258
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,590
Dr. Kan?

259
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,210
The villagers say he’s like an angel.

260
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,470
Everyone loves him.

261
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,330
Okay.

262
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,190
- All set, right?
- Thank you.

263
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,110
- Go see On next.
- Sure.

264
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,210
- Thank you!
- You’re welcome.

265
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,270
Are you having stomach pain?

266
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,830
Where does it hurt?

267
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,150
Alright.

268
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,030
Let me take a look.

269
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,470
Take a deep breath.

270
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,310
Drink plenty of water.

271
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,790
Does your throat hurt?

272
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,150
Does it hurt when I press here?

273
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:25,860
Ah, I see.

274
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,630
Alright, go see On, okay?

275
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,800
Thank you.

276
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,350
- That’s all, right?
- Yes.

277
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:45,960
Want some water?

278
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,350
If not, that’s fine.

279
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,980
- Doctor?
- Yes?

280
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,830
I’ll go put these away first, okay?

281
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,010
Sure.

282
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,550
Doctor.

283
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,410
Hmm?

284
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,290
I’m not accusing you of being a murderer.

285
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,550
But the police have to suspect everyone.

286
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,830
No one can be ruled out.

287
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:38,690
I understand.

288
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,370
But what if it really were me?

289
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,400
What would you do?

290
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:48,790
I’d arrest you, of course.

291
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,270
And prosecute you according to the law.

292
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,080
Anyone who kills another person with premeditation,

293
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,190
kills through torture,

294
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,930
or commits cruel and inhumane acts,

295
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
is subject to the death penalty.

296
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,040
What if the patient wants to die?

297
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:05,690
Suppose…

298
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,230
if they came to you asking for help to end their life—

299
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,320
Have you never heard of that?

300
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,250
The law says…

301
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,530
consent does not constitute a violation, right?

302
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:16,680
Am I wrong?

303
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,070
I won’t argue with you about medicine.

304
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,670
So don’t argue with me about the law.

305
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,070
This justification only applies if the act does not violate public morals.

306
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,190
Public morals?

307
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,270
Here we go again.

308
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,630
What even are

309
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:44,880
public morals?

310
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,800
For patients

311
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,390
who can neither live properly

312
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,170
nor die,

313
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,070
what do public morals do to help them?

314
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,710
Stop thinking about the patient for a second and think about yourself first.

315
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,910
It’s getting late.

316
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,790
When are we going back?

317
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,150
We?

318
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:22,860
Yes.

319
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,760
We’re staying here overnight to wait for Zapa’s funeral in the morning.

320
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,310
- What? Why didn’t you tell me?
- I didn’t invite you.

321
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,340
You followed me here yourself.

322
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,070
So don’t complain.

323
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,500
What about On?

324
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,370
She took the medicine back to the hospital.

325
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,370
Why are you here?

326
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,660
Professor.

327
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,740
You didn’t answer my calls.

328
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,510
Why should I answer?

329
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,010
I already knew you’d come to me for help.

330
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,310
Which you did.

331
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,950
So I came to thank you.

332
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,130
Dr. Somsak.

333
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,590
I’m not gay.

334
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,710
But I’m a survivor.

335
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,460
An orphan like me,

336
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,610
I had to do whatever it took to survive.

337
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,830
Until I met him.

338
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,540
Dr. Somsak La-amornchai.

339
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,870
A doctor with secrets no one could have guessed.

340
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,870
He supported me.

341
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,190
He paid for my education until I became a pharmacist.

342
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,180
Then he brought me to work here with him.

343
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,510
The coffee around here is really good, you know.

344
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,370
Have you ever tasted it?

345
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,040
I drink to survive.

346
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,840
I’m not as refined as you, Doctor.

347
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,390
Life is short.

348
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,610
Whenever you can find happiness, you should stockpile it.

349
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:53,850
Just like now.

350
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:00,500
Hmm?

351
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,460
I work with death every day throughout my life.

352
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,380
I always think…

353
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,310
people can die at any moment.

354
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:27,790
So…

355
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,380
I don’t waste time beating around the bush.

356
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:36,510
If I like someone,

357
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,660
I’ll just say I like them.

358
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,350
Unless you already have someone.

359
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,170
I don’t.

360
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,210
But I don’t like casual relationships.

361
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,390
I don’t want to be anyone’s one-night stand.

362
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,110
Captain Wasan,

363
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,570
I can’t promise

364
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,080
that we’ll be together forever.

365
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,840
But what I can promise you is…

366
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,390
you are definitely not just a one-night stand to me.

367
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:38,470
What do you think?

368
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:04,950
Not bad.

369
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,190
There are better things than coffee, you know.

370
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,389
Me?

371
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,389
Why did you ask me that earlier today?

372
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,969
Ask what?

373
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,980
You asked who I stole the KCL for.

374
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,400
Don’t you think I could be the murderer?

375
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:47,870
You’re not like them.

376
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,790
You’re already dead.

377
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,950
You talk as if you know who it is.

378
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,470
Of course, I do.

379
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,290
This isn’t the first time.

380
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,000
Eight years ago,

381
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,110
they used the same method to kill someone.

382
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,130
When I saw them here,

383
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,450
I was shocked.

384
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,030
But I didn’t think

385
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,790
they’d still be killing people.

386
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,610
Who?

387
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:31,440
Hey.

388
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,430
What’s wrong?

389
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,060
I miss my mom.

390
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,710
Before Zapa died,

391
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,610
there were loved ones by his side.

392
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,450
He got to say his goodbyes.

393
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,120
He got to leave his last wishes.

394
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,910
But my mom… she had no one.

395
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,070
She was lying there alone

396
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,190
and just stopped breathing.

397
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,030
The one thing your mother wanted

398
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,120
was to leave peacefully.

399
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,020
And I think…

400
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,830
she got what she wanted.

401
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,140
My mom worked so hard for me,

402
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,960
ever since my dad died.

403
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,480
She worked to send me to school.

404
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,030
When I graduated,

405
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,790
I didn’t come back to take care of her.

406
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,670
I didn’t like it here.

407
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,970
I want to say I’m sorry.

408
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,480
I want to thank her.

409
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,730
I want to tell her she did her best.

410
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,480
And I want to tell her how much I love her.

411
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,270
Just a few more hours.

412
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:36,890
Yes?

413
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:40,740
Hmm.

414
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,570
- Happy birthday to you!
- Oh!

415
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,240
Happy birthday to you.

416
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,150
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

417
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,420
Happy birthday to you!

418
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,430
Happy birthday to you!

419
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,300
Happy birthday to you!

420
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,710
Happy birthday, happy birthday…

421
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,900
Happy birthday to you!

422
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,130
Happy birthday, Professor! I hope you have a great one!

423
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,430
Thank you, thank you, everyone.

424
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,830
And thanks for keeping the volume under control.

425
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,310
Make a wish!

426
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,410
Yay!

427
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,890
Please share this with the nurses later, okay?

428
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,490
Doctor, take it home with you

429
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,450
to celebrate.

430
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,980
You seem to know everything!

431
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,260
I noticed since you got down from the mountain.

432
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,080
Are you serious?

433
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,780
Hello, this is Wasan speaking.

434
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,260
I have something important to discuss with you, Captain.

435
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,270
What’s the matter, Director?

436
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,230
Why are we talking out here?

437
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,220
I didn’t want to discuss this at the hospital.

438
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,040
The Director said…

439
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,600
there’s new evidence.

440
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,940
More than just evidence.

441
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:54,830
I know

442
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,220
who stole the potassium chloride.

443
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,550
I know

444
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,470
who the murderer is.

445
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,190
Yes, Director?

446
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,860
I have something to discuss with the doctor.

447
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,650
Yes?

448
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,510
Not now.

449
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,350
This is important.

450
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,790
I don’t want anyone to know.

451
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:36,470
Alright,

452
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,430
after work, Doctor, come to my house

453
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,030
at exactly 7 PM.

454
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,690
Uh, sorry, Director.

455
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,200
Can it be tomorrow? I already have plans tonight.

456
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,270
It’s about the murderer who’s been killing terminal patients we’ve been investigating.

457
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:56,990
Come alone.

458
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,460
And don’t tell anyone.

459
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,280
What’s up, Tew?

460
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,060
Hello, Doctor.

461
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,150
About our appointment this evening...

462
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,390
Something urgent came up; my boss just assigned it to me.

463
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:56,970
I...won’t be able to meet you anymore.

464
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,870
Oh, okay. That’s fine.

465
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,720
Oh, I forgot to tell you—I’ve got some urgent work today too.

466
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:09,760
What a relief.

467
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,200
But…

468
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,610
I should get a gift for that, right?

469
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:18,190
Oh no!

470
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,090
Just kidding.

471
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:23,360
Alright…

472
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:25,990
Let’s set up a new meeting next time.

473
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:27,670
Sure.

474
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,320
If I finish early,

475
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:31,520
I’ll call you.

476
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:33,980
Happy birthday!

477
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,830
Oh, come on.

478
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,870
What?

479
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,830
Why are you smiling like that?

480
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,560
Afraid of your wife, are you?

481
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:59,350
Who’s the girl?

482
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:00,670
Tell me about her!

483
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,750
What girl? There’s no one.

484
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:05,500
Are you going to tell me, or should I investigate myself?

485
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,300
Lieutenant.

486
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,940
Go on, get to work!

487
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:12,130
Your boss is waiting over there.

488
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:13,460
Go!

489
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,470
There goes our handsome guy.

490
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,830
Director Somsak asked me to meet him at his house

491
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:25,940
at exactly 8 PM.

492
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:29,880
He said he would hand over the killer of the terminally ill patients to the police.

493
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,010
So that means Director Somsak knows who it is.

494
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,630
Then why didn’t he just tell us?

495
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:38,620
Good question.

496
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,640
We could go straight in and arrest them—problem solved. And you wouldn’t have to risk yourself, Lieutenant.

497
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:43,750
That won’t work.

498
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,790
The director said if we want to catch the killer, we must do it his way.

499
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,630
But I don’t think meeting at his house will be dangerous.

500
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:53,210
Alright then,

501
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,550
we’ll go with this plan.

502
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,500
Kawin,

503
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,050
have your team ready nearby, just in case something goes wrong.

504
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,750
We can step in to help.

505
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:01,910
Captain,

506
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:03,140
be careful.

507
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:04,350
Understood.

508
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:02,820
Director, good evening.

509
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,260
Let’s talk upstairs in my office.

510
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:34,310
Let’s go.

511
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:35,520
Alright, let’s go.

512
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:35,810
Let’s go.

513
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,140
Director, what did you want to talk to me about?

514
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,300
I know you stole KCL from the pharmacy.

515
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:01,680
That’s not true!

516
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,950
I never stole KCL from the pharmacy.

517
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,940
Then you must’ve stolen it from somewhere else.

518
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,140
It’s not hard

519
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,030
for a doctor

520
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,270
to divert medication like this for personal use.

521
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,180
What are you trying to say, Director?

522
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,570
Don’t think no one knows what you’ve done.

523
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,070
You used potassium chloride

524
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,310
to kill Mr. Nipon Kongkham,

525
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,110
a terminal patient.

526
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:32,820
That’s incorrect.

527
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,030
I didn’t kill Mr. Nipon Kongkham.

528
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,020
Exactly.

529
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,110
The murderer stole the potassium chloride and knew how to use it.

530
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,520
It’s very likely the murderer is a doctor.

531
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,330
But it’s not me.

532
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,070
Liar.

533
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,580
I’m a doctor, Director.

534
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,590
And Mr. Nipon was my patient.

535
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:59,930
How could I kill him?

536
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:00,910
You didn’t kill him.

537
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,950
You euthanized him.

538
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,100
Alright, Captain.

539
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,930
Let me know if anything comes up.

540
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:29,760
Understood.

541
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,340
You think you helped him?

542
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,990
You think what you did was good?

543
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,910
Even though it was murder.

544
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,270
Director, you have no evidence.

545
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,330
You’re outright accusing me.

546
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:08,580
Do you remember?

547
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:10,650
Do you know who this is?

548
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:35,490
Dr. Kan.

549
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:37,310
Do you remember?

550
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,540
Your very first victim—

551
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,990
Dr. Pirot Kunawan,

552
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,750
your own mentor.

553
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:01,740
(OneD Original)

554
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,950
Director Somsak might have invited the killer to this room,

555
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,110
and then an argument broke out.

556
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:07,210
I’m afraid the killer might have harmed Director Somsak.

557
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:09,870
Happy birthday!

558
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,480
I’m glad you came today.

559
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,220
Doctor,

560
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:16,930
what are you doing here?

561
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,390
The director knows about us now.

562
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:20,370
He’s going to tell the police.

563
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,980
We need to make sure he can’t tell anyone.

564
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,450
And what happened to your head? The wound still looks fresh—

565
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,950
like it happened just a few hours ago.
