1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,870
Boss is highly suspicious.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,520
I’m going into Pharmacist Boss’s house.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,380
If I find something, I’ll inform the police.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,680
You’ve ruined me.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,590
You’re dead.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,320
On set up a meeting at her house.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,330
Ms.Onanong hasn’t come to work.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,270
Dr. Kan is also on leave.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,930
Pharmacist Boss didn’t come to work either, Captain.

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:21,960
He called in sick this morning.

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,280
You don’t even know what euthanasia really is.

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,330
Then teach me!

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,290
Teach me how to do it right,

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,510
so I can help like On did.

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,110
We could be a team.

16
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,330
Are you crazy?

17
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,330
Euthanasia

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,670
is the answer I’ve been searching for my whole life.

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,650
My father was like those people—

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,700
a bedridden patient.

21
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,410
Incurable.

22
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,240
Just lying there, waiting to die.

23
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,690
But he wouldn’t die.

24
00:00:59,290 --> 00:00:59,870
Hurry up and eat;

25
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,150
you’ll need to take your medicine.

26
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,570
What’s wrong with you?

27
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,840
What’s wrong with me?

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:05,940
Don't you want to get better?

29
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,800
I saw my mother

30
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,870
suffer every day,

31
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:12,610
unable to care for my father.

32
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,610
Until one day…

33
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,250
she killed him

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,700
and then took her own life.

35
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,039
I stood there, staring at her body,

36
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,690
hanging from the beam,

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,370
for hours,

38
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,130
waiting for the rescue team to arrive.

39
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,650
I kept wondering…

40
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,880
why didn’t she kill me too?

41
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,360
Let me die with them.

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,050
But maybe that’s all she could do.

43
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,880
All she could manage was to kill my father

44
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,840
and herself.

45
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,880
But she loved me too much to kill me.

46
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,890
That day, I understood—

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,300
people like my father,

48
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,760
bedridden

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,190
and in pain

50
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,450
are worthless. They shouldn’t live.

51
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,970
I was left alone,

52
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,810
an orphan,

53
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,500
living a life more worthless than a stray dog,

54
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,630
until I met you.

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,890
After that seminar,

56
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,160
I realized…

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,810
what my life was for.

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,090
And today,

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,050
I’ve invited a doctor

60
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,790
specializing in palliative care to join us

61
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,090
and discuss what euthanasia really is

62
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,700
and whether Thailand is ready for euthanasia legislation.

63
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,409
Please welcome him.

64
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,540
I don’t think it’s necessary.

65
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,770
The 2007 National Health Act, Article 12,

66
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,230
allows individuals to refuse medical treatment,

67
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,550
which should be enough

68
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,409
to let patients die peacefully if they wish.

69
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,850
Yes.

70
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,210
That’s true,

71
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,770
but are we forgetting something?

72
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,330
Are we neglecting the feelings of the patients themselves?

73
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,620
The ones enduring unbearable suffering in their final days—

74
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,190
both the patients themselves and their families,

75
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,730
how much suffering must they endure

76
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,860
before the patients naturally pass away?

77
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,450
We now have medicine,

78
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,640
specialists,

79
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,200
palliative care doctors,

80
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,330
and new drugs to help patients

81
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,970
through those terrible times.

82
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,830
I firmly believe that

83
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,790
what you’re saying is true, in an ideal world

84
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,500
where there are enough medical personnel

85
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,230
and everyone has equal access to healthcare.

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,290
Right?

87
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,320
Every word you said, Doctor,

88
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,820
felt like you were speaking directly to me.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,070
And you don’t just talk.

90
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,490
You act.

91
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,510
You make things happen.

92
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,820
This is the address for Wichan Mingsawat.

93
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,370
He’s moved to the nursery building.

94
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,690
I just gave his relatives sleeping pills,

95
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,130
so no one will be awake around 3 AM.

96
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,460
So,

97
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,630
you saw what I did

98
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,200
and decided to follow my example?

99
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,060
Yes.

100
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,790
I stand here before you today,

101
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,060
in the same place as you,

102
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,940
because of you…

103
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,710
We’re not so different.

104
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,610
No, Boss.

105
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,250
That’s not true.

106
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,110
Listen to me carefully.

107
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,570
The most important aspect of euthanasia is consent.

108
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,380
Everyone you killed

109
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,250
didn’t want to die!

110
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,260
No matter how much pain they were in, you had no right to kill them.

111
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,350
What I did…

112
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,590
I performed euthanasia. But what you did, you committed murder!

113
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,530
We are not the same!

114
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,290
No!

115
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,290
No!

116
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,550
If I’m a murderer,

117
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,350
then who are you?

118
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,370
Dr. Kantapat, the saint of patients?

119
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,690
No saint murders people left and right like you.

120
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,010
In this, we are both killers.

121
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,850
Your hands are stained with blood, just like mine.

122
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,230
You’re just another murderous doctor!

123
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,570
And without me, you would’ve been caught long ago.

124
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,789
Let me tell you something.

125
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,870
You’re wrong.

126
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,270
If it weren’t for you, the police wouldn’t know any of this.

127
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,750
It was Nipon Kongkham’s death that brought trouble to me.

128
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,350
And I took care of it for you, didn’t I?

129
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,970
Hey!

130
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,850
I killed them all for you!

131
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,070
I killed Nipon Kongkham,

132
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,720
killed Urai,

133
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,010
killed Som,

134
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,900
killed Somsak!

135
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,920
I killed Somsak

136
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,810
for you.

137
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,350
I killed the man I loved

138
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,770
to protect you.

139
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,030
Somsak died because of you!

140
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,690
And what are you going to do now?

141
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,170
Turn me over to the police?

142
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,330
How dare you?

143
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,190
You and I are no different!

144
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,890
Boss, wait.

145
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,750
Calm down.

146
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,650
I think we can work this out.

147
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,090
Captain,

148
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,090
there’s no one here.

149
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,290
Here’s the deal.

150
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,150
Let On go,

151
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,580
and we can figure this out together.

152
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:26,810
Okay?

153
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,740
Okay?

154
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,490
Who?

155
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,350
Boss.

156
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,590
Who’s calling?

157
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,570
Calm down,

158
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,190
Boss.

159
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,430
It’s nothing.

160
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,150
Fine!

161
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,010
If I go down,

162
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,260
you’re going down too.

163
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,450
- Let’s end this here and now!
- Listen to me, Boss!

164
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:10,430
Doctor!

165
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,490
Doctor!

166
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,530
Doctor, are you in there?

167
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,410
Does the Captain know how his mother died yet?

168
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:36,910
Not yet?

169
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,970
Captain!

170
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,130
Captain!

171
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:57,970
Doctor!

172
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:00,490
Doctor!

173
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,570
Joe,

174
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,620
call the ambulance now!

175
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,090
Yes, sir.

176
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,170
Doctor!

177
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,650
Doctor!

178
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,170
Doctor!

179
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,050
Wiang Singh Hospital

180
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,280
Captain, you should head back first.

181
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,560
This will take a while.

182
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,070
Will he be okay?

183
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,090
As far as I know,

184
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,830
Dr. Kantapat

185
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,890
was shot at close range and lost a lot of blood.

186
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,770
He’s currently undergoing emergency surgery.

187
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,600
As for Pharmacist Boss,

188
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,670
the bullet is lodged in the cervical spine,

189
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,280
a highly challenging area to operate on.

190
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,950
Whether he’ll survive or not is still uncertain.

191
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,740
You’re blunt, Doctor.

192
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,190
Reality is harsh, Captain,

193
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,830
in all matters.

194
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,210
What do you mean?

195
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,670
You know as well as I do

196
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,850
that the killer of the terminally ill patients

197
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,350
wasn’t Director Somsak.

198
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,800
He knew who the real killer was,

199
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,970
that’s why he was silenced.

200
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,420
As far as I know,

201
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,490
Dr. Kan was shot and collapsed,

202
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,210
aware that the police had arrived.

203
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,900
When he managed to grab the gun,

204
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,130
wouldn’t it have been better to aim for the suspect’s legs or body

205
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,300
instead of the head?

206
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,270
But then again,

207
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,810
sometimes the truth is harsher than we imagine.

208
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,790
Hang in there, Captain.

209
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,070
Doctor!

210
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,370
Doctor!

211
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,740
Joe, call the ambulance now!

212
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:51,170
Yes, sir.

213
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,310
Doctor!

214
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,990
The orthopedic surgeon successfully removed the bullet and stabilized the cervical spine.

215
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,840
However, the bullet

216
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,720
struck a critical area of the spine,

217
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
which may have side effects.

218
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,150
We’ll need to wait until he regains consciousness

219
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,630
to perform a detailed evaluation.

220
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,550
Dr. Kantapat was shot at close range,

221
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,079
resulting in significant abdominal bleeding,

222
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,260
leading to shock and unconsciousness.

223
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,450
The surgeon managed to stop the bleeding,

224
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,589
and his vital signs are stable now.

225
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,109
However, he may still require life support for some time.

226
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,150
So it’s no longer life-threatening, right?

227
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,170
We can’t be certain

228
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,150
until he regains consciousness.

229
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,660
Wake up soon, Doctor.

230
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,820
They say that

231
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,330
before death,

232
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,010
all our memories flash before us.

233
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,840
It must be true.

234
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,450
Bangkok, 2002.

235
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,050
No!

236
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,050
You! Stop!

237
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,370
Don’t do this!

238
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,770
Please, stop!

239
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,250
You!

240
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,250
You!

241
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,570
You!

242
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,540
Stop!

243
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,530
Don't do this!

244
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,830
You!

245
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,010
Stop!

246
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,070
You!

247
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,540
The images I saw as a child…

248
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,370
You!

249
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,530
Stop!

250
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,050
You!

251
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,210
Stop!

252
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:28,810
You!

253
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,010
came back to haunt me again.

254
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:32,690
Kan,

255
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,690
Kan, get out quickly!

256
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,210
My mother…

257
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,980
was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

258
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,650
In her final year,

259
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,370
all I could hear were sobs.

260
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,490
The pitiful image of my mother writhing in pain…

261
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,170
remains etched in my memory forever.

262
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,890
Please calm down for a moment.

263
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,850
You,

264
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,340
The thing my teacher wanted to teach the most…

265
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,130
That’s why I chose to study medicine

266
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,740
and became a palliative care doctor.

267
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,290
because the cervical spine…

268
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,460
I don’t want anyone to die in misery

269
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,320
and humiliation like my mother.

270
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,180
Birth, aging, sickness, and death

271
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,290
are part of nature.

272
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,020
But at the very least, everyone deserves to die

273
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,300
with dignity and honor.

274
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,810
A good death

275
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,530
is a matter of humanity and a fundamental right everyone should have.

276
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,010
That’s what I believe.

277
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,460
Yes, Lieutenant.

278
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,090
Captain.

279
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,870
Have you read the document I sent?

280
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,410
Yes, I’ve read it.

281
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,370
Over the past two years,

282
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,760
nearly ten patients under

283
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,630
Dr. Kan’s care died prematurely.

284
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,460
How?

285
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,760
We can’t rule him out as a suspect.

286
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,370
Understood.

287
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,720
The truth is harsh like this.

288
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,250
I found potassium chloride in the fridge.

289
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,220
so I checked the closet,

290
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,000
trying to find a black outfit.

291
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,530
Then Pharmacist Boss caught me.

292
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,120
He tied me up and locked me in the closet.

293
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,040
Did he say why

294
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,130
he did it?

295
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,730
He was afraid I’d call the police to arrest him.

296
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,920
And it seemed…

297
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,890
he noticed the police car outside.

298
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,290
He got very angry.

299
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,670
After that…

300
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,760
I don’t remember or know anything else.

301
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,040
The testimony aligns with the evidence found at Pharmacist Boss’s house.

302
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,710
The gun at the crime scene—

303
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,700
I’ve checked—

304
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,770
it’s registered under Dr. Somsak La-amornchai’s name.

305
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,590
It’s likely the same gun Dr. Kan mentioned,

306
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,130
the one that disappeared with Director Somsak that night.

307
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,990
So how did it end up with Pharmacist Boss?

308
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,810
Does this mean Pharmacist Boss killed Dr. Somsak?

309
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,680
Not yet.

310
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,210
We can only conclude that

311
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,550
after getting testimony from both of them.

312
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,790
Doctor.

313
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,700
Doctor.

314
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,330
Doctor.

315
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,090
How are you feeling?

316
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,340
I came to see you earlier, but you weren’t awake yet.

317
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,330
On…

318
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,900
How is Boss?

319
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,610
He’s still alive,

320
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,850
but he hasn’t woken up yet.

321
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,090
If he does wake up…

322
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:52,620
Doctor,

323
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,830
don’t worry.

324
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,120
Boss was shot in the cervical spine.

325
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,440
He should have woken up by now,

326
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,560
but there’s still no sign of it.

327
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,330
Maybe…

328
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,530
he might never wake up again.

329
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,830
Speak slowly, Doctor.

330
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,570
If it hurts or you can’t manage, just stop.

331
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,500
Don’t push yourself.

332
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,590
I’m fine.

333
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:48,210
Alright.

334
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,410
Let’s start with you leaving your house.

335
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,950
Where did you go?

336
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,090
I went to On’s house,

337
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,070
following the message she sent me.

338
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,250
At the time,

339
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,330
I had no idea

340
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,690
Boss had taken her phone to trick me.

341
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,370
Stay awake!

342
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,840
How’s the patient doing, Professor?

343
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,340
Overall, better, but still unresponsive.

344
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,050
Which is strange.

345
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,000
What should we do next? Do we need further tests?

346
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,360
Alright,

347
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,800
that’s enough for today.

348
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,950
Let’s not exhaust the doctor.

349
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,910
If there’s anything else, I’ll come back.

350
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,830
You can’t escape from me.

351
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,440
Captain,

352
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,510
I’ll head out now.

353
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:08,650
No need.

354
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,360
Wait out front. I’ll be out soon.

355
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:11,940
Understood.

356
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,100
Doctor, get some rest.

357
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,530
I’ll adjust the bed for you.

358
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,530
Alright.

359
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,290
I’ll come back

360
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,530
around five after I’m done

361
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,790
with work. See you then.

362
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,900
Alright.

363
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:52,400
Tew…

364
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,780
what’s the police conclusion on the case?

365
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:03,890
Nothing yet.

366
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,650
Just rest

367
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,120
so you can recover quickly.

368
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,170
Alright.

369
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,560
Sleep as much as you can.

370
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,570
Got it.

371
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,570
Overall, Dr. Kan’s testimony matches On’s.

372
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,750
There’s additional evidence

373
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,810
from Pharmacist Boss’s phone.

374
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,810
We found photos of forty palliative care patients.

375
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,570
Forty?

376
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:23,900
Yes.

377
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,330
Wow, that’s the whole department.

378
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,890
Was he planning to kill them?

379
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,330
That’s sick.

380
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:55,970
Captain…

381
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,040
my mom…

382
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,210
she died prematurely too.

383
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,780
Overall, everything seems better now.

384
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,690
I want to recover quickly.

385
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,550
I’m worried about my patients.

386
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,540
Get plenty of rest, then. That will help you recover faster.

387
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,350
Thank you.

388
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:37,370
Yes.

389
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:48,990
So,

390
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,190
how’s Boss doing?

391
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,210
He’s awake.

392
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,480
At first,

393
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,200
I thought I was dead.

394
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,100
But no—

395
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,050
that bullet

396
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
didn’t kill me.

397
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,490
It sent me to hell

398
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,450
while I’m still breathing.

399
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,730
The bullet damaged the C-spine,

400
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,070
resulting in a spinal cord injury.

401
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,790
Currently, the patient cannot move the lower half of their body.

402
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:15,850
Only for now, right?

403
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,490
No, it's a complete cord injury.

404
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,770
The spinal cord has lost all control.

405
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,930
You might feel slight sensations in your neck or arms,

406
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,310
but for your torso and legs…

407
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,330
they likely won’t recover.

408
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,490
Paralysis?

409
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,050
Yes.

410
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,160
I’m paralyzed.

411
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,610
Unable to take care of myself.

412
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,520
I’ve become the very thing I hated most.

413
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,920
I’ve become my father.

414
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,110
Useless.

415
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,970
Something that doesn’t deserve to exist in this world.

416
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,130
It shouldn’t have turned out like this.

417
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,250
He can’t move below his neck

418
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,660
but can still talk.

419
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,450
Maybe this is karma for me.

420
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,610
No, Doctor.

421
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,070
Don’t think like that.

422
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,490
Boss is awake.

423
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,740
Sooner or later…

424
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,530
the police will uncover the truth.

425
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:46,860
Doctor,

426
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,870
you’re a kind, compassionate person.

427
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,090
You’ll be okay.

428
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:52,970
And what do you think, On?

429
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,900
What will the world do to reward a good person

430
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,210
like me for what I’ve done?

431
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,220
Prison?

432
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,690
Or execution?

433
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,490
On,

434
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,650
what are you doing here?

435
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,290
I have a proposal.

436
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,950
I checked your background.

437
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,520
You’re alone.

438
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,090
No family or anyone else.

439
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,380
I’m willing to take care of you

440
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,470
as best as I can

441
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,410
for the rest of your life

442
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,920
if you stay silent.

443
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,490
You won’t escape blame, regardless.

444
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,570
Adding another guilty party won’t reduce your sentence.

445
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,590
The court might decide not to imprison you

446
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,770
because of your paralysis.

447
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,670
But your life will still be very difficult.

448
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,690
I can help you.

449
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,670
Captain, here to visit the doctor?

450
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,200
Yes.

451
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,520
Did you stop by your mother’s house, Tew?

452
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,230
No.

453
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,860
Sa went.

454
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,600
She said the flowers are blooming

455
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,570
and brought some for you.

456
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,890
Your mother loved these flowers

457
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,810
and planted them all over the yard.

458
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:17,900
Sa said

459
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,460
you like them too.

460
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,570
I like what they symbolize.

461
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,930
Blue hydrangeas—

462
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,520
they mean forgiveness.

463
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,540
How is he feeling, Doctor?

464
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,730
Much better now.

465
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,640
I think you could question him tomorrow,

466
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,970
though probably not for long.

467
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,140
Alright.

468
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,960
Captain, want me to come with you tomorrow?

469
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,810
You’ve got the Chatchai case, don’t you?

470
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,390
This one’s not hard;

471
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,730
Joe and I can handle it.

472
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,500
t’s not about difficulty;

473
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,010
I’m just going to support you.

474
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,420
Captain,

475
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,430
whatever happens tomorrow,

476
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,450
stay strong.

477
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,940
And don’t forget, our duty

478
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,450
is to uphold the law.

479
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,650
Wiang Singh Hospital

480
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,580
I’d like to question Chanchai Maneerat

481
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,500
about the events of…

482
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,040
I’m the one who killed everyone.

483
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,500
What did you say?

484
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,490
I’m the one who killed everyone.

485
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,990
I’m the one who wore black,

486
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,720
went out at night,

487
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,430
and killed them all.

488
00:39:59,440 --> 00:39:59,990
I did it.

489
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,480
Mr. Chanchai Maneerat,

490
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,770
one more question:

491
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,150
When you say you killed everyone,

492
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,870
does that include my mother?

493
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,400
Boss!

494
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,110
Ovarian cancer,

495
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,530
terminal stage.

496
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,450
Raweewan Khambunrueang.

497
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,850
- Boss!
- Captain!

498
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,530
Captain!

499
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,480
Captain,

500
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,710
let’s come back tomorrow.

501
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:49,970
Let’s go now.

502
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:51,290
Captain,

503
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:51,870
calm down.

504
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,700
So,

505
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,160
the real killer is Pharmacist Chanchai Maneerat.

506
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,600
Kawin, draft a new report.

507
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,650
Understood.

508
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,690
Finally, it’s over, Captain.

509
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,370
This time, really over.

510
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,020
No reopening this case.

511
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,070
Yes, sir.

512
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,150
Pang.

513
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,270
Wow, you came so quickly. Thanks for taking my shift!

514
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,130
No problem, happy to help.

515
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,180
Not too many patients today, right?

516
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,670
Not at all, luckily!

517
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,960
Two discharged, one admitted.

518
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,430
Only Pharmacist Boss is still here.

519
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,070
Oh, that’s great.

520
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,800
- Really great.
- Alright, Pang, head home.

521
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:41,880
Thanks so much!

522
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,890
I’m off, then.

523
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:45,570
Thanks!

524
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,720
- Get home safely!
- I will.

525
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,460
How was your day? Tiring?

526
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,330
A little bit.

527
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,710
That's fine.

528
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,370
Here,

529
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,130
you must be thirsty.

530
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,540
I know.

531
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,190
I got your favorite.

532
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,050
Thank you so much!

533
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,870
Of course.

534
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,640
I met a lot of people today,

535
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,400
including the Captain.

536
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,720
He even asked about his mother.

537
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,640
What did you say to him?

538
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,130
Think about

539
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,130
how he’d feel

540
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,850
if he knew the person who killed his mother with their own hands…

541
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:38,410
was you.

542
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,460
He can’t know about this.

543
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,950
If you don’t follow my orders,

544
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,690
I’ll tell him everything.

545
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,500
Murderer doctor!

546
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,230
Do it already.

547
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,130
What are you waiting for?

548
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,780
I need to talk to you first.

549
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,370
Follow protocol.

550
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,290
No need.

551
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:57,670
I’ve made my decision.

552
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:01,260
Boss,

553
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,690
you’re not a terminal patient.

554
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,610
You might not regain full mobility,

555
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,600
but you can still live.

556
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,410
Live?

557
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,150
Look at me.

558
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,300
If this is what living means,

559
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,910
I’d rather die.

560
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,290
I don’t want to be like my father—

561
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,610
a useless lump of flesh, good for nothing.

562
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,090
If you don’t want the Captain to know the truth,

563
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,450
shut up

564
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,680
and kill me.

565
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,700
I want you to remember me like this.

566
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,460
My life is like this because of you.

567
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:19,020
I’m your patient.

568
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,220
Take responsibility.

569
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:27,480
Boss,

570
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,470
think positive thoughts.

571
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,380
Cardiac arrest patient!

572
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:42,850
Where should I tickle you?

573
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,170
Over here!

574
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:44,770
(OneD Original)

575
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,180
Welcome home.

576
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,160
Stay with me.

577
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,060
I won’t let you down.

578
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,410
I think it’s a threat,

579
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,720
like they’re trying to mess with my head.

580
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,170
That’s Kantapat, isn’t it?

581
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:13,770
You actually came.
