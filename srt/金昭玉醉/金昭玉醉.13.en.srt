states

12
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,260
or you don't want me to come back?

13
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,260
I heard that you were ill.

14
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,260
You didn't go back to the palace.

15
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,260
You should go back to the palace.

16
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,260
Who would have thought that you would be so close to my husband?

17
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,260
You are so quiet.

18
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,260
Your child?

19
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,260
Your child?

20
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,260
Is he worthy of me?

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,260
What are you doing?

22
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,260
Sister Tang, I was the one who made the decision

23
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,260
to give birth to a child for you.

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,260
I am also thinking for you.

25
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,260
If you want to fight,

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,260
then fight me.

27
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,260
Okay.

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,260
Your Highness!

29
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,260
If you can't make him cry, then you should take care of him.

30
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,260
Lu Shao, are you crazy?

31
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,260
Yes, I am crazy!

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,260
Since I came to the palace,

33
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,260
I have been living in peace.

34
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,260
I even buried all my family's assets in the ground.

35
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,260
But you...

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,260
I have been living in peace since I was born.

37
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,260
My sister Tang was born in the same year as me.

38
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,260
Now she has a child.

39
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,260
You are the one who is heartless and heartless.

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,260
You are a bastard!

41
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,260
You are a bastard!

42
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,260
Lu Shao,

43
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,260
you have been married for many years.

44
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,260
You are a bastard!

45
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,260
You forced your father to die because of you.

46
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
You are not worthy of your husband.

47
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,260
You are a bastard!

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,260
You are not worthy of your wife.

49
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,260
You are a bastard!

50
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,260
You committed four crimes.

51
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
I did not punish you.

52
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,260
You are already a man of conscience.

53
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
You dare to humiliate me?

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,260
Then I will

55
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,260
have a good meal

56
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,260
and fight with you.

57
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,260
How about that?

58
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,260
Are you crazy?

59
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,260
Enough!

60
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,260
You are so ridiculous.

61
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,260
What is the dignity of the royal family?

62
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,260
During the period of the imperial edict,

63
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,260
you were already a man of conscience.

64
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,260
Even if Lu Zhao made a mistake,

65
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,260
his parents were dead.

66
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,260
You have no right to divorce your wife.

67
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,260
Lu Zhao,

68
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,260
Chu Wang has his own reasons.

69
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260
But you have no choice.

70
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,260
You even want to kill your father.

71
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,260
You cannot bear the position of the princess.

72
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,260
You are a couple.

73
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,260
You should not be afraid of your father.

74
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,260
You are a man of conscience.

75
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,260
You are a couple.

76
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,260
I do not want to see you become enemies

77
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,260
and disgrace the royal family.

78
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,260
I order you to divorce now.

79
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,260
You will be married and will not be together.

80
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Thank you for your help.

81
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,260
The imperial edict is urgent.

82
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,260
I will write a divorce letter

83
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,260
and have a good talk with Zhao.

84
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,260
I beg you to let me

85
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,260
and Zhao

86
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,260
have a private talk.

87
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,260
Lu Zhao, are you willing to do it?

88
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
Yes.

89
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,260
I will.

90
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
I will.

91
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,260
I will.

92
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,260
I have never written a letter

93
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,260
to send to the Pilan Palace.

94
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,260
How did you know that I was there?

95
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,260
You do not deserve to know.

96
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,260
The divorce letter is here.

97
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,260
If you want it, come and get it.

98
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,260
Uncle Jiu Huang is outside.

99
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,260
How dare you make a noise?

100
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,260
What?

101
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,260
Are you afraid?

102
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,260
You know kung fu.

103
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,260
You are not Lu Zhao.

104
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Who are you?

105
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,260
I am Lu Zhao.

106
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,260
I am also a shadow of your destiny.

107
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,260
By the way,

108
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,260
if I did not stop in time,

109
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,260
I am afraid that I have to prepare for your funeral.

110
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,260
Do you think you can hook up with Xiao Ren?

111
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,260
I am not afraid of you.

112
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,260
I am afraid that you will not be able to do it.

113
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Xiao Ren,

114
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
you are just a little smart.

115
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,260
You can move me.

116
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,260
Do you know that

117
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,260
in a short time,

118
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,260
Xiao Ren will personally send you to my bed?

119
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,260
You will come to me like a dog.

120
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,260
You better pray that you live a few more days.

121
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,260
Otherwise, you will not have the chance to dream if you die.

122
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,260
Lu Zhao,

123
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,260
wait and see

124
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
how arrogant you can be.

125
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,260
I will not let you die here.

126
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,260
You will not be allowed to enter the palace.

127
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,260
I beg you to leave.

128
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,260
I will not let you die here.

129
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,260
I will not let you leave.

130
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,260
You will not be allowed to enter the palace.

131
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Lu Zhao,

132
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
from now on,

133
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
you are no longer the Princess Consort of Chu.

134
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,260
You do not need to follow me

135
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,260
back to the Pilan Palace's order.

136
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,260
You have achieved your purpose

137
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,260
of taking advantage of my chef.

138
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,260
Uncle Jiu, you...

139
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,260
The reason I didn't expose you

140
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,260
is because you have some deep thoughts with Miao He.

141
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
But you must remember,

142
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,260
those who try to get into the deep abyss

143
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,260
will be the ones who are caught in it.

144
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,260
I hope you will be polite and considerate in the future.

145
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
Take care.

146
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
Princess Miao He,

147
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
Uncle Jiu,

148
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,260
the sister of Tong Ba of the New Garden,

149
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,260
no wonder she is willing to help me.

150
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,260
Greetings, Your Majesty.

151
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,260
Good. Good, my dear.

152
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,260
After all, you caught the King of Nanzhao

153
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,260
and solved my big problem.

154
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,260
This is a life-long journey.

155
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
I will reward you with a lot of rewards.

156
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,260
Whatever you want,

157
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,260
I will give it to you.

158
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,260
I have a favor to ask of you.

159
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,260
Go ahead.

160
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,260
The guilty minister, Liu Mingfu, committed suicide.

161
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
His residence is already in the palace.

162
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,260
But the daughter of Liu Mingfu, Lu Zhao,

163
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,260
just left the Palace of the King of Chu.

164
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,260
I beg Your Majesty to return his residence to Lu Zhao.

165
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,260
Just for this?

166
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Just for this.

167
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
Good.

168
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Good.

169
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

170
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
Come.

171
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
I...

172
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
It's my last request.

173
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,260
Let's go.

174
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
I'd love to.

175
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,260
Let's find a hotel.

176
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
No.

177
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,260
Be a good wife.

178
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,260
Not in.

179
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
Look around.

180
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,260
I'll show you right away.

181
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,260
What are you doing?

182
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
I really looked for a friend ATM.

183
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
I can then call you called beloved colleague.

184
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,540
Can you talk?

185
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,460
Yes!

186
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,220
Is this house sold?

187
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,900
From today,

188
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,500
This is your home part.

189
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
You don't have to keepenergetic anybody's house.

190
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
And the servant you were in the Liu family before.

191
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,500
From now on, you have your elders, friends by your side, and...

192
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,500
And... what?

193
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Ah Zhao, I didn't build this house to put you in this place.

194
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
If there's a place you want to go,

195
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
do what you want to do, and do it boldly.

196
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Only I will watch over you. If you want to come back, I'll be there anytime.

197
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Thank you.

198
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Go and take a look.

199
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
You're not coming in?

200
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm not coming in.

201
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Our Xuntian Gate has too many killings.

202
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
We can't even get a name or power.

203
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Usually, people in Xun's house are on the side door.

204
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,500
If we go to the main door, it's a big deal.

205
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
You're going to the house today. I'll just go to the side door.

206
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Go.

207
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
It's no use.

208
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Xuntian Gate is the emperor's sword.

209
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
The emperor's sword is a sword.

210
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,500
In order to make the people of the world be blessed,

211
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
how can we not enjoy it?

212
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Today, you helped me.

213
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
There will be many people who will rely on you.

214
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
This is the meaning of Xuntian Gate.

215
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Xiao Ren, if it weren't for you,

216
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,500
I wouldn't even think about when I can return to this sunny place.

217
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Ah Zhao, I know better than anyone what you're carrying in your heart.

218
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
You can come back now.

219
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I just don't want you to be a part of the evil.

220
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Have you decided to stay?

221
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I've decided.

222
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Let's go.

223
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Thank you.

225
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Xuntian Gate still has some official business. I'll go back first.

226
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Yes, official business is important.

227
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
So he did so much for me.

228
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
He did so much for me.

233
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Shaoyao,

234
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
is he injured?

235
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
He's been injured for three days.

236
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Don't worry.

237
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
The Ling Manor was confiscated.

238
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
His Majesty is the one who's willing to take it back.

239
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
I heard that the report of King of Nanzhao's arrest

240
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
must be to take back the house

241
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,500
so he's in a hurry to catch King of Nanzhao, right?

242
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I understand what he's doing,

243
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
what he's thinking.

244
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Miss,

245
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,500
you don't have to worry about it.

246
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,500
A few years ago, you picked up a wounded pigeon

247
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
and took good care of it.

248
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,500
One day, the pigeon flew away.

249
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
You just went there.

250
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,500
The pigeon spent the most difficult time with you.

251
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,500
You told it to stay.

252
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,500
But the master said

253
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
he was too sleepy to see it.

254
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,500
So he let it go in the good weather.

255
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,500
But do you know?

256
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
The pigeon came back that night.

257
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Because it thought

258
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
the master was at home.

259
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I think for a pigeon,

260
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,500
flying to the sky and returning to the court

261
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
are not conflicted.

262
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Miss,

263
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
the one who truly loves you

264
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,500
will choose the path you choose.

265
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
A'Zhao,

266
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
I didn't take this house

267
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
to put you in this place.

268
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
If you have any place you want to go,

269
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
do what you want to do.

270
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
I'll be here

271
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
if you want to come back.

272
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Do not be afraid.

273
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Do not be afraid.

274
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
He never my enemy.

275
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Neither once he taught me to be embarrassed.

276
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
We are the same kind of people.

277
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,020
Something's wrong, Miss Lu.

278
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,300
The Chief Xiao is seriously injured.

279
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
Commander Ling asked you to go and have a look.

280
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
What?

281
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
I...

282
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
I haven't had the time to tell you how I feel.

283
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,700
Please don't send anything!
