1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,700
Yeah, you know you got the

2
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,040
Hello,

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and help my sister to get revenge.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Your highness, he's here.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The show begins.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ah Xiao!

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Xiao!

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Xiao!

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ah Xiao!

10
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Ah Xiao!

11
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Ah Xiao!

12
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Ah Xiao!

13
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Xiao!

14
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you want to see him die in front of you?

15
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Look.

16
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Doesn't he look like the day you were killed?

17
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You two are really the same kind of people.

18
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You know the way to death, but you never turn back.

19
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Since you don't want to cooperate with me,

20
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll let you pay for your death.

21
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If he dies, you'll never get the Wufang Valley.

22
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Xiao Ren, do you want to see him die in front of you?

23
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ah Zhao.

24
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll take you home.

25
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Xiao Ren, kneel!

26
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll let him go once he's dead.

27
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll let him go once he's dead.

28
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Xiao Ren.

29
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Xiao Ren.

30
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Si Tu Xing Yuan, I'll let you die!

31
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Xiao!

32
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Stop them!

33
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Protect the people!

34
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Do you want to die twice?

35
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Retreat!

36
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's actually him.

37
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What's going on?

38
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He was seriously injured before.

39
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What's going on this time?

40
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And why is he in such pain?

41
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He doesn't have any pain, does he?

42
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Speak!

43
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The poison that Si Tu Xing gave you before was inescapable.

44
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Master personally...

45
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What personally?

46
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What personally?

47
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He personally dug out the golden silkworm bone in his heart.

48
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's how he got the poison that could pierce through your heart.

49
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He dug out the golden silkworm bone in his heart.

50
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's how he got the poison that could pierce through your heart.

51
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He dug out the golden silkworm bone in his heart.

52
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But if he was just injured like that, he wouldn't be so serious.

53
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Stop!

54
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Lin Su!

55
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You can't stop him.

56
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You still haven't figured out who the person in front of you is?

57
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Master is here.

58
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I dare not hide it from you.

59
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Master died unexpectedly before.

60
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
In order to save him, he used magic.

61
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He died in the name of the gods.

62
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This...

63
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is the price.

64
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yi...

65
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yi...

66
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yin Ming...

67
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Huan Ming...

68
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is a natural law.

69
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It takes a life-long life to be able to bring him back to life.

70
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
If I can bring my mother back,

71
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
what's the point of me running to the netherworld?

72
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can go back.

73
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Go back.

74
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yi...

75
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yi...

76
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yi...

77
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yi...

78
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yi...

79
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yi...

80
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yi...

81
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yi...

82
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yi...

83
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yi...

84
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yi...

85
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yi...

86
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yi...

87
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yi...

88
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yi...

89
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yi...

90
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yi...

91
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yi...

92
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yi...

93
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yi...

94
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yi...

95
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yi...

96
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yi...

97
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yi...

98
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yi...

99
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yi...

100
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yi...

101
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yi...

102
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yi...

103
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yi...

104
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You're such a fool.

105
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:38,180
Avenged the

106
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Don't make fun of me.

107
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,180
I'm back.

108
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,180
It's me, A'Ren.

109
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Ai Jie is back.

110
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,180
Ai Jie.

111
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,180
Ai Jie.

112
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
If I didn't come back,

113
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,180
I would have been in danger here,

114
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,180
hurt myself,

115
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,180
and have been hiding from me for so long.

116
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,180
Ai Jie.

117
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,180
I'm sorry.

118
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,180
I'm too scared.

119
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,180
I'm too anxious.

120
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
Don't leave me.

121
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,180
How can I accept it if you do this?

122
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,180
This is your life.

123
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,180
Is it worth it?

124
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,180
I can bring you back

125
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,180
with half of my life.

126
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,180
It's a great favor to me.

127
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,180
I'm sorry.

128
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Is it painful

129
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,180
to come to Golden Canggu?

130
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,180
I'm sorry.

131
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,180
I'm sorry.

132
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,180
A'Ren.

133
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Let's get married.

134
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,180
I won't leave you alone again.

135
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,180
Okay.

136
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,180
Okay.

137
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,180
I'm sorry.

138
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,180
I'm sorry.

139
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,180
I'm sorry.

140
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
I'm sorry.

141
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
I'm sorry.
