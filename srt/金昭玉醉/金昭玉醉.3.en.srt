00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Hello

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Good morning

3
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Today's live broadcast

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,140
will approximately follow the 這 gotta go

5
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,500
A few months ago

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,060
Goodbye everyone

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
Thank you for watching

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,620
What's up

9
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,600
John Lee

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,920
Where's my face

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,920
I hope you can help me to make up for my sins.

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Drink the medicine.

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,920
It's bitter if I smell it. I don't want it.

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,920
Drink it.

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,920
You are an adult now. Wipe it yourself.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,920
The secret weapon of Situ County's soldiers has been confirmed.

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,920
I have to go there myself. I have the evidence.

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
I gave my jade pendant to Princess Lu Zhang.

19
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Please take care of it for me.

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,920
I will give it to His Majesty as a witness.

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Sister, I will go with you this time.

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,920
I think it's a bit strange.

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
I will be careful. Take care of your wound. Wait for me.

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
It's not important.

25
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,920
You don't know the pain. You don't know how serious it is.

26
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,920
I heard that you find the medicine bitter every time.

27
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,920
You don't drink it secretly, right? Don't be willful.

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm not willful. I'm not a child anymore.

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Only you...

30
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,920
A'Ran, I will leave this to you.

31
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
It's an order from the Imperial Guard.

32
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Order? It's all orders.

33
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
Take care of your wound.

34
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Bring me back. I will give you the medicine.

35
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
I'm leaving.

37
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,920
By the way, drink the medicine. I made it myself.

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,920
I know. Come back soon.

39
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,920
The End

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Miss, you stayed up all night.

41
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,920
I'm sorry. How is the medicine?

42
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,920
I sent someone to look at the pills. They are harmless.

43
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,920
And they are good for detoxifying the body.

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
This is the secret medicine of Xuntian Gate.

45
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Take it and see it with your own eyes.

46
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,920
What kind of lies and hell do you live in?

47
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,920
The End

48
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Miss.

49
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,920
The End

50
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Miss.

51
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
Miss.

52
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,920
The End

53
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,920
The End

54
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Miss, your eyes...

55
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
I can see them.

56
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,920
The End

57
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Your Highness, why did you do this?

58
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
You haven't told me.

59
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Xiao Jinyu is always causing me trouble.

60
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,920
I don't know how many weapons the weapons are.

61
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Xuntian Gate is so tight.

62
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Did it hurt you?

63
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
It's okay.

64
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Xiao Jinyu is a dead man.

65
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Xuntian Gate without its owner is not a big deal.

66
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Your Highness, you are so wise.

67
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,920
I thought Xuntian Gate was so powerful.

68
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,920
It's still under your control.

69
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,920
No matter how powerful they are, they have soft thunder.

70
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,920
It's not hard to find their fate and take them down.

71
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Then who is your fate?

72
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Lu Zhang or me?

73
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
What do you think?

74
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
After his birthday party,

75
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,920
I will give you Lu Zhang after we get the Lu family's assets.

76
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Then I will have to throw out the child in his belly.

77
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,920
It's a pity that he is blind.

78
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,920
I can't see what the child he was thrown out looks like.

79
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,920
His eyes are all the result of your poison.

80
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
We are the one who are in love with each other.

81
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,920
I can only marry you with Lu Zhang's assets.

82
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,920
I have to wait until he is 18 years old.

83
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Then I can take out the assets.

84
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
I will be like a rat.

85
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,920
I can't wait to break him.

86
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
I love you.

87
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Xue'er, Xue'er.

88
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
I like you.

89
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
You are cool.

90
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,920
But you are full of desire.

91
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
You look like me.

92
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,920
You are not as calm and boring as Lu Zhang.

93
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
You are not as cool as me.

94
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
You are not as cool as me.

95
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
You are not as cool as me.

96
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
You are not as cool as me.

97
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
You are not as cool as me.

98
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
You are not as cool as me.

99
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
You are not as cool as me.

100
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
You are not as cool as me.

101
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
You are not as cool as me.

102
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
You are not as cool as me.

103
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
You are not as cool as me.

104
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
You are not as cool as me.

105
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
You are not as cool as me.

106
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
You are not as cool as me.

107
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
You are not as cool as me.

108
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
You are not as cool as me.

109
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
You are not as cool as me.

110
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,920
You are not as cool as me.

111
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
You are not as cool as me.

112
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
You are not as cool as me.

113
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
You are not as cool as me.

114
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
You are not as cool as me.

115
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You are not as cool as me.

116
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
You are not as cool as me.

117
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
You are not as cool as me.

118
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
You are not as cool as me.

119
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
You are not as cool as me.

120
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
You are not as cool as me.

121
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,920
Zhaoyue この場合はここまで表してあった

122
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,560
Zhaoyue Now, Since then, 今後のみなさんに

123
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,740
Sir, What's up with you, Sir, What's up with you,

124
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Someone just now 剛才有人

125
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,380
It's impossible 不可能

126
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,620
There's someone coming from Zhaoyue profiles. 昭月 việc

127
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,860
I'm sorry to say that Hiji's became my Half-Century Grandfather after you both mentioned about it

128
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,660
At last, the Lord of the MIKE

129
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,960
said you would get married instead

130
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,620
and he would be more grown up

131
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,620
but he still gave half of his grand-c 거의 love to my daughter

132
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,260
now we have the websites

133
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,780
and I did it too

134
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,080
but I regretted nothing

135
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,740
and now

136
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,340
Wu Qingxin loved me

137
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,220
since then

138
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,120
my husband's gone

139
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Because this is the first child of the king and I.

140
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:36,280
Beautiful girl.

141
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,280
The pain of being alone is my happiness

142
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Miss

143
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Miss, where did you go?

144
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Your clothes are wet

145
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Miss

146
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Miss

147
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Qin

148
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Miss

149
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Go

150
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Go find someone's clothes

151
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
I want to leave secretly from the back door

152
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Oh, right

153
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Don't alert anyone

154
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Now

155
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Now

156
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Miss

157
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
What happened?

158
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
Si Tu Xian

159
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Du Meng Ru is the one who killed me

160
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
I want to go to Liu's Mansion to save my father

161
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
What?

162
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
That's too much

163
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Miss, I want to go with you

164
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
No

165
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Listen to me

166
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Chu Wang's Mansion is in danger

167
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
Liu's Mansion is not safe

168
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Right

169
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Go find Jin Zhao to help him

170
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Go

171
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Yes

172
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Go

173
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
It's really her

174
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
It's really her

175
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
It seems to be from Xuntian Sect

176
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
I don't know

177
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
The leader of Xuntian Sect, Xiao Jin Yu, is dead

178
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Xiao Jin Yu is dead?

179
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
How is that possible?

180
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
He is the emperor's confidant

181
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
The leader of Xuntian Sect, Xiao Jin Yu

182
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
It's him

183
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
In time

184
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Xiao Jin Yu should be dead

185
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Without the leader of Xuntian Sect

186
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
It's not a big deal

187
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Si Tu Xian killed him

188
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Go

189
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Father

190
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Father

191
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Zhao Er

192
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Zhao Er

193
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Father

194
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
Uncle

195
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Zhao Er

196
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
You can see it

197
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
What's going on?

198
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Father

199
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
We will talk about the fengming later

200
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Listen to me

201
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
It's really too much

202
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Zhao Er

203
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Don't worry

204
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
I will help you

205
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Yes

206
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Zhao Er, don't worry

207
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,280
If I do something that is really against you

208
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Your father and aunt will help you

209
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Master

210
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Chu Wang is here

211
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Father

212
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
Zhao Er, don't be afraid

213
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
I am here

214
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Zhao Er

215
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Zhao Er

216
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
You can really see it

217
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
You can't even see a blind person

218
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
You almost missed the big picture

219
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Father

220
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Zhao Er

221
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
Zhao Er

222
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Zhao Er

223
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Zhao Er
