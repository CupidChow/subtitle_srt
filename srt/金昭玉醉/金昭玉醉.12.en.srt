1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:56,360
the

2
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,440
age

3
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,840
does

4
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,640
to see how I can change my fate and be tough.

5
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Thank you, Uncle Jiu.

6
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,840
You have to dye these fabrics

7
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,840
and embroider them in the Pilan Palace.

8
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,840
You can learn from them.

9
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,840
You have to understand the hard work of the people

10
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,840
so that you can help them

11
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,840
to be like their children.

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
I will follow your instructions.

13
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
What is the origin of this Uncle Jiu?

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
He is a man of great virtue.

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,840
Uncle Jiu, what is the origin of this?

16
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,840
You bitch!

17
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,840
You are a man of great virtue.

18
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Today, I will ruin your face!

19
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,840
You bitch!

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Kill me!

21
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
I am the heir of the King of Ru Nan.

22
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
How dare you hurt me?

23
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,840
If you kill him now,

24
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,840
blood will get dirty.

25
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,840
I don't like it.

26
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Take him down.

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,840
Yes, Your Highness.

28
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Now or later,

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
I will let you choose.

30
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,840
What poison did you feed me?

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,840
It is a miracle poison.

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
A year later, it will bleed and die.

33
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Your Highness,

34
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
I am sorry.

35
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
I will never do it again.

36
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
Please give me the antidote.

37
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
I promise I will never do it again.

38
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
I heard someone was going to ruin my face.

39
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Who said that?

40
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Is it you?

41
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Your Highness,

42
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
I was blind.

43
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Please forgive me.

44
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,840
I will never do it again.

45
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Please forgive me.

46
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
I forgive you

47
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
for your sincerity.

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,840
When you go back,

49
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,840
you will build a temple

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,840
and save the people.

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
I will give you the antidote.

52
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Okay.

53
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
I will go back and arrange for people to enter the temple.

54
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,840
What did you feed him?

55
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,840
It is a healing potion.

56
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
You don't care about the rumors.

57
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Why are you so angry today?

58
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,840
He made you lose weight 20 times.

59
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,840
Your Highness,

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
you are not allowed to enter the temple.

61
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
I am a foreigner.

62
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
If we are discovered,

63
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
it will be inappropriate.

64
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
You are from the Lu clan.

65
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
My father-in-law is just dead.

66
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
You are just a guard.

67
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Yes.

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Your Highness,

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,840
the princess lives in the front.

70
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
You are angry because of me?

71
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
So what?

72
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
A'Cheng,

73
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,840
you like me,

74
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,840
but you can't go back.

75
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,840
What?

76
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
I don't want to go back.

77
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
What?

78
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
I don't want to go back.

79
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
I will be back.

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
I will be back.

81
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
If you go back,

82
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
you are in danger.

83
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
You like me.

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,320
PM XIAO

85
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,960
Does it...

86
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,000
no more than that?

87
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
Your Highness.

88
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
Zhao.

89
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Your Highness, why are you here?

90
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
I know you are suffering here.

91
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
I miss you so much.

92
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
So I came to visit you.

93
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Thank you for your concern.

94
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
I'm fine.

95
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
This is...

96
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,840
This is the leader of your Lu clan in Jiangnan.

97
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I'm here to see you.

98
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Please rise.

99
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Thank you.

100
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,840
I know you are suffering in the Pilan Palace.

101
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,840
I brought the documents here after discussing with you.

102
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Please have a look.

103
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
You are very thoughtful.

104
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
You are thoughtful.

105
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,840
You can help me solve my problem.

106
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Zhao.

107
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,840
I'm so happy to marry you.

108
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Zhao.

109
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Come.

110
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
I'll give you the inheritance.

111
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
It's your last chance.

112
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
You can't leave me alone.

113
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
I'll take care of it.

114
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,840
I'll be here for you.

115
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Zhao.

116
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
I'll be here for you.

117
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Zhao.

118
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
I'll be here for you.

119
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Zhao.

120
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Zhao.

121
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Zhao.

122
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Zhao.

123
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Zhao.

124
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Zhao.

125
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Zhao.

126
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
I will kill you.

127
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
You can't have it.

128
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
I'm afraid you'll die if you miss me.

129
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
I'm afraid you'll die if you miss me.

130
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Princess, just press it.

131
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,440
the

132
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,440
in

133
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,940
Have

134
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,780
ahn

135
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,820
have

136
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,500
have

137
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,460
have

138
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,460
I will do whatever it takes to make up for your loss.

139
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,460
I will go back to my house.

140
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,460
Take care, Princess Consort.

141
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,460
I'm leaving.

142
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,460
What are you doing?

143
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,460
Master, Minister Su Xian is here.

144
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,460
He's almost at the door.

145
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,460
Hurry up!

146
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,460
It's too late.

147
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,460
Once Si Tu Xian gets the money,

148
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,460
he will surely make a weapon again.

149
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460
But he won't dare to look for people from the south.

150
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,460
I'm afraid he will have to find a gunman to cooperate with.

151
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,460
He will have to catch a spy.

152
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,460
The north and south are very far apart.

153
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,460
He's the royal family.

154
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,460
How dare he collude with the gunmen?

155
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,460
Back then, the traitor Song Lou

156
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,460
went to the north with General Xiao.

157
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,460
He was a traitor.

158
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,460
In the end, he became the traitor.

159
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,460
Once a person has a bad intention,

160
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
he will become ruthless.

161
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,460
He thought he got the money.

162
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,460
He didn't know it was a trap.

163
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,460
This is the end of the game.

164
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,460
How is Liu Yin Xue?

165
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,460
She's not pretending.

166
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,460
She treats herself as the royal consort.

167
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,460
She's a bit confused.

168
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,460
She's getting more and more sensitive.

169
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,460
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,460
It seems that it's time

171
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,460
to go back to visit

172
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,460
my poor cousin.

173
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,460
I have an important matter

174
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,460
to see Uncle Jiu.

175
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,460
What is it?

176
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,460
My family is ill.

177
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,460
I'm very worried.

178
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,460
I beg you to allow me

179
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,460
to go back to visit.

180
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,460
Do you know the rules of the Pilan Palace?

181
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,460
You are not allowed to go out during the training.

182
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,460
The family told me

183
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,460
that my cousin is sick.

184
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,460
She has been in the bed for days.

185
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,460
If she goes back to visit,

186
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,460
I won't be able to visit her.

187
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,460
I will be very worried.

188
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,460
I'm sorry

189
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,460
to my aunt.

190
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,460
Uncle Jiu has been teaching me

191
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,460
to be a good person.

192
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,460
If I don't care

193
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,460
about my family,

194
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,460
how can I be a good person?

195
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,460
If you are worried

196
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,460
that I will be a good person,

197
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,460
I beg you

198
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,460
to go with me.

199
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,460
I will go with you.

200
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,460
If so,

201
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,460
I will go with you.

202
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,460
Wait a minute.

203
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,460
Your Highness,

204
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,460
Your Highness,

205
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
is this for Xue'er?

206
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,460
Yes, it's for Miss Liu.

207
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,460
I will send it to her.

208
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,460
Your Highness,

209
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,460
I'm really bored

210
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,460
in bed.

211
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,460
Can you come with me every day?

212
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,460
I have always

213
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,460
been by your side.

214
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
This plum is so sweet and sour.

215
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,460
Sweet and sour.

216
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,460
We are

217
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,460
a boy.

218
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,460
Then,

219
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,460
you have to come

220
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,460
and feed me every day.

221
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Talk to our son.

222
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,460
Of course.

223
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,460
Who is it?

224
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,460
Who is the eunuch's servant?

225
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,460
Uncle Jiu,

226
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,460
how did you...

227
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,460
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
I'm sorry.

229
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,460
The End
