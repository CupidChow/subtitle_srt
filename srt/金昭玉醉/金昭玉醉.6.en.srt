1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,420
can go back in time.

2
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,440
Coming Soon

3
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,420
I didn't do it for nothing.

4
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,420
Who's there?

5
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,420
Who's there?

6
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,420
Who?

7
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,420
Who's there?

8
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,420
Who's there?

9
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,420
I didn't do anything.

10
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,420
I really didn't do it.

11
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,420
No!

12
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
No!

13
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,420
The game has started.

14
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,420
You all have to be smarter.

15
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,420
Too stupid.

16
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,420
But if you want to die,

17
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,420
don't be scared.

18
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,420
Your Highness!

19
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,420
Your Highness!

20
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,420
Your Highness!

21
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,420
Your Highness!

22
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,420
Lu Zhao!

23
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,420
Lu Zhao has turned into a devil!

24
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,420
He came to kill us!

25
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,420
Your Highness!

26
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,420
You have to believe me!

27
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,420
I'm not lying to you!

28
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,420
He will kill all of us!

29
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,420
We will all die!

30
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
Xue Er!

31
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,420
Your Highness!

32
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,420
Please save me, Your Highness!

33
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,420
Let's go!

34
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,420
We don't want to lose our property!

35
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,420
Let's go now!

36
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,420
Let's go now!

37
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,420
You Yuequan!

38
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,420
Calm down.

39
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,420
Calm down.

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,420
No matter if he's real or fake,

41
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,420
now is the best time

42
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,420
for us to take away Lu's property.

43
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,420
Lu's family in Jiangnan is a rich and powerful country.

44
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,420
That's a few hundred million taels of silver.

45
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,420
Once the big thing is done,

46
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,420
you won't be a beast

47
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,420
for all the grievances you've suffered.

48
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,420
I promise you.

49
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,420
I promise.

50
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,420
But I'm not playing the devil this time.

51
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,420
Your Highness, you have to believe me.

52
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,420
Lu Zhao has turned into a different person

53
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,420
since he woke up.

54
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,420
He's good at martial arts.

55
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,420
He even killed Du Juan.

56
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,420
He's a weak woman.

57
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,420
He's not that good at killing people.

58
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,420
He must be a scumbag.

59
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,420
Your Highness,

60
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,420
you have to be careful.

61
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,420
He's good at martial arts?

62
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,420
If that's the case,

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,420
when we go to Liu's mansion tomorrow,

64
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,420
I'll find the assassin

65
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,420
and kill him.

66
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,420
No, no, no.

67
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,420
I'm done.

68
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Boss,

69
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,420
do you have any idea about the master?

70
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,420
That Princess of Chu, Lu Zhao,

71
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,420
happened to die when I started to talk about martial arts.

72
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,420
Then Li Qi Fan came back to life.

73
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,420
My sister gave him jade pendant before she died.

74
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,420
She promised me to help him.

75
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
They had an agreement before.

76
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,420
The most important thing is

77
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
he still has...

78
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,420
Still has?

79
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,420
He still has a sword.

80
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,420
He still has a sword?

81
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,420
He still has?

82
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,420
Where?

83
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,420
Look at his body.

84
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,420
Anyway, I'm sure

85
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,420
Lu Zhao is my sister.

86
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,420
When will we meet the master?

87
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,420
He doesn't remember anything now.

88
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,420
Tell him

89
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,420
that he can still remember the ghost god

90
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,420
with his talent.

91
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,420
Besides, in order to save him,

92
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,420
you have to pay...

93
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,420
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,420
Li Cu,

95
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
I'm not as selfless as you think.

96
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,420
Everything I did

97
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,420
was just for myself.

98
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,420
He doesn't remember it.

99
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,420
Isn't it better?

100
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,420
From now on,

101
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
we're no longer sisters.

102
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,420
Are you crazy?

103
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,420
I'm not crazy.

104
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,420
From now on,

105
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
we're no longer brothers.

106
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,420
He won't have any reason

107
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,420
to save me.

108
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,420
Why can't the one who loves me

109
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,420
help me?

110
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,420
I'm not you.

111
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,420
Let me be the last time.

112
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
The last time.

113
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Zhao.

114
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,420
This...

115
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
This is...

116
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,420
Zhao,

117
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,420
don't you really remember?

118
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,420
The two elders saw

119
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
that after the accident,

120
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,420
they were all in the same room.

121
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
They were all in the same room.

122
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,420
They were all in the same room.

123
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
They were all in the same room.

124
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,420
They were all in the same room.

125
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
After the accident,

126
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
except my husband,

127
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
no one

128
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
remembers me.

129
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,420
Wu An,

130
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,420
this time,

131
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,420
I'm taking you home to see

132
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
some familiar dishes.

133
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,420
Maybe

134
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,420
you'll remember something.

135
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
This is your father.

136
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,420
This is your aunt.

137
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
And your cousin,

138
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
Liu Yingxun.

139
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,420
So it's my father

140
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,420
and aunt.

141
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
Yes.

142
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
The two elders

143
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,420
were so close.

144
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,420
I thought

145
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,420
they were related.

146
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,420
But

147
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,420
my surname is Lu

148
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
and my father's surname is Liu.

149
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Why is that?

150
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
Zhao,

151
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
here's the thing.

152
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
Your mother's surname is Lu.

153
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Your father

154
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,420
was a prisoner in the Lu family.

155
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,420
That's reasonable.

156
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,420
So your father was a prisoner.

157
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,420
Okay, okay.

158
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Your Highness,

159
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,420
let's order the dishes.

160
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,420
It's cold.

161
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
The dishes are getting cold.

162
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Yes, yes, yes.

163
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
Hurry, sit, sit, sit.

164
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Hurry, serve the dishes.

165
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
Hurry, slow down.

166
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
What are these?

167
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
The good fish and the good fish are good for the body.

168
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
It's a good season to eat.

169
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,420
Zhao, when you were at home,

170
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,420
you loved the good fish

171
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
cooked by the cook at home.

172
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,420
Father-in-law is right.

173
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,420
This is the fried rice with sesame oil.

174
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,420
This is the fried rice with scallion and leek.

175
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,420
This is the fried rice with linseed oil.

176
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
And this is the fried rice with the fish.

177
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,420
This is the fried rice with the fish.

178
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,420
This is the fried rice with the fish.

179
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
And this is the fish soup.

180
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
It's all made in Jiangnan.

181
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
I think Zhao will like it.

182
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,420
Yes, Sister Tang.

183
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,420
This fish is rare.

184
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,420
You should eat more.

185
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
Come.

186
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,420
Lu Zhao's birth mother jumped into the river and committed suicide.

187
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
When the body was caught,

188
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,420
it was in poor condition and full of fish.

189
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Since then,

190
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Lu Zhao will be sick and sick

191
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,420
when he sees the good fish.

192
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,420
This is impossible.

193
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,420
It's easy to do.

194
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
Zhao,

195
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,420
don't you like the good fish the most?

196
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
I don't remember.

197
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,420
I'm worried about you.

198
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,420
Come.

199
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,420
Try it while it's hot.

200
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,420
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
It's really delicious.

202
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
Come.

203
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,420
How dare you leave your home?

204
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,420
How dare you leave your home?

205
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,420
I will kill you today.

206
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,420
Be careful, Father.

207
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Zhao,

208
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
why did you run away from me?

209
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,420
As long as you are safe and sound,

210
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,420
I will be with you.

211
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
Zhao,

212
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,420
I will be with you.

213
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
I will be with you.

214
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,420
I will be with you.

215
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,420
I will be with you.

216
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,420
I will be with you.

217
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,420
I will be with you.

218
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,420
Zhao,

219
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,420
don't ask for anything.

220
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,420
Zhao.

221
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
Zhao.

222
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,420
Zhao.

223
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Put on the clothes.

224
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Put on the clothes.

225
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,420
Hurry.

226
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,420
Your Highness.

227
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,420
Your Highness.

228
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
Xue.

229
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,420
Xue.

230
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
Zhao.

231
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,420
Zhao.

232
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,420
Listen to me carefully.

233
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
It's not the time.

234
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,420
Your life is more important.

235
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,420
Lie down.

236
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,420
Let me see how you are.

237
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,420
Father,

238
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,420
my father told me

239
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,420
that my grandfather was the first Lu family in Jiangnan.

240
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,420
And I am the only heir of the Lu family.

241
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,420
If anything happens,

242
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,420
I don't want to see all the property of the Lu family

243
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,420
be handed over to other families.

244
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Your Highness,

245
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,420
what do you mean by this lie?

246
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,420
Your Highness,

247
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,420
I have written a letter

248
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
to the elders of Jiangnan.

249
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,420
I want to transfer all the property of the Lu family to the royal family.

250
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
And I want to be managed by you.

251
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,420
But

252
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
the elders of Jiangnan

253
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,420
want me to confirm it myself.

254
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,420
So I can believe it.

255
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,420
By then,

256
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,420
you will

257
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
Zhao.

258
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,420
this letter.

259
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,420
Zhao.

260
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
Your Highness,

261
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
this is the maid of the mansion.

262
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,420
Hurry up and give the pulse to the princess.

263
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,420
There are many people here.

264
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,420
Please leave.

265
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
I will try my best to help the princess.

266
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,420
You try your best to help the princess.

267
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,420
When she recovers,

268
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
you will be promoted to the head of the mansion.

269
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,420
If anything happens to the princess,

270
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
I will have you buried with her.

271
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,420
Yes, Your Highness.

272
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
I am looking for the secret agent.

273
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
Greetings, Miss Lu.

274
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,420
Are you hurt?

275
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,420
No, I am not.

276
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,420
It's just a pack of blood.

277
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,420
Don't you believe

278
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,420
your master's words?

279
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
You trust me so much?

280
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
When you lost your memory,

281
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,420
Situ Xian has already asked you to come to the banquet.

282
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,420
He invited an assassin to test you.

283
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,420
Do you remember that you can't expose me?

284
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
He wants to test me?

285
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,420
Why don't I try my best

286
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,420
to make him not believe me?

287
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,420
I need an agent.

288
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,420
The maidservant of Liu Mansion

289
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
are my secret agents.

290
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,420
They can help you.

291
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,420
That's great.

292
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,420
As expected,

293
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
you are a good person

294
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,420
to enter Xuntian Gate.

295
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,420
Don't worry.

296
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,420
I will protect you no matter what.

297
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,420
I will protect you.

298
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,420
It's okay, Xue.

299
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,420
What's the use of crying?

300
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
Mother,

301
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,420
there is really something wrong with her.

302
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,420
You must believe me.

303
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
It's just a small trick to disguise as a lost person.

304
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,420
You go back first.

305
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,420
Tomorrow,

306
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
I will find a way

307
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,420
to expose this bitch.

308
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,420
Your Highness.

309
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
How is the Princess?

310
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
I just sent someone to ask.

311
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,420
She didn't get hurt.

312
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,420
It's just a skin wound.

313
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
She can recover tomorrow morning.

314
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
She can fight for me.

315
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,420
I think

316
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,420
she is not a fake.

317
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
She is not a fake.

318
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,420
She is not a fake.

319
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
She is not a fake.

320
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
She is not a fake.

321
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
She is not a fake.

322
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
She is not a fake.

323
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,420
I heard from that maid

324
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,420
that the assassin's sword was a little bit too sharp

325
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
and it hurt her heart.

326
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Hurry up and bring this letter to Jiangnan.

327
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
Bring the leader of the Lu clan to India.

328
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
During this time,

329
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
Lu Zhao

330
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,420
must not have any trouble.

331
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,420
Yes.

332
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,420
Does she really not remember anything?

333
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,420
Didn't you say you would take me to see the prince?

334
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,420
Why did you bring me here?

335
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,420
The prince is here.

336
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
You can go ahead.

337
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
Aunt,

338
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
what are you doing?

339
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,420
Zhao'er, come and take a look.

340
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,420
Who is this?

341
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
Pull her up.

342
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,420
Aunt?

343
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,420
This old woman is not clean.

344
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
She stole the property of the mansion.

345
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,420
Naturally, she will suffer some pain.

346
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,420
Aunt,

347
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
this is the Chu's mansion.

348
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,420
I'm afraid it's not appropriate

349
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,420
for you to kill a servant like this, aunt.

350
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
The princess is thinking of me.

351
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
She wants to save her life.

352
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,420
If the princess recognizes it,

353
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,420
then for the sake of the princess,

354
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
I will spare her life.

355
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
If the princess doesn't recognize it,

356
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
then she will die immediately

357
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
and be taken to the prison.

358
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,420
You can fool the prince,

359
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
but you can't fool me.

360
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,420
Today,

361
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
I will kill you.

362
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,420
You dare to test me?

363
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
I will kill you.

364
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,420
I will kill you.

365
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,420
Your Majesty,

366
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,420
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,420
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,420
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,420
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,420
I'm sorry.

378
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
I'm sorry.

381
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,420
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,420
