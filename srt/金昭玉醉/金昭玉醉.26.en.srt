12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,620
I will see how I can change my fate and be a tough girl.

13
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,100
Your Majesty, bad news!

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,780
Prince Huai has rebelled and is now in the Five Gates.

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,780
He is coming for me!

16
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,260
Brother.

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,780
You don't need to pretend to be a politician now, do you?

18
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,380
After all, you should be the leader of this place today.

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,460
Ninth Brother.

20
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,940
You still made it this far after all.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,100
If Xun Tianmen hadn't been the one to ruin my plan,

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,780
I would have been in trouble earlier.

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,500
You are my youngest brother.

24
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,580
I have always treated you differently than others.

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,820
I thought that the one who finally met me

26
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,580
was not you and me.

27
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,940
Is there any need to be so reckless now?

28
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,700
Yuan.

29
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,980
Have you ever thought that

30
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,740
the way you are now

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,660
is because I want to see you...

32
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,460
Shut up!

33
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,060
You don't deserve to mention me.

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,420
It's all because of you.

35
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,980
Because your cowardice killed me.

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,500
It's also because of you

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,660
that you pushed me here step by step.

38
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,100
Now the situation is settled.

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,740
The whole city is under my control.

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,220
You are just my prisoner.

41
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,500
How can you still stand here and blame me?

42
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,260
I am asking you.

43
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,820
You have been promoted to the position of the late emperor.

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,900
I am the emperor in terms of status.

45
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,100
I am the eldest brother in terms of people and blood.

46
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,580
Why can't I be your brother?

47
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,580
Whether you are my brother or not,

48
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,820
you are not worthy.

49
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,900
Do you really think you can win?

50
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,700
Are you still not aware of the situation?

51
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,340
Now Xuntian Gate is also a game of loose kill.

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,500
You are useless.

53
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,420
Really?

54
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,980
Be careful!

55
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,220
Jinli!

56
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,300
Jinli!

57
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,140
I am late.

58
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,580
Please forgive me.

59
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,900
You are all deceiving me.

60
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,420
Situ Xingyuan has always controlled the heart of the people.

61
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,500
But she underestimated the true heart.

62
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,980
I can't understand Zhao.

63
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,700
Even so, what can you do?

64
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,700
Now the whole palace is under my control.

65
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,940
None of you can escape.

66
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,820
I want you all to be buried with Miaohe.

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,020
Do you still not understand?

68
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,500
The map I gave you looks like it's fine.

69
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,500
But it's actually dark inside.

70
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,580
When you brought all the dead people into the palace,

71
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,500
the imperial guards in the palace were already surrounded.

72
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,420
Situ Xingyuan,

73
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,420
don't think about it.

74
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,380
This is a dead end.

75
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,980
Dead end?

76
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,740
If I can't get out of the palace in an hour,

77
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,500
someone will have to take over the whole of Yindu.

78
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,460
Xiao Ren,

79
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,500
do you dare to bet on the lives of the people?

80
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,620
The 50,000 soldiers you hid have been surrounded.

81
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,180
Now you are the only one left.

82
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,940
You are done for.

83
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,140
Situ Xingyuan,

84
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,620
surrender.

85
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,380
You want me to surrender to her?

86
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,180
In your dreams?

87
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,020
Even if I die here today,

88
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,060
I will drag her to hell

89
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,860
and kowtow to Miaohe.

90
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,020
This is your last chance.

91
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,340
Situ Xingyuan,

92
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,540
you have no way out.

93
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,140
How ridiculous.

94
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,980
What kind of identity are you?

95
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,940
To live in the palace?

96
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,060
Your Lordship,

97
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,940
you deserve to die in the palace.

98
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Hmm.

99
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,100
How can I not know who he is?

100
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,620
Back then, the old master Xiao

101
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,540
was the one who was adopted by my secret edict.

102
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,300
Yuan,

103
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,420
Songlou is not a traitor.

104
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,540
He is a meritorious official of Nanqing.

105
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,940
How do you think Yongzhou and Wucheng will be taken over?

106
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,420
The whole Song family will die.

107
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,500
Songlou is a traitor.

108
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,860
He is a traitor.

109
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
He is a traitor.

110
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,300
No.

111
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,180
This is not true.

112
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,380
Why should I not say it?

113
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,980
The Song family is in a state of chaos.

114
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,700
How can I do this

115
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,700
when there are thousands of people in Wuzuo?

116
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,340
You are the one who will be taken over

117
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,660
and you will leave the palace.

118
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,260
You will live in a different place.

119
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,140
I have been to the Pilan Palace several times.

120
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,460
I wanted to reveal the truth to you.

121
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,460
But you turned me away

122
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,860
and never came back to me.

123
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,180
You said

124
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,740
it was for the peace of the temple

125
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,700
and for the peace of Nanqing.

126
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,340
But look what you have done.

127
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,980
You colluded with the people

128
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,100
and harmed the loyal officials.

129
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,820
You have done this.

130
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,740
What's wrong?

131
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,180
What do you want from the other countries?

132
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,580
Yuan,

133
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,300
do you know

134
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:39,060
why Miao He died?

135
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,580
What do you mean?

136
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,340
Why do you ask?

137
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,380
Father witnessed a sister.

138
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,340
My brother had hate words for the wrongs.

139
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,380
Now he beat all his genuinely 이ng Path of Tenิ village.

140
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,580
and send his body back to Yingdu.

141
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,700
Only with this secret letter

142
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,060
can we

143
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,940
conquer the border of Wu City.

144
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,500
Impossible.

145
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,060
Absolutely impossible.

146
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,340
Look at it yourself.

147
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,940
Miao He.

148
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,980
It's Miao He's handwriting.

149
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,740
Brother,

150
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,180
don't be sad for Miao He's death.

151
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,980
As the princess of South Qing Dynasty,

152
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,740
I've been raised by the people since I was a child.

153
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,660
I can sacrifice for the country.

154
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,780
I have no regrets in my life.

155
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,660
I will make great achievements.

156
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,740
Miao He must not enter the imperial mausoleum.

157
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,620
The land of South Qing Dynasty

158
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,620
is my place of rest.

159
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,020
I have only one wish.

160
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,220
If Brother Jiu doesn't make it to the imperial mausoleum,

161
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
I hope you can give him a chance

162
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,580
to change his mind

163
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,460
for the sake of my love.

164
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,460
So that

165
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,180
I can rest in peace

166
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,220
in the nine realms.

167
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,220
You loved me so much.

168
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,700
You wanted to see me for the last time.

169
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,020
How could I ignore your feelings at that time?

170
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,660
But Miao He had already opened the letter of marriage.

171
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,820
In front of the general,

172
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,060
how did you teach me to open the coffin?

173
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,700
Come on.

174
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,740
Offered.

175
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,820
So dejected.

176
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,860
In your dream,

177
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,740
you can't understand

178
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:44,740
I promise you that I will not kill you today.

179
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,740
From now on, you will stay in this Pilan Palace forever.

180
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,740
You will not be allowed to leave the palace alive.

181
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
I am a dog.

182
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,740
Why don't you die?

183
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,740
Huan Yuan!

184
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,740
I will never leave you.

185
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,740
I am not him.

186
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
If this ends,

187
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Huan Ren! Huan Ren!

188
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
Huan Ren, what's wrong?

189
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
Huan Ren!

190
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,740
Huan Ren, what's wrong?

191
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
How is it?

192
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Master is seriously ill.

193
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
This time, he lost too much blood.

194
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,740
Whether he can wake up or not,

195
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,740
we will have to wait and see.

196
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
I know.

197
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Master is very lucky.

198
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,740
I believe he will wake up.

199
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
Yes, maybe he will wake up tomorrow.

200
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,740
The imperial city will still be in a state of rest.

201
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,740
Xun Tian Men must not be taken in by anyone.

202
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,740
Ling Su, from now on, Xun Tian Men will be counting on you.

203
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Ling Su will not be able to live up to his mission.

204
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,740
Go back.

205
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Go.

206
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,740
Go.

207
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,740
Go.

208
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Ren,

209
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,740
is the red one better or the white one?

210
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,740
The white one is better.

211
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,740
The dog is much longer than the last one.

212
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,740
It's good.

213
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,740
Put this on for me.

214
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
I will count to three.

215
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
You have to get up.

216
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
One,

217
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,740
two.

218
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
One, two, three.

219
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,740
I, Xiao Jiu, have been living a life of misery.

220
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,740
I will not accept your sacrifice.

221
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,740
May the heavens bless you.

222
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,740
May Xiao Ren wake up soon.
