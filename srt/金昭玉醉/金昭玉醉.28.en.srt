00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Then I'll take this one.

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I won.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I lost again.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I lost again.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I lost because she is my wife.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I lost because she is my wife.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why do you have to help her?

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why?

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Why?

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why?

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why?

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Can't you see?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Spirit tree.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You...

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You little...

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Spirit tree.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Look.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's put this one.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's make a wish together.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then I wish that all wishes will come true.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
May the future be long.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
May the future be long.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
May the future be long.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
May the future be long.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What's your name?

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My name is Xiao Ren.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Xiao Jin Yu's wife.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,680
The hatred in my heart will never go away

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,200
The rain of fire and rain

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,680
The flowers are still in full bloom

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,440
If you have any place you want to go,

63
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,920
or things you want to do,

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
just do it boldly.

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,600
Xiao Ren,

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,800
if it weren't for you,

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,000
I wouldn't have thought

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
when I would be able to return to this sunny place.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
A Zhao,

70
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll take you home.

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Xiao Ren!

72
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,800
The rain of fire and rain

73
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,600
The flowers are still in full bloom

74
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
The love between us is clear

75
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
From now on,

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,400
there will be no more conflicts between us.

77
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,200
Snow is falling

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,800
You are in my dreams

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,200
You light up my thoughts

80
00:04:50,800 --> 00:05:05,960
LyricsKS

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
We will reunite one day.

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I will return to the moon.

83
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,800
I will wait for you in the wind and clouds.

84
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
By the way,

85
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Shaoyao said that your body has fully recovered.

86
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Thanks to a virtuous lady who takes care of me every day.

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Then please ask my husband to take care of your body.

88
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Don't make your wife worry.

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Of course.

90
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,800
But since you have taken care of my body,

91
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
please give me a chance to repay you.

92
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
What are you doing?

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
What are you doing?

94
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Let me down.

95
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Your body has just recovered.

96
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Then you should be happy in time.

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Let me down.

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Shaoyao, please.

99
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Please stop.

100
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
I want to sleep a little longer.

101
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Stop sleeping.

102
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Get up.

103
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Master, something bad happened.

104
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Go.

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Go.

106
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Go.

107
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Master.

108
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Master.

109
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
The secret letter was sent this morning.

110
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I dare not delay the delivery of the body.

111
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I will send it to you immediately.

112
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
What happened?

113
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
What happened?

114
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
The wall has changed.

115
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Father left the file house to cover us.

116
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
He is alone in the forest.

117
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:32,940
The waste was

118
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,240
I have made up my mind to live and die.

119
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,200
Please allow me to do so.

120
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
In the 29th year of Shuntai,

121
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,400
the king of Huai, Situ Xingyuan, was captured by Fan Xue.

122
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
The chief of Xuntian, Xiao Ren,

123
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,880
was injured and died in the army.

124
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,880
His wife, Lu Zhao, was in great pain.

125
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
It was a great funeral.

126
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,080
Let's end it here.

127
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,640
I have a secret mission to do.

128
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,000
I can't walk around in my real identity anymore.

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I will entrust Xuntian to you in the future.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I will keep the token for you.

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I will wait for you to come back.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know when we can meet again.

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
When we save him,

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
he will come back.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Take care.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't worry.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I will protect him.

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will take you to a place.

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Young master,

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Madam is waiting for you in the main hall.

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Go there.

143
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I will go back to work.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Uncle,

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
don't tell my mother that I am out to play.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Otherwise, she will beat me.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Go.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I have a gift for Madam.

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
She just found out the game.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
She can eat this.

151
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ren.

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Your uncle wants to drink with you today.

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Shunniang,

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
go and buy your favorite fish and wine.

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Wait for me.

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I won.

157
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You are strong.

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Do you dare to be the best player in the next year?

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why not?

160
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I will win.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I will win the whole Song family.

162
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Ren.

163
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You are back.

164
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Come here.

165
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What's wrong?

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Nothing.

167
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I remember that Situ Xian destroyed this place.

168
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
During your sleep,

169
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I asked someone to repair this house.

170
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But General Song hasn't come back yet.

171
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I am afraid that he will be suspected.

172
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I dare not to make a big deal of it.

173
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
When we bring my father back,

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
the Song family will be innocent for the rest of their lives.

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Thank you.

176
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Let's go.

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let's go.

178
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's go home now.

179
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't worry.

180
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I and Ah Zhao will definitely bring my father back.

181
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
dislocation

182
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Are you ready?

183
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Of course!

184
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,880
Start air-foрод later.

185
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,140
She's filling up on rational stuff

186
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Where are we going?

187
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,060
Let me see

188
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,320
The atmosphere is really一點

189
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
1, 2, 3, go!

190
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
1, 2, 3, go!

191
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Push!

192
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,440
Situ Xinyuan, do you dare?

193
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,080
I'm not going to leave until I finish.

194
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,560
This is my grandson.

195
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,720
I'm going to hug him.

196
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,920
I'm going to light up the fire in my eyes.

197
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm going to pull up the table.

198
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,480
How do I do this?

199
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,920
Come on.

200
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,360
Come on, Yu.

201
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,840
We're going to have a child.

202
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
You're going to have a good time.

203
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,160
Say it.

204
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
You're going to sleep tight.

205
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,160
I'm going to sleep tight.

206
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
I'm going to train my chin.

207
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,240
I'm going to sleep tight.

208
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,440
He's coming.

209
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,000
Come on, Yu.

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,560
I'm going to sleep.

211
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
Be quiet.

212
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,560
Don't move.

213
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Yu.

214
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,520
Don't be angry.

215
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,720
You're going to be angry.

216
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,360
I'm going to stand here.

217
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
You have to have a point.

218
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,760
I'm going to stand here.

219
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,640
You have to have a point.

220
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,520
You have to make this place a little messy.

221
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,600
No, no, no.

222
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,000
Brother, what are you going to do?

223
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Sit down.

224
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm going to sit here.

225
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
Sit down.

226
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Boss.

227
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Boss.

228
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,680
You...

229
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
Okay, come on.

230
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,440
Okay.

231
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Hurry up.

232
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
You two, one by one.

233
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,720
Be careful.

234
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Don't scratch your legs.

235
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Scratch your legs.

236
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,720
If you want to eat meat, you have to eat blood.

237
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,480
I'll feed you.

238
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Come on, eat.

239
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,720
You're too much.

240
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,080
Help the people to survive.

241
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,480
Help the people to live in peace.

242
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,680
Why don't you have eyes?

243
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,480
You can't run away.

244
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,680
I've already found two guests.

245
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
Okay.

246
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,080
Okay, okay.

247
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Come on, come on.

248
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,680
Okay, okay.

249
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,080
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,680
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
Okay.

253
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
Come on.

254
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
Give it to the guest.

255
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Thank you.

256
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,680
Let's go.

257
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,880
Be careful.

258
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Be careful.

259
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
Go.

260
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
Okay.

261
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,280
This is it.

262
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
This is it.

263
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Come on.

264
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Let's finish this first.

265
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Let's go.

266
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
Here you are.

267
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Here you are.

268
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
I'm sorry.

269
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
This is it.

270
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
It's okay now.

272
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
Let's do it again.

273
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Come on.

274
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Stop it.

275
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
Get out.

276
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
I'll kill you sooner or later.

277
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Stop.

278
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Stop.

279
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
Go away.

280
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Okay, I'm sorry.

281
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
Stop.

282
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Let's go.

285
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
I'm so smart.

286
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
I only have one night.

287
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
What are you doing?

288
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
You can lie to the girl.

289
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
You can't lie to me.

290
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
My master is fine.

291
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Yes.

292
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
You are the master of Xuntian Sect.

293
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
But you collude with the thief secretly.

294
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,680
You don't think you can let the child

295
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
come out smoothly?

296
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
I'm so happy.

297
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
I'm off work.

298
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
See you in the morning.

299
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,680
See you in the morning.

300
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Wish you a happy and happy morning.

301
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Let's go to the temple.
