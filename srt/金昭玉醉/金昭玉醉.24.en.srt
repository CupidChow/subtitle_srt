1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,900
No no no no.

2
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,900
The TV version of the new movie is on air at the same time.

3
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,500
The audience is looking forward to seeing me change my life.

4
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,460
I'm very excited.

5
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,060
Why didn't you tell me today?

6
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,940
I can't bear to leave you.

7
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,900
The wind rises, thousands of wishes fall.

8
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,900
The wealth,

9
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,900
The time,

10
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,900
Even life and death, I don't care.

11
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,900
The country is drifting away.

12
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,900
Where is the longing?

13
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,900
I want to marry you.

14
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,900
I want to be your bride.

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
The city is empty.

16
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,900
I want to be with you forever.

17
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,900
The lights are flickering.

18
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,900
The year is passing by.

19
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,900
The cold wind blows.

20
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,900
The sky is clear.

21
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,900
The dream is falling.

22
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,900
The dream is falling.

23
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,900
The lonely shadow is hard to find.

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
The end is in this life.

25
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,900
There is no regret in this life.

26
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,900
The end.

27
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,900
The wind rises, thousands of wishes fall.

28
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,900
The Song family is guilty.

29
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,900
I have sinned against the Xiao family.

30
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,900
I have sinned against Nan Qing.

31
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,900
I have sinned against you.

32
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,900
The thousands of wishes fall.

33
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,900
You took my head to see His Majesty.

34
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
The wind rises, thousands of wishes fall.

35
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
He didn't just try to rob the Xiao family.

36
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,900
The wind rises, thousands of wishes fall.

37
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:28,900
I only want to drink with you after I die.

38
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,900
The lonely shadow is hard to find.

39
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,900
The wind rises, thousands of wishes fall.

40
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,900
The wind rises, thousands of wishes fall.

41
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,900
The end is in this life.

42
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,900
The cold wind blows.

43
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,900
The sky is clear.

44
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
The dream is falling.

45
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,900
The dream is falling.

46
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,900
The lonely shadow is hard to find.

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
The end is in this life.

48
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,900
There is no regret in this life.

49
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,900
Father, what should I do?

50
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
Why should I swear to the ancestors

51
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
to protect his life?

52
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,900
He doesn't deserve it.

53
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,900
You are the eldest daughter of the Xiao family.

54
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
You are the future leader of Xuntian Sect.

55
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
How can you be so narrow-minded

56
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,900
and judge people by their blood?

57
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,900
I have been raised by my father.

58
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,900
Since I was young, I grew up in the Xiao family.

59
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,900
I ate the Xiao family's food.

60
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
I was raised by the Xiao family's ancestors.

61
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
I believed in the Xiao family's family.

62
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,900
What does this have to do with whose bloodline?

63
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
Why are you still here?

64
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,900
Do you want me to kill you?

65
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,900
If my death can calm the hatred between the two families,

66
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
I will die without regret.

67
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
I won't kill you.

68
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,900
You are not the one who chose to kill me.

69
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,900
You are not the one who chose to bear the hatred.

70
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,900
The hatred from the previous generation has nothing to do with you.

71
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
Father, I am sorry.

72
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
I am sorry.

73
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
I am sorry.

74
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,900
I am sorry.

75
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
I am sorry.

76
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,900
I am sorry.

77
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
A'Chou.

78
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
Song Luo killed the leader of the family

79
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
and betrayed the country.

80
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,900
He is the enemy of the Xiao family.

81
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,900
One day,

82
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
I will personally kill him

83
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
to avenge him.

84
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,900
Until that day, you dare to stop me.

85
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
I will kill you.

86
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,900
I will not stop you from avenging.

87
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
Don't worry.

88
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,900
I will not let the Xiao family down.

89
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,900
I will go to the palace to meet the king

90
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
and tell the emperor about this.

91
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
He will decide.

92
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Have you thought it through?

93
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,900
I am willing to forgive you, but the emperor is not.

94
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,900
You may not regret it.

95
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,900
A'Chou.

96
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,900
I carried the blood of this body.

97
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,900
I have to take the responsibility.

98
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,900
It is a pity that tomorrow is our wedding.

99
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,900
I ruined everything.

100
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
How do you know that tomorrow is our wedding?

101
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
If you go,

102
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,900
you will cause the suspicion of Situ Xin Yuan.

103
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Stay and the wedding will be held.

104
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,900
A'Chou.

105
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,900
I am a traitor.

106
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,900
The Song family's crime has been involved for a long time.

107
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,900
Have you decided to marry me?

108
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,900
I have made up my mind.

109
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,900
I will not blame you.

110
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,900
Tomorrow,

111
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,900
we will worship the church together

112
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,900
and drink the wine together.

113
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
We will drink together.

114
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,900
After we get married,

115
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
I will use my wife's life

116
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,900
to go to the palace to meet you.

117
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
If His Majesty insists on killing you,

118
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
I will accompany you to the Imperial Palace.

119
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
We will be husband and wife.

120
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,900
We will live and die together.

121
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,780
접 rally

122
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:54,080
若剑锋将宿命刻成言论 The sword will cut his life into a

123
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,520
爱却是中尽骨头的诅咒 I'm the curse that is cast upon me

124
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:01,660
胜了感血落在街角的掌纹 The blood is on the shoulder, the sword is broken

125
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,600
这叫什么事? What's going on?

126
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,540
这新婚之夜洞房花烛他俩不在 They're not here on the wedding night,

127
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,540
让咱俩在这儿守着 they made us wait here.

128
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,540
Shhh, shut up.

129
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,140
Be careful of the walls.

130
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,380
Don't worry, I won't.

131
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,340
Uncle Jiu can't even think of it.

132
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,380
They're just getting married.

133
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,540
They have to come to the palace.

134
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,380
It's a dangerous trip.

135
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,660
The master will only trust you and me.

136
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,420
Don't be so careless.

137
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,340
Why are you so far away from me?

138
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,900
Be careful of the flaws.

139
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,900
Okay.

140
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,260
Okay.

141
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,300
What are you looking at?

142
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,140
Come closer.

143
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,540
We're a newlywed couple.

144
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,700
Oh, thanks.

145
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,300
No, thanks.

146
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,180
Some other techniques are nice.

147
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,860
Folks,

148
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,460
just knock,

149
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,220
no business.

150
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:39,100
Yuan ведь

151
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:27,540
Howって

152
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,420
war

153
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,540
Get up.

154
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,540
Your Majesty.

155
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,540
Now that things have come to this,

156
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,540
I should tell you something.

157
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,540
I...

158
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,540
I knew your real identity from the very beginning.

159
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,540
I...

160
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
Speaking of this,

161
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,540
I should start from that war.

162
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,540
Back then, the Situ County tribes were in need of military supplies.

163
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,540
The border was destroyed.

164
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,540
The southern border was destroyed 50 times.

165
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,540
Tens of thousands of people and soldiers were slaughtered.

166
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,540
That war was a tragic one.

167
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,540
But in the end,

168
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,540
General Xiao and his army were defeated.

169
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,540
It was a dead end.

170
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,540
General, hang in there!

171
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,540
Our map of the Lianfang has fallen into enemy hands.

172
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,540
We have to find a way to send the message back.

173
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,540
The gunmen are chasing the army.

174
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,540
I can't leave.

175
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,540
But I have one last way to live.

176
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Military counselor.

177
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Yes.

178
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,540
We have to protect the people of Wucheng.

179
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,540
There is only one way to return the gold.

180
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,540
Kill me, blow up the country, and take the people's land.

181
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
No.

182
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,540
General, I will die if I have to.

183
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,540
I can't die without seeing the people.

184
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Our family has been guarding the border for generations.

185
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,540
We have fought with the gunmen for generations.

186
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,540
If I surrender, they won't believe me.

187
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
