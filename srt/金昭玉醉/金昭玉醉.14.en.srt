1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm gonna change my destiny and be a tough guy.

2
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
Lin Su, come here.

3
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,580
What did you wrap me with?

4
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,580
Come here.

5
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,580
Tao, if you can't catch up with her,

6
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,580
you'll have to use your hard work.

7
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,580
Let me make your wound bigger.

8
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,580
I don't believe she can't see it.

9
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,580
Are you crazy?

10
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,580
I just didn't feel the pain.

11
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,580
I'll die if I lose too much blood.

12
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,580
Don't worry, I'm very serious.

13
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,580
And I told Miss Lu that you're about to die.

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
Just look at her.

15
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Wait, when did you tell her?

16
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,160
Just now.

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,160
I think it's almost there.

18
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,160
Are you crazy?

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Tao, you can't die.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
Tao.

21
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Tao.

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Does it hurt?

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
It hurts.

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Tao, you have to hold on.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Tao.

26
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Didn't you say you didn't have any classmate?

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,160
I have something important to do at Xuntian Gate.

28
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
I have to feed the dogs.

29
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Wait.

30
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Get up.

31
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,740
You can't hold on.

32
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,740
I didn't mean to.

33
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,740
I just wanted you to look at me.

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,320
If you really can't stand it,

35
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,320
then you can stab me.

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
But after you stab me,

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,320
it's over.

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
Don't ignore me.

39
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
You lied.

40
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,320
You're going to die.

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
You're really generous.

42
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,320
If you really die,

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,320
I have no regrets.

45
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Even if you don't have a classmate,

46
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
you have to protect yourself.

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
If you lose too much blood,

48
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
you don't know how you'll die.

49
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,900
How can you protect me forever?

50
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,900
Actually,

51
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
it's all about Lin...

52
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
What did you say?

53
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
I said,

54
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,480
I like you.

55
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
I'm willing to

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,480
give you my heart.

57
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
What's wrong?

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
I've thought about it.

59
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,480
I said...

60
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,060
I said I'd deal with Situ first.

61
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,060
Then I'd buy you a big house.

62
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,060
Then I'd fill it with flowers.

63
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,060
Then I'd confess to you.

64
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
I'm not ready to do this.

65
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,060
Turn around and let me see you.

66
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,060
Look at me.

67
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,060
I know.

68
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,060
I know what you're doing.

69
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,060
I can see it in your eyes.

70
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Thank you.

71
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,060
Let's be together.

72
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,060
Okay?

73
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,060
Zhao,

74
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,060
from now on,

75
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,060
I won't let you lose.

76
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,060
Okay.

77
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,060
Okay.

78
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Okay.

79
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Don't push me.

80
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,640
Don't push me.

81
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Zhao,

82
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
let's deal with Situ first.

83
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
Let's get married.

84
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Okay?

85
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Hurry up.

86
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
What are you doing?

87
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
You can't fool us.

88
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
It's nothing.

89
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
It was nothing before.

90
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
But now it's really dangerous.

91
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Oh no.

92
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
I'm the one who's in danger.

93
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
You're so bad at dancing.

94
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Again?

95
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
Well,

96
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
how's Situ Xian?

97
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
She's too depressed.

98
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,220
She's been out of the mansion for half a day since she got the Lu family's property.

99
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,220
Those robbers are not only in the teahouse,

100
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
but also in the tea house.

101
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,220
Don't worry.

102
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,220
The fox will find out.

103
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,220
She will find her out.

104
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,220
She will.

105
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Prince.

106
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Tell me.

107
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
I've found out

108
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
that I work for Xio Tianmen.

109
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,660
Your guards who patrolling Lu Zhao

110
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
at Pilan Hall

111
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,660
are all dead.

112
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,660
There're the truth,

113
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,660
Xiao Ren.

114
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
Xiao Ren,

115
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
Xio Tianmen,

116
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,660
You killed Xiao Yuan.

117
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
And you killed him also

118
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
You'll see.

119
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
Your highness.

120
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,660
Speak.

121
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,660
Miss Liu doesn't want to take her medicine.

122
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,660
She wants you to accompany her.

123
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Do you know that we are discussing business?

124
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Tell her not to let her be fooled.

125
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Get out.

126
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,660
Yes.

127
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,660
Go.

128
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,660
Keep watching Lu Zhao and Xuntian Gate.

129
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
I'll go check on her.

130
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
Come at any time.

131
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Yes.

132
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Eh?

133
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,660
I didn't expect you to know how to put flowers.

134
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,660
So what?

135
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,660
A woman can put on makeup, but a man can't put on flowers?

136
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,660
I like doing these things.

137
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,660
This is the first time I've heard you say what you like.

138
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,660
From now on, you'll be in charge of the flowers in this mansion.

139
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,660
Yes.

140
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,660
After leaving the Chu's mansion, I feel the world is so vast.

141
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,660
The world is so big.

142
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,660
Why should a woman stay in a small house?

143
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
You'll stay there forever.

144
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
You're right.

145
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,660
I believe that one day, everyone in the world can live their own lives.

146
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
Do you want some sweet and sour pork?

147
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,660
Sir, two pieces of sweet and sour pork.

148
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,660
Coming.

149
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
I'll do it.

150
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Sir, this is the most popular Ruyi Zan.

151
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
It's very popular.

152
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Buy one for Madam.

153
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
I'm not a sweet and sour...

154
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
You're right.

155
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
My wife should live a happy life.

156
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,660
Let's go.

157
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,660
You love Madam so much.

158
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660
It's a rare chance to see you together.

159
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,660
Only by having a smooth nose can you feel the world.

160
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,660
The night is deep.

161
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
The love is hard to separate.

162
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,660
The snow is hard to separate.

163
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
The boss is watching.

164
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
You two are so in love.

165
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
You're a perfect match.

166
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,660
Well said.

167
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
You have a reward.

168
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,660
Thank you, sir.

169
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,660
Thank you, madam.

170
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Where else do you want to go?

171
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,660
I'll accompany you.

172
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,660
I want to eat the Xizi soup bowl in Chengdu.

173
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,660
Xizi soup bowl?

174
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
The one with the bald head?

175
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,660
Wait for me here. I'll be right back.

176
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Where's my Xiang Si Zi?

177
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,660
No!

178
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,660
Miss, is this your bracelet?

179
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
Thank you.

180
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,660
Miss, what's wrong with you?

181
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,660
I'm fine.

182
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,660
She looks so strange.

183
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660
Miss!

184
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Miss!

185
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Poison?

186
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
Miss.

187
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,660
Why did you commit suicide?

188
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
My husband sold me to the bank.

189
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
Now I've escaped.

190
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Where else can I go?

191
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
I'm not a virgin anymore.

192
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660
I have no right to live.

193
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
If they catch me,

194
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
I'll die.

195
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,660
Please.

196
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
Let me go.

197
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,660
Why would a woman take the blame for her husband's crime?

198
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
You're never to blame.

199
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Where do you live?

200
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,660
I'll send you.

201
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
I'll see who dares to touch you.

202
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
Men can't be hurt by blood.

203
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,660
I don't know.

204
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
No one should see it for themselves.

205
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,660
Come with me.

206
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
You're back?

207
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,660
Who's making money for me?

208
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,660
I don't think you want to live.

209
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,660
Where did you come from?

210
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
It's none of your business.

211
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
Don't come over.

212
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,660
I'm not your husband.

213
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,660
Husband?

214
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,660
I'll kill you.

215
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,660
The red and green ripples are following the dust.

216
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,660
The night is light and the city is dark.

217
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,660
I hold your eyes and the old days are sad.

218
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,660
I have a question.

219
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,660
Can you not recognize me?

220
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,660
The snow is falling and the people are falling.

221
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,660
I hear the soul of despair.

222
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:43,660
The spring is empty and the old days are gone.

223
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,660
Who is the one standing outside the door?

224
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,660
The eyes are full of hatred.

225
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:57,660
The red and green ripples are following the dust.

226
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:04,660
I'll see you before the dawn.

227
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:11,660
The wind is blowing and the people are falling.

228
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,660
Love is a curse.

229
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:25,660
The song of sorrow is the song of despair.

230
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:32,660
The city is light and the people are not clear.

231
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:39,660
The red and green ripples are following the dust.

232
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
I have a question.

233
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Can you not recognize me?

234
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:53,660
The snow is falling and the old days are gone.

235
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,660
I'll see you before the dawn.

236
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:04,660
The wind is blowing and the people are falling.
