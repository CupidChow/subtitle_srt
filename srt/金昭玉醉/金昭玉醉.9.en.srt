Only us.

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,100
What about you?

18
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,100
But after this, the red lock will appear on the arms of the two people.

19
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,100
It's hard to eliminate.

20
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,100
You have to think clearly.

21
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,100
This old skin is really too much.

22
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,100
I'm afraid I can't do it.

23
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,100
I'm afraid I can't do it.

24
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,100
I have to go to the north grass.

25
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
I have to go to the north grass.

26
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,100
I have to go to the north grass.

27
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
The north grass can be removed,

28
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,100
but there is a way to get through the north grass.

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
In order to continue to have a life, it is not worth it.

30
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,100
I'll send you back to Xuntian Gate now.

31
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
I want his life.

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,100
I have to pay the price.

33
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,100
Go.

34
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Come.

35
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,100
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
I'm here.

37
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
Hurry.

38
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,100
I'm sorry.

40
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
It's okay.

41
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
It's okay.

42
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,100
It's okay.

43
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
It's okay.

44
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,100
It's okay.

45
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
It's okay.

46
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
It's okay.

47
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,100
It's okay.

48
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
It's okay.

49
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
It's okay.

50
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
It's okay.

51
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
It's okay.

52
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
It's okay.

53
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
It's okay.

54
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
It's okay.

55
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
It's okay.

56
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,100
It's okay.

57
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
It's okay.

58
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
It's okay.

59
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
It's okay.

60
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
It's okay.

61
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
It's okay.

62
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,100
It's okay.

63
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,100
It's okay.

64
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,100
It's okay.

65
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
It's okay.

66
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
It's okay.

67
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
It's okay.

68
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
It's okay.

69
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,100
It's okay.

70
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,100
It's okay.

71
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
It's okay.

72
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
It's okay.

73
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
It's okay.

74
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
It's okay.

75
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
It's okay.

76
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
It's okay.

77
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,100
It's okay.

78
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
It's okay.

79
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,100
It's okay.

80
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,100
It's okay.

81
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
It's okay.

82
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
It's okay.

83
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,100
It's okay.

84
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,100
It's okay.

85
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
It's okay.

86
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
It's okay.

87
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
It's okay.

88
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
I like having cleansed up

89
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:40,100
I like having cleansed up

90
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:48,100
I like having cleansed up

91
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:54,100
I like having cleansed up

92
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:07,740
So

93
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,440
His northern shot breaks.

94
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,040
I didn't say anything.

95
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,240
Does it hurt?

96
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,140
It does.

97
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,640
But I can still take it.

98
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,440
I didn't mean to.

99
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,740
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,740
You're worried about me?

101
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
Your voice is so familiar.

102
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
You don't have to worry about me.

103
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,740
I can get through this.

104
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,740
How could I possibly watch you hurt yourself?

105
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
I'm sorry.

106
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
It's okay.

107
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
It's over.

108
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
Why is your face so red?

109
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Is it because of the poison?

110
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I didn't.

111
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
I didn't.

112
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,740
I didn't make a mistake.

113
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,740
I'll go get some herbs for you.

114
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Don't go out. There are wolves outside.

115
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
Put your clothes on.

116
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,740
I'll go get some herbs.

117
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,740
There's a secret message on your jade pendant?

118
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,740
Every time this jade pendant touches my blood, it creates a secret message.

119
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,740
I don't know the meaning behind this secret message.

120
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,740
When I was little, my sister thought this jade pendant was fun.

121
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
She gave it to my father as a gift.

122
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,740
She said that my father would take it from me if I didn't give it to him.

123
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
But he got beaten up by my father.

124
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,740
I guess your sister doesn't like you either.

125
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Not really.

126
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,740
Sometimes, I feel like my sister hates me.

127
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,740
My father has always been a man and a woman.

128
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Since he was little, he had been eating good things.

129
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,740
He would give me toys and food.

130
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,740
He would tell me that he was happy to have a son like me.

131
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,740
He wanted me to be a son of Xuntianmen.

132
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,740
But I know that my sister is smarter, more talented and more hardworking than me.

133
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,740
But no matter how hardworking she is, my father is still the same.

134
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,740
As time goes by, she starts to hate me.

135
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:29,740
So sometimes I wonder if it's because of me that she took away what belonged to her.

136
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:43,740
Until one day, in the cave, my sister risked her life to save me.

137
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,740
I am not interested in fame or power.

138
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,740
I just want to grow old with my sister and father.

139
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,740
But the day is not the same.

140
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
My father is gone.

141
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,740
My sister is gone too.

142
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,740
In the end, I have nothing.

143
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
Hmm?

144
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
Hmm?

145
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,740
My lord, he should be that way.

146
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,740
Ah Zhao!

147
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
Ah Zhao!

148
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
My lord!

149
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
My lord!

150
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,740
Ah Zhao.

151
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,740
Why are your hands so cold?

152
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,740
You are still wet.

153
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,740
Come.

154
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,740
Rou, why did you save yourself?

155
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,740
What did you say, father?

156
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Yesterday, when I met the mountain queen, I was alone.

157
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,740
I... I wouldn't have fallen off the cliff.

158
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,740
Yesterday, I was so innocent that I fell off the cliff.

159
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Luckily, I was in the water.

160
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,740
That's how I escaped.

161
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,740
There is no trace of another person here.

162
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Who saved her?

163
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
This Rou Zhao...

164
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,740
Father, what are you looking for?

165
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,740
Wait, the seal.

166
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,740
Father, what are you doing?

167
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,740
This is impossible. This is impossible.

168
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,740
This is impossible!

169
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
Wait!

170
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,740
My lord, the princess is in good health.

171
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,740
She is fine except for a few wounds from the fall.

172
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
I'm glad she is fine.

173
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
I'll go make the medicine for her.

174
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
Go.

175
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
My lord, you can rest assured.

176
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
How could it be?

177
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,740
The poison in the spring dragon's body is fierce.

178
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,740
If others detoxify it in time,

179
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,740
it's impossible for her to be safe.

180
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740
My lord.

181
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,740
My lord, the palace is urgent.

182
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
I'll be back soon.

183
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,740
What happened?

184
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
Who is the person behind you?

185
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Okay, father.

186
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,740
You have no choice but to go to heaven.

187
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
You have no way out.

188
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,740
You have to break in.

189
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,740
What do you mean?

190
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,740
I'm not going to die.

191
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,740
I'm going to die.

192
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
I'm going to die.

193
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
I'm going to die.

194
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,740
I stayed up all night in the yard last night.

195
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,740
I just wanted to make a big road for you.

196
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,740
So you can go back to the west as soon as possible.

197
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,740
And live with me in the underground.

198
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
The End

199
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,740
The End
