1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What happened to you?

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was just trying to help you.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I didn't mean to hurt you.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thanks.

34
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,140
Sickly...

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,140
sickly...

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It didn't take long,

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,140
Zarathus would already be dead.

38
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,140
The w esempio of mercy is that

39
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:18,520
Zarathus cannot亞

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,160
Liu Mingfu, as a court official,

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,200
colluded with the Yamen and attempted to kill the Princess Consort.

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,720
The evidence is clear and the power of heaven is hard to enter.

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,760
I now order Xuntian Gate to come and arrest the guilty subject, Liu Mingfu, for the case.

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,560
I hereby resign.

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,520
The Yamen and the Princess Consort

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,920
What are you doing?

47
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,320
What are you doing?

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,520
These bandits have always been here. What does it have to do with you?

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,320
Xiao Ren, you are just deliberately targeting.

50
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Tell me. Let Lord Liu explain.

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,920
Your Highness, I had no choice.

52
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,120
That day, someone beside Master sent a bottle of medicine powder and made me drink it.

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,520
But how could I drink it?

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,720
That person was watching me, so I had to drink it.

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,920
But I was so scared that I bled in the wind.

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,720
I've already sent someone to the Imperial Physician's Office to check.

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,720
This medicine can make people more conscious.

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,720
No wonder. I was already sleepy after taking the pear cream.

59
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Someone found us the other day.

60
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
They said that Hu Weiya had a deal.

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,500
The woman in the carriage was a woman who was very good at

62
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,720
making jokes.

63
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
They said that she had already been given medicine and wouldn't resist.

64
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
They told us to pretend to push her down the cliff.

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
They said that there was no trouble.

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,720
How can this prove that it was me?

67
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Where did this sachet come from?

68
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:26,360
That day, I saw that person wearing a

69
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,360
It's good that there's a way to get down the cliff.

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,360
The name Xi Zhong is not ordinary.

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,360
If I remember correctly, this should be Lord Liu's watch.

72
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,360
They are a group of bandits who stole my sachet and want to harm me.

73
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Father.

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Father.

75
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Lord Xiao, there must be some misunderstanding.

76
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Lord Liu is my biological father.

77
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,360
How could he harm his own daughter?

78
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Lord Xiao, you must investigate this matter thoroughly.

79
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,360
Give my father a clean break.

80
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,360
Princess Consort, you think he's your biological father?

81
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
He might not think that you're his biological daughter.

82
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
But please don't worry, Princess Consort.

83
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
I will definitely go back and interrogate him.

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Whether there is a person behind the story of the Liu Ming Manor,

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I will go through them all and report to His Majesty.

86
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,360
It's you. That person is you.

87
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Take him away.

88
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Father.

89
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Let go of my father.

90
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Father.

91
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
Father.

92
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Father.

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,360
It's still the high place of the Chu Manor.

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Other places are almost as good as this.

95
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
It's almost there.

96
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Princess Consort, it's almost there.

97
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Your Highness.

98
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Hanzhao.

99
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
I don't believe that father would do such a thing.

100
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Your Highness, you must save father.

101
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
You must save father.

102
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Princess Consort, don't worry.

103
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,360
I will definitely investigate the truth

104
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,360
and give father a clear answer.

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Lu Zhao, what kind of medicine are you buying?

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Father.

107
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Are you doing well here?

108
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,360
You are really my good daughter.

109
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Don't you want to know who is the person behind me?

110
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,360
I don't think I guessed it right.

111
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
This devil will get his retribution.

112
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,360
Since you are a devil, what are you afraid of?

113
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,360
I am really a devil.

114
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,360
I am really a fake corpse.

115
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,360
I know that my mother's death wasn't a suicide.

116
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,360
It was you and Fang Yuanrou who forced her to die.

117
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,360
When I killed Fang Yuanrou, I knew you would take revenge.

118
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,360
I killed her to get you to come out alive.

119
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,360
According to the law of the South Qing Dynasty,

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,360
the bandits who colluded with me are mostly against me.

121
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,360
You put so much effort into this.

122
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
What is your intention?

123
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Do you know that Situ Xian has so many enemies?

124
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Do you want to guess?

125
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,360
You are now in the hands of Xuntian Gate.

126
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
He will let you live in peace.

127
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Prince Wu likes Xue'er.

128
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
He likes you.

129
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Prince Wu likes Xue'er. He will definitely come to save me.

130
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Do you want his life to be in vain?

131
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
He was born in such a dirty place.

132
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,360
His dream of being a princess will never come true.

133
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,360
If hell doesn't give birth to you, I will be your hell.

134
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Bitch! Bitch!

135
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,360
You are as evil as your mother.

136
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
You forced me to be a prisoner and ruined my life.

137
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,360
You are a bastard. You should be killed.

138
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
You have no good intentions.

139
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,360
It's all your family's fault.

140
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,360
You are a bastard.

141
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,360
You are a bastard.

142
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Bitch!

143
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
You are dead?

144
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Yes.

145
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
You are dead.

146
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Your Highness,

147
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,360
after Miss Liu learned that Lord Liu committed suicide in prison,

148
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
she was killed by a man.

149
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
She was killed by a man.

150
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Your Highness,

151
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,360
after Miss Liu learned that Lord Liu committed suicide in prison,

152
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
she was in a bad mood and passed out.

153
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,360
You can send her back to rest.

154
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
But...

155
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
What happened?

156
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,360
I found out about Miss Liu's pulse just now.

157
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,360
She is pregnant.

158
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,360
You go and comfort her. I will be right there.

159
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Yes.

160
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Don't come near me. Get lost!

161
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
I want to see His Highness.

162
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Miss Liu, you are pregnant. Don't be rash.

163
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I said I want to see His Highness.

164
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Xue'er!

165
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Xue'er, put down the knife.

166
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
We have something to discuss.

167
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Okay?

168
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Your Highness!

169
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,360
You still don't believe me?

170
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,360
My father and mother

171
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,360
were killed by Lu Zhao one by one.

172
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
I will be the next one.

173
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
I believe you.

174
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Lu's clan leader will be here soon.

175
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
You have to endure it for a few more days.

176
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,360
I can't. I can't.

177
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,360
I have been holding it in for too long.

178
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
I want her to die.

179
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
I want her to die now.

180
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,360
I want her to die for my parents.

181
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
I want her to die.

182
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Xue'er!

183
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Do you know

184
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,360
I have been living with my father for so many years.

185
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Is it just for me?

186
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Think about our child.

187
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Don't you want her to be the Crown Prince?

188
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
Child?

189
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Child?

190
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
I don't have a child.

191
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,360
I don't have a child.

192
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Crown Prince.

193
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Xue'er.

194
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
My father!

195
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
My father!

196
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,360
When Lu's clan leader returns to the capital,

197
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Lu Zhao will be dead.

198
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
You are here so soon.

199
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
You are here so soon.

200
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
How can I be late?

201
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,360
To be honest,

202
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Lu's clan leader will be here soon.

203
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
At that time,

204
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,360
I will give all Lu's assets to Situ Xian.

205
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
What?

206
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,360
You can't bear to lose her?

207
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
I want her to die.

208
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
I have to make her crazy first.

209
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
After she gets the assets,

210
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
she will do something

211
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,360
to catch her own people.

212
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,360
But the first step after she gets the assets

213
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
is to kill you.

214
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,360
So I need a proper reason

215
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
to leave the mansion.

216
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,360
I heard that Liuming Mansion is in the prison.

217
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
And the one who forced her to die

218
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
is her daughter.

219
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,360
So I have committed a big crime.

220
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Now, the Ninth Uncle is in charge of the royal family.

221
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
He is responsible for the etiquette and discipline of the family.

222
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
If someone has the heart of a teacher,

223
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
he has the right to return.

224
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
You have committed a big crime.

225
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
You must go to the Pilan Palace

226
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
and listen to his instructions.

227
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,360
If Situ Xian doesn't dare to do anything to the Pilan Palace,

228
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
otherwise, the Ninth Uncle will find out.

229
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Besides, I have to do something

230
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,360
to make her leave.

231
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Did you hear that?

232
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,360
The Princess forced her father to kill herself in the prison.

233
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
This is all over the news.

234
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
If such a big crime doesn't happen,

235
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
the Prince can't protect her.

236
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
I heard that she is going to be sent to the Pilan Palace to receive the news.

237
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Pilan Palace?

238
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
What's the difference between that and the prison?

239
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,360
That is the place where the Ninth Uncle Situ Xian is.

240
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Isn't it?

241
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
The Princess has suffered a lot.

242
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Ah Zhao,

243
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,360
there are many rumors in the capital.

244
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,360
The Empress ordered you to go to the Pilan Palace to receive the news.

245
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Don't worry.

246
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
I will go to the palace to plead for you.

247
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
After this matter is settled,

248
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,360
I will personally take you home.

249
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,360
But the Pilan Palace is where the Ninth Uncle is.

250
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
He is a strict person.

251
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
He doesn't allow me to be with him.

252
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
I have arranged a bodyguard for you.

253
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
He can help you.

254
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

255
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Keep an eye on him.

256
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
If there is anything, report to me.

257
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Don't worry, Your Highness.

258
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Your Highness.

259
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
Your Highness.

260
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Your Highness.

261
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
Your Highness.
