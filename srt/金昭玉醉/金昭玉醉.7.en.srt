1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:56,400
Right!

2
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,400
The show is broadcasted on the same day on Yun Shi Ting TV.

3
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Watch the show and watch the show today.

4
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Help Jing get revenge with me.

5
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,400
You can fool the prince, but you can't fool me.

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Today, if you don't admit your false memories,

7
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
and you don't get the right to be here,

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
I will kill this bitch.

9
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
You dare to test me?

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
You dare to do this?

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
How could I not dare?

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I was just going to play this game with you guys.

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
I have changed my mind.

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Mother,

15
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Mother,

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
go to hell.

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Mother!

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Jiao... Jiao is dead.

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Grandma, how are you going to explain this to them?

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Don't be afraid, I know how to deal with this.

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I'll take you away.

24
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Princess,

25
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
you are killing people in the palace.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
How are you going to deal with this?

27
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I know how to deal with this.

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I know you know how to deal with this.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
If we work together and don't admit our mistakes,

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
we will achieve our goal.

31
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Isn't that better?

32
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Xuntianmen?

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
The Prince of Chu has a death sentence.

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Xuntianmen will use this opportunity to investigate the Prince's mansion.

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
This is what you call a strong team.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Don't worry.

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
I will protect you.

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
I won't let you lose.

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I'll go with you.

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
I'll go with you.

41
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
I'll go with you.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Prince, come with me.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Xun'er, this is the Prince's mansion.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Be careful.

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Prince, come with me.

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Come with me.

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Mengjie!

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Mengjie!

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Aunt?

50
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
What happened to you?

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Your aunt died in the garden half an hour ago.

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
What happened?

53
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Aunt?

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
You bitch!

55
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
How dare you say that!

56
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
How dare you say that!

57
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Enough!

58
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Tang Mei,

59
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
your mother is dead.

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Why are you beating me?

61
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
My mother told me

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
that she wanted to see you in person.

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
But now she's dead.

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Xuntian!

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Xuntian killed my mother!

66
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
It's not you!

67
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Tang Mei!

68
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I can understand your pain of losing your loved one.

69
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
I'm also very sad that your aunt died.

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
But my aunt is my family.

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
She wanted to see me in person.

72
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Why did she want to see me in person?

73
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
You...

74
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Enough.

75
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Ah-Zhuang, I've made up my mind.

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Everyone in the mansion

77
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
has a witness.

78
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Only you.

79
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Prince,

80
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
you're suspecting me?

81
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I have no reason to harm my aunt.

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
And I'm a lady.

83
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,400
How can I do this, Prince?

84
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Prince.

85
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
I won't suspect you.

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
But,

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
half an hour ago,

88
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
where were you?

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Who can prove it?

90
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Prince, I...

91
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Prince, Xuntian's master, Xiao Ren,

92
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
broke into the mansion.

93
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
What did you say?

94
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,280
The

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,280
The

96
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,280
The

97
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,280
The

98
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,280
The

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,280
The

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,280
The

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,280
The

102
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,280
The

103
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,280
The

104
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,280
The

105
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,280
The

106
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,280
The

107
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,280
The

108
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,160
The

109
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,160
The

110
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
The

111
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,160
The

112
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,160
The

113
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,160
The

114
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,160
The

115
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,160
The

116
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,160
The

117
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,160
The

118
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:57,280
But this is my family.

119
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,280
The royal family is the state.

120
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:19,280
The murder has not been solved.

121
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
The crisis in the royal family has not been resolved.

122
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Everyone here is not allowed to leave.

123
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
Lock up the royal family.

124
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Search every inch of it.

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Do it!

126
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
I dare you!

127
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Supervising the royal family.

128
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
First, the royal family is to be executed.

129
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
The royal family is to be executed.

130
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,280
What's wrong with my duty?

131
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,280
But why are you so afraid of me?

132
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Are you afraid that I will find out something that I can't see?

133
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,280
We have found out that the murderer is him!

134
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,280
He was the only one I met before my mother's death.

135
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
It must be him!

136
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
I didn't! I didn't!

137
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
I didn't!

138
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Oh?

139
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,280
You are a suspect?

140
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
If that's the case,

141
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
then why don't you let me take him back

142
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
and interrogate him?

143
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Xiao Zhen!

144
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
She is my princess!

145
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
How dare you touch her?

146
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
She is your princess?

147
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
You are being impudent.

148
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
I just saw this lady

149
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
dressed up like a princess.

150
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
I am the princess.

151
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
I am asking you,

152
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
who are you?

153
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
I am the princess's cousin.

154
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
You only know how to stop the princess from doing her work.

155
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Li Su, take her away.

156
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
I don't want to go!

157
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
I want to save the princess!

158
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Report!

159
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
The guard of the house that Mrs. Fang is with

160
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
has been found.

161
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Bring him here!

162
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
The guard of the house that Mrs. Fang is with

163
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
has been found.

164
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Bring him here!

165
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
You bitch!

166
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,280
I will make you pay for my mother's death!

167
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
I won't say anything!

168
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,280
Your mother was killed by the water of the river.

169
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
How dare you slander the princess?

170
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Your Highness!

171
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
A servant just came.

172
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Mrs. Fang died of drinking too much water.

173
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
She is just a commoner.

174
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Xiao Man Zhu

175
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
is going to seal my Chu's mansion

176
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
and take my princess away.

177
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
If the princess of the house

178
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
is exposed,

179
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
aren't you afraid of being punished?

180
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Your Highness is right.

181
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Since this is their family matter,

182
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
we Xuntianmen can't be too careful.

183
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
But, Your Highness,

184
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
if you do too much evil,

185
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
you will be punished.

186
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
I will take my leave.

187
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
Oh, right.

188
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Please don't be anxious.

189
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
I'm not anxious either.

190
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
Let's play slowly.

191
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Are you laughing?

192
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Thank you for protecting me.

193
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
In fact,

194
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
I can go with them

195
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
to Xuntianmen.

196
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
It's not as simple as you think.

197
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Jin Ling, take the princess back to her room.

198
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Your Highness.

199
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Go!

200
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Please, Your Highness.

201
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Why?

202
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Why did you do this to me?

203
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Why did you do this to me?

204
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
He is my mother!

205
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
He is my mother!

206
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Didn't I tell you

207
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
not to cause trouble again?

208
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I didn't take your mother

209
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
and put her in a difficult situation.

210
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
But I also brought

211
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
a dog.

212
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
What is Fang Yuanrou?

213
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Lu Zhao killed her?

214
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Ridiculous!

215
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
The guards and the neck she was carrying

216
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
were all killed

217
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
under the knife of Xuntianmen.

218
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Do you know that?

219
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Xun'er.

220
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Xuntianmen kept

221
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
asking me to keep an eye on them.

222
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
They killed your mother

223
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
just to search my Chu's mansion

224
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
with a knife.

225
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
If they succeed,

226
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
I, you

227
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
and more than 400 people

228
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
in Chu's mansion

229
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
will all be killed

230
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
with your stupid mother

231
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
and your daughter.

232
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
You will be the last one to die.

233
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Your Highness.

234
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,280
I was wrong.

235
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
I will never do this again.

236
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
I was wrong, Your Highness.

237
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
I will be obedient from now on.

238
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,280
I was wrong, Your Highness.

239
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
From today on,

240
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,280
you cannot go anywhere

241
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
without my permission.

242
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Your Highness!

243
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Your Highness!

244
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Tao'er.

245
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
What are you doing

246
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
in this peacock-like clothes?

247
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,280
What are you hiding from?

248
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Let's get out of here.

249
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
You're here.

250
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

251
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
I've been watching Si Tu Xian.

252
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Did he believe you?

253
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,280
Yes.

254
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,420
It's to prove that they are lost in the water.

255
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,260
Thanks for today.

256
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,340
Thanks.

257
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,200
You're my ally. You're welcome.

258
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,820
What if I want to kill someone else in the future?

259
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,740
Then I will

260
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,940
give you a good knife.

261
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
This is...

262
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,460
This is the goose from the jade room.

263
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,720
I brought it here. You can try it.

264
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Is it good?

265
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,280
I will bring you more next time.

266
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,280
It's cold and hot.

267
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,280
The fresh goose will cool down soon after it's out of the oven.

268
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,280
No matter how good the food is, it will be a little bit bland.

269
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,280
From the palace to the Chu palace, it takes half an hour.

270
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,280
The goose is still hot.

271
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
How did you make it?

272
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
It's still hot.

273
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
How did you make it?

274
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,280
I think you took it here to warm it up.

275
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,280
It's still hot outside.

276
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
You are so considerate.

277
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Are you interested in me?

278
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
If I say yes,

279
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,280
what about you?

280
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
