00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,120

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,820
Please

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,180
Yes

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,500
Hi everyone, I am Zhou Junwei

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:02,500
今朝一醉必战TV版云视听小电视同步热播。看电视看今朝,和我一起助阿景复仇。

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
你别过来!

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
不是,不是,你帮我的恩人!

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,500
恩人?

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
看我怎么弄死你!

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
前任竟然杀父!

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
雪莲,不要怕。

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
善者不争,就会给恶者上路。

18
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
怕他,你就会被逼着自己自杀。

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,500
不怕,他就什么都不是。

20
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
你看。

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
反抗,没有那么困难。

22
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
雪莲,你想干什么?

23
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
难不成真想杀了我?

24
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
看我不弄死你!

25
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
你说得对,我就是要杀了你!

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
这七年来,你非得让我出去给你赚钱!

27
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,500
只要有不舍,就打我骂我!

28
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
还把我卖出去,令人凌辱!

29
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,500
你这种畜生,就该死!

30
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
她死了。

31
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
我...

32
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,500
我接手杀了她。

33
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
她死了。

34
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
我接手杀了她。

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
她死了。

36
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
她死了。

37
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
谢谢你带我回来解脱。

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
让我痛痛快快地报了仇。

39
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
谁敢逃回家?

40
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
走!

41
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
走!

42
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
她来杀我灭口。

43
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
走!我不想连累你!

44
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
别动,我去衣服。

45
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
别动!

46
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
出来!

47
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
说!

48
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
我不知道啊!

49
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
放肆!

50
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
谁给你们的胆量?

51
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
私设昌管,草菅人命。

52
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
找死!

53
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
找死!

54
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
说,你们的主子是谁?

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
这可不是一般的大手。

56
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
他牙里藏了毒是个死士。

57
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
你怎么还惹上死士了?

58
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
买簪子的时候,我发现我的相思子掉了。

59
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
想着你正好买它完,就去找找。

60
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,500
结果,路上遇到一个从昂场管逃出来的姑娘。

61
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
再结果,就是你看到这个样子。

62
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
这就是我的相思子。

63
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
这就是我的相思子。

64
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
这就是我的相思子。

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
这就是我的相思子。

66
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
这就是我的相思子。

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
您会生气吗?

68
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
您在等我吗?

69
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
以后,如果有这种事情,就告诉我。

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
趕快吃生日,

71
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
等会儿涼了。

72
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
我把这些尺寸收拾。

73
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
当时我被卖了一盒,

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
人牙子蒙住了我的眼。

75
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
当时我被卖了一盒,

76
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
人牙子蒙住了我的眼。

77
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
当时我被卖了一盒,

78
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
当时我被卖了一盒,

79
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
当时我被卖了一盒,

80
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
当时我被卖了一盒,

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
人牙子蒙住了我的眼,

82
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
带我坐了很久的马车,

83
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
还走了好长一段时间的蜜桃。

84
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
还走了好长一段时间的蜜桃。

85
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
等出了蜜桃,

86
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
我就发现自己在地下安昌馆里。

87
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
我就发现自己在地下安昌馆里。

88
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
我不堪淋浮。

89
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
趁看管的人不注意,

90
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
躲在藏尸体的车下面,

91
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
这才逃了出来。

92
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
那你可还记得,

93
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
那安昌馆的上面是什么?

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
不记得了。

95
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
不记得了。

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
我躲在车下面,

97
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
我根本不敢说话,

98
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
更不敢四处张望。

99
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
不过,

100
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
我倒是隐约透过缝隙,

101
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
我倒是隐约透过缝隙,

102
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
看到过好几排大红灯笼。

103
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
大红灯笼?

104
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
疾方馆?

105
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
枪人常去的茶楼?

106
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
这帮枪人,

107
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
果然是有问题。

108
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
我现在就派人过去,

109
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
围剿他。 不行!

110
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
我听里面的人说过,

111
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
办成管理到处都是炸药,

112
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
而且有很多机关,

113
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
一旦强攻, 机关就会自动启动,

114
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
马上就会站为平地。

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
你不会是想亲自前进去

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
把人救出来吧?

117
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
安然!

118
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
里面危险重重!

119
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
我对安常管说,

120
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
要去也是我去!

121
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
萧门主,

122
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
那你说怎么办呢?

123
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
我陪你呗!

124
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
楼主,

125
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
今日楼里逃了一个姑娘,

126
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
赶紧去追杀!

127
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
废物!

128
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
日后再发生这种事,

129
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
你便以死谢罪!

130
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
是。

131
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
马上安排一批新人,

132
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
务必让客人们进行。

133
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
是。

134
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
猴儿,人鸭子找到了,

135
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
黑使传来消息说,

136
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
他们今晚要再送一批新人进楼。

137
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
准备一些胭脂和女红。

138
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
走!

139
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
快点!

140
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
走!

141
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
快点!

142
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
走!

143
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
快走!

144
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
有美人?

145
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
大爷,我有的事情。

146
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
我要把这些美人全买了。

147
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
滚开!

148
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
别找死!

149
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
学相,赶紧让道!

150
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
走!

151
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
走!

152
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
走!

153
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
大爷,

154
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
我不想再上山了。

155
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
我要走。

156
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
马车快到了。

157
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
再检查一下眼罩。

158
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
一,二,三,四,五,六,七,八,九,十。

159
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
十。

160
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
十吗?

161
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
十。

162
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
我记得我抓的是十个人。

163
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
怎么成十二个了?

164
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
多两个人还能多两份钱。

165
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
走!

166
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
走!

167
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
快走!

168
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
快走!

169
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
快走!

170
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
快走!

171
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
快走!

172
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
快走!

173
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
快走!

174
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
走!

175
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
这里的路为何如此熟悉?

176
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
走!

177
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
快走!

178
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
There's a mirror.

179
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Could it be...

180
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
This is...

181
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Zhaoyue Tower?

182
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Hurry up.

183
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Hi.

184
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Later, when the guest comes,

185
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
you must treat me well.

186
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
If you're not satisfied with a little bit,

187
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
I'll peel your face.

188
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Do you understand?

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Yes.

190
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Beauty.

191
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Beauty.

192
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Stop hiding.

193
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Come out and play with me.

194
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Come out, beauty.

195
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Where are you?

196
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
If I catch you,

197
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
I'll punish you.

198
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Beauty.

199
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Where are you?

200
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Are you playing hide-and-seek with me?

201
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Don't let me catch you.

202
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Beauty.

203
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Don't think about it.

204
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
I can't remember you.

205
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
This is the person who hid in Yingdu.

206
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
It seems that he is the guest today.

207
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
You can't kill him again.

208
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Otherwise,

209
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
you can't kill anyone.

210
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Where are you?

211
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
You...

212
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I'm here to drag him out.

213
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Go find the gunpowder.

214
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
You...

215
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
What's wrong?

216
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Can't you?

217
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Okay.

218
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
But there is punishment.

219
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
I'm going.

220
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Come out, beauty.

221
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Guest?

222
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Are you looking for me?

223
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
You...

224
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
You smell bad.

225
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,500
You really smell bad this time.

226
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Beauty.

227
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Don't show me your face.

228
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Guest.

229
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Slow down.

230
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Okay.

231
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Don't run.

232
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
We all call Anchengguan's boss

233
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Mother.

234
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
As long as the new one is unwilling to accept guests,

235
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
he will throw it to the subordinates.

236
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
He will be tortured.

237
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
He likes drinking.

238
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
There is also a special bar.

239
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
The room is for guards.

240
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Why is it so slow?

241
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Mother is waiting.

242
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
It's useless.

243
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
It's useless.

244
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Mother asked me to send her a bottle of wine.

245
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Where is the wine?

246
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Go up.

247
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Yes.

248
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Mother.

249
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
I'm here to send you wine.

250
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Come in.

251
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Mother.

252
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Where is the fire demon?

253
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Who sent you here?

254
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
You don't deserve to know.

255
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Then no one will clean up for you.

256
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
If you dare to speak,

257
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I will stab you in the throat.

258
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Can you tell me now

259
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
where the fire demon is?

260
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Nonsense.

261
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Nonsense.

262
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
The fire demon is hidden behind this wall.

263
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
That main body is the mechanism.

264
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
The fire demon is hidden in the house.

265
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm not afraid of blowing myself up when I'm on fire.

266
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
I asked someone to design the secret room.

267
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
As long as it's not a strong country,

268
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
it will never go on fire.

269
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
How to destroy the mechanism that controls the fire demon?

270
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
The thing on the table is the explosive lock.

271
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Just pull it out.

272
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Who is your master?

273
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
I really don't know.

274
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Every time he comes, he wears a mask.

275
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I've never seen his real face.

276
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
You don't know?

277
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Then you're useless.

278
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
I'm not wrong.

279
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Oh my god.

280
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
No way.

281
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I'm not afraid of you.

282
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I'm not afraid of you.

283
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
I'm not afraid of you.

284
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm not afraid of you.

285
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
I'm not afraid of you.

286
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
I'm not afraid of you.

287
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I'm not afraid of you.

288
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I'm not afraid of you.

289
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I'm not afraid of you.

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm not afraid of you.

291
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm not afraid of you.

292
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
I'm not afraid of you.

293
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
I'm not afraid of you.

294
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
I'm not afraid of you.

295
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I'm not afraid of you.

296
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I'm not afraid of you.

297
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
I'm not afraid of you.

298
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I'm not afraid of you.

299
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I'm not afraid of you.

300
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm not afraid of you.

301
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I'm not afraid of you.

302
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm not afraid of you.

303
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
I'm not afraid of you.

304
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I'm not afraid of you.

305
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
I'm not afraid of you.

306
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
I'm not afraid of you.

307
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
I'm not afraid of you.

308
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm not afraid of you.

309
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I'm not afraid of you.
