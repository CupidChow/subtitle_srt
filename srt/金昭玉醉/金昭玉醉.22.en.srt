1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,380
I gave composing of news to you

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,460
Even if it takes a lifetime

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,520
Even if it takes a lifetime

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,640
All in...

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and change his fate.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are a member of the Song family.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You are the blood of the Song family.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Once His Majesty knows about this,

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
he will gather the entire Xiao family.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is a dead end.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This cooperation

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
is between you and me.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I will give you time to think.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You are a smart person.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You know how to make a choice.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You know the Song family and the Xiao family are blood enemies.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are afraid that when the God's world is exposed,

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Xiao Jing Yu will hate you.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He will take you back.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Then,

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
you will have to turn everything you want into nothing.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What is this?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You are so stubborn.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You are here.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Are you tired today?

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, right. Come.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Come and sit.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Look.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The embroidery shop just sent us some keys.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They want us to choose some wedding dresses. Look.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What do you think of this?

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This? This is your favorite style.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Look.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The wedding dress? What are you doing?

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How is this?

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's your style.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I knew you would like it.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will go find Xue Lian.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Remember to finish your wedding dress.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
According to Zhao,

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
what should I choose?

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a deal.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No one is allowed to see anyone else.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No one can see.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I will go.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Isn't this the bracelet I gave you?

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You gave it to me. It's here.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Only when we think about each other,

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
we can think of each other.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's make a wish.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's make a wish.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There's still something important to do at the Xuan Tian Gate. I have to go.

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's an important work. Go.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You followed me?

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I heard you were getting married.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I came to give you the wedding dress.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You even got the list of the spies I sent to the Xuan Tian Gate.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You are indeed Prince Jiu.

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I have more control over you than you think.

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sect Leader Xiao,

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
your wedding is coming up.

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I came to remind you of one thing.

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't forget the answer I want.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I dare not lie.

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:36,080
Prince, why don't we force Xiao Ren to hand over the

66
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
wedding dress to me?

67
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Besides,

68
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
he really looks like Miao He.

69
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
I hope Xiao Ren can do as I wish.

70
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,080
I also want to see how far they can go.

71
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Don't disappoint me.

72
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Is it possible?

73
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
It's not the same. It's not the same at all.

74
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
I'm the one who's a little smaller.

75
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
It's not like that.

76
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,080
You have to make it a knot first,

77
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
then pull it out.

78
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Isn't it only done tomorrow?

79
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Why is it so fast?

80
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Sect Leader Xiao and Miss Lu are our great benefactors.

81
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
They got married.

82
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
We are very happy.

83
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
We also finished the work.

84
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
It's really pretty.

85
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
This is...

86
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
This is the Golden Bee Crescent.

87
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
I wish you two a happy marriage.

88
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,080
Shaoyao, look at me like this.

89
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
Shaoyao.

90
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Shaoyao, what are you doing?

91
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
You're a coward. Don't run.

92
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
You're a coward.

93
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
Stop chasing me.

94
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
This mouse...

95
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,080
Do you want it?

96
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Here, try it on.

97
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Miss Lu, why don't you try it on?

98
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Let's go.

99
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,080
These are the things I couldn't hand over before I got into trouble.

100
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Remember to report to Xiao Ren.

101
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Just listen to his arrangement.

102
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,080
As for the defense map of the palace, I will hand it over to him personally.

103
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Yes.

104
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Oh, right.

105
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Recently, Qiangren suddenly stopped acting.

106
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Situ Xingyuan also kept on not being able to catch up.

107
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Did something happen?

108
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Xiao Ren has been losing his mind lately.

109
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Is it because of these things?

110
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
I'm worried about his safety.

111
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,080
This Qiangren without a sound is because we've been hitting him too hard.

112
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Situ Xingyuan...

113
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Catching him is just a matter of time.

114
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
As for the peach,

115
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,080
if you want to know, you can ask him yourself.

116
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
I'm not his sister anymore.

117
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,080
There are some things that are not convenient for a couple to talk about.

118
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,080
If he doesn't want to, I have to respect him.

119
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Sister?

120
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Couple?

121
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Yes.

122
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
I understand.

123
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Sect Leader, leave this matter to me.

124
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
Huh?

125
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Tao'er.

126
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I know what you're thinking.

127
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
What do you know?

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,080
I heard that a man's anxiety disorder appears before he gets married.

129
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,080
He's usually worried about the wedding room.

130
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,080
I've specially found some good things for you.

131
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Read them carefully.

132
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Okay, I understand.

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Be happy, Tao'er.

134
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
You've been asking for it for years.

135
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
It's normal to be suspicious.

136
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
But our Sect Leader is not an ordinary woman.

137
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Since he chose you, he won't let go of you for the rest of his life.

138
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
Okay, I understand.

139
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
I know.

140
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,080
I'm really your close friend.

141
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
You've been asking for it for years.

142
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
It's normal to be suspicious.

143
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,080
So I can't avoid it.

144
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,080
No matter what, I can't lose him again.

145
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,080
I...

146
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Ms. Xiao's ancestors didn't talk to us about this matter though.

147
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,080
I will leave the position tomorrow and be in private for my marriage.

148
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
But I hope you would consider my injury itself

149
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,080
I have былоin the family business since childhood.

150
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,080
I just followed my father.

151
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,540
A seasoning for a moment's happiness and happiness to come.

152
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,860
Noodles and wine and one's own brother's back garden.

153
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,020
Never forget the visit.

154
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,660
Even the flower and fire.

155
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,800
My lover who was left all alone.

156
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,520
A lovely place as well.

157
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,140
We may not live down to it until we die.

158
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,320
We can still have more r 노래es.

159
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
I'm not a good person.

160
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
I'm not a good person.

161
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
I'm not a good person.

162
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
I'm not a good person.

163
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm not a good person.

164
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
I'm not a good person.

165
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
I'm not a good person.

166
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm not a good person.

167
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
I'm not a good person.

168
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
I'm not a good person.

169
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
I'm not a good person.

170
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
I'm not a good person.

171
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
I'm not a good person.

172
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
I'm not a good person.

173
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Bow to the sky and earth.

174
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Bow to the gods.

175
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Bow to the gods.

176
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Bow to the gods.

177
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Bow to the gods.

178
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Wait!

179
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Who are you?

180
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
I'm not evil.

181
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
The owner sent us this.

182
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
He said he's here to help the bride.

183
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
He said he's here to help the bride.

184
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Who is the owner?

185
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
I don't know.

186
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
We just take money.

187

Will you blame me?

201
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320

202
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320

203
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
