1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
The

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:29,720
adaptability of some show

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
iamo

4
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,440
Block her

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,640
Don't stop it.

6
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,720
Don't stop me.

7
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,280
Are you mad at me?

8
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,000
If I...

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,800
I give you возaks.

10
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,360
If I'm so gentle with you,

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,400
you can't die like this.

12
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,000
If I have a future,

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,360
Prime Minister's death in the northern Yong禄

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,720
is like a broken bricks dish.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,040
why does this appeal to you?

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,380
After the Second

17
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:19,500
of remembered

18
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,680
Brother-in-law

19
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,680
I like to be with you.

20
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,080
You still think about that woman.

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,600
What?

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,160
Am I not enough to buy you a gift?

23
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,800
Princess.

24
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,240
Recently, the prince is busy with the construction of the Zhaoyue Tower.

25
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,760
He specifically ordered us to

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,280
ask someone to go to the Zhaoyue Tower and call him if you have something.

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,280
Why do you come here in person?

28
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,800
I want to give him a surprise.

29
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,480
Baoqing.

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,080
Wait for me here.

31
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,980
height

32
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,420
height

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,820
Lord.

34
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
Lord.

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,000
Princess.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why are you here?

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,200
Prince has been busy with work lately.

38
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,200
I brought some snacks for Prince to try.

39
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,400
I wonder if it suits Prince's appetite.

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,400
Princess Consort.

41
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
It's cold today.

42
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,400
Your eyes are not well.

43
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,000
From now on, you can leave this to your servants.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Prince has been to the Zhaoyue House for my birthday.

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm not doing anything serious.

46
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Thank you, Princess Consort.

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,400
Princess Consort, let me help you.

48
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Prince.

49
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
What's wrong, Prince?

50
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,200
It's nothing, Princess Consort.

51
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,400
I accidentally bumped into the table next to me.

52
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Prince.

53
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,000
These are snacks that I especially asked for.

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,200
They're from a famous snack shop in Jiangnan.

55
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,600
I got them from a guest.

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
Prince, try them.

57
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,400
Here.

58
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you, Princess Consort.

59
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
Princess Consort.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Did you burn yourself?

61
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
It's nothing.

62
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I was too blind to see the candles.

63
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,400
That's why I accidentally burnt myself.

64
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,200
Let me see if it's really that serious.

65
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Prince, it's nothing.

66
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
It's just a small wound.

67
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,400
Prince, it's nothing.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,200
Princess Consort, what's wrong?

69
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,000
Are you feeling unwell somewhere else?

70
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm not feeling unwell.

71
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,200
Prince.

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,400
Prince is going to be a father.

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's great, Princess Consort.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm going to be a father.

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
It's getting cold these days.

76
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,400
You're pregnant.

77
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,800
You need to take care of yourself.

78
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,200
Let's go. I'll take you back to the palace to rest.

79
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600
Prince.

80
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,800
What's that sound?

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
It's nothing.

82
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
It's just a thing that's been playing around with me all night.

83
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
It's nothing.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Let's go.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,800
Let's go.

86
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's go.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
Prince.

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,600
Prince.

89
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Prince.

90
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Prince.

91
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Prince.

92
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,800
Prince.

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Prince.

94
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Prince.

95
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Finished.

96
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,000
The weather is getting colder,

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,400
making it hard to stay up.

98
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,000
The number of villagers in Yingdu is getting higher.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,300
Only aim for Warehouse.

100
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,600
A townspeople wear a gun that prevents them from scaring you.

101
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
Look at you,

102
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
you're a mine Carrier.

103
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,720

104
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,640

School cape,

136
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,860
Guard the Imperial City storming all door scars

First

138
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,780
Submitted Ros retaliational authority

139
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,780
Looking for the Tianmen Xiao Yue

140
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,500
And calling Dian Yan Gong as bad guy cuts fuelling black bother me

141
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,480
Why did I cut myself?

142
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,480
Be careful what you eat,

143
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,160
watch your shoot.

144
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,740
Let's go.

145
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
You don't have one?

146
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,760
Our plan

147
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,000
iszzle specific information,

148
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,800
Ok

149
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,960
Thank you

150
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,040
Ok

151
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,640
This is our latest information

152
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,800
wipe it

153
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Liu Yingxue and Princess Chu

154
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,920
and destroyed the Chu's mansion.

155
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,760
Situ Xian is cunning and very aggressive.

156
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,280
It's hard for us to get close to him.

157
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,880
But I think

158
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,400
since we can't

159
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,840
send someone in from outside,

160
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,840
why don't we do it from inside

161
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,520
and use their house?

162
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,200
If someone connects with him by test Magic,

163
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,880
przyszal avoidance can be only a томography cost.

164
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,060
ShadowMar abruptly

165
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:56,280
slightly

166
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,120
ends tomorrow.

167
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,340
Tyrannässa

168
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,680
Burial

169
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,800
I'll make it by myself.

170
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,120
The child of the prince

171
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,320
is born by me alone.

172
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,520
You don't deserve it either.

173
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,360
I'm sorry.

174
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,240
I'm sorry.

175
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,160

I'm sorry.

185

I'm sorry.

186
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
I'm sorry.

187
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
I'm sorry.

188
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
I'm sorry.

189
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
I'm sorry.

190
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I'm sorry.

191
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
I'm sorry.

193
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
I'm sorry.

194
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I'm sorry.

195
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
I'm sorry.

196
