1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure if it's because you're interested in me.

2
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If I say yes, what about you?

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm not sure if it's because you're interested in me.

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I like women who are wise and brave.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Other than my sister,

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Miss Lu calls her the greatest sinner in the world.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I saw you hate Situ Xian so much in the hall today.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I saw you hate Situ Xian so much in the hall today.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why is that?

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Because he killed my sister.

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I want him to pay back his debt.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What kind of person is your sister?

13
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The wind is cold and the gold is silent.

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't sleep because I'm so tired.

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The wind is cold and the gold is silent.

16
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's so cold.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The shadow flies away with the wind.

18
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Where is the longing going?

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Sister, you hate me so much.

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why did you leave me?

21
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Shut up!

22
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My parents are all dead.

23
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're my last family in this world.

24
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I won't give up on you.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Never!

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Sister, I'm so weak.

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I can't get out of Wan Tu Mountain with you.

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You have my permission.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can't give up.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You can't die.

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm going to find the Golden Canggu to help you.

33
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you close your eyes now,

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll never forgive you.

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
A Yan!

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I found the Golden Canggu.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're saved.

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Help me.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The wind is cold and the gold is silent.

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I can't sleep because I'm so tired.

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Get out of my way!

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Get out of my way!

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm so tired.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Get out of my way!

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm so tired.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Do you believe me?

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll kill you!

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Get out!

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I want to kill A Yan.

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll never let you get away with this.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
A Yan!

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not afraid of you!

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I won't let you hurt A Yan!

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
A Yan!

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We've been through a lot together.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I've been thinking,

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
as long as I'm alive,

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
as long as I'm alive in this world,

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
he won't be alone.

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who would have thought

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
that he'd leave me so soon?

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I've brought you here.

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't want you to be sad.

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No need.

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
She can't compatable my feeling.

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
She mustoo help me to create the weapon of Situ Xian.

67
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Now she need men.

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You just do what I told you.

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In the future I must make our way.

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He wants my family's property.

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm so happy.

72
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If he doesn't want it,

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll find a way to make him want it.

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay.

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Do whatever you want.

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm here.

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You'll protect me, right?

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm here.

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't be envious. You have it too.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Get lost.

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm here.

82
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Shaoyao, come here.

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The roast goose your master brought is very delicious.

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's exactly my taste.

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Miss, only the roast goose is your taste.

86
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What about the person who brought the roast goose?

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Miss, do you like it?

88
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Your master is very capable and brave.

89
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He's a good partner.

90
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Who doesn't like him?

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Miss Lu, your master is very noble.

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's not only worthy of your cooperation,

93
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but also can entrust his life to you.

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't you feel touched at all?

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have nothing to do with the kind of person he is.

96
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I won't put my life on a man.

97
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We're just using each other.

98
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Boss, don't be sad.

99
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Although Miss Lu is using you,

100
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm very sincere to you.

101
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wait for me. Why are you walking so fast?

102
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Miss Lu, Lord Liu is here.

103
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He's waiting for you in the court.

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Father.

105
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Zhao'er.

106
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Father.

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Zhao'er.

108
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why are you here?

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I came to ask for a favor.

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What favor?

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's okay if you say it.

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Come on.

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay.

114
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Zhao'er, I'll just say it.

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Your aunt died of drowning.

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's not a good thing.

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You should send Chu Bin to her parents

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
so that she can rest in peace.

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But now,

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
her son is sick.

121
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Only you can send him to her.

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Is this appropriate?

123
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
After all, I'm already married.

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't worry.

125
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I've already told them

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
to do everything in their own way.

127
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll do everything.

128
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I understand.

129
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then I'll do everything for you.

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
With your aunt's help,

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sure she'll be happy

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
to see you off.

133
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Zhao'er, don't worry.

134
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll take good care of my daughter.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Princess Consort,

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
use this pear cream to make a toast.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Then the funeral will be complete.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Aunt, pear milk, pear drink.

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Eat pear cake and drink pear wine.

140
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Have a safe trip.

141
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Zhao'er, you have to finish this pear cake

142
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
before you can leave.

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't worry, Zhao'er.

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No matter what sacrifice you make,

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll do everything to protect you.

146
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll save the people of Lu Zhao's tomb

147
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and send them all to hell

148
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
to save your soul.

149
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Aunt, it's not easy to go to hell.

150
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't worry.

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll send someone to accompany you soon.

152
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The funeral is over.

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Go.

154
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There are bandits!

155
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm going to die.

156
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hurry up.

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hurry up.

158
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm Princess Consort.

159
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Who sent you?

160
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
How dare you do this to me?

161
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Princess Consort, I'm the emperor in this mountain.

162
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Look at you.

163
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If you kill me,

164
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll make you the queen.

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Go after her.

166
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Don't run.

167
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Go.

168
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Get up.

169
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
There are high-ranking people behind Lu Zhao.

170
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This way, I can find the person behind her.

171
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Keep an eye on the cliff.

172
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If anyone comes to save you,

173
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
you have to force them to jump off the cliff.

174
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Master,

175
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
there's a pool of water under the cliff.

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Even if you fall,

177
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
you can't die.

178
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What if they escape?

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
They can't escape.

180
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I've already put the most vicious poison

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
in Lu Zhao's pear tree.

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Once they jump off the cliff,

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
you go to report to the king of Chu

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and search the cliff.

185
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
When they are alone,

186
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
they will be alone in the wild.

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
When they are in the wild,

188
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
we can catch them in the wild.

189
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Master, you're brilliant.

190
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why don't you run?

191
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If you go one step further,

192
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
you'll be in trouble.

193
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Or you can be my wife.

194
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Go!

195
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
How dare you kill my brother?

196
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Don't jump! Why don't you jump?

197
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll let you die together!

198
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
No.

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Do you believe me?

200
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Jump.

201
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Jump.

202
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Shoot!

203
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Your Highness.

204
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Your Highness, bad news.

205
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Where's Lu Zhao?

206
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Why are you the only one who rushes back?

207
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Where's the princess?

208
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The carriage team met bandits by the cliff.

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The princess was forced to walk

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and fell off the cliff.

211
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What are you doing?

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I've heard that

213
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the Lu family is in danger.

214
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Lu's clan leader is on his way to the capital.

215
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If Lu Zhao dies at this critical moment,

216
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll kill your whole family!

217
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Your Highness, calm down.

218
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I heard there's a pool under the cliff.

219
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Even if the princess falls, it's okay.

220
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I hope you can send someone to find her.

221
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Send my order immediately.

222
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Go to the lake and search for Lu Zhao.

223
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If you can't find her,

224
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
bring her here!

225
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes.

226
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What's wrong?

227
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's so hot.

228
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's like someone has put some medicine on you.

229
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Take off your clothes first.

230
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll go light the fire for you.

231
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll go light the fire for you.

232
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll go light the fire for you.

233
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll go light the fire for you.

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You're in the wrong place.

235
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's Chunlu Su.

236
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He Qian.

237
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's Yao Huamen.
