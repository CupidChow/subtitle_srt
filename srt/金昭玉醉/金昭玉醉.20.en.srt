1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,080
Do

2
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Do

3
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:52,600
Do

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,000
The TV version of Bilibili is on air at the same time.

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,800
The audience is looking forward to seeing me change my life.

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,200
I've reported to His Majesty about Situ Xingyuan's rebellion.

7
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,000
His Majesty ordered the search to arrest Situ Xingyuan immediately.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But the spy reported that the Pilan Palace is empty.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Situ Xingyuan is not in the city.

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,000
She must still be in the city.

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
I'll take someone to block the city gate.

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,200
Then I'll take another team to search the Pilan Palace from start to finish.

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,400
My personal jade pendant is still inside.

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,800
Yes.

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
I know. I know. I'll be right there.

16
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Why don't you sleep a little longer?

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Some people are more badly injured than me and get up earlier than me.

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
I'll be right there.

19
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Since your memories are back,

20
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I'll report to His Majesty

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
and ask him to return the position of Xuntian Sect Leader to you.

22
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Report?

23
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
How do you want to report?

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,200
Are you telling His Majesty that Xiao Jinyu was lying to His Majesty and was lying to him?

25
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Or are you saying that you used the witchcraft

26
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
to bring people back to life?

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,400
A'Ren, I've already decided

28
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,800
not to take over Xuntian Sect anymore.

29
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
A'Ren, if...

30
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Listen to me.

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Since ancient times, the king has hated the witchcraft.

32
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
You must keep this in mind.

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,800
You must not mention it to anyone else.

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Moreover, I feel that my skills now

35
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
are not as good as before.

36
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,800
I can no longer take over Xuntian Sect.

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Moreover,

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,800
you really did better than me.

39
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
In the past,

40
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
I was always out there killing people.

41
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,800
You were behind me and protecting me.

42
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
From now on, let me

43
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
be behind you and protect you.

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
A'Jie.

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
You're calling me A'Jie.

46
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
We've been called A'Jie

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
for so many years.

48
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
A'Jie

49
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
can't fall in love with a younger brother.

50
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Lu Zhao can.

51
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Lu Zhao can fall in love with Xiao Ren.

52
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
From now on,

53
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
I will no longer be Xiao Jin Yu.

54
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
I will only be your A'Zhao.

55
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I will only be your A'Zhao.

56
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
This is...

57
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
For A'Zhao.

58
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I'll help you.

59
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I'll help you.

60
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
I'll help you.

61
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I'll help you.

62
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I'll help you.

63
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
When I helped you,

64
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I never thought

65
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
we would share these eyes.

66
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I will take you

67
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
to see the world.

68
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Actually,

69
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I knew

70
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
you weren't Xiao Prince.

71
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
My mother had a child

72
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
and only had one daughter.

73
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
It wasn't like what my father said.

74
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
It was a twin child.

75
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
So you knew about it too.

76
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I did have some feelings for you.

77
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
When I found out the truth,

78
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I asked my father

79
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
why he was so partial.

80
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
But my father said

81
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Xiao's family was to be inherited

82
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
and it was not allowed to be separated from each other.

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Otherwise,

84
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
he would have let the ancestors down.

85
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
I was here

86
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
being held down,

87
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
kneeling down and begging.

88
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
For the sake of Xiao's family,

89
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I will keep this secret forever.

90
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
I will not tell anyone about your background.

91
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I hated you at first.

92
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I hate...

93
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Xiao's family is my blood.

94
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
But why

95
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
did you take everything away?

96
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
So,

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
I treated you with my heart

98
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
and tried to be nice to you.

99
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
But you always used me as your shield

100
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,800
and risked your life for me.

101
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
I never felt wronged.

102
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Having you by my side

103
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
is also a blessing in disguise.

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
The stars at midnight

105
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
see through your eyes.

106
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
If the palm of your hand

107
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
is only for the sake of you.

108
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
I, Xiao Ren,

109
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
will never forget you.

110
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
I will never forget you.

111
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I will never forget you.

112
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I will never forget you.

113
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
I will never forget you.

114
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
I will never forget you.

115
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Forever and ever.

116
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
No matter what the future holds,

117
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
the old memories are just a pair of people.

118
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
When it's cold in the world,

119
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
it's a bit warm in the six years.

120
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
What is it that you are trying to do to me?

121
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Qiu Huangshuang,

122
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I heard that

123
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
you are now being forced by Xiao Ren.

124
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
It's like the death of the family.

125
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Let me out.

126
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
I will kill him for you.

127
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I will kill him for you.

128
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Let me out.

129
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I will kill him for you.

130
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
With your current condition,

131
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
how can you kill him?

132
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
With my life.

133
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
I can help you leave this place.

134
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
The old house of Song

135
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
has been abandoned for many years

136
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
after the rebellion of Song.

137
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
No one has been in charge of it.

138
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I will order someone

139
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
to set fire to the house

140
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
and let Xiao Ren out.

141
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I will leave the rest to you.

142
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
By the way,

143
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
there is one more thing.

144
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
I think you should know.

145
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Lu Zhao died on his birthday.

146
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Now, Lu Zhao is Xiao Jingyu.

147
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Yan보� sano

148
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
You smell so great.

149
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
You do gain weight.

150
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
You must have been adopted.

151
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
I was admiring the

152
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,100
emperor making sound of hisErmarскиs.

153
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,060
I can't believe you two THSE you as husband and wife.

154
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,060
After the ordination,

155
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,800
all of the wives in Dasik becomes concubines.

156
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,080
It appears that theThree Rangers escaped this place.

157
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,480
Dasik?

158
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Why do you sound so familiar?

159
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Isn't it that prince from before?

160
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
It's him!

161
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
It's him!

162
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Yes, yes, yes!

163
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Forgive me!

164
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Forgive me!

165
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Where is he?

166
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Over there!

167
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Where is he?

168
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
No!

169
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
No!

170
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Don't go!

171
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
No!

172
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
No!

173
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
No!

174
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
No!

175
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
No!

176
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480
No!

177
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
No!

178
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
No!

179
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
No!

180
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Prince!

181
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Prince!

182
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Do you know where Prince is?

183
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
No!

184
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
Can you take me to him?

185
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Prince!

186
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,480
Father and mother...

187
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
are dead...

188
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
and my child is dead too...

189
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,480
I only have Prince...

190
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Take me to him...

191
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,480
