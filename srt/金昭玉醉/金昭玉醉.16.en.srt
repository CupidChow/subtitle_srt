1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,660
no

2
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:39,780
no

3
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,280
yes

4
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,320
no

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,040
oh

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,200
yes

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,340
QQ

8
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,340
Listen to the TV and watch the live broadcasts.

9
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,340
The big screen is more exciting.

10
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,340
Watch me change my life and kill myself.

11
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,340
Oh my god.

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,340
No way.

13
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,340
So professional.

14
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,340
So comfortable.

15
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,340
Don't stop, director.

16
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,340
So professional.

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,340
Director, are you okay?

18
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,340
Director, don't stop.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,340
Go on.

20
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,340
Go on.

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,340
You pervert.

22
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,340
You pervert.

23
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,340
I'll throw up if you don't come back.

24
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,340
Say it.

25
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,340
Who is the master here?

26
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,340
You are the master?

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,340
My master is you.

28
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,340
Master, please hit me.

29
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,340
Hit me hard.

30
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,340
Master.

31
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,340
Boss, what's wrong?

32
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,340
Don't bother me.

33
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,340
I'm here.

34
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,340
Stop looking.

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,340
I didn't let her touch anything.

36
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,340
Sorry for you.

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
It's serious.

38
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,340
I've solved the fire.

39
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,340
And I've sent out a signal.

40
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,340
Lin Su has surrounded the teahouse.

41
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,340
Here.

42
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
I found this.

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,340
The map of the secret passage.

44
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,340
I thought the terrain was similar to the one in Zhaoyue House.

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,340
Now I've verified my guess.

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
So what?

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,340
People who have seen me like this must die.

48
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,340
Stop laughing.

49
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,340
I'll kiss you.

50
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,340
I'll save the girls who were locked up.

51
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
I'll go and solve Situ County.

52
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,340
You're so stupid.

53
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,340
Stop.

54
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,340
Don't be afraid. I'm here to save you.

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,340
Do you know where the other girls are locked up?

56
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,340
Yes.

57
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,340
I'll take you there.

58
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,340
Let's go.

59
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,340
You're so rude.

60
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,340
I'm here.

61
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,340
Stop.

62
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Stop.

63
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,340
Get up.

64
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,340
Go.

65
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,340
Go.

66
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,340
Go.

67
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,340
Go.

68
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,340
I won't do it.

69
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,340
Miss.

70
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,340
Miss.

71
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,340
It's okay.

72
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,340
It's over.

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
Miss.

74
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,340
Liu Yingxue.

75
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,340
Why are you here?

76
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,340
Why hasn't the prince come to see me these days?

77
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,340
Miss.

78
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,340
The prince is busy.

79
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,340
He has no time.

80
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,340
He's busy all day.

81
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,340
Can he be busy all day?

82
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,340
He must have other girls in the mansion.

83
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,340
I'll go and find them myself.

84
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,340
I'll go and find them myself.

85
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,340
The prince told me to keep you safe.

86
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,340
Don't go out.

87
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,340
Get out.

88
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,340
Prince.

89
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,340
Prince.

90
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,340
Prince.

91
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,340
Prince.

92
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,340
Prince.

93
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,340
Prince.

94
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,340
Prince.

95
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,340
Prince.

96
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
I don't know.

97
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,340
I don't know.

98
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,340
Get out. Don't touch me.

99
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,340
I want to wait for the prince to come and save me.

100
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,340
When will you come?

101
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,340
You still expect that man to save you?

102
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,340
Go.

103
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,340
I won't go with you.

104
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,340
I've done so many things that hurt you.

105
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,340
I don't believe you're so kind to save me.

106
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,340
I don't believe you're so kind to save me.

107
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Wake up.

108
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
Go.

109
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,340
Go.

110
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Go.

111
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,340
Go.

112
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,340
You're useless.

113
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,340
How can you see the master?

114
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,340
Where did he go?

115
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,340
Miss Liu had to go and find you.

116
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,340
When I went out, he was gone.

117
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,340
I really don't know anything.

118
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,340
Wait.

119
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,340
Xiao Ren.

120
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,340
You actually found Jifeng House.

121
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,340
Si Tu Xian.

122
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,340
It's really you.

123
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,340
I'm the prince.

124
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,340
How dare you arrest me without the imperial decree?

125
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,340
What a good king.

126
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,340
You colluded with the gunmen

127
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
to rebel.

128
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,340
The evidence is solid.

129
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,340
What about my late emperor?

130
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,340
Tuo.

131
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,340
I've controlled all the people in Jifeng House.

132
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,340
Miss Du saved all the priests who were imprisoned.

133
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,340
Liu Ying Xue is also in it.

134
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,340
What did you say?

135
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,340
Why is Xuan'er there?

136
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,340
She went to find you.

137
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,340
Zhao, this bitch.

138
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
How could she be so kind to save Xuan'er?

139
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,340
You must be lying to me.

140
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,340
The person who is heartbroken

141
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,340
can't see anything clean.

142
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
Take her away.

143
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
Xiao Ren.

144
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
Xiao Ren.

145
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,340
What happened?

146
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,340
You don't know anything about the case?

147
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
What happened?

148
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,340
You don't know?

149
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,340
There is a secret warehouse in here.

150
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
I heard that the people who went in were all high-ranking officials.

151
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,340
As long as they have money, they can play as they want.

152
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
You are so mean.

153
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,340
Actually,

154
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
you see,

155
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,340
those secret warehouses will be taken out later.

156
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,340
I want to see what kind of people they are.

157
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,340
We have no money to play, can't we see?

158
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,340
Right.

159
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,340
These girls are already pitiful enough.

160
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Don't you have any sympathy?

161
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,340
Who are you?

162
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
We didn't say you.

163
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,340
How do you know they are not willing to do it?

164
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,340
There are so many women in the world.

165
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,340
Why only kidnap them, not others?

166
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,340
If they are a woman who is a woman,

167
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,340
who can kidnap them

168
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,340
if they don't go out and sell?

169
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,340
I think they are shameless.

170
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,340
They can't even clap.

171
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,340
Do you want to clap?

172
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,340
If you don't want to clap, clap again.

173
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,340
Forget it.

174
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,340
Sir, Xuntianmen's work.

175
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,340
No one is allowed to enter.

176
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,340
You, go and send two carts.

177
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,340
Don't let anyone see the faces of the girls.

178
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,340
Yes.

179
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
Senior Xiao Lian Tianzhuang,

180
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
thank you Xuntianmen.

181
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,340
I thank you for your kindness.

182
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,340
Thank you.

183
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Don't kneel.

184
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
Get up.

185
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,340
From today on, you don't have to kneel.

186
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
I have no family.

187
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,340
I can't live on my own.

188
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,340
I am satisfied

189
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,340
to leave here before I die.

190
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,340
Please accept my bow.

191
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Thank you.

192
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,340
Xu Lian, hurry.

193
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Get up.

194
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,340
Don't be silly.

195
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,340
No matter what happened before,

196
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
living is the most important.

197
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,340
Living?

198
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,340
We have been ruined like this.

199
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,340
How can we live on?

200
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,340
I am the same as you.

201
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,340
I am also from the secret factory.

202
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,340
We never die.

203
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
We are not at fault.

204
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,340
We are innocent.

205
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,340
No one has the right to blame us.

206
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,340
I can walk out.

207
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
I can be a decent person.

208
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Why can't you?

209
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,340
I am a good person.

210
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,340
I can be a decent person.

211
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,340
Why can't you?

212
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,340
I have a embroidery shop outside the city.

213
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,340
I can buy food and shelter.

214
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
I also have money.

215
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,340
If you don't have a home,

216
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,340
you can come back.

217
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
You can live there

218
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,340
with your own skills.

219
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,340
Live a decent life.

220
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
I want to run away.

221
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,340
I want to run away.

222
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,340
Shaoyao, take them away.

223
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,340
Go.

224
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Take him away.

225
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,340
I know.

226
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,280
You?

227
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,700
An Sima!

228
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,180
嗯?

229
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
是,是,是。

230
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,580
趙?

231
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,580
趙!

232
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,280
快走!

233
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,340
You...

234
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,340
You're the one who laughed.

235
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
Where is the antidote?

236
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,340
You...

237
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,340
I can go to the heaven without dying.

238
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,340
How much do you think you can hold?

239
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,340
Where is the antidote?

240
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,340
You...

241
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,340
For Lu Chao...

242
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
You actually lost your power.

243
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,340
This way, things will be fine.

244
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,340
You...

245
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,340
It's not easy to lose your loved ones and your loved ones.

246
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,340
You always thought that I killed Xiao Qianyu.

247
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,340
So you kept biting me like a dog.

248
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,340
You even put your hand in my back.

249
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:32,340
But do you know how Xiao Qianyu died?

250
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:43,340
Speaking of which, I've never seen a woman as difficult to kill as Xiao Qianyu.

251
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Xiao Qianyu killed the craftsmen.

252
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,340
It was too late to find out about me.

253
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,340
So I set a trap to lure him into the ambush.

254
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,340
I wanted to get you two out of there.

255
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,340
But you didn't dare.

256
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,340
Only Xiao Qianyu died.

257
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,340
You...

258
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,340
Shoot!

259
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,340
You...

260
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,340
You actually killed the dead.

261
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,340
He was so badly injured.

262
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,340
How could he still escape?

263
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,340
I'm not even as capable as him.

264
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,340
It's a pity that he's still dead.

265
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,340
You couldn't save Xiao Qianyu.

266
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:22,340
Now, you can't save Lu Zhao either.

267
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:29,340
You'll always be my loser in this world.

268
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,340
The End

269
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:17,340
The End

270
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,340
The End

271
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,340
The End

272
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,340
The End
