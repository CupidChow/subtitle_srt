1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
��

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:01:00,040
great

3
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:28,340
I think.

4
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,340
Ah Zhou,

5
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,340
it's you who's lucky.

6
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,340
It's you who's lucky.

7
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,340
Is he armed?

8
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,340
It seems like he has a gun.

9
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,340
What's wrong?

10
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,340
A new report said that

11
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,340
there was a fire in the city.

12
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,340
It seems to be the remains of the Chu royal family.

13
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,340
How many people?

14
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,340
There are nearly a hundred.

15
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,340
I'm not sure.

16
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,340
I heard that

17
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,340
the people in the city were attacked by a fire.

18
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,340
It seems that the people in the city were attacked by a fire.

19
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,340
It seems that the people in the city were attacked by a fire.

20
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,340
There are nearly a hundred.

21
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,340
I heard that they might have gunpowder in their hands.

22
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,340
Let's get the whole team together.

23
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,340
I'll lead the team.

24
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,340
Yes.

25
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,340
Oh, right. There's one more thing.

26
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,340
Let him sleep a little longer.

27
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,340
Inform the kitchen to send the mountain later.

28
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,340
Yes, sir.

29
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,340
Don't worry, master.

30
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,340
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

31
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,340
Now that I've got rid of my obsession,

32
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,340
I can leave with no worries.

33
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,340
The memories that belong to you

34
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,340
will be returned to you.

35
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,340
Thank you.

36
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,340
Thank you for

37
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
letting me see

38
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,340
another kind of fate.

39
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,340
Take care,

40
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,340
Xiao Jing Yu.

41
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,340
Take care,

42
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,340
Lu Zhao.

43
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,340
Xiao Jing Yu.

44
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,340
Master of Xuntian Sect.

45
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,340
Xiao Jing Yu.

46
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,340
Xiao Jing Yu.

47
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,340
I thought I was dead.

48
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,340
I was just a little girl.

49
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,340
You know how to make a man.

50
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,340
You're so smart.

51
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,340
You have no idea

52
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,340
how to make a man.

53
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
You're so smart.

54
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,340
You're so smart.

55
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,620
Am I dead?

56
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,140
No.

57
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,500
The one who killed me is not Si Tuoxin.

58
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,220
Chase her!

59
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,060
Stay back!

60
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,780
Kill her.

61
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,540
Kill!

62
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,220
What is going on?

63
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,220
What happened?

64
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,220
Who is that?

65
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
I must tell Xiao Ren about this right now.

66
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,220
Miss, you haven't used your wound yet.

67
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Where are you going?

68
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,220
Where is Xiao Ren?

69
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,220
When the City Queen discovered the gunman, she went to check.

70
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,220
How many people did she bring?

71
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,220
How many people are there in the Xuntian Gate right now?

72
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:55,800
The

73
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,380
temple said that there are a lot of gunmen and gunpowder, so it's hard to deal with them.

74
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,380
The sect leader then took all the good guys inside the gate.

75
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,180
There must be a difference between those who collude with the gunmen and those who are still there.

76
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,180
I have to go remind them.

77
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,780
Miss, you go change your clothes first.

78
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,780
I will go to the Xuntian Gate right now.

79
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,780
Sect Leader?

80
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:33,620
They came for me.

81
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Don't worry about me.

82
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,620
Hurry and go find Xiao Ren.

83
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,620
Miss, how can I leave you here alone?

84
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,620
It's a big deal.

85
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:57,420
Xiao Ren, are you ok?

86
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,540
If I'm not careful, my smallish body,

87
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,420
cannot be artificially永守 Couple Endured

88
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:00,540
my already existing strength and weakness.

89
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
leaning on theoken inner force,

90
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,540
I can't resist.

91
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,760
Miss Lu, fire the Covid-19 Waterhill.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,840
Ninth Uncle?

93
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,620
Thanks for rescuing me, Your critique.

94
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,620
Tell me what happened.

95
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,620
Your highness,

96
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,620
there must be someone else hiding behind Situ Xian.

97
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,620
How do you know?

98
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,620
Because I...

99
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,620
It's the one from Xuntian Gate.

100
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,620
It's father.

101
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,620
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,620
Because...

103
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,620
You recognized me?

104
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,620
I was right.

105
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,620
You really are Xiao Jing Yu.

106
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,620
If I remember correctly,

107
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
Xiao Jing Yu's death

108
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,620
and Lu Zhao's time to jump off the building are very different.

109
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,620
After Xiao Jing Yu died,

110
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,620
Lu Zhao's personality changed.

111
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,620
Xiao Ren also risked his life to help Lu Zhao.

112
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,620
This is not Xiao Ren's doing.

113
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,620
Unless...

114
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
Unless what?

115
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,620
Unless...

116
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,620
Xiao Ren risked his life to help Lu Zhao.

117
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,620
From the beginning to the end, they are the same person.

118
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,620
It's said that there is a witchcraft in the northern border.

119
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,620
It can be used to bring back the dead.

120
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,620
You mean,

121
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,620
Xiao Jing Yu is Lu Zhao.

122
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Lu Zhao is Xiao Jing Yu.

123
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
That's all.

124
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,620
I can only make it clear.

125
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
Whether it's true or not,

126
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,620
I'll know in one try.

127
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,620
It's a pity

128
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,620
that these eyes that look like the temple

129
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
this time,

130
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,620
God is still standing on my side.

131
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
Stop!

132
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
Don't run!

133
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,620
Don't move!

134
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
Don't move!

135
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,620
I'm Xiao Ren.

136
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,620
Chief, Lu Zhao was taken away.

137
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,620
The gold bug can smell the breath of the gold warehouse.

138
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Follow him

139
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,620
and you'll know where Zhao is.

140
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,620
Come on, let's go!

141
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,620
Come on, let's go!

142
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,620
Zha Ruo!

143
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Zha Ruo!

144
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,620
Where are you going?

145
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,620
I'm going to the temple.

146
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,620
Where are you going?

147
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,620
Where are you going?

148
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,620
Zha Ruo!

149
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,620
You go ahead!

150
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,620
Come on!

151
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,620
Zha Ruo!

152
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Hurry up!

153
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Hurry up!

154
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,620
Where are you going?

155
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,620
How can I let you break in?

156
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,620
Since the day I lost him, I've been crazy.

157
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,620
Then I'll go with you.

158
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,020
Listen to my order.

159
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,620
This is my personal matter.

160
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,620
I can give up my life, but I will never gather the Xuntian Gate.

161
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,620
You must take your wife to the gate right now.

162
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,620
Without my order, no one is allowed to enter.

163
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,620
If after an hour, Lu Zhao and I are not back yet,

164
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,620
the next Xuntian Gate Master will be you.

165
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,620
Yes.

166
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,620
You're awake.

167
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,620
It's been a long time, Sect Leader Xiao.

168
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,620
Since you've recognized me,

169
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,620
why do you still want to kill me?

170
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,620
These eyes are exactly like Miao He's.

171
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,620
They are so wild and fierce.

172
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,620
How can I bear to kill you?

173
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,620
Do you really think that Lu Zhao's tragedy

174
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,620
is just because of the family's property?

175
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,620
Lu Zhao is a daughter of a merchant. How can she marry into the royal family?

176
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,620
It's you.

177
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,620
It's indeed me who manipulated this marriage.

178
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,620
Because only the Lu family's property

179
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,620
can support the ambition of Situ County to rebel.

180
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,620
In this way, I have the opportunity to take the advantage of the fishbowl.

181
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,620
Whether it's me or Situ County,

182
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,620
they are all just your stepping stones.

183
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,620
Why?

184
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,620
Sect Leader Xiao, let me tell you a story.

185
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,620
The two countries are at war. The south is in a terrible state.

186
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,620
The result of the compromise

187
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,620
is that my sister Miao He was sent to the north.

188
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Sister!

189
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Brother, take care.

190
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,620
Later, she was killed by the enemy.

191
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,620
She was not even released.

192
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,620
She was killed by the enemy.

193
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,620
She was killed by the enemy.

194
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,620
She was killed by the enemy.

195
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,620
She was killed by the enemy.

196
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,620
She's no longer alive.

197
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,620
She's no longer alive.

198
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,620
She's no longer alive.

199
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Hurry and surrender!

200
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,620
Decapitate the organisation!

201
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,620
You're a traitor!

202
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,620
Your Majesty!

203
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,620
Your Majesty!

204
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,620
I beg you to let me see the last year of the temple.

205
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,620
If you don't stop me, I will send you away.

206
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,620
The temple!

207
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
The temple is a sacred place.

208
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,620
It should be a great place to be buried.

209
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,620
It should be admired by all.

210
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,620
Your Majesty, to preserve the reputation of the royal family,

211
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,620
you don't allow it to enter the imperial mausoleum.

212
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,620
You buried it at will.

213
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,620
I have been doing this for a long time.

214
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,620
I have been doing this for a long time.

215
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,620
I finally understand

216
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,620
that only by being the supreme ruler

217
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,620
can I protect the one I love.

218
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,620
From that time,

219
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,620
I asked to leave the palace

220
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,620
to secretly plan for my great plan.

221
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,620
You want to rebel?

222
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,620
Any northern wall will drop the border.

223
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
He will die helplessly.

224
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:16,020
After 노니е в

225
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,620
I admire you.

226
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,620
You have the intelligence and the determination of the Miao River.

227
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,620
You are a true hero of the Jin State.

228
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,620
Why don't you follow me?

229
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,620
Hand over the map of the palace.

230
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,620
We will work together to turn this world into what you expect.

231
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,620
What are you pretending to be so righteous?

232
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,620
It was the Northern Qiang that started the war.

233
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,620
They killed our people and humiliated our princess.

234
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,620
You colluded with them.

235
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,620
If you really have the strength, you should go to war and kill the enemy.

236
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:16,440
Instead of fighting against the

237
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,620
I killed you.

238
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,620
I know you have bones.

239
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,620
You are not afraid of death.

240
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,620
But there are people who live and there are people who die.

241
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,620
It's okay if you don't want to cooperate with me.

242
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,620
I will invite you to start a good show.

243
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,620
Your Highness, he is here.

244
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,620
The show begins.

245
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,620
The show begins.

246
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,620
The show begins.

247
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,620
The show begins.

248
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,620
The show begins.
