1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,040
Alright.

2
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhou Junwei.

3
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,540
Today's episode will be broadcasted on Yun Shi Ting TV.

4
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,340
Watch TV and watch today's episode.

5
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,540
Join me in helping Jing get revenge.

6
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,040
Who is it?

7
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
You!

8
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,740
Big robbery.

9
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,240
What robbery?

10
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Rob... rob a young man.

11
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,040
Sect Leader Xiao.

12
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,240
You're not a sect leader anymore, but a bandit?

13
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
I'm not seeing a beautiful lady get pregnant.

14
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Why don't you go back with me and be my wife?

15
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
We'll be happy every day.

16
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,740
Then, Sect Leader Xiao, you just killed a spy from Situ County.

17
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,240
What should I do from now on?

18
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,740
Who are you explaining to?

19
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,240
Just kill one and pay one.

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Here, your favorite roast goose.

21
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,240
How's your injury?

22
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,240
You're worrying about me?

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm fine.

24
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
It's not counted.

25
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
I'm fine.

26
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
You're indeed Miss Lu.

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,240
The wound on the outside is better.

28
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
The internal organs are still a bit painful.

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,240
You're talking nonsense. I don't have internal organs.

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:47,860
Princess Consort Chu, the first lesson of the Yilan Palace's

31
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
Two hours?

32
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,860
The Ninth Uncle is not an ordinary royal family.

33
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,860
He's not a common person, but he knows the etiquette of the entire royal family.

34
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,860
His sister, Princess Miaohe, is the core of the country.

35
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,860
She was killed by a four-man gun.

36
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,860
His Majesty feels guilty towards her, so he's been making her suffer.

37
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Let's meet.

38
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,860
Such a big place, and you're just sitting in the middle of the pavilion.

39
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,860
You saw our Prince of Ru Nan?

40
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,860
Get out of the way!

41
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,860
Who am I?

42
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,860
I'm the one who forced my father to die.

43
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
What a disgrace.

44
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,860
Get out of my way!

45
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,860
Go clean up.

46
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,860
How dare you! You dare to hurt our prince?

47
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,860
You...

48
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,860
You... You dare to come to the Yilan Palace?

49
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Wait for me!

50
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,860
The Pillar Assembly is the place of spiritual cultivation.

51
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,860
Who is making the noise?

52
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,860
The Ninth Uncle is a wise man. I wouldn't dare.

53
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,860
It's all because of that bastard!

54
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,860
He's arrogant and arrogant.

55
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,860
He's just letting the guards hurt people.

56
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,860
Please, Your Majesty, help me.

57
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,860
It's you.

58
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,860
You're the one who killed my father.

59
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,860
You're the one who killed my father.

60
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,860
It's you.

61
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,860
When I was young, I went to Jiangnan with the late emperor.

62
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,860
We had a meeting.

63
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,860
The Lu family's daughter was gentle and virtuous.

64
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,860
Why are you changing your name now?

65
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,860
Your Majesty, I'm the Princess Consort of Chu.

66
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,860
I speak and act in honor of the royal family.

67
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,860
You just heard that the Crown Prince was rude.

68
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,860
I can also be humiliated.

69
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,860
The guards hurt people and they're being punished.

70
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
The Princess Consort of Chu is not a good teacher.

71
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,860
She punishes women for hundreds of times.

72
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,860
She's being punished for ten days.

73
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,860
I ordered her to do it.

74
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,860
She shouldn't punish others. I'm willing to take the punishment.

75
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,860
The Pillar Assembly has its rules.

76
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,860
You should be the one to punish the Princess Consort of Chu.

77
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,860
I'm willing to take the punishment.

78
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,860
As for you, you're the Crown Prince of the South.

79
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,860
You're being punished for ten days.

80
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,860
I don't care about rumors.

81
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,860
I'm seriously injured.

82
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,860
There are many rules in the Pillar Assembly.

83
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,860
Let's not fight over these rumors next time.

84
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,860
I don't want anyone to bully you like you.

85
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,860
Did you have a hard time before?

86
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,860
So many wounds.

87
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,860
Are you concerned about me?

88
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,860
I'm thinking that you'll be very sad to see your parents in heaven.

89
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,860
Really?

90
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,860
This will hurt a little. Bear with it.

91
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
This isn't an old wound, right?

92
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,860
If it can hurt you like this, your opponent must be very powerful.

93
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,860
He's really powerful.

94
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,860
He almost killed me.

95
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,860
Only he can kill me.

96
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,860
You'll get hurt if you get hurt after taking the medicine.

97
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,860
I'll put on your clothes.

98
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,860
I'll go.

99
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,860
The most annoying thing about the formation is the water.

100
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,860
You have to be careful these days.

101
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,860
I'll be back.

102
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,860
A Ji.

103
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
What did you call me?

104
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,860
I'm sorry.

105
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,860
I'm coming in.

106
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Miss Lu, you're here too?

107
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,860
It's good to have a big event.

108
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,860
This is all the work of Xuntian Gate.

109
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,860
I finally got to show it to you.

110
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,860
Is this a big deal?

111
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,860
What's wrong? Why are you so forgetful?

112
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,860
Why didn't I notice before?

113
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,860
It's harder to write than to hold a pen.

114
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
Here.

115
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Why are you here?

116
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,860
Take a break. I'll write.

117
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,860
The hand of the Sect Leader Xiao is for killing people.

118
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,860
Do you know how to copy women's books?

119
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,860
What kind of women's books?

120
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,860
They're just nonsense.

121
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,860
They're to attack women's luck.

122
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,860
I used to write when I was little.

123
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860
How do you know how to copy women's books?

124
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
I copied them from my sister.

125
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
Okay, you copy.

126
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,860
You look pretty handsome.

127
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,860
I'm sorry.

128
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,860
Ah Jie,

129
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,860
what should I do

130
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,860
to make you understand how much I love you?

131
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860
I'm sorry.

132
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,860
I didn't kiss you just now,

133
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,860
but I'll kiss you in the future.

134
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,860
I'm afraid that he'll be happy

135
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,860
even if he's not happy.

136
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,860
This dream is too cruel

137
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,860
to be true.

138
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,860
We can't have no regrets.

139
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,860
You...

140
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
Ah!

141
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,860
Sect Leader Xiao,

142
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,860
we're just using our relationship.

143
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Sect Leader Xiao,

144
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,860
I'm sorry.

145
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:29,860
fingers I sword

146
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,640
architecture

147
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
For an angular

148
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Gini

149
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,460
Ah

150
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
We're

151
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,260
Really

152
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
You are never his wife.

153
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Never!

154
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,640
It's none of your business!

155
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,640
I've died once anyway.

156
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
I don't believe you.

157
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Why should I believe you?

158
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Ah Zhao.

159
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
I'm different from him.

160
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Don't put us together.

161
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Okay?

162
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
I'm not your wife.

163
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
I'm your husband.

164
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
I'm your husband.

165
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I'm your husband.

166
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
I'm your husband.

167
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
I'm your husband.

168
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
I'm your husband.

169
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
I'm your husband.

170
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
I'm your husband.

171
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
I'm your husband.

172
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
I'm your husband.

173
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
I'm your husband.

174
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
I'm your husband.

175
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,640
I'm your husband.

176
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm your husband.

177
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
I'm your husband.

178
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,140
Suddenly in the blink of an eye

179
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:30,440
a lil康oy

180
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,960
Mr. Han is a good realization.

181
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,480
Mr. Han.

182
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:53,440
He will bear the ambitions in his heart with al

183
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,720
Ha, ha, ha.

184
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,560
He will only take half of his age .

185
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,400
Love will lead your way

186
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,500
