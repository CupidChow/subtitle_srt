1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
oh

2
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,120
Oh

3
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Hello, how are you i'm jingwei

4
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,560
今朝一醉必战 TV版云视听小电视同步热播

5
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,320
看电视看今朝

6
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,560
和我一起助阿谨复仇

7
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,360
宋楼叛国的消息很快就被卡了

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,760
群体激发

9
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,160
祸于情势

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,560
朕只能下旨将宋家宝宝困于府中

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,360
七日后斩首

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
宋夫人,计划有变

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
抢人的眼线混入营都到处悬扬

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
抢王下了悬赏令

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,960
宋家一举失身,赏金百两

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,560
陛下原本计划秘密斩首,直接埋尸

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,760
但现下每日都有众多百姓居中围观

18
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,160
唯恐生变

19
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,960
只能冒出一场大战

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,160
而宋家宝宝困于情势

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,160
众中围观,唯恐生变

22
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,160
只能冒险将你们提前转移

23
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
宋夫人

24
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,160
萧爱卿已从寻天门的死囚中

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
为你们寻好了提身

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,160
你们转移后就把这宅院烧了吧

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,160
就说宋家人畏罪自尽,葬身活海

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
不可

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,160
陛下,那枪贼执意要见我宋家人的尸身

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,160
显然还未完全信任我夫

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,160
我夫如今孤身一人,立于敌营,危如雷乱

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,160
那枪王一丝一毫的才艺就能要了他的命

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,160
这最后关头,唯有我宋家全族的命

34
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
能帮他安全渡过

35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,160
宋夫人三思啊,宋爱卿已身入局

36
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,160
已为国蒙冤,若朕连他的家人都保不住

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,160
你让朕如何面对宋爱卿的一枪忠魂哪

38
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,160
陛下,永州大败,小老将军慷慨赴死送他入枪

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,160
为这局棋已经牺牲了无数的兵将烈士

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,160
生死关头,助我宋家人苟且偷生

41
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,160
如何对得起前线捐躯的烈士一魂

42
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,160
他将这定情玉佩送还于我

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,160
这次的死亡是坏了彼此的决心

44
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,160
陛下,为了涉及大忌,为了我父的安危

45
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,160
妮夫恳请陛下将我宋家满门处死

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,160
以绝送老后顾之忧

47
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,160
妮夫为欧阳情,求陛下替宋家保住这唯一的血脉

48
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,160
宋家的血脉

49
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,160
宋家的血脉

50
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,160
求陛下成全

51
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,160
无愿一死,以成大忌

52
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
求陛下成全

53
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160
无愿一死,以成大忌

54
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
求陛下成全

55
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
无愿一死,以成大忌

56
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,160
臣奏

57
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,160
母亲领走前,将你托付给了萧海清

58
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,160
她说,如若你发现了自己的真实身份

59
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
将此信交付给你

60
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,160
母儿阿任,展兮,贪婉相见

61
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
娘亲特留此书,十位相告

62
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
你父一身轻果,未曾叛国

63
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,160
叛你莫要责怪他所作抉择

64
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,160
义莫为娘亲的离去

65
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
母亲领了你,却不知你父亲的心愿

66
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,160
母亲领了你,却不知你父亲的心愿

67
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,160
母亲的离去,而心怀怨恨

68
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,160
虚知,这世间有诸多大事远重于小琴

69
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,160
娘亲忠心齐往,无儿消福

70
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,160
以后亦能成为一个有担当,有勇气,秉天立地的男子汉

71
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,160
娘亲虽是,但将化作璀璨星辰

72
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,160
I will be with you forever.

73
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,160
I wish you a long life.

74
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,160
And a peaceful life.

75
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:46,160
I will be with you forever.

76
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Your Majesty.

77
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Situ Xingyuan has gathered the army.

78
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
He is ready to attack at any time.

79
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
This is serious.

80
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
It's urgent.

81
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
Please decide.

82
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Then we will lead the army into the net.

83
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,160
We will kill him and his confidants.

84
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
I will do it.

85
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Xiao Ren.

86
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Your family is loyal.

87
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
You are the descendant of the loyal minister.

88
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Today should be your wedding day.

89
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,160
But because of these things, you are involved.

90
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I am ashamed to see you go.

91
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Go.

92
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
I am not a traitor.

93
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
I am a traitor.

94
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
I am a traitor.

95
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
I am a traitor.

96
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
I am a traitor.

97
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
I am a traitor.

98
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
I am a traitor.

99
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
I am a traitor.

100
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
I am a traitor.

101
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
I am a traitor.

102
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
I am a traitor.

103
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
I am a traitor.

104
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
I am a traitor.

105
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
I am a traitor.

106
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I am a traitor.

107
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
After the war,

108
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
our family never gave up.

109
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I know.

110
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Our family never gave up.

111
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
My father never gave up.

112
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
I will go.

113
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Nine needles, one fake.

114
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
They will be hooked.

115
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Okay.

116
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
I will go tomorrow morning.

117
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
You should rest.

118
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
I want to see you for a while.

119
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
I will go.

120
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,160
The Song family is all heroes.

121
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Since they are heroes,

122
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,160
they are destined to bear a lot.

123
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
A'ren, look at me.

124
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
A'ren.

125
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
I am fine.

126
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
I am fine.

127
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
I have nothing to feel wronged.

128
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
I was born and raised in the Xiao family.

129
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
My first time to ride a horse was my father's.

130
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
Every time I am in danger, you come to save me.

131
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
The death of the Song family has nothing to do with me.

132
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
The Song family's death has nothing to do with me.

133
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
I know.

134
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
I know all of this.

135
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
They never let Nan Qing down.

136
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
But they let you down.

137
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
You can be mad.

138
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
Really.

139
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
Cry if you want to.

140
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Let go if you have emotions.

141
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
It's okay.

142
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
I will be with you.

143
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
I will be with you.

144
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Why is he so stupid?

145
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
It's okay.

146
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Why?

147
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Why?

148
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Why did I have to be alone?

149
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
Why?

150
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Why?

151
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Why did I have to be a hero?

152
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
Why did I have to carry these eight lives?

153
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:48,160
The song of the

154
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Zhao family

155
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Zhao, what should we do next?

156
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Next, we should go to the bait.

157
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
This is a serious game.

158
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,160
This game must be real.

159
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Zhao Zhuling, you bastard!

160
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Bastard!

161
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Get up.

162
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Get up.

163
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Xiao Ren.

164
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
You hurt me.

165
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
I can't get up until I hug you.

166
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
Get up.

167
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Okay, okay, don't cry.

168
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Husband, you are so smart.

169
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
I'm not.

170
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm not.

171
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
I'm not.

172
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
You are so smart.

173
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
You are so brave.

174
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
You are indeed the leader of Xuntian Sect.

175
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
I almost believed it.

176
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
This game

177
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
is so satisfying.

178
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I really think I'm so smart.

179
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
But, your mechanism is really clever.

180
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Of course.

181
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Xuntian Sect's craft is of course very good.

182
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
Let's go.

183
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
It's time to close the bowl.

184
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
You can watch me later.

185
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
You are so great, Sect Leader Xiao.

186
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
You are so brave.

187
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
