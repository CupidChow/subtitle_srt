1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,240
Protocol

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,360
is

3
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,360
my

4
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
The king!

5
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
You can go to Luzhao

6
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
as you wish

7
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
but you can't kill her

8
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Xuer

9
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,360
In a few days

10
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,360
It will be Luzhao's

11
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
18th birthday

12
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
But after the birthday banquet

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
He has the right to

14
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
fight with the Luzhu clan

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,840
all Lu's family members.

16
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,200
If you kill him before the ceremony,

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,480
it will ruin my great cause.

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,960
Your Highness,

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
I didn't want to kill him.

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,920
I just got dizzy.

21
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,280
I want to kill this child for you.

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,920
I don't care how I usually

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,840
pamper him, respect him,

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,640
give him a position of concubine,

25
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,920
or give him a high position.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,680
But as a child,

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
I can't stand you and other women

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,800
being selfish.

29
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,520
Why?

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,520
Why?

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,360
Why?

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,240
Xuan'er.

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,280
Come on.

34
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,760
Get up.

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,600
I don't want to have children with other women.

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,640
You are the only one

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,360
who can have my children.

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,200
But

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,040
now

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
the ceremony is not over,

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,200
I still need to use this child

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,120
to take over Lu's family.

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,000
Only you

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,000
are my only true wife.

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,000
Please,

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,000
tonight

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,520
we will have a child.

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,200
Brother-in-law,

49
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,120
it's my fault.

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,880
Don't be angry.

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,520
It's snowing outside.

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,360
Please take me back.

53
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,880
Come on.

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,440
Jinlin.

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,360
Yes.

56
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,880
According to old rules,

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,960
you are the one who will keep guard here.

58
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
The baby...

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,960
My baby...

60
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Your Highness!

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
I just had a dream.

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Our child is gone.

63
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm covered in blood.

64
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
I'm lying in the snow.

65
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
I'm very flustered.

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Your Highness, tomorrow, go to the Fanyin Temple with me.

67
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Let's pray for our child.

68
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Your Highness.

69
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Why aren't you talking?

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Your Highness.

71
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
No! You're not the Prince!

72
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
Who are you?

73
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Your Highness.

74
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
Ah Zhou, it's me.

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
I had an emergency.

76
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
I took care of it temporarily.

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
I'm afraid I'll give you cold air.

78
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
So I changed into a new clothes.

79
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
You were just talking.

80
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
I thought I was lying next to someone else.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
I was so scared.

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Ah Zhou.

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,360
It's easy to think about your luck.

85
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Rest early.

86
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Tomorrow, I'll go with you to the temple

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,360
to pray for our child.

88
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Okay?

89
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,360
Okay.

90
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Back up!

91
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
Don't move!

92
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
He's your master's twin brother.

93
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
If you don't want him to die here,

94
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,360
put down your weapons and let him go!

95
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Put down your weapons and leave.

96
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Go!

97
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Master of the Sky Gate, Xiao Jinyu!

98
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Xiao Jinyu!

99
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
You forced me to go to the dead end!

100
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Don't blame me for being rude!

101
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
It's too late.

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Put down your weapons!

103
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,360
I think you don't know the people of the Sky Gate.

104
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,360
You don't know my Ah Jie.

105
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,360
If you didn't kill yourself,

106
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,360
I thought you could catch me.

107
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Idiot.

108
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
You're not a fool.

109
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,360
You should have the right to kill yourself.

110
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
How can you do that?

111
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
You're a coward.

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,360
You should've been a man.

113
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
You've been a man for a while.

114
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
You should be a man.

115
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
I don't want to die.

116
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
You can't be a man!

117
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,360
You can't be a man!

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
You can't be a man!

119
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
You can't be a man!

120
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
You can't be a man!

121
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
You can't be a man!

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,680
You're so stubborn.

123
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
When I stab him

124
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,080
into your eye,

125
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,720
you must hold on.

126
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,760
I said...

127
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,560
It's my uncle.

128
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,040
It's a spirit.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,080
He's very cautious.

130
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,000
Every time,

131
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,040
different people see him.

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,360
I suddenly found out.

133
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,600
There's something wrong with the King of Chu.

134
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,120
You're really ruthless.

135
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,960
You almost killed me too.

136
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,120
You have the golden bone.

137
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,920
You don't have any pain, and you're not close to him.

138
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,840
What are you afraid of?

139
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,000
You're not dead yet.

140
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,960
I...

141
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,280
The King of Chu is in the Fanyin Temple

142
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,680
with the Princess Consort of Chu.

143
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,200
I have to go.

144
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,080
You...

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,800
You can go back and heal yourself after you're done.

146
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,280
I'm leaving.

147
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,240
Come back soon.

148
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,400
Be careful, Tang.

149
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,200
Xue.

150
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,720
It's so cold.

151
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,920
You're still with me to pray for the child.

152
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,520
You've worked hard.

153
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,480
What are you talking about?

154
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,200
The future King of Chu is so noble.

155
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,240
I have to pray for him with you.

156
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,880
I heard that the Fanyin Temple is the most sacred place.

157
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,800
As long as you write down your wish and hang it on the tree,

158
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,640
you can achieve your dream.

159
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,440
Tang.

160
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
You're not well.

161
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,520
I'll write it for you.

162
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,720
What do you want?

163
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,680
I don't have many wishes.

164
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,520
I just hope my child

165
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,560
can live a safe and smooth life

166
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,120
and live a happy life.

167
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,680
Okay.

168
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,840
Wait for me.

169
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,600
Zheng.

170
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,040
Come here.

171
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,560
I've finished writing it.

172
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,000
How do you think, Your Highness?

173
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,000
Very good.

174
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,480
Come on.

175
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,720
Tang.

176
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,440
Take the Buddha card and kowtow to Buddha.

177
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,360
Remember, you must be sincere enough

178
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,280
so that Buddha can feel your kowtow.

179
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,680
Tang, please pray for him here.

180
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,840
I won't bother you.

181
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,360
Zheng.

182
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,920
I'm going to pray for the child

183
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,760
in the temple every day.

184
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

185
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,960
May Buddha bless my child to be born safely and successfully.

186
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,760
May Buddha bless my child to be raised well.

187
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,840
You don't think that you can let your child be born safely by praying to Buddha?

188
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Princess Chu.

189
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
Who are you?

190
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,800
You know me and know that I pray for my child.

191
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,360
You still speak ill of me in front of Buddha.

192
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Aren't you afraid of committing a crime?

193
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,720
The leader of Xuntian Sect, Xiao Jingyu.

194
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,360
He committed many crimes in his life.

195
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Of course, he is not afraid of the Buddha.

196
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,440
I heard that you have been working for His Majesty.

197
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,200
You have always been loyal to His Highness.

198
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Now you are in the hall of Buddha.

199
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Why do you say these words to me?

200
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Isn't it very clever?

201
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,280
Why is it that when I meet Prince Chu, I can't see the danger of the night account?

202
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,720
Leader Xiao, I have been busy for many years.

203
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,080
I don't need to know the night account.

204
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,120
A person is not afraid of the night account, but only afraid of the heart.

205
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
You...

206
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
What do you mean by this?

207
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,000
Your good cousin, Liu Yingxue, secretly bought a poison that can make people blind.

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,080
And your eyes were blind four years ago.

209
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,080
You guess, is this a coincidence?

210
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Or is it a beauty?

211
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
You Xuntian Sect are very cruel.

212
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Your reputation is out there.

213
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,080
I have never known you.

214
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
I don't believe every word you say.

215
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
You don't believe?

216
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Prince Chu and Liu's family are now in the back yard.

217
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
They are planning to meet in the water.

218
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
You can go to the city to verify.

219
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Leader Xiao, you don't have to be angry with me.

220
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,080
I won't suspect anyone I love because of your words.

221
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Please leave.

222
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Love?

223
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,080
Your Prince Chu never wanted to leave this child.

224
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,080
He never wanted to keep your life.

225
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,080
If you don't believe, you can take the Buddha card in front of Buddha to let people see.

226
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,080
What does Liu write on it?

227
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Enough!

228
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
What do you want to do?

229
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
I want to cooperate with you.

230
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,080
I will help you see their true faces.

231
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,080
You will be my eyes in Prince Chu's mansion.

232
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,080
I don't want to see your eyes.

233
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,080
I don't want to see your eyes.

234
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
I don't want to see your eyes.

235
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
I don't want to see your eyes.

236
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
This is the secret holy medicine of Xuntian Sect.

237
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
It can not only help you with your eye blindness.

238
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,080
It can also make you unable to see for three days.

239
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
What kind of lies do you live in?

240
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
In hell.

241
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,080
When you see the truth, you can come to Xuntian Sect to find me anytime.

242
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Take it.

243
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
This orchid jade pendant is my surname.

244
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,080
As an exchange, I will avenge you.

245
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,080
I will avenge you.

246
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Prince.

247
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
What happened?

248
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Four of our men were killed on the way here.

249
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
What happened?

250
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
It's Xuntian Sect.

251
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,080
We might be targeted.

252
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Prince, please leave this place immediately.

253
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
The Jiaojian Jade.

254
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
The Jiaojian Jade

255
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,080
Miss, let me help you rest.

256
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Baoqing.

257
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,080
Please help me look at the words written on this card.

258
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
The blood of the blood moon.

259
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Mother, where did you get this blood moon?

260
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
What's wrong?

261
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,080
This is the blood moon card used by the Qifu Sect.

262
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
But it's made of the curse of the fire.

263
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,080
It's written, you can't die.

264
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
This is an ominous object.

265
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Throw it away.

266
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Wait.

267
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Give it to me.

268
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Give it to me.

269
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Mother.

270
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Baoqing.

271
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Ask someone to check what this pill is for.

272
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,080
Where did you get this pill?

273
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
Don't eat it.

274
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,080
You should ask the prince to come here and have a look.

275
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
No.

276
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
The prince can't know about this.

277
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
Go.

278
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
Okay.

279
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
I will do as you say.

280
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Go.

281
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Go.

282
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
Go.
