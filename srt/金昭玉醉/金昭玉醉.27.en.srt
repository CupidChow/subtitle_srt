00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,260
Hello, 大家好, 我是周俊伟。

2
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,060
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhou Junwei.

3
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,580
Today's wine is a must-have for TV.

4
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,620
The TV of the Cloud Hall is on air.

5
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,380
Watch TV and watch today's wine.

6
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,020
Help A'Jing to get revenge with me.

7
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,540
Lady Buddha.

8
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,860
Amitabha.

9
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,260
Lady Buddha.

10
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,500
You make wishes with blood every day.

11
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,740
If you keep doing this, you'll hurt yourself.

12
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,660
Don't make any more wishes for the good fortune.

13
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,660
Thank you, Master.

14
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,660
But I can't see through the good fortune of all people.

15
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,060
Amitabha.

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,340
Toov!

17
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,300
A wish smiles upon J 앞

18
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,180
as the Liar- SUN天

19
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,860
Sand bogged刺人

20
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,060
How can the city sustainable

21
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:43,460
With such standing

22
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:50,460
I went to the Fanyin Temple today and saw your school sign.

23
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,460
How could you be so stupid?

24
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,460
You used half of your life to exchange for my rebirth.

25
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,460
You used the next life to exchange for my eternal peace.

26
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,460
But do you know that if you weren't there,

27
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,460
how could I have been safe?

28
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,460
I was afraid that I would never see you again.

29
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,460
I was afraid that you wouldn't wake up.

30
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,460
I was afraid that we would break our promise.

31
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,460
I was afraid that you wouldn't come back.

32
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,460
I was afraid that we would break our promise.

33
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,460
I was afraid that you wouldn't wake up again.

34
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,460
I was afraid that I would never see you again.

35
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,460
I didn't know.

36
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,460
I miss you now.

37
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,460
I miss you so much that I can hear the sound of the bell.

38
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,460
I haven't heard you talking to me in a long time.

39
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,460
Am I dreaming?

40
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
I am dreaming.

41
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,460
You are really awake.

42
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,460
I thought that you would leave me alone in this world.

43
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,460
How could I?

44
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,460
I am so sorry.

45
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,460
I am so sorry.

46
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,460
I am so sorry.

47
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,460
How could I be so happy when the world is falling apart?

48
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
I am so happy.

49
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,460
I will never leave you.

50
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,460
I will never leave you.

51
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,460
I will never leave you.

52
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,460
How is she?

53
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,460
Even though she is awake, she has a broken bone.

54
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,460
She needs to rest for a year to recover.

55
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,460
During this time, she must not be hurt.

56
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,460
Otherwise, it will be difficult to save her.

57
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,460
Did you hear that?

58
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,460
You must take good care of yourself.

59
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,460
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

60
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,460
I am not allowed to go anywhere.

61
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,460
I am all grown up now.

62
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,460
If you are not used to it, I will go and get some medicine.

63
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,460
I will get back the dye.

64
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,460
I like the old man.

65
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
I am sorry.

66
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
I am sorry.

67
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,460
I am sorry.

68
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,460
I am sorry.

69
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,820
that I'm still going with him,

70
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,300
since he's quite the same.

71
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,200
But this isn't fair,

72
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,620
I'd still want you to be 부� όold ladies.

73
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,380
So I'd just look for Sparrow to turn me into an old lady.

74
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,060
Really?

75
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,620
You suffered.

76
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:53,320
Your Highness equation to pi o

77
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,460
Hurry up, spit it out.

78
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,460
How many times have I told you not to eat ice?

79
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,460
I only ate two.

80
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,460
I knew you were suffering, so I made plum juice for you.

81
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,460
I knew my wife loved me.

82
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,460
Speaking of which, this is the first time we've had a drink together.

83
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,460
There's nothing else besides plum juice.

84
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,460
What do you want?

85
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,460
What do you think?

86
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,460
My dear, you drank a few more cups tonight.

88
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,460
Do you feel better?

89
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,460
I'm fine. I didn't drink too much.

90
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,460
If that's the case, why don't we...

91
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,460
What are you doing?

92
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,460
She said I couldn't do it anymore.

93
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,460
Don't move. I know what to do. Just wait.

94
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,460
Don't move.

95
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Don't talk.

96
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,460
I'll be right there.

97
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,460
Okay, I won't talk.

98
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,460
Hurry up.

99
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
I finally got it.

100
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,460
Shaoyao was afraid that I wasn't right.

101
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,460
I've been feeling a little down lately.

102
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,460
I'm afraid I might be wrong.

103
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,460
I'm afraid I might be wrong.

104
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460
I'm afraid I might be wrong.

105
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,460
I've been practicing hard. I finally found my place.

106
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,460
I finally found my place.

107
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,460
What is this?

108
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,460
It's a flower.

109
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,460
This is the most beautiful flower in the world.

110
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,460
I don't know what to do now.

111
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,460
I'm in love with you.

112
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
This is for you.

113
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,460
I'm in love with you.

114
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,460
I'm in love with you.

115
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,460
I'm in love with you.

116
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,460
I'm not a child anymore.

117
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,460
You forgot it all?

118
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,460
When we were kids, we went to the market.

119
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
Father bought us some windmills.

120
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,460
I lost it on the way back.

121
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,460
Father asked you to give it to me.

122
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
What did you do?

123
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,460
You stepped on it and broke it.

124
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,460
You were punished for the whole afternoon.

125
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
I'm sorry.

126
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,460
And you hated me so much after that.

127
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,460
You suffered.

128
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,460
I didn't suffer.

129
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,460
Zhao, I'm your brother on your birthday.

130
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,460
Father forced you to take on my responsibility to protect me.

131
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
I know you're not a child anymore.

132
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,460
But I still want to make up for your regret in childhood.

133
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,460
I know you're brave and strong.

134
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,460
You don't have to do this in front of me.

135
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:11,460
From now on, I'll be your brother and your husband.

136
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,460
I'm sorry.

137
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,460
The pain and the hatred are all in the past.

138
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,460
The night is full of thorns.

139
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,460
I hold your eyes and dream of the old days.

140
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
I have a question in my mind.

141
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,460
Can I not recognize it?

142
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,460
The snow is falling.

143
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,460
I hear the sound of the soul in despair.

144
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,460
I close my eyes and feel lonely.

145
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,460
Who is standing outside the door?

146
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
The eyes are red.

147
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,460
The heart is red.

148
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:23,460
I will recognize you in the next life.

149
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:29,460
The wind is blowing.

150
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,460
Love is a curse.

151
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,460
The song of sorrow is a song.

152
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,460
The snow falls on the street.

153
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,460
The lamp is lit.

154
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,460
I can't remember the words.

155
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,460
The night is full of thorns.

156
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,460
I have a question in my mind.

157
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,460
Can I not recognize it?

158
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,460
The snow is falling.

159
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,460
I hear the sound of the soul in despair.

160
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,460
I hold your eyes and dream of the old days.

161
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,460
I have a question in my mind.

162
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,460
Can I not recognize it?

163
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,460
The snow is falling.

164
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,460
I can't remember the words.

165
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,460
The song of sorrow is a song.
