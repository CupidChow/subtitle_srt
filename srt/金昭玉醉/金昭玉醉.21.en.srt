1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:54,960
Hello, I'm Zhou Junwei.

2
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Hello, I'm Zhou Junwei.

3
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Can you....

4
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Who has ever been alone in the autumn wind?

5
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,960
The city is full of birds and the rain is heavy

6
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,960
The city is full of flowers and the rain is heavy

7
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,960
The city is full of flowers and the rain is heavy

8
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,960
The city is full of flowers and the rain is heavy

9
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,960
The city is full of flowers and the rain is heavy

10
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
The sky is full of me

11
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,960
The city is full of me

12
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,960
The sky is full of me

13
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Even if this city is not allowed, no one can leave this city

14
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Tao'er

15
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Situ Xian escaped yesterday

16
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Escaped? Where did he escape to?

17
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,960
It seems to be the direction of Song's mansion in the past

18
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
The mansion where the traitors sent the building?

19
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Yes

20
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
But that has been a long time since he was caught

21
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,960
I don't know what he is going to do

22
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
He can't escape by himself

23
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Someone must have helped him escape

24
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Could it be...

25
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Situ Xingyuan

26
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Zheng Chu can't catch him

27
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,960
He sent such a big defective

28
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
You haven't recovered yet, I'll go with you

29
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
No need, take care of Zhao

30
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Yes

31
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Situ Xingyuan

32
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
It's been a long time

33
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Situ Xingyuan let you out, right?

34
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Where is he?

35
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Situ Xingyuan

36
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
I...

37
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
If it wasn't for you and Xiao Jinyu

38
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
How could I have killed Xue'er?

39
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
If it wasn't for you and Lu Chao

40
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,960
I would have been on the throne of the nine-fifths

41
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
I would have used thousands of miles and mountains

42
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
You ruined it all

43
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Actually

44
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,960
I didn't do anything to you

45
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Your good uncle wants to protect the capital

46
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
How could he let me die?

47
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,960
He must have touched your gunpowder

48
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Situ Xingyuan

49
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Think about the past

50
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Who designed the engagement between you and Lu Zhao?

51
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Who is the one who used Lu's family's assets, private camp, and military fire to collude with the gunmen?

52
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
You and Lu Zhao are not related

53
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Who is the one who used Lu's family's assets, private camp, and military fire to collude with the gunmen?

54
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
Who are you responsible for these crimes?

55
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Who is it?

56
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
I only did this to lure me here

57
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Situ Xingyuan

58
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
You have been a chess piece for a lifetime

59
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Don't be controlled by him anymore

60
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Tell him I won't kill you

61
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
I won't kill you

62
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Li Yong

63
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
You are telling me this now

64
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
It's also Li Yong

65
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
I know

66
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
I know

67
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
You all

68
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,960
You all are using me

69
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
I am Situ Xingyuan

70
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
I am the one who came back from heaven

71
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
But I was dragged by the mother

72
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,960
I was born to be trapped by the chess piece

73
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,960
I was dragged by the chess piece

74
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I am the one who came back from heaven

75
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
I am the one who came back from heaven

76
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
I am the one who came back from heaven

77
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
I am here to find you

78
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
I am here to find you

79
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
I am here to find you

80
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Sect Leader Xiao

81
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Do you think the Song family's ashes are a good match for this?

82
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Situ Xingyuan

83
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Situ Xingyuan

84
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
You dare to come to see me alone?

85
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Sect Leader Xiao

86
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
You have been the son of the Xiao family for so many years

87
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Don't you want to know who your real parents are?

88
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,960
I just want to tell you who you are

89
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
I am here to find you

90
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,960
I was not able to kill the northern wall because of the rebellion in Songlou

91
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
The emperor wanted to kill all the people in the family

92
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
The Song family is not well-respected

93
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,960
They were able to kill themselves the night before the rebellion

94
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
When I arrived

95
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Only Mrs. Song's child and the family's jade pendant were not able to fly together

96
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,960
That means you are the descendant of the Song family

97
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Do you think a fake family can fool us?

98
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
When the Songlou case was in a trance

99
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
The emperor was very angry and worried about the family

100
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
The family could have been fake

101
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,960
But the jade pendant was impossible

102
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Kill me

103
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,960
The spirit will immediately save your life

104
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Do you dare to bet with me?

105
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Xiao Ren, you dare not kill me

106
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Because you are afraid

107
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,960
You know that the Song family and the Xiao family are blood enemies

108
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
You are afraid that your life will be exposed

109
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Xiao Qingyu will hate you

110
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,960
You will die in the valley and you will not be able to live

111
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,960
What you want in your life will turn into a false dream

112
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
What is the best?

113
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
You are dreaming

114
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
I was born and raised in the Xiao family

115
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
The blood of the Xiao family is on my body

116
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I am not the Song family

117
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Look carefully

118
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
You are the Song family

119
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
The blood of the Song family is on your body

120
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Once the emperor knows about this

121
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
The whole family will be gathered

122
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,960
This is death

123
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
What do you want?

124
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Give me the palace defense map

125
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,960
I will always keep the secret of my identity for you

126
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
You want me to betray the country?

127
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Ninth prince

128
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
You are wrong

129
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
I have another plan

130
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
You forgot that I am from the Xiao family

131
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,960
We are from the Xiao family

132
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,960
You will die

133
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
No

134
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Betray

135
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Betray the country

136
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
No

137
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
My sister was killed by the bandits

138
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
I have a bloody feud with the bandits

139
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
I will never betray the country

140
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
If I ascend the throne

141
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
I will not let Nanqing be humiliated

142
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
I will fight the country to the death

143
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
In fact, I have already prepared for the full

144
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
I can attack the palace at any time

145
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
The reason why the palace does not defend the land

146
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Is just that I don't want to hurt innocent lives

147
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
What is the reason for the palace defense?

148
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
What is the reason for the people of the city?

149
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
The soul army is on the road

150
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
The god is angry

151
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
The innocent people die

152
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
This is the result you want?

153
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
I promise you

154
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
I will never kill the innocent

155
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
I will treat the late emperor well

156
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Let him also be the emperor's identity and nourish the world

157
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
I will also make the decree in person

158
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
To marry you and Lu Zhao

159
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
This cooperation

160
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
With you, with me

161
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
With the people of the world

162
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
All 100 interests are not harmful

163
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
I will give you time to think

164
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
You are smart

165
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Know how to make a choice

166
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Situ Xian

167
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Situ Xian

168
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Is the sincerity I give you

169
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
I hope you will be sincere too

170
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Don't disappoint me

171
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Situ Xian

172
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
In the 9th year of Shuntai

173
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Songlou rebelled

174
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
The Qis were all killed

175
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
But Song's birth and death

176
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
And the Song family's inheritance

177
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
For the life of Mrs. Song

178
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
The dead are buried

179
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Songlou

180
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
It's really ridiculous

181
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Songlou

182
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Songlou

183
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Songlou

184
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Songlou
