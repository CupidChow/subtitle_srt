1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,800
She has changed since 2005 when she leased her

2
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,540
欧 votes until August 2014

3
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,300
她当 killed the general in CDC

4
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:58,980
肯定过去!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
and help A-Jing to take revenge with me.

6
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,560
You couldn't protect Xiao Jinyu back then.

7
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Now,

8
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,080
you can't protect Lu Zhao either.

9
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,040
You will always be

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,160
my subordinate and general.

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,080
You think I wouldn't kill you?

12
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
You dare?

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,840
Of course I dare.

14
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,160
Who do you think you are?

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,700
You have Xiao Jinyu's

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
You have nothing else to do.

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,480
But

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,440
if you kill me,

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,720
Lu Zhao

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,040
will also die.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,600
I have put poison in yin and yang long time ago.

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,880
When sheしい license for Private Familie of Chuanshanletter,

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,560
she fixed Siddiq eyes one by one.

24
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,360
She's poisoned now

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,200
and now she hides.

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,200
The only hope in the world has long been taken by me.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Until now, only he can suppress the poison every month with me.

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
You want to save Lu Zhao?

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Then you have to save me first.

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,200
And you have to personally send her to my bed!

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Today, maybe I'm in a good mood.

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm not afraid of you.

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
I'm not afraid of you.

34
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
I'm not afraid of you.

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
I'm not afraid of you.

36
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Maybe I'm in a good mood.

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I can use my power to defeat him and help him defend himself.

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Only then can he forcefully kill me.

39
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Otherwise...

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,080
The

41
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Get off!

42
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Who am I to you?

43
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Aren't you the most clear?

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
You just wait and see.

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
I know the woman I'm looking for.

46
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
I know the woman I'm looking for.

47
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
I know the woman I'm looking for.

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I'm the one who sent half of the evil spirits to Yan Luo Palace.

49
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,960
After you leave, I won't be alone.

50
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
I...

51
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
I...

52
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
I...

53
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
I...

54
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
I...

55
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
I...

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Today is the last day.

57
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
If I can't find the antidote, I'm afraid...

58
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Master!

59
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Ice breaking knife?

60
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,080
Ice breaking knife is only available in the northern border.

61
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
It's so far from the northern border.

62
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
How did you get it so fast?

63
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
I need an ice breaking knife.

64
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,080
I can finish the removal of the golden silkworm bone.

65
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,080
The golden silkworm bone can be used as a drug to cure hundreds of poisons.

66
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
But once it's used as a drug, it can't do anything but detoxify.

67
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,080
The poison in your body has been growing in your heart for a long time.

68
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,080
If you want to remove it, it will hurt.

69
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Once the golden silkworm bone is removed, you won't have the body of a man who can't feel pain.

70
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,080
I've been through the pain of losing it.

71
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,080
What else can hurt that day?

72
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,080
The golden silkworm bone was given to me by her.

73
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,080
The golden silkworm bone is just the source of the evil.

74
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Do it.

75
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Where am I?

76
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Do it yourself.

77
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
I can't help but feel sad.

78
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,080
I have no regrets in my life.

79
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I'm sorry.

80
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Hurry up and take the medicine.

81
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Okay, I understand.

82
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Don't be afraid.

83
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,080
You'll wake up soon.

84
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,080
I won't let you die.

85
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,080
By the order of the emperor, the king of Chu, Si Tu Xian,

86
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,080
colluded with the foreign tribes to rebel and held a great grudge against the emperor.

87
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
The emperor of Chu, Si Tu Xian,

88
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,480
was killed by the

89
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,080
emperor of Chu.

90
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,080
The emperor of Chu, Si Tu Xian,

91
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
was killed by the emperor of Chu.

92
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
It's all your fault.

93
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Si Tu Xian, it's all your fault.

94
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
You've hurt the emperor.

95
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
You're dead.

96
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,080
You're dead.

97
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
You have one more.

98
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,080
You have one more.

99
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,080
You're dead.

100
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,080
You're dead.

101
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,080
You're dead.

102
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Together.

103
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Come on.

104
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,080
I've already confiscated all the weapons before the villa was confiscated.

105
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Please rest assured.

106
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
Very good.

107
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
Your mission has been accomplished.

108
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
The Great Night is coming.

109
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
There's only one step left.

110
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,080
You mean the palace is not protected?

111
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,080
But only the leader of Xuntian Sect is qualified to preserve this map.

112
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Xiao Jingyu died suddenly.

113
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
He didn't have time to hand it over to Xiao Ren.

114
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Since Xiao Jingyu died, Xiao Ren has been holding on to Lu Zhao.

115
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
He didn't seek the palace to protect her.

116
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Xiao Ren only cares about Xiao Jingyu.

117
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,080
How could he suddenly kill Lu Zhao?

118
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,080
I've always thought it was strange.

119
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Since the collapse of the Great Night,

120
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
he has changed his surname to Qin.

121
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
He seems to have changed his name.

122
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
The Great Night

123
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Miss, you're finally awake.

124
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Man Zhu.

125
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
You're awake.

126
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,080
What's wrong with me?

127
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Why are you sleeping here?

128
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
It's all because of that bastard Si Tu Xian.

129
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Man Zhu...

130
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Si Tu Xian poisoned you.

131
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
I have to find the antidote for you.

132
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
I have to investigate the case of Chu Wangfu.

133
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,080
I'm too tired.

134
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
I'll sleep with you for a while.

135
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,080
How did you detoxify my poison?

136
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,080
You still don't believe my tricks?

137
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,080
It's not hard to get the antidote from a prince who's always been in love.

138
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Are you hurt?

139
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
No.

140
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Besides, I have golden bones.

141
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
It doesn't hurt even if I'm hurt.

142
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
By the way,

143
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
we have a conclusion on Chu Wangfu's case.

144
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,080
We found the letters of him and the gunmen from Chu Wangfu.

145
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,080
We also found the list of officials who colluded with Long Pao.

146
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,080
His Majesty ordered to take the throne and keep it for the rest of his life.

147
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Unfortunately...

148
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
What's unfortunate?

149
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Unfortunately, all your property was exchanged for military goods by Si Tu Xian.

150
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,080
He put all of these in the villa.

151
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
When we arrived,

152
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Jin Lin was burning himself.

153
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,080
If you could get that money,

154
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,080
you would have a more powerful man to fight against the gunmen.

155
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Let's not talk about this.

156
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm almost scared to death.

157
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
What's wrong?

158
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
I had a nightmare.

159
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
I...

160
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
I thought you were...

161
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
...murdered by many people.

162
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
I should have been by your side.

163
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
By your side.

164
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm sorry.

165
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
It was just a dream.

166
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,080
The flowers are falling.

167
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,480
The sound of the

168
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,080
heartbeats.

169
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Look.

170
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
You've protected me very well.

171
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,080
You didn't lose me.

172
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
You won't lose me either.

173
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
I'm afraid that I can't

174
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,080
bear the loneliness.

175
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
I'm waiting for you

176
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,080
through the years.

177
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,080
The night is like a flower shower.

178
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Snow white and shadow like a snow.

179
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:20,080
I miss you, I ask if we can be together.

180
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,080
I want to be with you in the world.

181
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,080
Farewell, hope to return.

182
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
The heart is with me.

183
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
From now on,

184
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,080
there is no more gap between us.

185
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
The rain is like a flower.

186
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,080
The flowers are still with you.

187
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Life and death are clear.

188
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Love and hate are separated.

189
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,080
The wind is like a rain.

190
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,080
The moon will always be with you.

191
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,080
I'm still waiting for you in the wind.

192
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
The rain is like a flower.

193
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
The flowers are still with you.

194
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,080
The flowers are still with you.

195
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
Life and death are clear.

196
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Love and hate are separated.

197
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Ah Zhao.

198
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Have you thought it through?

199
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,080
I've never regretted my life.

200
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,080
The years are like a flash in my life.

201
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
The wind is like a flower.

202
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080

218
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
The flowers are still with you.

219
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
The flowers are still with you.

220
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
The flowers are still with you.

221
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,080
The flowers are still with you.

222
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
The flowers are still with you.

223
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
The flowers are still with you.

224
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
The flowers are still with you.

225
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
The flowers are still with you.

226
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
The flowers are still with you.

227
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
The flowers are still with you.

228
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,080
The night is full of thorns.

229
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,080
I have been dreaming of you for a long time.

230
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,080
I have been thinking about you.

231
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,080
I can't help but feel sad.

232
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
The snow is falling.

233
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
The flowers are withering.

234
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,080
I hear the sound of the wind in my dream.

235
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,080
The spring is empty.

236
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,080
The past is buried in the city.

237
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Who is sleeping outside the door?

238
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,080
The eyes are full of tears.

239
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,080
The heart is in the dark.

240
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:26,080
I will meet you before the dawn.

241
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,080
The warm breeze is telling me to fall asleep.

242
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,080
Love is a curse.

243
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
It's a song.

244
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,080
The snow falls on the city.

245
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
The light is too bright.

246
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,080
I can't see the beautiful scenery.

247
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
The night is full of thorns.

248
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,080
I have been dreaming of you for a long time.

249
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
I have been thinking about you.

250
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,080
I can't help but feel sad.

251
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
The spring is empty.

252
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
The flowers are still with you.

253
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
The flowers are still with you.
