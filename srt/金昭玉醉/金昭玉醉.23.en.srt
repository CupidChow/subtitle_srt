the power rules

Zhang Yunlong?

19
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Your highness, you are really good at guessing.

20
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Lu Zhao really found out about it.

21
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,480
I followed your order and reminded him.

22
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
He has been searching for Tianmen for so long.

23
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,480
If he didn't find Xiao Ren was wrong,

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
then it's not a good thing.

25
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Your highness is wise.

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
I will go to the palace and find out the truth.

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
What do you want?

28
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
We have made a deal.

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
Please keep the letter.

30
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
How do I know it's true?

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
If it's true,

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,480
your wife was a good maid.

33
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Please tell me how you got her.

34
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Zhao and I are husband and wife.

35
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
She has no revenge against me.

36
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
I will go to the palace and find out the truth.

37
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
What's wrong?

38
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
The empress dowager's birthday is coming.

39
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
I have to go to the palace in person.

40
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,480
When can you find out the truth and give me a good reference?

41
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,480
I have already found it.

42
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,480
It's in the box on the shelf.

43
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
You can take it.

44
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Sleep a little longer.

45
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Zhao.

46
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
You are so cruel.

48
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,480
You are willing to cheat on my wife.

49
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
We have made a deal.

50
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Please don't bother me.

51
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Why are you so anxious?

52
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
To thank you,

53
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,480
I have prepared a surprise for you.

54
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Zhao.

55
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Why are you here?

56
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,480
To discuss a big deal with me.

57
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,480
I won't believe every word he said.

58
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I know that he is not a good man.

59
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
He is a good man.

60
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
He is a good man.

61
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
He is a good man.

62
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
He is a good man.

63
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,480
I know that there must be something difficult to say.

65
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
As long as you tell me the truth,

66
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
even if it's a bluff,

67
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
I will kill you.

68
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,480
Zhao.

69
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Listen to me.

70
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
I will explain to you later.

71
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,480
We have to leave the city now.

72
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
The show hasn't started yet.

73
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,480
How can the protagonist leave the city in advance?

74
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Be careful.

75
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Si Tuo Xing Yuan.

76
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
You are rude.

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,480
I never promised to let you leave.

78
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
It's time.

79
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
You still won't tell me what happened.

80
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
He is afraid that he doesn't have the courage to confess to you.

81
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
I can do it for him.

82
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Shut up.

83
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Ran.

84
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Zhao.

85
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Look at me.

86
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
I...

87
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
I am...

88
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
the son of Song Luo.

89
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
What did you say?

90
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Before the wedding,

91
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
you were in a panic because of this?

92
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Yes.

93
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
So,

94
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
you knew your identity.

95
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
But you hid it from me.

96
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
In order to lie to me about marrying you.

97
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Yes.

98
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,480
You confessed to Si Tuo Xing Yuan.

99
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
And you asked me to draw a map.

100
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
I am sorry.

101
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Why?

102
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Zhao.

103
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
I...

104
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Zhao.

105
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,480
I want to be with you.

106
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Zhao, I want to be with you forever.

107
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
I want to be with you forever.

108
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
You coward.

109
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
You betrayed me with the name of love.

110
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,480
You are not worthy to be my husband.

111
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Zhao.

112
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,480
You really want to kill me?

113
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
As the leader of Xuntian Sect,

114
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
you colluded with the thieves.

115
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
You are not loyal.

116
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
You are not loyal.

117
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
You are a traitor.

118
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
You are a life-and-death for the people.

119
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
You are a coward.

120
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
I raised you up.

121
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
You are sincere.

122
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
But you are a coward.

123
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
You are unfilial.

124
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
You are not worthy of me.

125
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
You are unfilial.

126
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
But you are ungrateful.

127
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
You are not worthy.

128
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,480
I am not worthy.

129
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,480
You are a coward.

130
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Zhao.

131
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Your Highness, it's time.

132
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
It's your turn to lead the party.

133
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Lu Zhao.

134
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
I was right.

135
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
You won't let me down.

136
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
Si Tu Xin Ren.

137
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
You are a bastard.

138
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,480
I will kill you sooner or later.

139
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Don't worry.

140
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
The day will come.

141
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,480
I will teach you a lesson.

142
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Stop.

143
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Si Tu Xin Ren.

144
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Do you dare to fight with me?

145
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Stop.

146
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Stop.

147
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Si Tu Xin Ren.

148
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Stop.

149
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
You bastard.

150
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Bastard.

151
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Get up.

152
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
What are you doing?

153
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Let's go.

154
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
There are many things to prepare for tomorrow's wedding.

155
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,480
I know you are busy these days.

156
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Because you told me when you were a kid.

157
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
You don't have to blame yourself.

158
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
You didn't break my wish.

159
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,480
You protected Xun Tian Men and me very well.

160
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Didn't we agree that we would not be siblings anymore?

161
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Since we are husband and wife,

162
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,480
we will face everything together.

163
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Just say what you want to say.

164
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
I am with you.

165
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,480
I am the son of Pan Zhen and Song Lou.

166
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:11,480
I am the only son of Lan Qing Pan Zhen and Xiao Jia Shi.

167
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Song Lou is my only son.

168
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
I am sorry.

169
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
I am sorry.

170
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
You know it all.

171
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Why didn't you tell me today?

172
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
I will spare your life.

173
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,480
I will kill you.

174
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
I will kill you.

175
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
I will kill you.

176
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
I will kill you.

177
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,480
I will be your person.
