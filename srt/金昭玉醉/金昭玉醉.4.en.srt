1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,720
Remember.

2
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:59,760
energizer

3
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
I will not force you to go back to the mansion.

4
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,520
You just need to write a letter to the Lu clan leader of Jiangnan

5
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,520
and ask him to give all the wealth of the Lu clan to me.

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,520
I may be able to give you a letter of divorce.

7
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
You're dreaming.

8
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
You're dreaming.

9
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
You're dreaming.

10
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
You're dreaming.

11
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
You're dreaming.

12
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
You're dreaming.

13
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Then don't blame me for not keeping you company.

14
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Baoqin!

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Don't move.

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Your maid is so bold.

17
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,520
She dares to break into the capital's mansion.

18
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Do you know who is the owner of the capital's mansion?

19
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,520
You're bullying me too much.

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Miss, don't blame me.

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,520
It's not the clan leader, it's the ancestor's family left by the old master and madam.

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,520
I don't want to be the culprit.

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Baoqin!

24
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Baoqin!

25
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Baoqin!

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Baoqin!

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Why?

28
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Why did you do this?

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Why?

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Baoqin!

31
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Mother!

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Mother! Father!

33
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Uncle hit me!

34
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Uncle, how could you do such a terrible thing to your daughter?

35
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Xun'er, it's my fault.

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Don't blame me.

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Daughter.

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
You...

39
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Tell me.

40
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,520
How did you recover your eyes?

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,520
It was the gods who opened my eyes.

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:56,520
They made me see your beautiful faces.

43
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,520
You bitch!

44
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,520
You're still talking when you're dead.

45
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Bitch!

46
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,520
You're still talking when you're dead.

47
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Ah-Zhuang.

48
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,520
If there's really a god in this world,

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
why are you here?

50
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Write a letter.

51
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,520
I'll give you a chance to live.

52
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Okay?

53
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,520
I won't let you succeed even if I die.

54
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
You're really a coward.

55
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,520
I think you're just drunk and can't drink.

56
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Ah-Zhuang.

57
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Why are you doing this?

58
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Why are you crying?

59
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
You're pregnant.

60
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Do you want this child to die without seeing the sun?

61
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Why do you want to do this?

62
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Yes.

63
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,520
I'm pregnant.

64
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Come.

65
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Write a letter.

66
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Sign it.

67
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,520
I'll keep you and your child safe.

68
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Untie.

69
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,520
Untie.

70
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Your Highness.

71
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
Your Highness.

72
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Hurry.

73
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Call for the doctor.

74
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Call for the doctor.

75
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Yes.

76
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
The child is gone.

77
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
How can I take care of it?

78
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Si Tu Xin.

79
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,520
You're cruel.

80
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,520
This child has your blood.

81
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,520
I think it will be in danger in the future.

82
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,520
You don't deserve to have my child.

83
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Don't think about it.

84
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,520
I'll take him to the hell.

85
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
You bitch.

86
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,520
You designed it.

87
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Bitch!

88
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Fu Yi.

89
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Where's Fu Yi?

90
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Fu Yi!

91
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Fu Yi!

92
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Princess Chu.

93
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,520
The rouge you put on yourself is not red enough.

94
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Let me see.

95
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
It's just right.

96
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
What?

97
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Sister Tang is not satisfied with the rouge I put on myself?

98
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
I forgot.

99
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,520
You were fed the medicine.

101
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
I can't talk.

102
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Even if you're not satisfied, you have to endure it.

103
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,520
The ice will be over soon.

104
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,520
After you untie the pendant, your birthday party will begin.

105
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,520
If the king can't receive your letter of lettering from you,

106
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,520
it will be hard to protect the lives of the Lu clan.

107
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Sister Tang.

108
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,520
You'd better behave yourself.

109
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
I'll go.

110
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,520
Sister.

111
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
I know everything.

112
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,520
We're not blood brothers.

113
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,520
I'm actually Ah Xun.

114
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,520
You used to protect me.

115
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Now I'm here to protect you.

116
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Don't worry.

117
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I'll pay back every drop of your blood and every pain you've suffered.

118
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,520
No one can separate us.

119
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Even if we're to die.

120
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,520
The rebirth technique requires a personal skill.

121
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,520
You have to use your blood to lure the soul.

122
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,520
If you succeed, a blood-colored orchid will appear on her body.

123
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Then she'll come back to life.

124
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
This is a counter-measure.

125
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Whether you succeed or not, you'll pay a huge price.

126
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
You'll live or die without regret.

127
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Have you thought it through?

128
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
If you can return my sister,

129
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,520
what if I run to the netherworld?

130
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Let's begin.

131
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
Your Highness.

132
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Your Highness.

133
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Rumors are spreading.

134
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Princess Consort is not of a noble background.

135
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
She's also a mother.

136
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
You treat her like a treasure.

137
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Now, in order to celebrate her birthday,

138
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
you've built this Zhaoyue Tower.

139
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,520
You're indeed the best man in Yingdu.

140
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Chu Wei, don't try to get rid of me.

141
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I'm ashamed to say this.

142
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
I was too cold today.

143
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
I'm sorry for my loss.

144
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,520
I'm really sorry for my lack of care.

145
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Your Highness, Princess Consort is here.

146
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,520
Greetings, Princess Consort.

147
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Princess Consort.

148
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Princess Consort.

149
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Princess Consort.

150
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Princess Consort.

151
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Thank you, Miss Liu.

152
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Don't force me to break your legs.

153
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Let's go.

154
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Everyone,

155
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,040
let's drink this cup

156
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,320
to the Princess Consort.

157
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,240
Congratulations, Princess Consort!

158
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,640
May you live a long and happy life!

159
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
My lords,

160
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,880
the King of Chu has tried to rebel

161
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,680
to deceive our Lu family's property.

162
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,640
He has been hunting down our horses and harboring hatred against us.

163
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,600
Today,

164
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,080
I risk my life to tell you this.

165
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
I beg Your Majesty

166
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,680
to help us, my lords.

167
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
I've already poisoned him.

168
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,800
How can he still talk?

169
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,760
Go on.

170
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,520
I swear

171
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,800
to help my father, A Jie.

172
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,800
I'm willing to sacrifice everything for the family.

173
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,640
If you don't agree to marry me,

174
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,800
I will travel the world

175
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,680
and spend my life with you.

176
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,720
No!

177
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,040
Situ Xian,

178
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,800
you're trying to rebel!

179
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,000
You're guilty of treason!

180
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,120
Are you still going to keep your mouths shut?

181
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,120
Speak!

182
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,840
Speak!

183
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,360
Zhao,

184
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,520
I've specially prepared a birthday banquet for you.

185
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,760
Do you think

186
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,000
no one can enter

187
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,840
the banquet?

188
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
You're so stupid and pitiful.

189
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,280
You're so disobedient.

190
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
You should know

191
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,520
that disobedient people

192
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,720
have to pay a price.

193
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,520
Situ Xian,

194
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,480
what are you trying to do?

195
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,160
I want you to learn a lesson.

196
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,920
The Lu family is a hundred times more dangerous than humans.

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You know that.

198
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,120
But it's all in your mind.

199
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,960
You only know

200
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,560
that I can inherit the Lu family's property

201
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,120
after I turn 18.

202
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,360
But you don't know

203
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,240
that if I die,

204
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,760
all the property in the Lu family

205
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
will be handed over to the state.

206
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,000
How dare you, who матoo lose the honor of your 60-year standing?

207
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,800
What are you doing?

208
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,200
Your Highness!

209
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,400
Let's get him!

210
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,120
The crab colours dry up on the sea as the star turns wild.

211
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,360
The wine sprinkled for Three Since Swillsky Fours becomes Siram gdziene ...

212
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,520
Chang sacar and burned!

213
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,720
Go, go!
