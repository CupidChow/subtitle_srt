1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,200
 The K2 

2
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,940
 The K2 

3
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:47,700


4
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,040
 I was falsely accused of murdering Raniya and arrested,   
  

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,400
 but luckily, I escaped within a week.   
  

6
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,030
Also ... I'm concerned about that banner worker.  
  

7
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,600
That guy, so uselessly, saw me right in the face.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,940
Banner hanger? 
  

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,980
 

10
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,160
You are saying you lost track of the banner hanger in the end?

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,080
 Anna is the only means I have to control Jang Se Jin. If something bad happens to Anna, from a bad accident or whatever  

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,750
 

13
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,220
 If something bad happens to that child,  

14
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,710
 everything that Choi Yoo Jin built up during her lifetime will collapse in a single moment. 

15
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,750
You're all grown up.

16
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,040
You're pretty as you resemble your mom. 
  

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,380
- Devil.  
 - Who?  Me?

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,360
I remembered everything.

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,070
Mom did not commit suicide.

20
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,630
 

21
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,550
If I come a second time, you who will die.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,620
 

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,160
This is the second meeting that I told you about.

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,500
Shoot!

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,600
Shoot! Shoot! 
  

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,920
Kill her already! Kill her!

27
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,030
 

28
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,640
 

29
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,400
 But an enemy's enemy is a friend, isn't it? 

30
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,920
 And if he appropriate time arrives, 

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,660
 JSS will be your gun.   
 

32
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,180
You have to be the bullet.

33
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,180
I will pull the trigger.

34
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,740
This is Agent Kim Jae Ha who will work in the VIP team.

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,300
His caller ID will be K2. 
  

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,800
What are you looking for? 
  

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,150
  Oh, ramen ... 

38
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,000
 

39
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:18,000
 But this child read my heart and mind. 

40
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,930
  But ... the child didn't need my command or permission. 
  

41
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,110
 He wasn't a hunting dog. He is a wolf.  

42
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,060
 I probably won't be able to tame him.] 

43
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,790
 Dad, I think I'm lost. 

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,300
 Please come get me.  
  

45
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,560
Really?  My dad sent me this?

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,540
 I think she realized that she was the one who was bothersome to her father, 

47
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,800
 and she tried to take care of it by eating strawberries. 

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,510
 Anna, you can't.  Please don't die. 
   

49
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,780
Your father will never show up in front of you.

50
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,440
To you your father must have been all you're living for,

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,700
but you're not everything to your father. 
  

52
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,300
Promise me that you will protect Anna until the end.

53
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,740
I will.

54
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,420
  Anna is a hostage. 

55
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,540
  I must have the most power in order to save her.  

56
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,260
I missed you, Dad.

57
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,650
- Why did you bring my dad? 
 - So you don't die.

58
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,230
My father is  ...

59
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,370
You can't.

60
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,200
 Anna is now in your hands.   
  

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,030
 I'll be protecting you from now on. 

62
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,370
 I'm going to make sure no one messes with you. 

63
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,380
- Miss. Miss. 
 - Anna!

64
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,290
Please stop.  My child is sick. 
  

65
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,950
Anna, Anna, are you okay?

66
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,010
Are you okay? 
 - Yeah, I'm okay.

67
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,090
  
  Thank you. 

68
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,040
If it's brother-in-law's child, then wouldn't she obviously be my niece? 
  

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,560
You can't.

70
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,420
J4.

71
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,290
 So, you protect Anna by my side. 

72
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,700
It's war.

73
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,800
Come alone.  Or else Anna will be in danger. 
  

74
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,900
Hey, where are they?

75
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,180
 I know the big secret that Anna is brother-in-law's biological daughter.   
 

76
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,210
 So if Anna is by my side, my sister won't be able to take JB easily. 

77
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,270
What took you so long?

78
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,730
♫  When I see you my heart hurts  ♫

79
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,500
♫  What good does that do to my heart  ♫

80
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,200
♫  The closer I apprach the farther away I am  ♫

81
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:31,030
♫  Seeing you is to painful for me.  ♫

82
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,000
♫  Saying it's okay I keep trying  ♫

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,120
♫  to comfort my heart  ♫

84
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,080
♫  When it's very difficult.  ♫

85
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,290
♫  Every so often I used to cry silently  ♫

86
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:58,590
♫  Every so often I used to think about you  ♫

87
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,880
♫  On the road I walked with you like a fool  ♫

88
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,370
♫  I'm standing by myself  ♫

89
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,510
♫  As usual I'm calling out your name again  ♫

90
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,870
 This is Anna. K2, respond to me, over. 

91
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,060
This is K2. Go ahead, over.

92
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,220
Shoot.

93
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,450
I forgot to say sleep tight, over.

94
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,040
I guess you're right.

95
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,490
Sleep well, over.

96
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,670
Kim Jae Ha,

97
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,820
good night.

98
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,750
Go Anna,

99
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,480
good night.

100
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:36,270
 Episode 10 

101
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,490
This is the first time you'll get this much skill.

102
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,190
If I hadn't become a body guard, I would've been a makeup artist.

103
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,800
This is my first time wearing makeup.

104
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,300
I mean, it's not like makeup is the only 'first' you'll have.

105
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,850
What else do I have to do?

106
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,720
You have to have a first kiss too.

107
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,760
First kiss?

108
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,270
Yeah, first kiss.

109
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,430
I've already had my first kiss.

110
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,870
No! That's CPR! How is CPR a first kiss?

111
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,620
Oh, how funny!

112
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,210
A kiss is not merely two lips touching.

113
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,280
A kiss is is more like—

114
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,300
I know too! Kissing! So then have you ever kissed?

115
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,810
Oh? I've had countless kisses! Even yesterday I...

116
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,880
Yesterday? When? With who?

117
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,710
No, I mean yesterday... yesterday!

118
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,580
Anyway, there's something like that.

119
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,690
Miss, you should know that I'm giving K2 to you.

120
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,080
Giving? K2?

121
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,060
Yes, of course.  It's a bit of a shame to give him to you.

122
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:59,320
Kim Jae Ha? If I had given my all and seduced him, it'd be a huge fuss!

123
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,320
Please stop pouting.

124
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,260
And throw away the naive thought that CPR is kissing.

125
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:19,760
I'll make kissable lips with this magic lipstick.

126
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,830
Ta-da!

127
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,880
Where is K2?

128
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,790
Miss, what are you doing all of a sudden?

129
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,750
- You haven't seen K2? 
 - He left early this morning.

130
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,610
Oh, he left?

131
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,380
Okay.

132
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,140
 I'll meet with Madam to make sure that she doesn't chase after Anna anymore. 

133
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,060
 Will that work? 

134
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,960
 Be careful, Jae Ha. 

135
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,240
♬  Come, please me   ♬

136
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,170
♬ They beckon to you for me  ♬

137
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,900
♬ In the moonlight  ♬

138
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,700
♬ Come to me, beloved  ♬

139
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,060
♬ They beckon to you for me  ♬

140
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,190
What is this?

141
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,970
♬ Beloved, hear me  ♬

142
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,360
Jeez.

143
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,890
♬ My songs beckon softly  ♬

144
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,950
Hello?

145
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,860
- Kim Jae Ha, did you see the picture?
-Yeah, I saw it.

146
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,820
Unni Mi Ran did my makeup. How does it look?

147
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,040
Yeah, it's pretty.

148
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,560
He said it's pretty! It's pretty!

149
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,360
See? See? I told you it's pretty!

150
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,290
- Kim Jae Ha.
   - Yeah, I'm listening. 

151
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,150
- You're now mine. 
 - What?

152
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,040
Since Mi Ran gave you to me, you're now mine. You know what I'm saying?

153
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,060
What are you say—

154
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,740
Yeah, do whatever you want.

155
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,940
So make sure that you be careful today and don't get hurt.

156
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,660
Alright.

157
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,360
Anna? Is she happy?

158
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,230
Yes.

159
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,980
That's a relief.

160
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,980
When is she coming back?

161
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,920
There are a lot of watching eyes. You need to control your expression.

162
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,210
That son of a b****. This means that he's not going to let go of Anna.

163
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,500
Today is a live broadcast. You must be relaxed.

164
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,150
This is the last interview regarding Anna. Utilize the media team

165
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,200
and make sure anything else regarding Anna is blocked.

166
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,890
They've already been mobilized. She will soon be forgotten.

167
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,430
Then Anna is completely in Chairman Choi's hands.

168
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,490
Now I'm getting curious about what Chairman Choi will do.

169
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,840
He said that he was also going to use Anna to try and stop his older sister.

170
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,150
I guess that could happen, at least until the presidential election.

171
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:46,360
But what if Assemblyman Jang and Madam end up winning the election?

172
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,770
Then, will they leave Anna in Chairman Choi's hands? The President and the First Lady?

173
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,270
And does Chairman Choi not know of all of this?

174
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,390
Right now, Anna is not Chairman Choi's shield.

175
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:06,620
She's more like a powerful knife against Madam Choi Yoo Jin.

176
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,500
Hello

177
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,700
- Did you sleep well last night? 
 - Yes.

178
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,060
Why? Is there something bad going on?

179
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,950
No, not exactly. I've been thinking about something recently.

180
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,900
Whether or not I should show you this.

181
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,590
What is it?

182
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,900
I think showing you is the right thing to do.

183
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,750
This is a police report... on your mother's case.

184
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,680
 Investigation Report of  Eom Hye Rin's Death 

185
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,360
More than anything else, this is the burning curiosity in everyone's mind.

186
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,170
How did you become Go Anna's guardian?

187
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,940
I... was Anna's mother-

188
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,760
Eom Hye Rin's close friend.

189
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,600
Actually, when I was younger and working at JB,

190
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,300
we met as an advertising company employee and as a campaign model.

191
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,490
Oh, that's what happened. It makes sense,

192
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,350
because Eom Hye Rin used to be the star of commercials.

193
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,130
Yes. We got close under those circumstances,

194
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,560
and later she met someone from my company-

195
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,270
the movie director Go Joon Ho.

196
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,310
She later married him, right?

197
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:44,100
Oh, then it looks like you match-made them.

198
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,490
I wouldn't call it matchmaking, but

199
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,480
it is a fact those two did meet because of me.

200
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,250
You just used "because of me",

201
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:01,240
is that because the two eventually divorced?

202
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,100
Yes. Honestly, back then

203
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,760
I was truly hurt and miserable.

204
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,730
I felt that it was my fault they met...

205
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,790
So that's why you took responsibility for Anna- the thing that came out of their relationship.

206
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,400
Yes.

207
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,660
Gosh,

208
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,960
I guess we finally see your tears.

209
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,630
We'll pause here for a word from our sponsors.

210
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,790
Yes, we'll go into commercial break!

211
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,310
Ji Hyeon,

212
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,390
Wouldn't it have been better to not cut off this kind of emotional scene with commercial?

213
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
Should I have?

214
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:07,770
Sorry, Unni. It must have been hard to show tears.

215
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,580
Unni, but back then were you working at JB?

216
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,520
What?

217
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,840
Back then, weren't you studying abroad?

218
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,060
I was going back and forth.

219
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,560
Really?

220
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,440
Back then, my brother-in-law worked at JB, but he didn't know you.

221
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,060
What would simple employees know?

222
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,140
He was the President.

223
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:04,900
Ji Hyeon, shall we just stick to the script?

224
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,100
Why?

225
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,910
Because of my son?

226
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,840
Alright everyone! We'll go back on!

227
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,830
My son is overseas.

228
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,070
Will he be cut off from his mother,

229
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,000
and have to roam around for a decade from now?

230
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,210
Cue!

231
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,170
Here in the studio, we're having a conversation with Mrs. Choi Yoo Jin.

232
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:47,230
After the late Eom Hye Rin came back from America after her divorce,

233
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,340
were the two of you still in contact?

234
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,530
Madam?

235
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,240
Yeah?

236
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,900
Ah... yeah... we did.

237
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:12,800
Seeing her slowly deteriorating broke my heart.

238
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,660
As it progressed, she ended her own life sadly, right?

239
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,130
Yes.

240
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,600
Had I pay more attention,

241
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,920
perhaps, I could have it stopped...

242
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,950
Then with that connection,

243
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,830
you took in Anna who was left alone and took care of her?

244
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,990
Yes.

245
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,370
But I guess

246
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:44,390
you didn't know at all that Mr. La Felt was desperately looking for Anna, did you?

247
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,200
Of course, I didn't know.

248
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,510
Perhaps Eom Hye Rin knew Mr. La Felt?

249
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,770
Mr. La Felt?

250
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,070
Of course not.

251
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,490
Of course. If they did,

252
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:04,990
you'd have known about that since you kept in touch with Eom Hye Rin all that time, right?

253
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,240
Of course.

254
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,200
It'd been great if Anna could have joined us today.

255
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,580
She seemed to be ill on the news screen yesterday.

256
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,990
You said my child is ill, right?

257
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:24,460
I did. She is suffering from a panic disorder.

258
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,400
Due to her long illness, her sociophobia became worse.

259
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,500
Her condition must be serious.

260
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,620
Yeah, a bit...

261
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,200
So ... she doesn't go out of the house at all...

262
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,860
I see.

263
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,300
But then, who are you and I?

264
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:53,800
Today, a surprise guest we invited has come to our studio.

265
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,360
Miss Go Anna! Please come out.

266
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,490
You are joking, right?

267
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,330
Maybe...

268
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:13,270
♬ Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out ♬

269
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,590
Welcome, Miss Anna!

270
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:26,000
♬ Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out ♬

271
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,600
♬ Watch out for the Witch ♬

272
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,930
♬ The Witch ♬

273
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:41,100
♬ Watch out for the witch ♬

274
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,720
♬ The witch ♬

275
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,520
♬ The good, the good, the good Lord ♬

276
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,270
Glad to meet you, Anna.

277
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,220
Hello.

278
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,990
Is the lighting okay with you?

279
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,060
Yeah, thank you.

280
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,730
You were surprised, right Madam? Say hello to each other.

281
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,500
Yeah.

282
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,240
You came.

283
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,530
Yes, Ahjumma.

284
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,200
Did you not know all this time that Mr. La felt was desperately looking for you?

285
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,660
No, I didn't know.

286
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,060
Then you didn't know who Mr. La Felt is, either?

287
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,360
No, I knew of him.

288
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,090
When I was younger,

289
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,470
When I was young, my mother sometimes told me about him.

290
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,800
Really? Was your mother a fan of Mr. La Felt?

291
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,800
No. I heard he was one of the close people she knew when she was in Paris.

292
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:52,400
Yet the Madam told us Eom Hye Rin didn't know Mr. La Felt at all, didn't you?

293
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,140
Ah, yeah...

294
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,400
Now, while we are on the subject,

295
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,050
we just got a surprising video letter from an amazing person

296
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,140
for Anna. Aren't you curious?

297
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,020
Shall we take a look?

298
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,400
 Hello my sweetheart.  You already know who I am. 

299
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,140
 I am Jean Paul La Felt. 

300
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,440
 I've been looking for you for a long time.  Do you know?   I've been shocked twice because of you. 

301
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,390
 First time, when I saw you for the first time.  

302
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,970
 My friend, my muse Eom Hye Rin.  

303
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,490
 I thought she was back from the dead. And the second time was, when I finally met you.  

304
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,570
 When I learned you were Eom Hye Rin's daughter. 

305
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,890
 Anna, could you become my falling star? 

306
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,050
 Would you become my new muse?  

307
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,160
 Here, your paradise awaits you. Please, hurry up.  

308
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,700
 I'll wait for you here.  Bye 

309
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:51,200
Wow! The fact that Eom Hye Rin was Jean Paul La Felt's muse

310
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,810
is being revealed for the first time, it seems.

311
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,640
My, this is amazing.

312
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,760
Actually in the fashion industry,

313
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,330
they say if you are liked by La Felt, you are guaranteed to be a successful model.

314
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,800
When are you planning to go to Paris?

315
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,000
I have no plan.

316
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,960
Yeah?

317
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,300
Even though I should treat my panic disorder first,

318
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,160
I have something I need to take care of first.

319
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,130
So wait? Wow!

320
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,830
Indeed, you are the daughter of Eom Hye Rin who

321
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,330
was called Korea's pride. Amazing.

322
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,070
Not at all.

323
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,140
But you just mentioned you need to take care of something aside from the treatment.

324
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,270
Just what is that something that even Mr. Lafelt has to wait?

325
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:04,270
I want to solve the mystery of my mother, Eom Hye Rin's death.

326
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,470
If you are saying mystery about Eom Hye Rin's death,

327
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,730
are you saying you can't accept her suicide?

328
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,750
Anna.

329
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,830
No. It's not that kind of matter.

330
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,470
Then what...?

331
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:37,430
If my mother committed suicide, then I want to know why she committed suicide.

332
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,300
At the time, she wasn't interested in popularity and she wasn't having financial difficulties, either.

333
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,720
She even got my passport just before she died.

334
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,130
On that day, my mother

335
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,430
even booked flights to America for both of us.

336
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,330
But...

337
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,920
But  that night ...

338
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,740
my mother died.

339
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,170
She didn't even leave a suicide note.

340
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,500
That's why

341
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,660
why my mom died

342
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,800
I want to know.

343
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:53,280
I see.  That's an understandable curiosity to have from your point of view.

344
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:02,050
Perhaps Madam Choi since you were close with Eom Hye Rin at the time,

345
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,480
do you have anything to tell Anna such as the conversations you've had with her mother.

346
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,360
I'm not sure.

347
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,490
First of all,

348
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,260
around the time of her death,

349
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,020
I would like know her life.

350
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,480
If anyone who knew my mother personally or had conversation with her at the time,

351
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,650
please call me. I am asking.

352
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,040
This is a bit suspicious.

353
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,180
By chance, did someone kill her?

354
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,210
Something is fishy.

355
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,720
Anna. Are you out of your mind?

356
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,540
Why show up suddenly in front of the people who are desperately trying to capture you?

357
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:19,020
Was it you, Chairman? I am asking if it was you who arranged this broadcast?

358
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,380
I told him I want to do it.

359
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,760
I want to rip off Choi Yoo Jin's mask.

360
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,660
If my uncle didn't stop me...

361
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,560
I'll be back.

362
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,630
Anna. What's up with you, for the love of Pete?

363
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,030
I want to revenge Choi Yoo Jin. My uncle will help us.

364
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:51,800
And... I know you'll keep me safe.

365
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,630
Madam, are you alright?

366
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,680
All this time,

367
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,750
I think I was mistaken.

368
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,600
You should've killed her.

369
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,420
I know, right?

370
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,800
I should've listened to you.

371
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,170
My mother didn't die sleeping comfortably after taking pills.

372
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:10,930
She died struggling in agonizing pain to the point of breaking her fingernails.

373
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,220
Stop smiling and just spill it.

374
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,530
You got something, don't you?

375
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,290
This isn't something you share in

376
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,120
the office with coffee.

377
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,160
I got it. I'll treat you grandly with a 40-year-old booze.

378
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,880
Sunbae, consider yourself lucky for having a hoobae like me.

379
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,550
I know. Hurry and spill the bean.

380
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,800
Sunbae, now you should get insurance from me.

381
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,890
Jang Se Joon is finished.

382
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:59,480
Forget the prelude and tell me why? Why is he finished?

383
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,820
Is that true?!

384
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,250
Oh, right!

385
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,120
These team leaders will give you the wings to fly, Barcelona Angel.

386
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,290
This is Team Leader Shin Jeong Hui who'll take care your fashion, hair and makeup.

387
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,220
Team Leader Kim Yoon Hui for media.

388
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,830
Manager Baek for security detail.

389
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,070
Madam, the Assemblyman will be released this afternoon.

390
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,460
Congratulations, Madam.

391
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,980
Today's makeup is to welcome him?

392
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,720
Yeah.

393
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,440
How nice it must be for the Assemblyman.

394
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,430
Having this beautiful woman as his wife.

395
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:44,330
The thing that I reported earlier today, I ordered to be taken care of before the Assemblyman is released.

396
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,420
I still

397
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:11,410
think we should leave Jae Ha alone. He might be of use later.

398
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,490
Plus the email issue...

399
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,130
I understand.

400
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,010
I'll bring the warm coffee.

401
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,920
I thought chairmen are very busy making money.

402
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,770
I guess you have a lot of free time.

403
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,350
Servants make the money.

404
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,350
Then what do the chairmen do?

405
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,630
Us? We fight wars.

406
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:59,370
We build castles, take castles and expand our territories.

407
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,800
Once you expand the territories, the servants start to farm again.

408
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,160
That's why we fight wars, endlessly.

409
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,080
I guess you are right.

410
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:13,070
Anna to you is not a shield to protect yourself but a sword to attack Choi Yoo Jin.

411
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,920
Oh~ not bad. Where did you hear that?

412
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,790
That's right. I hope Anna will succeed in avenging her mother.

413
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,860
Then I can keep JB. Is that wrong?

414
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,070
Justice will be served, and I keep my castles.

415
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,630
Is that why you showed her mother's death report containing shocking photos

416
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,850
to Annao on purpose while she's suffering from panic disorder?

417
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,660
Eh? I think you are mistaken.

418
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:49,290
Take a look. The woman you love is no longer a child.

419
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,790
Take a look.

420
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,460
She needs someone who'll give her wings.

421
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,340
I guess you don't know your sister that well despite being around her all your life.

422
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,370
If you did,

423
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:20,090
If you did, you wouldn't have risked the danger of bringing her to the studio today.

424
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,570
Let's go one more time, Anna.

425
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,340
Relax.

426
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,830
- Little more. 
- Relax, relax.

427
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,620
Not bad.

428
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,510
Relax a bit more.

429
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,150
This one is good. That's right.

430
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:47,190
She is improving a lot.

431
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,690
Be natural.

432
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,260
Just lean on it slightly.

433
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,130
Next one is sitting on different chair.

434
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,450
Okay. Okay.

435
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,760
Chairman.

436
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,830
I tried to work with it.

437
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:04,350
But it'll be difficult to get commercial quality without the flash.

438
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,020
Let's just do her portfolio today.

439
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:11,000
Photographer Hwang, give me an hour. I'll have a talk with them.

440
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,670
Okay.

441
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,860
Let's eat first. I made a reservation near here.

442
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,570
Wow!

443
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,590
Let's go, I am hungry.

444
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,930
Anna.

445
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,160
Ah, you go to eat, too Mi Ran.

446
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,030
Okay, I will.

447
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,130
I got this from Dr. Lee in the hospital. It's for treating anxiety.

448
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,160
It's effective if you take it an hour before the situation that might bring your panic attack.

449
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,200
There's a medicine like that?

450
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,430
Of course. Time has changed.

451
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,370
Take this and let's give it another try.

452
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:57,640
And let's see if we can use the flash or not, too.

453
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,400
Okay.

454
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,030
Okay.

455
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,040
What is this?

456
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,880
Medicine for panic disorder. He said he got it from the hospital.

457
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,480
Why would Chairman give you this? Things of this nature, you should get it yourself.

458
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,530
It's not like my uncle would give me weird medicine.

459
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,170
If so, would you have taken it?

460
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,220
That's true, but---

461
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,720
Let's go to the waiting room. He said I need to wait an hour after taking it.

462
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,810
I hope this works. Right?

463
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,180
Hold on. What's your business?

464
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,880
I am to deliver flowers to Go Anna.

465
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,460
You can give that to me.

466
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,870
That won't do.

467
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,950
J4. J4.

468
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,720
 Service unavailable 

469
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,150
Anna, get up.

470
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:13,350
Why? What's up?

471
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,800
Go through up there and run go outside first.

472
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,460
What?

473
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:24,090
Weird people barged in here. I think you'd be in danger if you stayed. Let's go out.

474
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,420
How can I go?

475
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,870
It's okay, you can go out.

476
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,620
I am to go alone? Then what about you?

477
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,090
Don't worry about me. I'll walk out.

478
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,230
Then I won't go, either. I'll go with you.

479
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,430
Anna, listen carefully. Right now, suspicious people

480
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,520
out there are spraying sleeping gas. Do you know what that means?

481
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,370
Gas? Poisonous gas?

482
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:48,120
You know I fight good, right? I'll take care of this, so you go out first.

483
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,130
That's why I am going with you!

484
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,490
Anna. If we go together, I am at disadvantage because I have to protect you.

485
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,380
Don't lie. How can you fight in that?

486
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,170
You are trying to get me out. Let's go together Jae Ha.

487
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,840
- Anna, we don't have time. 
- I won't go alone!

488
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,800
ANNA, please... listen to me.  I'm begging you.

489
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,420
If we are together, we'll both die.

490
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,850
Go. Climb up.

491
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,020
Yes.

492
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,230
Put me to Madam.

493
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,880
Madam is busy right now. Talk to me.

494
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,390
So it was you.

495
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,700
The people you sent here, stop them right now.

496
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,340
Why? I don't like you like certain someone

497
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,430
nor do am I concerned about Anna's father.

498
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,900
 Madam becoming indecisive is all because of you. 

499
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:36,620
Everything was in order and peaceful before you showed up.

500
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,960
Now it's time to put me and Madam back to the original place.

501
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,530
To the places of dead and living.

502
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:51,860
You just wait a bit until I get there.

503
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,330
Jae Ha.

504
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,990
Jae Ha, wake up!

505
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:44,320
Wake up Jae Ha!

506
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,470
Jae Ha! Jae Ha, wake up!

507
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:52,320
Jae Ha, wake up! Jae Ha!

508
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,080
Jae Ha! Jae Ha, wake up!

509
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,830
Jae Ha!

510
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,230
Jae Ha, please.

511
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,300
Jae Ha, please.

512
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:48,340
Jae Ha.

513
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,030
Jae Ha.

514
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,000
Wake up Jae Ha.

515
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,850
What happened!

516
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,860
Uh, Miss!

517
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:28,000
We believe Assemblyman Jang Se Joon!

518
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,920
We believe! We believe!

519
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,850
What's with the investigation?!

520
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,960
What's with it?! What's with it?!

521
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,060
We believe Assemblyman Jang Se Joon!

522
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,700
We believe! We believe!

523
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,530
Shall we go out now?

524
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,770
Let's do that, Sunbae.

525
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,900
I'll go finish the paperwork and be back.

526
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,300
Okay.

527
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,080
We believe Assemblyman Jang Se Joon!

528
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,730
We believe! We believe!

529
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,460
Assemblyman is not guilty!

530
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,430
Not guilty! Not guilty!

531
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,830
Wake up Prosecution Office!

532
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,500
What happened to Anna?

533
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,640
Not guilty!

534
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,760
Not yet...

535
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,760
This is so wrong! Wrong!

536
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,920
 Assemblyman Jang Se Joon!   

537
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:39,280
What's taking them so long?

538
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,970
 Breaking news! Soon there will be an important press release relating to Assemblyman Jang Se Joon by the prosecutor. 

539
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:49,920
 We'll continue with the news as the press release comes out. 

540
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,020
He's coming out!

541
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,110
Hurry!

542
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,090
Let's go check it out.

543
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,520
Let's go!

544
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,930
Assemblyman Jang Se Joon was scheduled to be released today.

545
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,900
But as a new charge was discovered while checking the seized material,

546
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,770
his release is canceled due to further investigation.

547
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,590
That's all.

548
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,900
What is the new charge?

549
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,500
 The prosecutor's office cancelled Assemblyman Jang Se Joon's release due to the new discovery of evidence. 

550
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,470
Is the new charge serious one?

551
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,890
Please tell up!

552
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,700
 The prosecutor's office cancelled Assemblyman Jang Se Joon's release due to the new discovery of evidence. 

553
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,970
Give us just one comment.

554
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:51,050
Do you think he'll be arrested?

555
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,430
What is Assemblyman Jang Se Joon's current state?

556
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,110
If anything comes up, then the arrest warrant will be issued, right?

557
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,860
Uh, majority party members!

558
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,300
Hurry!

559
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:06,890
Mr. Assemblyman, please give us a few minutes.

560
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,200
Assemblyman, you need to go to a general investigation room.

561
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,940
- Seong Gyu. 
- Uh.

562
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,890
Let's go to the safe house.

563
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:30,640
Uh?

564
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,550
I think the safe house is the safest. Chief Kim won't attack JSS.

565
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:39,180
Uh, let's do that. I'll send a team of guards.

566
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,960
Let's go.

567
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,900
Yes, Manager, it's me.

568
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,810
What?

569
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,940
Keep going.

570
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,990
While they are applying for a warrant, I will apply for a restraining order.

571
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:19,450
But without knowing the charge,

572
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,930
it's not easy to block their sudden attack.

573
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,720
What the heck are you talking about?!

574
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,090
If you can't even block this measly attack, then why did I raise you attorneys for?

575
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:32,460
I am sorry, Madam.

576
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,470
In situations like this, the political decision is more than law and evidence--

577
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:40,910
Shut up! Either you sweet talk or threaten  the judge,

578
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:44,150
just stop the arrest. What about the finance team?

579
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:46,130
Yes, Madam.

580
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:49,540
Is there any mistake on the documents submitted?

581
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,620
Absolutely not. It's 100% perfect.

582
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:57,210
Okay, hang up.

583
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,200
What about the President's secretary?

584
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,240
He's still on the phone.

585
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:15,760
Just try to understand my loyal heart

586
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,800
tried to prevent a profiteer, such as Jang Se Joon, from joining our party.

587
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:25,420
Assemblyman Park, are you threatening the President?

588
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,300
Pardon? Gosh.

589
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,590
How can it be a threat?

590
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:34,150
I just wish to meet and discuss with Mr. President

591
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:37,860
what I should do in this situation

592
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,620
where there is pressure on me,

593
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,640
Mr. President may get hurt as well in return.

594
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,450
Assemblyman Park, are you really that afraid of Assemblyman Jang joining the party?

595
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:53,890
Ah, yes I am afraid. Of course, I am afraid.

596
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:57,220
It's like a nobleman is fighting with a lowly person

597
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:02,130
holding each other's topknot, so how can I not be afraid?

598
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:11,240
Then... what more do you want me to do?

599
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:16,520
These days,

600
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,270
Recently I heard there are a lot of nice carp fish coming out of Uiyang Dam.

601
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:25,260
Why don't you pick a nice spot with scenery and keep fishing there.

602
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:29,820
After my election is over, I'll get you a nice spot

603
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:33,150
in the center to cast your rod.

604
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,280
I am hanging up to tend my business.

605
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,240
Welcome!

606
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:50,310
Party Leader! I almost died.

607
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,190
Aigoo welcome my kids.

608
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,560
Good job enduring it.

609
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:59,190
Daddy! They hit me.

610
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,160
They hit you?

611
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,450
What bastard hit you?

612
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,770
Good job. Good job.

613
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,950
Good job.

614
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:11,020
Ahjumma! Bring some tofu here!

615
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,200
Come in. Come in.

616
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,970
Come in.

617
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:19,270
Let's give them applause.

618
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:21,390
Party Leader.

619
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,690
A few members of Progressive Party

620
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:28,020
are hanging around the entrance.

621
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,720
They've read the sign of shifting power.

622
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,260
Bring them into a separate room and don't embarrass them.

623
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:42,590
And only bring the good assemblymen to join us.

624
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,800
Be sure not to embarrass them.

625
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,340
I'll go over there later.

626
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,970
Yes, I understand.

627
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:56,530
Just what is it...? The ace that Park Gwan Soo has up his sleeve.

628
00:55:56,530 --> 00:56:00,400
I don't know well about the concealed circumstances,

629
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,030
but Park Gwan Soo is not pressuring the Chief Secretary but pressuring the VIP.

630
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,260
I am positive.

631
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:09,740
The President?

632
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:14,210
If the request for a thorough investigation passes and the warrant is issued,

633
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,930
I am positive they'll drag the trial to the election time.

634
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:19,540
Even if we win the case later,

635
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:24,100
the election will be over.

636
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:30,020
Madam, now we only have one choice.

637
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:38,300
Tonight... We have to kill Park Kwan Soo.

638
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,350
Will that...

639
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:48,370
Be possible?

640
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:54,460
A high level of security is probably ordered for that side by now.

641
00:56:54,460 --> 00:57:00,330
But we have a more special person, though.

642
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:22,530
Check the inside.

643
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:36,810
Let's go now, Anna.

644
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:41,530
I am too afraid to go.

645
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,830
Let's go.

646
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:31,630
- Since you can't see ahead well, be careful walking. 
- Um.

647
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,170
Are you okay?

648
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,900
- Yes, I am okay. 
 - Oh.

649
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,260
Are you scared?

650
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,620
Yeah.

651
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,730
Are you hungry?

652
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:10,390
Huh? Was it me?

653
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,170
Um, it was you.

654
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:16,480
No.

655
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,700
I-I was just too nervous.

656
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,580
Do you want me to make you ramen again?

657
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,630
N-No, I am fine.

658
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:32,600
Then... why is your stomach making noise?

659
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,100
I-I said it wasn't me.

660
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,520
Oh my.

661
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,030
Be careful.

662
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,900
Steps.

663
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,850
How about now? Feeling any better now?

664
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,980
A bit... scared.

665
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:16,760
Um. First--

666
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,750
I think we are at the door.

667
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,410
Uh huh.

668
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:25,360
- I am going to open the door. 
 - Uh um.

669
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,230
We are going in.

670
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,730
Yeah.

671
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:42,320
What do you want to eat the most now?

672
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,930
What I want to eat...?

673
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,720
I don't know.

674
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,340
But I think we are in.

675
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,290
Already?

676
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,950
Um, already.

677
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:13,300
♫   You are going away.  ♫

678
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,000
How is it? Are you still afraid?

679
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,920
♫  There are still many words which couldn't be said  ♫

680
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,970
Um.
♫  They couldn't be expressed to the end.  ♫

681
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:32,040
I am afraid.

682
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:42,700
♫    Are my feeling showing? Just looking forward to see you   ♫

683
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:50,480
♫  Love you, even if I try to stop the feeling  ♫

684
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:58,220
♫   It keeps growing bigger and bigger  ♫

685
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:02,390
♫  I love you, I love you  ♫

686
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:07,600
Are they now, perhaps...?

687
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:12,570
This is driving me crazy!

688
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,810
Ambush is basically used when the enemy is relaxed.

689
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:23,800
Unless Assemblyman Park is a fool, he's probably waiting for us tonight with a trap.

690
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,870
Jae Ha is quite capable, but still...

691
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:31,150
Does this have any possibility?

692
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:36,150
For sure there's a possibility for eliminating Park Gwan Soo, but...

693
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:38,860
But...?

694
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:43,210
There's a slim chance he'd return alive.

695
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:47,260
What are you talking about? Even if the possibility is only 1%,

696
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:53,350
we'd have to fight! If we spent the night like this,

697
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:57,090
isn't the JSS done for anyway?

698
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,260
Where is... Kim Jae Ha now?

699
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:15,620
He's back at the safe house.

700
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:32,840
I will. I'll go.

701
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:41,610
In return, guarantee the safety of this place.

702
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,780
Once I verify that, I'll depart.

703
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,230
Where on earth are you going?

704
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,470
I'll be right back.

705
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:59,850
Don't go.

706
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:01,460
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

707
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:07,070
No. Don't go. You are going because of me, aren't you?

708
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,540
Don't go.

709
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,680
So, although I can kill Park Gwan Soo, but

710
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:38,860
it'll be hard for me to return alive.

711
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,630
Fine. I'll do it.

712
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:57,160
I'll kill Park Gwan Soo for you, but I have conditions.

713
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:03,030
Conditions? Tell me... anything.

714
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:07,480
First. Give me a head.

715
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,900
A head?

716
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:11,930
This woman's head.

717
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:17,870
If you give me her head, then I'll bring you Park Gwan Soo's head.

718
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:21,360
What will you do, Chief Kim?

719
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,670
I understand. I'll give it to you.

720
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:33,560
But only if you bring Park Gwan Soo's head first,

721
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,140
I'll give you mine then.

722
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,390
That make sense, right?

723
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:42,810
I'll do that. And the second.

724
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:49,490
Promise me that... you'll leave Anna alone.

725
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:55,850
And in return, I will persuade Anna not to provoke you, too.

726
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:07,240
Okay. I'll do that. I'll promise.

727
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:11,280
That'll do.

728
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,470
Is that all?

729
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:19,250
Ah! Give me the rapid response team, too. Somebody must pull the trigger in place of me.

730
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:22,670
Of course, we'll give you the team. Is that all?

731
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,360
I'll depart.

732
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,620
But just in case,

733
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:33,050
can you give us the email address before you go?

734
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,820
Isn't it about time?

735
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:39,030
It's not like we are strangers. Aren't we a family? Right?

736
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:42,640
Forget it. I don't need that measly email.

737
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:51,730
If he can't succeed, we all are done for anyway. Don't you agree?

738
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,730
What are you doing? If the decision is made, let's move quickly. We don't have much time.

739
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:58,590
Yeah.

740
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,670
K2!

741
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:30,130
Jae Ha.

742
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:42,990
If the situation gets dire... you can just come back.

743
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:56,420
What's with you? It's not like you.

744
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,630
What is like me?

745
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:02,630
Don't worry.

746
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:05,640
I already...

747
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:09,460
canceled sending the email.

748
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,430
Jae Ha.

749
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:20,490
♬ To get the beautiful flower ♬

750
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:27,170
♬ Without ceasing, treading in the deep forest ♬

751
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,000
I believe ...

752
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:38,500
you are a person who will keep a promise.

753
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:30,050


754
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:33,450
  Anna. 

755
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,110
Uh Anna.

756
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:46,360
When you come back, please bring me some oil tteokbokki from my old neighborhood. I am craving for it.

757
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,280
I'll be very late coming home today.

758
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:53,740
That's fine even if late.

759
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,140
Why don't you ask Mi Ran for that sort of thing?

760
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:03,880
I can't because she'll eat it all by herself.

761
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,150
I want to eat it with you only.

762
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,020
Go ahead and tell me.

763
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,510
I have an additional order for tonight.

764
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,310
Additional order...?

765
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,530
Eliminate K2 along with Park Gwan Soo.

766
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,280
Yeah?

767
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,990
Even if the mission of eliminating Park Gwan Soo failed,

768
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:35,940
at least you must eliminate K2.

769
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:40,500
And be sure to bring K2's phone.

770
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,200
Understood?

771
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:45,000
Yeah.

772
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,110
Okay? You must bring me that, okay?

773
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:01,610
You'll die if you forget it.

774
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:08,000
I guess I have to bring you tteokbokki if I want to live.

775
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,310
Be sure return alive.

776
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:19,250
It's an order.

777
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:23,170
Understood.

778
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:25,660
I'll make sure I come back to you.

779
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:28,860
♫   No matter how hard I try to reach you   ♫

780
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,800
♫    who are going farther away again  ♫

781
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,280
♫   are spending the day in tears   ♫

782
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,460
♫   I can only stare at your back blankly. Everyday   ♫

783
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:44,870
♫   Because you remain very much still in my heart  ♫

784
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:50,870
♫   I'll cry myself to sleep   ♫

785
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:54,750
♫   Whether I am erasing you    ♫
