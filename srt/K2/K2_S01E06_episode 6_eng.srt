1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,400
 The K2 

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:18,730
 This is not an appropriate program for viewers under 15 years of age. 

3
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,680
  The K2 

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,600
 I thought nothing existed, but then ... 
   

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,620
 
 Save me. Save me.

6
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,310
 Someone whom I wanted to protect appeared 

7
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,230
Among prospective presidential candidate's wives, you were number one from the popular vote.

8
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,740
In the political circles, you are already known and praised as the queen of housewives.

9
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,100
  
  There nothing much in being supportive.

10
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,620
 

11
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:26,160
 Also... I'm concerned about that banner worker.  That guy, so uselessly, saw me right in the face.. 

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,050
Banner hanger?

13
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,820
 

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,470
 

15
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,740
You are saying you lost track of the banner hanger in the end?

16
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,600
- Give me a little more time. 
 - Only a little

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,180
He is someone who cannot be caught through JSS's strength.

18
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,000
 

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,430
Why? Is there someone besides me who's stirring up trouble?

20
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:14,870
Your daughter. 
  

21
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,170
Does that run in the blood?

22
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,780
How are you going to prevent it?

23
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,480
- disguised as a perfect accident. 
 - Are you mad?

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,200
Anna is the only means I have to control Jang Se Joon.  If something bad happens to Anna, from a bad accident or whatever, 
 

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,530
However, I am the person who will become president.

26
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,290
If something bad happens to that child, everything that Choi Yoo Jin built up during her lifetime will collapse in a single moment.

27
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,870
  
 You're all grown up.

28
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,870
You're pretty as you resemble your mom. 
  

29
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,730
- Devil. 
  - Who?  Me?

30
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,190
I remembered everything.

31
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,150
Mom did not commit suicide.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,500
What are you doing?  Don't!

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,000
 

34
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,520
Also everyone who helps you in the future will die.

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,640
Who sent you?

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,570
If I come a second time, you who will die. 
 

37
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,990
This is the second meeting that I told you about.

38
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,510
Shoot!  Shoot! 
  

39
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,030
Shoot!

40
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,160
Shoot! Kill her already! Kill her!

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,720
Other than me, there is another person who wants you dead.

42
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:52,780
 

43
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't let the innocent people die because of me.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 

45
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,820
This is how you should look., 
  

46
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,300
you need to look like this at least, right?

47
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,670
I will win in this fight, everyone. 
  

48
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,970
Kim Jae Ha?
  

49
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,140
Come on, is it something like a henchman of JB?

50
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,150
Just... why don't you think of it as a subject of an empire?

51
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,030
This is Agent Kim Jae Ha who will work in the VIP team.

52
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,400
His caller ID will be K2.

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,100
 

54
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,170
It's not that my dad doesn't come.  He can't because of that woman.

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,900
 

56
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,700
But this child read my mind and heart.

57
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:07,100
But ... the child didn't need my command or permission.
 [Jae Ha rescues Yoo Jin again.

58
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,460
He's wasn't a hunting dog. He is a wolf. 
  

59
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,150
I probably won't be able to tame him. 
  

60
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,000
- Let's go to Cloud Nine.  
 - Cloud Nine?

61
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,330
 It's going down. 

62
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:22,670
Fine, then garnishee Professor Kim Soo Yeong's pay and sue her for about 3 million dollars for damages.

63
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:28,060
It'll make it hard for her to find another job, and she'll soon have financial problems and bad credit.

64
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,230
Madam, it'll be a bit difficult to win.

65
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:39,080
So what if we lose? We can drag the lawsuit about 3 years and by then she'll have a hard time to recover her status.

66
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,200
Yes, I understand.

67
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,900
Make sure she can't get a job anywhere.

68
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,910
Next. Director Go Yoon Hyeong.

69
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,190
He doesn't have much, does he?

70
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,680
  ("Mirror" speaking) There is a record of a dropped case. 

71
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,630
What is it?

72
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,060
 There's a record of his internet video chatting. 

73
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,130
You have a video, too? Play it.

74
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,660
Forget it. Turn it off. How disgusting.

75
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,380
Release the video and drive the issue as him being a hideous pervert.

76
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,970
And first get the testimony of the people who suffered from sexual harassment.  That's it.

77
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,300
Yes.

78
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,280
That video... before releasing it to the public,

79
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,050
be sure to show it to his kids first.

80
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,860
Why? Don't you think his kids are at the right age to view porn?

81
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,650
Madam, to show the father's image like that to his kids— lf...

82
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,700
Don't you think he'd want to kill himself?

83
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,620
No? Those won't be enough to do that?

84
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,350
I was thinking at the family meeting during the funeral service.

85
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:15,300
What death would be the least painful death?

86
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,620
Yes. We'll carry it out right away.

87
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,560
You startled me.  Knock first. 
  Episode  6 

88
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,480
Do you know what just happened?

89
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,840
What?

90
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,410
Jae Ha, Jae Ha is—

91
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,410
Jae Ha. Jae Ha!  What about Jae Ha again?

92
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,920
Look at you!

93
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,690
That good?

94
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,730
How did he go to Cloud Nine already upon his arrival?

95
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,890
That's what I am saying.  He's already an executive at his age.

96
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:17,720
I know, right? I guess it's true that he did something big yesterday.

97
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:25,560
Now I just need to get Jae Ha. Oh my God, then I will ...

98
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:33,540
You just become crap. How will you get him? Do you think he'll come here again?

99
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,990
I heard there isn't anyone monitoring the hidden camera today.

100
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,100
Don't do useless things like this again and just watch Anna well.

101
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,280
But where did Seong Gyu go on a day like this?

102
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,490
What crap...

103
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,110
Yes, understood.

104
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,960
You came. Go on in, she is waiting for you.

105
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,330
Have a seat.

106
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,960
This is nice.

107
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,960
This is a soundproof room?

108
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,770
You even know that?

109
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,630
This must be level B or level C.

110
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,450
Indeed.

111
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,640
This is level D.

112
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,330
Even a gunshot in here can't be heard outside this room.

113
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,260
And a bullet can't penetrate this room either.

114
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:05,610
You must have spent a lot of money on this. So, what do you want to tell me to bring me all the way here.

115
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:11,440
No, I called you here because I wanted to hear your stories.

116
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,850
What stories?

117
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,700
All of them.

118
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,380
The story of the man who crossed the enemy line alone to save me.

119
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:29,130
The story of the man who brought an umbrella in the midst of that and held it over me. And ...

120
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:35,260
What kind of life did he live to carry a handkerchief these days?

121
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,390
I am curious.

122
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,650
I am curious as well. Ah~ Why did I live like that?

123
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,020
So what is it that you want to hear, really?

124
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,060
  That's true, though. 

125
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,700
I've already heard about your military story from Manager Ju.

126
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,940
Now I want to hear what happened in Iraq.

127
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,820
I am about to begin my hunting of Park Gwan Soo. Is this enough reason for you?

128
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:15,030
As you know, this room is perfectly soundproofed.

129
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:20,060
No one can hear what's being said in this room.

130
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:28,140
Then who's listening from the microphone that is turned on?

131
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,950
It's my Mirror.

132
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,620
The witch's mirror.

133
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:45,180
Mirror~ Mirror, who's the fairest of them all?

134
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,770
Don't you know that?

135
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,490
What's with that? That look is like you are watching a crazy person. Fine, watch it carefully.

136
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:04,390
Mirror. Mirror, who is the fairest of them all?

137
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,440
 Snow White. 

138
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,030
She even has a sense of humor.

139
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:17,490
 Assemblyman Jang Se Joon is visiting the traditional market to shake hands with people. 

140
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:23,120
 He's planning to attend the fifth anniversary mass at the cathedral in Ahyeon-dong for the massacre 

141
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,340
 along with the other political leaders from both parties tomorrow afternoon. 

142
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,140
 Next news. 

143
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,290
 Ahyeon-dong Cathedral? 

144
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,830
Did you say AI (Artificial Intelligence)?

145
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,230
Voice recognition, artificial intelligence.

146
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:53,500
Smartphones have those nowadays. Of course my Mirror is a bit smarter.

147
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,470
As you've probably suspected, this place is like JSS's brain.

148
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,020
This is a place where all the secret information we can collect in the world is stored.

149
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,750
And also a place analyzing the big data floating on the internet.

150
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:15,190
My Mirror is the software finding the most fitting answers to my questions from the collected information

151
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,790
and revealing it to me.

152
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,440
Tell me your story, then Mirror will tell you what you are curious about.

153
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,920
Why do you think I am curious about something?

154
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,260
If you didn't, you didn't need to be employed at JSS.

155
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,800
Don't you think?

156
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:51,600
Why the look of a child who got caught stealing from his mother's wallet?

157
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,980
You don't need to try to sneak in here because it won't work.

158
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,220

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,970
And Mirror is designed to respond only to my voice.

160
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,480
Two, let's go!

161
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,180
Seriously awesome.

162
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,190
Now, tell me. Why are you after Park Gwan Soo?

163
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,660
Also... tell me what happened to you.

164
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:10,790
There was a girl... Raniya. She was a Kumar refugee.

165
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,700
I wanted to take her out of that miserable hell hole.

166
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,820
Hey guys!

167
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,480
What's up!

168
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,260
Hi.

169
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,760
Please review the content.

170
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,820
Raniya!

171
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,380
Raniya!

172
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,200
I love you!

173
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,100
This is extremely important, so there can not be even the slightest mistake.

174
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,880
He is confident.

175
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,570
Confident?

176
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:59,510

189
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,620
That's how I got framed for Raniya's murder and got arrested. Thankfully,

190
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,350
I was able to escape within a week. But after I came out,

191
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,710
the unknown Park Gwan Soo, Korean politician, had already  left the day after the incident,

192
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,310
and Blackstone camp had already been moved.

193
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:07,000
That's how I ran away and went through Turkey with Syrian refugees.

194
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,630
From there, I got into Europe.

195
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,850
That is all.

196
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,320
The reason I need to kill Park Gwan Soo.

197
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,560
That reason... is reason enough.

198
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,380
Ugh... I'm going crazy.

199
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,970
Mirror, you heard, right?

200
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,620
From now on, please answer all Kim Jae Ha's questions.

201
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,330
 Okay. 

202
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:16,100
September 15, 2015- I want to know Park Gwan Soo's schedule.

203
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,200
 He was busy. 

204
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,010
That day at 15:30 (3:30PM),

205
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:28,220
Park Gwan Soo was in a tent in the desert, 30 minutes away from his hotel. That reason?

206
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,130
 No official data. 

207
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,750
Mirror - From now on, double your search options,

208
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,830
and modify the value doubled by raising tolerance and find the probable answer.

209
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,600
 In that case, 

210
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,780
 "#5. Secret meeting" probability of 54.3%. 

211
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,170
That's right, "#5. Secret meeting." Those involved in the meeting?

212
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,000
 Can you specify the location of the meeting tent? 

213
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,810
7 km north of Kumar 2 National Highway and Sanami intersection.

214
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,880
 Politician Park Gwan Soo, Blackstone guards, Translator Raniya, 

215
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,660
 also, presumed attendee Kumar Leader Abdul Omare. 

216
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,610
Reason for the presumption?

217
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,910
 The meeting tent belongs to Abdul Omare's bodyguard. 

218
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,190
The reason for the secret meeting?

219
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,580
 Reason not known. 

220
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,900
Why did Park Gwan Soo use Blackstone to murder Raniya after the job?

221
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,730
   

222
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,840
Yes, that's right! Damn!

223
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,810
#2. The translator translated content she shouldn't have known.

224
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,050
If that's the case, what is the topic of Park Gwan Soo and Abdul Omare's conversation?

225
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,290
  I cannot estimate. 

226
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,770
Was there a money transaction?

227
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,170
  I cannot estimate. 

228
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,510
Anything further would be out of reach, unless you have more information.

229
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,850
 However... 

230
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,910
However?

231
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,020
 The presumptive trilateral relationship error range is unique. 

232
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,780
 Two weeks after the meeting, Abdul Omare broke free of his central government, 

233
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,860
 and formed his personal army. 

234
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,130
Did he export weapons?

235
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,110
If he did, Park Gwon Soo is amazing.

236
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:15,310
From Park Gwon Soo's perspective, it's true. He became a weapons exporter.

237
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,590
Who is it?

238
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,300
This is is Car 01.  Where are you going at this hour?

239
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,820
This is J4. I am going to the mart.

240
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,830
 If you keep doing this every day, I'll have to report to HQ. 

241
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,050
Hey, don't do that.

242
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:04,620
I'm just kidding. Instead, I'll ask you for a coffee.

243
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,380
Okay.

244
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,430
 Okay? This is new. 

245
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,540
Where should I take you?

246
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,660
Customer, where should I take you?

247
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,140
What?

248
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,300
Yeonhee-dong.

249
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,340
Yeonhee-dong?

250
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,130
- Yes.
 - Alright.

251
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,710
That refugee named Raniya,

252
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,020
you loved her,  didn't you?

253
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,340
Well, I'm not sure about that now.

254
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:57,150
Was that really love? Or was it useless pity?

255
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,530
Useless?

256
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,640
Yes. Raniya's translation work with the Blackstone

257
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,650
was because I introduced her to them.

258
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,600
Well now, I'll be off.

259
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,390
To where?

260
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,230
To the dorms.

261
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:20,520
No. Your place of work will now be Cloud Nine. Use the JSS apartments.

262
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,340
I'm fine too. I'm comfortable where I'm at.

263
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,900
For someone from JSS

264
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,670
to move into Cloud Nine means that from that moment,

265
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,310
I will take responsibility for that individual and their families.

266
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:42,350
To me, those words sound like from that moment, they will live as your slaves.

267
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:49,750
I... have never betrayed someone who hasn't betrayed me.

268
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,250
An owner who didn't betray his or her slave... has never existed.

269
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,910
But friends don't betray each other, right?

270
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,870
Friend?

271

 JB card: Checking account -$7.60 for Taxi 

272
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,610
 Good job.

00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,540
 You can hear the music. Step and step. 

274
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,760
 Shall we? Other side. 

275
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,990
 Now, spin! 

276
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,050
 To the left. 

277
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,730
 Good job. 

278
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,490
So are you going to work at Cloud Nine from now on?

279
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,290
No, I'm not going to work there.

280
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:46,860
You got rejected, didn't you? Dang, what a waste.

Hello?

287
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,650
Yes, welcome.

288
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:22,590
Since you've come so early this morning,

289
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,220
passport photo or application photo?

290
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,630
That picture outside...

291
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,710
Uhm Hye Rin...

292
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,230
her daughter? You're her daughter!

293
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,330
An... An?

294
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,350
Anna.

295
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,140
Right!

296
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,620
You're working hard.

297
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:59,050
Thanks, but J4's been out for a long time and still hasn't come back.

298
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,130
We're about to report to HQ.

299
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,310
J4 did?

300
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,490
Yes.

301
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,200
Oh, Jae Ha.

302
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,150
You can't do this all of a sudden!

303
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,700
Seriously...

304
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,920
Why? What? What's wrong Jae Ha? What's going on?

305
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,120
What happened? Oh, no.

306
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,770
Even then, your mother was the prettiest!

307
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,740
Even when I was taking this picture, I was so awestruck.

308
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,490
Did you know my mother well?

309
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:59,270
Huh? No, how could I know your mother?

310
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,380
She was a movie star.

311
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,320
To be honest, your mother wasn't someone who should've taken their picture here.

312
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,470
She should've gone to a nice studio.

313
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,680
On this day, she came to get your passport photos,

314
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,240
and then randomly decided to take a family picture.

315
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,000
So I luckily took her picture.

316
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,540
Passport photo?

317
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,870
Yes, passport photo.

318
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,370
You went to America, right?

319
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,060
What?

320
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,460
Back then, I even took your US visa pictures.

321
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:39,870
Oh, and this was your last picture with your nanny.

322
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:44,300
To your mother, your nanny was family.

323
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,720
In the frame,

324
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,950
I purposefully folded your nanny.

325
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,760
Cause she wasn't pretty.

326
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:04,070
That's right... I had a nanny.

327
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:08,600
Yes, I'm going into the control room.  Of course!

328
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,370
We have to dig through the police's camera footage.

329
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,950
Oh, and Manager Ju, what are you going to do now?

330
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:18,410
We have to report this to the madam.

331
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,360
If we keep this up, we're both dead.

332
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,650
President, please calm down.

333
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:28,650
I think it'd be best if we look for her first, at least until the afternoon scheduled events.

334
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,970
Yes, of course. I'll take responsibility.

335
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,850
I apologize.

336
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:44,180
Okay, so what else is missing. Did she write a note or something?

337
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:50,620
There was no note. The only things missing are my wallet and... my transmission earpiece.

338
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,150
Your trans— You seriously!

339
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,010
Huh?

340
00:38:59,010 --> 00:38:59,770
Why?

341
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,170
My card... She used my card. She paid for a taxi.

342
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,860
She's already used it twice. I need to report it stolen.

343
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,230
No way. Are you crazy? Call this into the control room.

344
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:13,280
And look into where the taxi took her!

345
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,580
At least we know she's alright.

346
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,950
That nanny used to live in this neighborhood.

347
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,170
I heard that she's in a nursing home now.

348
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,480
It's so unfortunate.

349
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:41,570
Room 101, Miss Yoo Myoung Ja. You can find her over there.

350
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,330
 You've been okay? Any areas of discomfort? 

351
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,650
 I've gotten a lot better. 

352
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,110
 If you need anything, please let me know. 

353
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,480
 It's a relief you're feeling better. 

354
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,220
Nanny...

355
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,010
Nanny, it's me, Anna.

356
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,390
Hye Rin. Hye Rin,

357
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,730
Hye Rin, I'm hungry. Give me food.

358
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,980
W-what?

359
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,020
You just finished eating.

360
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,270
Hye Rin, this girl stole all my food and ate it.

361
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:03,190
I'm hungry. So hungry.

362
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,790
Nanny... I'm Anna.

363
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,320
Do you remember me?

364
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,010
Anna?

365
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,670
Yes.

366
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,680
Yeah, Hye Rin. Hurry and run away!

367
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,050
Go to America with Anna! You must go quickly.

368
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,310
Choi Yoo Jin found everything out. Run away!

369
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,780
She's going to kill you and Anna.

370
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:49,680
You need to hurry. You need to hurry. You need to hurry.

371
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,060
Hurry... You need to hurry.

372
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:58,500
That's right. It's Choi Yoo Jin right?

373
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,350
Nanny, you knew everything.

374
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:12,090
You can't put that much water into the flour.

375
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:16,670
It will smell.

376
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,480
Hye Rin, give me some food.

377
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,010
I'm hungry. 
-Nanny.

378
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,980
Oh, nanny!

379
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,350
Hye Rin, I'm so hungry.

380
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,720
Patrol cars, block front and back entrances.

381
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,810
 We're going in now. Make sure not even water gets out. 

382
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:07,350
Have you perhaps seen someone that looks like her?

383
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,850
Yes, the person looking for room 101. She went that way.

384
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,000
J4, go look.

385
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,080
This is J4, target not in sight.

386
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,220
  Look carefully! She said she went that way! 

387
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,800
She's not in the men's side.

388
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,310
Yes, Assemblyman. I apologize.

389
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,700
Yes, we will definitely find her.

390
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,330
What?

391
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,380
Yes, I understand.

392
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,090
Is it the assemblyman? It sounds like the President Kook couldn't hold it in, reported about it.

393
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,860
So what'd the assemblyman say?

394
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,110
He said to make sure she doesn't appear at the cathedral.

395
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,710
In the end, it looks like he's more worried about himself than his daughter.

396
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,950
He's a politician.

397
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,910
 Dad's not that kind of person. 

398
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,880
 It's because Choi Yoo Jin's at his side. 

399
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,510
- Grandmother, give it to me. I'll carry it for you. 
 - Oh,  no.

400
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,550
Please take my hand.

401
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,690
It's been tough, hasn't it?

402
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,940
How rude...

403
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:17,350
Please come this way.

404
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,410
 What is he doing? 

405
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,540
 There's such a difference between Assemblyman Jang and Assemblyman  Park! 

406
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,560
 How dare he act like that at a memoriall? 

407
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,880
 Assemblyman Park is definitely not right 

408
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,380
Yes, yes.

409
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,890
Let's keep going.

410
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,950
 She's definitely here. Look carefully. 

411
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,750
 Make sure she doesn't get near the VIP. 

412
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,110
Oh, you came early.

413
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,050
Please sit. Please sit.

414
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,950
Let's see. Jang Se Joon is...

415
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,150
Over there.

416
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:21,350
Oh ho~ Even Madam Uh...

417
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:24,050
Oh, thank you.

418
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,750
Grandmother, I'll leave your purse here.

419
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,340
Hey, Assemblyman Jang, come here! Come here!

420
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,680
Please come here, Madam Choi. There's a seat over here.

421
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,390
Oh, come here, why are you being coy? Come on.

422
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,650
There's a seat here.

423
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:42,650
Oh, come he–

424
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,240
Please sit here.

425
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,580
Oh, no.

426
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,960
We can sit in the back.

427
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,090
No, no we cannot allow that to happen. It's okay with us,

428
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,420
so please. 
-No, no, we are fine.

429
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,280
No, please sit.

430
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,500
Oh, yes. Thank you very much.

431
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,890
Thank you!

432
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,590
Take a seat.

433
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,950
Seems I took a hit. Man.

434
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:15,250
Today, before the mass,

435
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:20,470
sisters gathered from each convent will sing in  memory of those who died.

436

Dad.

437
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,410

 Don't, Anna. 

472
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,640
 Anna, don't. 

473
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:26,050
  Anna! Anna! Just a minute please. 

474
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,800
What is it?

475
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,090
Nothing.

476
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,140
Excuse me.

477
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:05,410
 Dad, I think I am lost. Please come get me. 

478
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:08,910
 You know where I am, right? 

479
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:14,710
I'll be the end of everything if the public finds out about Anna.

480
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:21,580
That's what I want to say to you. Just how were you keeping her

481
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,760
to cause an incident like this?

482
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,910
Enough with that and think quickly what this place is.

483
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,340
I told you I don't know.

484
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,900
She believes her dad will come to see her, but

485
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,470
her dad doesn't know the place?

486
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,940
Just how will I know? That was over 10 years ago!

487
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:49,770
Anna is pathetic... but I am also

488
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:56,640
feeling very disappointed that she believes her dad is coming to see...

489
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,800
Let's drop it now.

490
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,590
What are you trying to do now?

491
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,470
Manager Ju, would you please leave us for a minute?

492
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,060
Yes, Ma'am.

493
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,690
14 years ago, the day I made breakfast for you the last time.

494
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:29,790
Had you left me kicking the door that day,

495
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,940
I don't think I'd hate you this much.

496
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,070
 Breakfast is almost done. 

497
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,160
 Shocking Tragedy! Star Um Hye Rin committed suicide! 

498
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,770
 If you leave this house now, 

499
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,310
 Anna will die as well. 

500
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:38,480
Then should I have let Anna died by your hands, too?

501
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,780
You murderer.

502
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:54,950
That's what I thought all along.

503
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:59,050
I thought you did it because of Anna's safety.

504
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,170
But now we both know,

505
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:08,900
that you were just afraid Anna will be a roadblock for your ambition.

506
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,270
Did you find anything?

507
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,480
Nothing.

508
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:36,410
Check everyone that came out of the cathedral. Be alert!

509
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:39,690
You must find her no matter what, understood?

510
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,130
Yes!

511
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:45,580
If something goes wrong here, we are done.

512
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:05,810
 - Which one? 
 - That one. 

513
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:07,160
 The viking? 

514
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,420
 What to do? 

515
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,140
 She can't? 

516
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:17,240
 What to do Anna? She said you are too short by this much. Let's try it next year. 

517
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,010
 Hurry up Dad! 

518
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:39,320
 Okay! Ice creams have arrived. Let's eat. 

519
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,910
 We are looking for a 6 years old girl came from Ssangmoon-dong. 

520
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,050
 She is wearing a blue striped shirt and red--- 

521
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:48,050
 Anna. 

522
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:53,670
 If you ever be separated from you parents in a place like this, then what do you need to do? 

523
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:58,210
 I need to get a taxi and ask to take me to 1371 Dohwa-dong in Jongro-gu. 

524
00:58:58,210 --> 00:58:59,820
 What? 

525
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,570
 Wow~ My Anna is pretty smart. 

526
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:08,980
 Dad, I am 8 years old. That's just basics. 

527
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:15,670
 But Anna, what if you can't get a taxi like overseas? 

528
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:19,710
 Then I'd have to find you quickly. 

529
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,340
 Anna. At times like that 

530
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:32,730
 If you go around here and there, Daddy can't find you right? 

531
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,940
 You're right. What should I do then? 

532
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:39,510
 If it happens, stay at the place I lost you. 

533
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,740
 Really? 

534
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:46,100
 You have to wait for me there despite your fear. 

535
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,790
 Then I'll come to you. 

536
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:57,610
 Okay. I'll stay put at the place. You must come find me, okay? 

537
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:00,590
 Of course, I will. 

538
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,070
I upgraded my phone to the latest model.

539
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:15,970
It's no joke.

540
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,900
No need to Photoshop.  I'll take a picture and send it to you.

541
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,700
She wants to see?

542
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,800
She wants a photo.

543
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:30,070
This angle will be prettier.

544
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:32,390
How cute.

545
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,660
It came out pretty.

546
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,420
I found her!

547
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,300
Really?

548
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,980
It's her.

549
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,180
We are okay now. Where is it?

550
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,340
It's Dreamy Forest in northern Seoul.

551
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,230
Look Team leader Seo.

552
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:59,340
- What? 
- I have a favor to ask.

553
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,940
What? A favor?

554
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,820
It's not an order?

555
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,080
No it's a favor.

556
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:18,950


557
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,980
Here.

558
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,680
What about my dad?

559
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:00,210
Don't you know your dad is a busy man?

560
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,600
Your dad sent me here.

561
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:10,680
It's true. How else would I know you are here unless your dad told me?

562
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:24,170
It was good that you endured it earlier.

563
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,730
What did my dad say?

564
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:35,220
Your dad? What did he say....?

565
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:39,050
Right. He asked that you wait a little longer, and when he becomes the President---

566
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:43,430
Did he not get angry because I showed up suddenly?

567
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:46,340
Angry?

568
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,590
Not at all... He was really worried.

569
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:01,830
Take it, it's melting. Your dad told me to take it to you.

570
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:07,440
Really? My dad sent me this?

571
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,830
Of course.

572
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:15,890
Okay.

573
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,180
I'll eat it if my dad gave it to me.

574
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,020
It's good.

575
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,350
This is your team leader. We'll not approach until K2 brings the VIP out.

576
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:44,950
Yes, understood.

577
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:49,310
But, what are the two doing now?

578
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:52,980
They are eating ice cream together.

579
01:03:57,330 --> 01:04:02,610
This was the Dreamland before.

580
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:09,470
And my only "mundo de ensueno." ( Fairy tale world) 

581
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,600
This was my first theme park I visited with my dad.

582
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:27,230
Before, they had a rollercoaster that reached up to there and dropped.

583
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,720
I couldn't get on because I was too young.

584
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:35,990
I was just happy with the fact that I came to the theme park with my dad.

585
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:39,370
I had something to brag about to my friends.

586
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:43,810
I guess so. That must felt good.

587
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:55,230
But I couldn't brag because people must not know who my dad was.

588
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,940
My mom told me that

589
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:11,590
because of my dad holding a high position and if people find out that we are his family,

590
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:16,140
bad people will harass my dad.

591
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:21,310
I didn't understand what it meant then.

592
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,600
But it's just the bad people...

593
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,880
harassing my dad scared me...

594
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,750
So I just sucked it up.

595
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:41,080
Anna, are you sick?

596
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,770
Vana illusion. (  Futile illusion )

597
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:46,900
Are you okay, uh?

598
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,310
But I know now.

599
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:58,140
I am the one... I am the one who was that "bad people."

600
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:03,810
Anna! What's wrong? Anna!

601
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:11,310
♫   I can't breathe because my heart aches  ♫

603
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:18,140
- This is K2, call the ambulance quickly! 
- What?

604
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,450
Call the ambulance!

605
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:22,050
Wait!

606
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:27,550
Anna, wake up!

607
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:30,990
Yeah? Strawberry ice cream?

608
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:34,940
This is a big problem.

609
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,110
Yeah? Strawberry allergy?

610
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:40,740
 She could die eating just a bit. 

611
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:47,770
Hey, punk! It's because of the strawberry. She is allergic to strawberry!

612
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,430
Strawberry.

613
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:52,470
 Really? My dad sent me this? 

614
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:53,540
 Of course. 

615
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:54,810
 It's good. 

616
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:57,280
 Can you feel her pulse? 

617
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:00,670
I can feel it, but very weak.

618
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:05,950
  Damn it. She has a problem breathing. Help her to breathe until the ambulance comes. 

619
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:08,350
 She'll die otherwise! 

620
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:11,680

621
