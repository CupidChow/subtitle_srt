00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,680
Wow. There are a lot of friends.
 Episode 15 

5
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,180
You're all working so hard.

6
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,530
Great job!

7
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
I...

8
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,880
don't want you to worship me.

9
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,610
I just...  that...

10
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,260
You just wanted to own me.

11
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,700
As another slave.

12
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,960
What's this?!

13
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,870
Come on!

14
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,600
  There is an intruder. 

15
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,150
Wow... this place is really cool!

16
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,670
Mirror. Lock the door.

17
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,160
This is a bomb.

18
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,300
They can't hear you from in there.

19
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,300
That's a bomb.

20
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,620
That son of a b**ch.

21
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,460
Speak up. I can't hear you.

22
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,190
Mirror, turn on the speaker from outside.

23
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,720
 Please speak. 

24
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,560
What are you doing here? You didn't even call ahead.

25
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,820
President!

26
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,640
If you were having guests over, 
you should have let me know in advance.

27
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,960
Yes, Madam. My apologies.

28
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,740
With my loyalty for the company--

29
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,000
Shut your mouth!!

30
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,900
Hey, Noona, I might end up deaf.

31
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,970
What's going on?

32
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,910
Listen carefully to what I say.

33
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,230
Alright. What's the occasion.. for you 
 to come all this way?

34
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,590
Ah, I came to set up a bomb.

35
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,340
Watch... Hey, open it!

36
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,910
Okay ...

37
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,760
Wait a second.

38
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:37,040
Everybody's watching...

39
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,880
Now it's done. Will two hours be enough for our conversation?

40
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,290
Mirror, turn off. Where is Anna now?

41
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,930
You are only worried about Anna all the time, whether you are awake or not.

42
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,840
I asked where is she...? Anna?

43
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,000
By now... would she already be on the plane?

44
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,440
Or still at the airport?

45
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,900
She went to La Felt.

46
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,790
Yeah, well, out of all the things you did to Anna...

47
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,170
it's the thing you did best.

48
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,870
Mirror, turn back on.
 It appears you came to get Cloud Nine?

49
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,300
 Oh, Kim Jae Ha. How are you feeling?   You're still alive.

50
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
- Your family fight is quite intense.  
 -  Our family's always been like this.

51
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,800
Ah, Noona, answer the phone. It will be from my partner.

52
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,660
Who is it?

53
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,140
  It's a video call from Assemblyman Park Gwan Soo. 

54
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,820
Put it on.

55
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:55,360
 Gee... are greetings.. in order? I'm not sure, Madam. 

56
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,400
As you can see.

57
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,940
This time, my knight appears to have captured the queen.

58
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,300
So what...  you sent him to kill me?

59
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,240
Oh, oh, Jeez.. why would you say something  so frightening..

60
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,560
Politicians should try to solve the issues through discussion, don't you think so?

61
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,370
Oh.. with a gun in one hand?

62
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,800
A discussion is more fun in that way.

63
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,330
Like last time. You remember, when I almost died.

64
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,830
Ok, what do you want from me this time?

65
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:51,230
I just need Kim Seok Han's memory card. So simple.

66
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,260
And I just want this Cloud Nine.

67
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,230
Mirror, turn it off. Why don't you honestly admit that you don't have the memory card?

68
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,390
What are you going to do?

69
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,400
We need to catch him. Mirror, turn it on again.

70
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,860
You are asking for something impossible only.

71
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:30,780
First, I can't give you the memory card. Because I don't have it.

72
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,390
What?

73
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,720
- Is she telling the truth? 
  - Yes, that is the truth.

74
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,270
Kim Jae Ha still hasn't handed it over.

75
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,820
If you give me a little time, I can find where it is soon.

76
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,820
 Hey, mercenary, you didn't hand it over to her yet? 

77
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,940
Yes.  If that punk hadn't tried to steal it...

78
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,170
it could have been in your hands by now.

79
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,780
I wouldn't have been hurt like this, either.

80
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,600
Why did you do that? Didn't you want to pay me the remaining payment?

81
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,510
 No, no. no. no. 

82
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,590
 Hey, my friend. That's your misunderstanding. 

83
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,100
 Would there be a reason for me to have him do that? 

84
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,320
 It could be just emotional conflicts between young people like you and him. 

85
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,630
 Oh, that guy.. he's taken so many beatings from you all this time. 

86
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,430
 He was messed up big time. 

87
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,650
Right. He got beaten a lot, as you said.

88
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:35,500
The remaining payment. Money. Then, that punk...

89
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,100
Was he the same team with Assemblyman Park Gwan Soo?

90
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,670
 Right. 

91
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,370
 I hired that guy. 

92
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:54,310
 Madam, then were you just bluffing to the consortium? 

93
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,990
 Yes? 

94
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,140
I'm sorry about this.

95
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,300
You dirty traitors.

96
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,240
 What are you going to do? 

97
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,650
That's why  I told you not to mess with Anna.

98
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,970
 I have to catch Park Gwan Soo. 

99
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,710
Whoa, that punk is a scary one.

100
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:24,030
Ohhh, our poor Madam. She had no clue and...(had a crush on him).

101
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,350
 So... is the memory card lost? 

102
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,620
No, I'm keeping it safe.

103
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,720
 Can you bring that to me now? 

104
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,700
How about the remainder?

105
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,780
 Oh, of course I'll give it to you. 

106
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,460
 I should reward you with plenty bonus as well. 

107
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,860
 You know where, don't you?
- Of course. 

108
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,630
 My request is finished now, so you two brother and sister... 

109
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,560
 enjoy the rest of your conversation. Then good bye. 

110
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,300
Miss, your ticket.

111
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,390
Your bags have also been taken care of.

112
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,380
Thank you.

113
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,110
Mirror, turn off.

114
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,350
Do you think you can do it, in your condition?

115
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,380
Send Manager Ju to the scene.

116
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,920
Okay.

117
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,070
Also, I'm not going to be coming back.

118
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,830
Throw Cloud Nine away and get out. And then maybe ...

119
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,390
you'll be happier than now.

120
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,750
I can't throw Mirror away. Because Mirror...

121
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,840
is me.

122
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:09,700
Right? Of course it would be. Because Mirror has power...

123
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,610
that is unrelinquishable.

124
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,500
That's right. You understood, too.

125
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,590
That's why I gave you access to Mirror, too.

126
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,890
Look at him. Even though he has everything as a chairman of a conglomerate,

127
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,100
he's working this hard to get Mirror.

128
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:49,230
However, this is already

129
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,360
yours.

130
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,400
Whoever gets to taste the power of Mirror,

131
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,880
he will be engulfed by the desire of making Cloud 9 his.

132
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,470
That's why you became the witch to control this cloud 9,

133
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,320
and gave yourself up to be a prisoner of Cloud 9 at the same time.

134
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,500
Just walk out of here. As for Park Gwan Soo and Chairman Choi,

135
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,800
I will defeat them by myself.

136
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,860
We, in a better time,...

137
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,750
in a better fate, should have met.

138
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,620
Farewell.

139
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:08,640
♬ A pure girl meets a  ♬

140
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:16,290
♬  a wolf in the thick forest ♬

141
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:22,730
♬ She doesn’t know, what is fear? ♬

142
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:29,990
♬ He's an evil beast ♬

143
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:39,250
♬ When she sees a beautiful flower ♬

144
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:46,260
♬ He whispers something in her ear ♬

145
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:52,820
♬ To get the beautiful flower ♬

146
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,980
Mirror, turn back on. 
- Hey, you guys, back off.

147
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,850
And Mirror, when this door opens and I walk out,

148
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,910
close the door quickly.

149
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,510
 Yes. Quickly. 

150
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,450
Open.

151
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,760
Are you going to be okay in that condition?

152
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,100
Hey, shut up. Let's go quickly.

153
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,830
Go ahead.

154
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,560
Well, we need to get to the business, too, Noona.

155
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,580
Once you get to the destination, there will be a person from our side to greet you.

156
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,300
Alright.

157
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,320
Miss, make sure you hold on to my number, and don't erase it.

158
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,110
Because I won't ever change my number.

159
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,980
Of course I will. Why would I erase it?

160
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,380
Gosh, in my life, I got to experience this strange relationship.

161
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,360
We used to monitor you and confine you...

162
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,530
While mistreating you, I grew an affection towards you finally and as we got to close each other, now you are...

163
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,220
Don't cry. If you keep this up, how can I leave?

164
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,740
Right. Don't cry too much.

165
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,700
Miss is going there to be a famous model.

166
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,260
Okay.

167
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,180
Miss...

168
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,490
Please enjoy your freedom in the wide and big world.

169
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,570
Please forgive me, too.

170
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,570
Miss, when you arrive, call.

171
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,060
Yes.

172
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,820
This time, too, Dad didn't come.

173
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,020
Jae Ha... I'll leave him in your care.

174
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,060
I was the one who tried to kill you two. Did you forget?

175
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,090
No, not yet.

176
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,440
But I will try to forget.

177
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,770
It's time. Go on in.

178
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,900
Take me to the parking lot at the St. Tomas Hospital.

179
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,490
Mirror, did Jae Ha leave?

180
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,860
 Yes. 

181
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,000
Alright, he's gone.

182
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,970
Then, first shut off the elevator.

183
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,250
Cut off the communication from outside of the building as well.

184
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,800
Check it out.

185
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,770
The door won't open.

186
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:06,370
Gosh, what are you doing, Noona? This is a bomb, I said.

187
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,830
Now MIrror, on Secretary Kim's cell phone...

188
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,170
broadcast this CCTV.

189
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,420
What?

190
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,430
What is this? Mobilize all the JSS members!

191
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,860
Yes.

192
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,740
This is B1. B1. Everyone mobilize to headquarters. To headquarters.

193
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:39,490
Well, now the live broadcasting has begun.

194
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,670
Then, now, shall we start the game?

195
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,620
 Hey, Mirror. 

196
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:23,440
 Where do President Gook's grandchildren live? 

197
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,060
 They are in San Diego, West Coast of  the United States. 

198
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,370
To our military contractors in the US...

199
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,760
Email them the kids' address.

200
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,900
 With the condition of no cancellation, transfer the payment  in cash right away. 

201
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,450
 Because now I can't live for more than two hours. 

202
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,600
Tell them I'll double the pay if they finish in an hour.

203
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,110
W-w-wait, Madam!

204
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,610
I deserve to die for my wrongdoings.

205
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,540
 Mirror, stop for a second. 

206
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,270
M-m-madam, it's me who should die.

207
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,040
I'm the one who deserves to die! Please, please!

208
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,160
But Madam, I was just doing this for pure loyalty.

209
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,980
For the JB Group, please don't fight over JB Group with Chairman.

210
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,770
So that's why you betrayed me. Mirror.

211
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:27,670
Madam! Can't you give me one more chance?

212
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,700
I, under the late chairman's order,

213
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,060
took care of the Eom Hye Rin case.

214
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,900
Therefore isn't it why you served as Police Chief

215
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,630
and the President of the JSS?

216
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,070
Yes, I will die.

217
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,880
But please my kids...

218
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,790
have nothing to do with this.

219
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,580
Is that so?

220
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,210
The kids didn't do anything wrong, that's right.

221
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,100
Okay, I got it.

222
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,840
So die right here right now.

223
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,360
I'll spare your grandchildren.

224
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,180
You don't want to?

225
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,960
No. I'll do it. Yes.

226
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:49,210
M-m-madam, thank you.

227
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:01,030
I'll definitely repay back

228
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,040
my debt in hell.

229
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,990
Seong Won,

230
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,470
did you see?

231
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,000
This is how you use Cloud Nine.

232
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,850
Whoa, Noona. That's totally you.

233
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,610
Don't like it too much, because you'll be the next one.

234
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,350
You, special forces behind you.

235
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,100
Shoot Choi Seong Won.

236
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,690
What are you saying now?

237
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:05,550
The first one who shoots him will get 1 billion right in his account.

238
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,170
Okay, no need to think about your actions.

239
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,910
1 billion to each one of you.

240
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:28,660
Hey, hey, wait a second. I'm the one with more money!

241
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,090
I'm the chairman of a conglomerate! Geez, you scared me.

242
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,290
And I'm the only one who knows the bomb's password.

243
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:46,030
And because it has a locator, if I leave this here and get out

244
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,190
It will just blow up.

245
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,500
Right?

246
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,020
Really? Okay.

247
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,240
So let's cancel it for now.

248
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,420
It was a nice try.

249
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,760
But you thought I could not think about that?

250
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,900
Anyway, I feel like you'll die in the end.

251
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,910
Make everybody stay outside, so we can talk.

252
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,930
Okay, everybody gets out here and stand by.

253
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:26,300
And... take care of President Gook.

254
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,760
Sure, you prepared well.

255
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,750
But it seems like you really don't know the nature of a human being.

256
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,940
Soon those guys will be pointing their guns at you.

257
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,150
To make you defuse the bomb.

258
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:59,590
And then, they'll beg  me to reactivate the elevator.

259
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,300
In exchange, they' ll promise to kill you.

260
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,570
You came to the wrong place.

261
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,490
For you, there's no way out.

262
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,750
 Parking garage 

263
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,720
Yes, it's me. I got the memory card from him.

264
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,990
Oh! You did well! Great!

265
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,630
What should I do with him now?

266
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,430
You should make him disappear.

267
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,950
Yes, I got it. Please wait.

268
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,380
Goodbye.

269
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,080
Jae Ha, are you okay? Get up.

270
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,120
- Are you okay? 
- I'm not okay, I'm not.

271
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,920
 Hello? Hello? 

272
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:11,090
Yes, so where should I bring this?

273
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,060
Oh my, mercenary... Is it you, Jae Ha?

274
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,050
Yes, it's me.

275
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,990
What about the guy who was next to you.

276
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:29,340
He's here. What to do? He died.

277
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,860
What about the money? Did you prepare it?

278
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,130
Oh, o-of course.

279
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,980
I just need to go to the place where your safe is, right?

280
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,000
Oh, y-yes, yes. I will wait for you there.

281
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,110
This guy... is a scary punk.

282
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,640
Did you find the memory card?

283
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,890
Yes.

284
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:16,890
Thank you. You should go to the hospital, hurry.

285
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,910
No, this is not yours anymore.

286
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,030
I must reveal it to the world at once.

287
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,890
Chairman Choi has broken into Cloud Nine and installed a bomb.

288
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,280
To take Cloud Nine away from Choi Yoo Jin.

289
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,790
We have to take down Park Gwan Soo and Chairman Choi right now.

290
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,630
In order to do that, we should reveal to the world the memory card's content right now.

291
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:47,410
Sergeant Kim, if we do that now, it'll be the end of Assemblyman's career as well.

292
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,240
Give it to him. We should use it for his political move before or after the election.

293
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,070
No, we have to stop Park Gwan Soo and Chairman Choi right now!

294
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,280
I know! But this is no easy matter. If we reveal that JB Group and Jin Han Co. will be in trouble.

295
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,840
Then, how we are going to get enough funding for the election?

296
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,190
Chairman Choi will keep Cloud Nine for himself

297
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,010
or  along with Cloud Nine Choi Yoo Jin could die as well.

298
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,250
Jae Ha, for the lesser of two evils.

299
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:18,590
Lesser of the two devils? You are the same as always.

300
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:23,880
Even when I was discharged from the military, you used to say the small matter is okay to be victimized for the bigger matter.

301
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,240
I'm not telling you to sacrifice things this time now.

302
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,450
He's right Jae Ha, I need to have it in order to accomplish my dream.

303
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,890
And for you to get your revenge.

304
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,140
So what about Eom Hye Rin?

305
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,390
And what about Anna?

306
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,790
If it's too hard for you to do,

307
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,930
I will do it by myself.

308
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,810
Sergeant Kim, don't make me shoot you.

309
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,020
When you first lured me to join the JSS team,

310
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,050
you told me these people are really somebody.

311
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:18,530
They will make it to the Blue House without a doubt, you said. But look at yourself now.

312
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,360
Manager Ju, I am saying.

313
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,720
You are encouraging the Assemblyman to give up even his last conscience as a father.

314
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,330
How about you? You slaughtered citizens in Iraq for a few dollars

315
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,330
and you were summoned to the war criminal trial. That's why you were on the run.

316
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,420
The part of it is right but some part of it is wrong as well. You're right.

317
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:44,570
I was abandoned by my own country and I was sold for money

318
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,950
and I worked as a mercenary. That's all true. However,

319
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,930
I didn't slaughter the citizens.

320
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:56,780
On the contrary, I was on the run because I was going to testify in a court of law for the international war criminal trial

321
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,660
about the case of slaughtering citizens. And Blackstone found out about it.

322
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,250
To stop me from testifying, those bastards were pursuing me.

323
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:14,520
Jae Ha, you told me I am a puppet.

324
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,630
Yes. That's right. But now,

325
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:23,100
we are about to lose Cloud 9 and if we don't have even this memory card in our hands,

326
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,930
then I will become even worse than a puppet. I will turn into a scarecrow.

327
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:32,220
Assemblyman! Why are you a puppet?

328
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,910
Now you have to be Anna's father.

329
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,610
I am so sick of you guys now.

330
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:02,230
Originally the goal of this operation was to take Anna safely from Choi Yoo Jin's control and

331
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,070
to kill Park Gwan Soo.

332
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,000
Now I am leaving to kill Park Gwan Soo.

333
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,340
What are all these? Isn't that C4 Plaster bomb?

334
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,060
Sergeant Kim, how are you going to do it alone?

335
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,990
- You saw the trunk already.
- Are you perhaps...?

336
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,390
Are you going to be a suicide bomber?

337
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,510
Hey. Sergeant Kim. Hey! Sergeant Kim!

338
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,130
Noona, can you just give me this Mirror, please?

339
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,310
Please share it with me, huh?

340
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,900
Are you trying to whine at me? Is that your new strategy?

341
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,120
When you planned to marry brother-in-law, in fact,

342
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,270
weren't you going to give up the JB Group?

343
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,870
I was so envious of your courage back then.

344
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,690
That wasn't it.

345
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:06,300
Your mother took JB from me.

346
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:13,520
I envied you. Unlike me, you are not the child of a mistress.

347
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,490
 Everyone liked you and said you would be the chairman. 

348
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,580
I didn't doubt about it, either.

349
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,970
But the most envious thing about you was

350
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,660
when you refused the arranged marriage and planned to marry brother-in-law.

351
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,920
I had someone in my mind as well.

352
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:39,480
I couldn't do anything else but give her up.

353
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,760
If I were a little more naive, I would have fallen for your word, boy.

354
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,460
Whoa, it was so close! I almost could make it.

355
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,600
Gosh, my Noona is so clever.

356
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,350
But still, Father cared about you more than me for real.

357
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,590
and as I heard before, you killed Eom Hye Rin

358
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,070
and Father ordered President Gook to clean up your mess? Isn't it?

359
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,670
What do you know?

360
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,250
Fine. I got it.

361
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,070
Then. let's do this way. I will give you the half of the JB shares. And let's share Mirror together.

362
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,670
Then it's fair. If I took Jin Han Company after that,

363
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:33,240
you can be the chairman of the JB Group and I will be the chairman of the Jin Han Company. Deal?

364
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,990
Why?

365
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,920
Are you getting nervous as the time passes?

366
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,780
Seong Won, when you first walked in here with that bomb,

367
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,430
you were thinking of taking over Mirror or

368
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:54,410
just destroying everything, right?

369
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:58,840
There was no option for you to die here together.

370
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,030
However, now that you can't escape from here,

371
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,890
you have no choice but to stop the explosion in the end.

372
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:11,190
Then, why do I make a deal with you?

373
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,890
Before those bastards outside turn into beasts from anxiety,

374
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:23,190
you better stop the bomb and walk out of here quietly.

375
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,020
I won't kill you in that case.

376
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,210
A-Assemblyman, are you really going to have a press conference?

377
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,970
While I was covering all the hard things about you,

378
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,390
I endured countless humiliation  for only one thing.

379
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,880
It's your endless desire for the political power.

380
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,600
But now that you said that you are going to give up everything, I also have no reason to stay by your side.

381
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,530
Jeez, you are giving me a strong punch.

382
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:59,130
Manager Ju. How about you?

383
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,630
In this case, shouldn't Madam have a choice as well?

384
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,730
That's right. Give a call to Choi Yoo Jin.

385
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,900
Let's see how she is doing.

386
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,630
 There is a call from Assemblyman Jang Se Joon. 

387
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,850
How early to call me.

388
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,920
Let me answer it, Mirror.

389
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,020
Yes. Assemblyman. Talk to me.

390
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:32,090
Oh, the bomb didn't explode yet, I guess.

391
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:37,730
Why? Are you sorry for that?

392
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,520
You sound like you are relaxed. Then, I have something to discuss.

393
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,030
Go ahead.

394
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,320
Jae Ha left me a present.

395
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,740
The Kim Seok Han's memory card.

396
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,370
What are you going to do, Seong Won?

397
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,630
So?

398
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,060
That guy said, to save you from the bomb,

399
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,730
I have to reveal this to the world as soon as possible.

400
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,300
Did Jae Ha say that?

401
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,260
 He did. But... 

402
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,920
what should I do? Do it or not?

403
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,600
Are you crazy to think of revealing it?

404
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,260
Don't worry about Seong Won.

405
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,140
He won't let the bomb explode.

406
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,260
Then,

407
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,540
With this opportunity, I have to give a good lesson to Park Gwan Soo and the consortium.

408
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:49,420
No, not me. You

409
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,290
call the Chairman Park in Jin Han Co. in person.

410
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,800
If they don't listen to us, we will destroy Park Gwan Soo

411
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,570
with the consortium as well as JB Group.

412
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,910
If you call them, it will look more realistic. Don't you think?

413
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:12,390
You are exactly how my wife should be.

414
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,300
How about Jae Ha?

415
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,100
What about him?

416
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,570
How was his condition?

417
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:25,260
Well, he didn't look great.

418
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,800
Where did he...? No.

419
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,880
I will see you at home later.

420
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:43,870
I guess Park Gwan Soo will resign as a candidate for President soon without a fuss.

421
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:49,030
What are you going to do, Seong Won? How about just blowing up everything?

422
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:52,800
And then, should I start all over to establish JB?

423
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,410
Cancel the press conference.

424
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,990
And call Chairman Park in Jin Han Co.

425
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,800
Ah, yes.

426
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:24,720
Hello, Chairman Park. I got to possess a very interesting thing.

427
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,860
That's called Kim Seok Han's memory card.

428
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,700
Whoa, why are you so surprised?

429
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,690
As I heard, you are the member of the consortium as well.

430
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:42,600
Shall we see each other face to face with the other members?

431
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,960
What? Jang Se Joon has the memory card?

432
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,600
Gosh, did you check the content as well?

433
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,050
Oh, my. Then...

434
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,390
Gosh. I got it. Okay, I got it for now.

435
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,510
Jeez, this is a big mess.

436
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:09,570
- Then, Kim Jae Ha bastard gave that to Assemblyman Jang.
- Yes.

437
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:14,700
He is suspicious. He seems to play with double faces with Choi Yoo Jin.

438
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,300
Turn the car around. Turn around.

439
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,740
- And you!
- Yes.

440
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,540
Mobilize the team members at my hideout to capture him.

441
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,390
Aright. I got it.

442
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,110
Wait a sec. To Jang Se Joon,

443
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,870
- he has a daughter called Anna, doesn't he?
- Yes.

444
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,330
Call Police Chief to get her.

445
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,800
Yes. I will.

446
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,260
Jang Se Joon or Kim Jae Ha.

447
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,450
Let's bury them all tonight. Bury them all!

448
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,970
Miss, please turn off the phone for safety reason. Thank you.

449
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,690
Okay.

450
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,680
♬  As if lighting the way   ♬

451
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:33,490

452
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:41,770

455
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,500
♬   I can't move  ♬

456
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,790

459
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,060

460
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,010

♬   Maybe you it's you?   ♬

462
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,830
 We are about to depart. 

463
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:24,010
Wait a minute. Please cooperate. By any chance...

464
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:28,180
That person over there.

465
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,700
Miss Go Anna?

466
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,240
Please come with me.

467
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:12,170
We've been tricked. Kim Jae Ha is in. Everyone scatter and find him!

468
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,950
Drop the gun.

469
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,110
Stick it.

470
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,370
Stick it.

471
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,360
Stick it.

472
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,220
What is this? Where is Park Gwan Soo?

473
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,540
He asked me to give this message.

474
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,220
If you want to keep your girlfriend alive, give up the memory card.

475
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,660
What did you... what did you say now?

476
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:09,070
Your girlfriend, Go Anna.

477
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,800
Tell me straight up, bastard.

478
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,230
We got her at the airport while trying to leave the country.

479
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,550
Where is she now?

480
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,310
If you want to save your girl, the memory---

481
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:23,750
Tell me, bastard!

482
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,790
Ahh!! Please spare me. I'll tell you.

483
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,650
Tell me!

484
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,900
 - Hello? 
 - Mi Ran, it's me Kim Jae Ha. 

485
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,440
Where is Anna now?

486
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,250
Are you feeling alright?

487
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,890
Miss had just left the country.

488
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:49,540
I think Park Gwan Soo kidnapped her. Call the airport now and check it out.

489
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:53,150
Kidnap? Miss has been kidnapped?!

490
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,220
What are you talking about? What do you mean Miss is kidnapped?

491
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,040
We saw her going into the departure hall!

492
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,060
I don't know. Jae Ha thinks Park Gwan Soo kidnapped her and he's after him.

493
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:08,470
Hello! This is the airport, right? I want to check a name on the departure list.

494
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,290
What's with video chat?

495
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,900
Times like this, don't you think

496
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:23,490
seeing each other's face is better, Assemblyman Jang?

497
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,310
I guess you are in a hurry.

498
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,830
 Of course, I am in a hurry. 

499
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,680
It's a matter of someone's life or death.

500
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:39,250
Don't worry. Would I kill you or something?

501
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,780
 Me? 

502
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:45,430
Not me. Wait a sec.

503
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,600
 Dad! Dad! 

504
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,270
Anna.

505
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:08,520
Let's stop looking at a not so pleasant picture.

506
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,190
You... what the heck are you doing now?

507
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,950
 Now, now, now. Calm down. 

508
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,910
Explanation is not needed, right?

509
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:20,490
Assemblyman Jang. Bring Kim Seok Hwan's memory card.

510
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:23,610
Let's exchange it with your daughter.

511
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,720
 Come to Cloud 9 or whatever you call that place. 

512
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,930
I'll go with your daughter. Let's make the exchange there.

513
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:36,330
It is the enemy's territory, but the friendly have conquered the place.

514
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:40,500
 So it's fair, right? Assemblyman Jang, I don't 

515
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:46,700
kill a young girl or anything like...

516
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,470
I don't particularly like, but---

517
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,400
I'll be there.

518
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:01,110
Ah, I heard that memory card can't be copied.

519
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:06,510
But let's not do anything dirty because I'll check everything.

520
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:10,560
Now... I am on my way.

521
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,940
Now, then.

522
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,800
Uhm.

523
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,570
That girl... send her there.

524
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:37,070
Memory card, cloud or whatever and even the person

525
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:40,760
let's finish them all once for all.

526
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,410
Yeah.

527
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,600
 J4 

528
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,790
- Yeah. 
- Hello.

529
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:04,050
Jae Ha! A cop had come and got her just before departure. It seems Park Gwan Soo is telling the truth.

530
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,800
Understood.

531
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,640
Stop him!

532
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,860

No.

 Please help. Please help. Please spare me. Please spare me.

00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,100
Jae Ha.

555
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,000
What are you doing! Kill him!

556
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:00,900
Good!

557
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,480
Master!

558
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,180
Master.

559
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:10,210
- Miss. Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes.

560
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,990
Master.

561
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,590
Who the heck are you!

562
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:18,070
Miss.

- You go Miss. Hurry!

566
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:20,800
Be quiet.

567
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,420
 Mom? 

568
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,770
It's okay, okay.

569
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,040
You are surprised, right? I am sorry.

570
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:02,100
Was it you, Master?

571
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,310
That night... the person who put a hand over my mouth and shined the flashlight on me.

572
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:13,440
Miss.

573
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:18,440
That... That night.

574
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:27,130
Jae Ha. Don't be upset and let's talk it over, uh?

575
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:31,160
Let's t-t-talk it over.

576
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,690
Where is Anna?

577
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:37,510
A-Anna. She is where is it... t-that cloud 9...

578
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:40,560
She went there. Go there quickly.

579
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,440
- You drive. 
- Right now?

580
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,690
We can't go there now.

581
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:49,290
Why is that?

582
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,910
That's... The thing is...

583
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,060
No... that...

584
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:59,790
Bomb! The bomb will soon be exploding.

585
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:03,450
If it explodes, everyone there will die.

586
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,820
You can stop it.

587
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:07,010
That would be nice, but...

588
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:11,940
Once the bomb is activated, it can't be s-stopped.

589
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:15,980
Even Chairman Choi doesn't know about it.

590
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:32,100
No!!!!

 What the point of living? Let's just die here together. 

597
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:07,760
 Are you saying my Anna is being chased? 

598
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:12,180
 The bomb won't stop. 

599
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:15,860
 If Anna is captured as a hostage, don't you think he'll give up Seok Hwan's memory card? 

600
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:19,800
 Not sure. Would it be that easy? 

601
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,970
 You all must leave here now. 

602
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,920
  The bomb will go off at cloud 9. 

603
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,530
 Let go! Jae Ha! 

604
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,310
 I swear.
