 The K2

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,750
   
   I was falsely accused of murdering Rania. 

6
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,380
 and arrested by the police, but luckily, I escaped within a week. 

7
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,900
Save me. Save me.

[The man who witnessed presidential candidate Se Jun's rendevous is placed in harm's way because of Yoo Jin. 
 Don't mess with the people around me.

9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,450
The brakes aren't working! 
 

10
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,630
Other than me, there is another person who wants you dead.

11
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,190
 

12
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,560
As a husband who stayed up all night next to his sick wife, 
   

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,210
you need to look like this at least, right?

14
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,620
Wow, you're such "a wise mother and a good wife" indeed.

15
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,410
Ah, we don't have a kid, so the "wise mother" part needs to be removed though.

16
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,680
A  bodyguard?

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,310
I won't give my loyalty to anyone nowadays.  
  

18
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,470
Neither to the country nor any entity.

Kim Jae Ha? Come on, is it something like a henchman of JB?

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,200
Just... why don't you think of it as a subject of an empire?

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,620
An enemy's enemy is a friend, isn't it?   
  

23

If an appropriate time arrives, JSS will be your gun. 
 

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,360
You have to be the bullet.  I will pull the trigger.

25

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,500
What?  Oh, ramen ...

30
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,870
It is a meeting to elect a new chief director.

31
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,150
A meeting of the board of directors without me?  It's invalid.

32
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,750
The first agenda item is to pass the motion to fire Director Choi Yoo Jin.

33
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,300
But this child read my heart and mind.

34

But ... the child didn't need my command or permission 
  

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,400
He wasn't a hunting dog.  He is a wolf. 
  

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,810
I probably won't be able to tame him.

 - Cloud Nine?

What do you really want to hear from me?

39
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,700
Everything.  We'll start hunting now. Is this reason enough?

Oh no, I couldn't do that. How could I do that?

71

It's okay. We're going back to the safe house this afternoon anyway.

Head back first and prepare everything.

It's ok. I'll do it.

So, let me know if you need anything before then.

Is there nothing you need?

Ok, I guess you don't want anything.

Why?

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,520
Why did you bring my father to me?

87
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,760
To stop you from dying.

88
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,590
Why is it any of business of yours whether I live or die?

Do you have any idea how many people are suffering because of you?

Suffering?

I guess so. I'm sorry

92

for making villains like you suffer.

93
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,520
You're right, we're villains.

We're villains that are imprisoning and surveiling you.

95

However, it would be nice if you could acknowledge that we're also trying to protect you.

96
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:58,290
Is impersonating my father by cooking me ramen and buying me ice cream protecting me?

97

I don't need that so just leave.

98
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,830
Fine.

Promise?

Just how are you running your security?!

103
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,250
I apologize. It's my fault. I will take responsibility.

104
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,190
Responsibility? How?

105
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,490
I will resign.

106
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,190
Resign? Do you understand what that means?

107
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,640
Do you know what it means to resign from here?

108
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,150
I'll accept your decision.

109

And those bitches and bastards?

The police are pretending to investigate the incident, however...

111
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,150
However?

112
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,490
The people who tried to kill the assemblyman are now turning their back around

113
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,470
and that girl is now accusing him of sexual harassment.

114
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,930
They're asking for a confrontation with the  assemblyman.

115
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,300
  (During a criminal prosecution the accused may request confrontation with the accused) 

116
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,120
Fine, let them go without any charges.

117
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,800
I'll take care of them after they're released.

- Chief Kim, 
 - Yes.

119
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,740
You must get rid of that bodyguard who betrayed us.

120
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,820
That's the way you prevent others from doing that.

121
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,190
Chase him to the ends of the earth.

122
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,340
Yes, I'll do it per your instructions.

  the financial sector immediately. 

126
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,230
Don't worry about it. Everything he's saying is just for show.

127
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,040
If he messes with us, he will also...

128
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,730
 He's not in! You can't come in here! 

129
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,150
Due to suspicion of violations of the Electronic Financial Transaction Act, the Foreign Exchange Control Law

You have the right to remain silent and everything you say can be used against you in the court of law.

132
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,960
You have the right to retain a lawyer.

133

135
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,350
What brought you here?

136
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,840
From this point on, we are executing a seize and search warrant. Everyone put your hands down.

137
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,790
You over there! Put your hands down.

138
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,900
We are carrying out official duties.

139
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,930
Here he comes.

140
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,160
Assemblyman Jang, please give us a comment.

141
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,750
Are you confident about the prosecutor's investigation?

142
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,570
What do you think the result of the investigation will be?

143
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,940
Everyone, you're all working hard this morning.

144
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,130
I will honestly cooperate with their investigation and clear up everyone's worries.

145
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,360
Could you make a comment?

146
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,780
Please give us more comments.

147
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,960
Assemblyman, please, just one word.

148
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,830
How much did you get from them?

149
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,020
Did you get it or not?

150
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,990
How do you expect the investigation to go?

151
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,720
Please give us a comment!

152
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,130
Just one word, please!

153
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,760
Welcome. Please come this way.

154
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,410
I will.

155
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:24,980
We're not here to execute a search warrant forcefully.

156
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,930
We're here because the assemblyman volunteered to cooperate with the investigation so remember to mind your manners.

157
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,100
Yes sir.

158
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,480
Oh, have you arrived?

159
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,670
Madam, have you come to greet us?

160
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,460
I apologize for suddenly inconveniencing you.

161
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,920
What do you mean inconvenience? You're doing your official duty.

162
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,100
Please make yourselves comfortable.

163
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,870
To start, we've boxed up everything we could for you.

164
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,960
If you need anything further you can search the house.

165
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,250
You didn't have to do all this for us.

166
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,470
Oh also, did you all eat breakfast?

167
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,340
I've prepared some sandwiches on the kitchen table.

168
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,930
I made plenty so take your time and eat while you work.

169
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,030
Thank you very much.

170
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,680
What are you all doing. Go ahead and eat.

171
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,540
I've heard about Madam's famous cooking skills.

172
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,420
I consider this an honor.

173
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,280
- You're making me blush.
- Thank you.

174
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,070
- Come this way.
- Okay.

175
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,400
I prepared yours in my study room. Please come with me.

176
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,640
Shall we?

177
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,160
This study is elegant and dignified just like you.

178
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,500
Is that so? Thank you.

179
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,140
Please help yourself.

180
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,700
Thank you.

181
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,630
Is the investigation on the International Finance going well?

182
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,660
Ah, well.

183
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:09,240
The thing is, even though I know they are related to you,

184
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,080
the higher-ups have an extreme interest in investigating this case, so there's nothing much I can do.

185
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,050
Please investigate them with impartiality.

186
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,270
Yes?

187
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,530
Please consider the higher-ups' will is my will as well.

188
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,300
I understand.

189
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll do my best.

190
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,290
 The number you dialed is not connected... 

191
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,550
Are you still having trouble getting hold of the Chief Secretary?

192
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,270
This is just like Choi Yoo Jin.

193
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,340
In-law, this is not the time to laugh.

194
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,830
What would you rather have me do?

195
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,570
If you went after her uncle like that, then we...

196
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,500
She was able to do that because he's a small fish.

197
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,950
But if she messes with me or my son-in-law

198
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,060
then she would be forfeiting the election.

199
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,040
What money would she use to finance the campaign?

200
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,160
I can't let her do that.

201
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,070
She has such a fierce personality.

202
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,110
When she loses sight of reason she'll do anything to achieve her goal.

203
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,910
The problem is what happens after the election.

204
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,080
If we don't make ourselves secure before the day they enter the Blue House,

205
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,890
we will be in a really dangerous situation.

206
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,770
 Including the International Finance Corporation, Sambu Financial and others  

207
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,700
 under suspicion of 6 counts of corruption   

208
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,000
 will undergo a major investigation. 

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,570
 In addition, starting with Independent candidate Jang Se Joon, who is voluntarily undergoing investigation,  

210
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,340
 many politicians in the ruling and opposing parties will be under investigation. 

211
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:03,780
 Much attention is being put on the entire political community to see if this investigation will put them in distress. 

212
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,100
 On to the next news story. 

213
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,100
Besides the International Finance Co., they are all our sponsors.

214
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,440
And the investigation?

215
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,970
It's fine, you can talk.

216
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,200
On our side it looks like it may be Assemblyman Kim, Assemblyman Heo, and Assemblyman Song.

217
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,130
What?

218
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,310
With the guidelines issued it's clearly a targeted investigation.

219
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,240
Although I suspected it,

220
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,170
this blow hurts.

221
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,770
If we leave it this way, the confused assemblymen will become agitated.

222
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,280
Can you please leave the room?

223
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,550
Yes, please let me know when you're finished talking.

224
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,110
Min Cheol, is it that Jang Se Joon has nine lives?

225
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,690
Or are we just unlucky?

226
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,860
I apologize for saying this but I think the other side has an exceptional person on their side.

227
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,990
An exceptional person?

228
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,580
The person who tried to attack you last time...

229
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,240
Revolving door?

230
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,340
Mr. Prosecutor! Mr. Prosecutor!

231
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,510
Give us some comments.

232
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,870
How were they? Did they cooperate well?

233
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,850
Please go back.

234
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,710
Chief Park, are you really going to be like this?!

235
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:29,840
 Assemblyman, don't act this way towards a powerless person like me. 

236
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,660
Why don't you resolve this with my superiors?

237
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,510
Chief Prosecutor Park, you still have a lot of time left in your term; you should be smart about this.

238
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,620
Did you go blind from staring at the setting sun?

239
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,550
 Of course not. 

240
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,900
 I just wanted nature to take its course. 

241
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,350
Was it Chief Kim who laid down these guidelines?

242
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,230
Oh yes, I knew it would happen. I knew it.

243
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,040
Fine, so you can at least wait until the next guidelines are set.

244
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,650
 Well, it's not like we'll be starting new investigations. 

245
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,170
 In any case, within the next 3 days... 

246
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:09,070
Before then you better not mess with my assemblymen for your own good

247
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,670
as I'll be setting the next guidelines! I'm hanging up!

248
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,290
These guys, really.

249
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,760
What's happening with the police investigation?

250
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,610
They're saying that it's difficult to implicate Jang Se Joon...

251
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,280
You idiot!

252
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,860
I apologize.

253
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,200
We can't leave it like this.

254
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,160
I was saving this for the finals but I think I need to pull out the big guns.

255
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,750
  After putting together all the reports about Angel, it's clear that she made an appearance in Seochon. 

256
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,300
 Seok -Cho? Oh my God, that's where I live. 

257
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,130
 The majority of the sightings have been in the southern part of Seoul Forest. 

258
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,910
 Pay special attention to that location. 

259
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,790
 How about Busan? 

260
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,990
 The results of a photo examination show a 0% match  

261
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,190
 I see. 

262
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,470
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

263
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,970
 How about Naegok-dong? 

264
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,580
 You're the only person who has reported seeing her in Naegok-dong. 

265
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,090
 Please give up. 

266
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,390
Ah... I'm sure I saw her somewhere.

267
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,720
It appears that she was exposed to the public at the park yesterday.

268
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,530
- Where's Anna now?
- She's on her way back.

269
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,750
What should I do?

270
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,450
Isn't it the time to make your decision?

271
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,660
 You're right we are the villains. 

272
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,760
 We're villains that are imprisoning and surveilling you. 

273
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,510
 However, it would be nice if you could acknowledge that we're also trying to protect you 

274
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,090
 Anna, wake up! 

275
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,290
What kind of promise?

276
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,620
What did you promise to my father?

277
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,460
I did not lose my ears! And why don't you sit properly?

278
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,270
It's dangerous... really.

279
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,190
Your father asked me to protect you so I promised him that I will.

280
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,790
What more?

281
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,070
Anyway, since I promised yesterday, I will protect you from now on.

282
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:10,670
From now on, I won't let anybody hurt you.

283
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,830
- Even if it turns out to be Choi Yoo Jin.
- Did I ask to protect me?

284
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,730
Right, but even if your father asked me to protect you, still you are an adult.

285
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,540
If you don't want me to protect you, I will leave your side whenever.

286
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,160
If you don't like it, tell me right away. Got it?

287
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,670
Understand?

288
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,730
Okay.

289
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,630
# Isn't she the Barcellona's Angel?

290
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,900
What are you staring at?

291
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,990
I told you back then about Lafelt's Angel, she might be a Korean.

292
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,820
She kinda looks like her.

293
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,820
But isn't it bad to write an article with just this proof?

294
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,090
- Maybe?
- Yes...

295
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,200
Work hard!

296
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,380
Thank you. For listening to my father's request.

297
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,840
And also for bringing him to me so that I could find out the truth about him abandoning me and my mom.

298
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,130
Don't say stupid things.

299
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,330
- Because your dad did not abandon you. 
- Stupid things?

300
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,320
Who said that? Dad abandoned us!

301
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,590
When Mom died, when I was taken to Spain, he didn't appear!

302
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,100
You're right! Your dad is a very bad man, a very bad politician.

303
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,760
But if your father did, for real, abandon you,

304
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,530
you probably wouldn't be alive.

305
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,550
Since Choi Yoo Jin is not the type of person to rest her fate on someone with poor chances.

306
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:41,460
Therefore you should grow up and act like an adult.

307
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,990
if you want to be able to fight someone like Choi Yoo Jin and survive.

308
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,040
Oh my... Hey! Where are you?! Reporter Park!

309
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,970
If I catch you, I'll kill you! Come out right now!

310
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,760
How could you take it from me!

311
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,970
I'll come back soon.

312
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,720
Yes, come back safely.

313
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,530
- Get in. 
- Why?

314
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,640
Hey, who are you?

315
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,130
I... I apologize.

316
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,860
 That's Anna's predicament. 

317
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,700
 Rather than letting her be exposed to public, it is better to let her die. 

318
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,370
 In any case, if Anna goes around, causing trouble like that, 

319
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,800
 I am not sure if Choi Yoo Jin will let Anna live. 

320
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,320
What happened? Who was that guy?

321
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,660
It's nothing.

322
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,270
Freeze. Freeze!

323
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,860
Freeze.

324
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,920
What's that?

325
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,040
- Go. 
- Go?

326
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,120
You don't know the game "Freeze and Go?".

327
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,070
You stop when I say "Freeze" and you move at "Go". "Freeze and Go" game.

328
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,130
Here, Go.

329
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,120
Great job.

330
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,130
Next...

331
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,020
- Sit down.
- What?

332
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,400
Sit down.

333
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,780
Like this?

334
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,490
So obedient. That's fine.

335
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,830
What are you doing?

336
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,220
Mutt training.

337
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,630
What?

338
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,130
Freeze.

339
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,610
Go.

340
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,230
Freeze.

341
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,250
Go.

342
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,610
Freeze. Freeze!

343
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,960
 I ask o you this favor. 

344
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes... I lived long enough.

345
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,690
Hello, is this the entertainments department?

346
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,280
About that Barcelona Angel,

347
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,980
I know really well who she is.

348
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,660
Yes, right. It's true!

349
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,580
I'm telling you it's for certain!

350
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,750
Why would I make this up?

351
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,830
She's Anna! The movie star Eom Hye Rin's daughter.

352
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,120
Who am I? Oh, my...

353
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,430
It's not polite to ask those sorts of things.

354
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:02,420
I'm hanging up! I have to call other newspapers as well. I am busy!

355
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,420
Aigoo!

356
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,040
 Now, are you really going to keep saying that she's not in Naegok-dong? 

357
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,910
 - Wow!
- You found her! It's a 100% match! 

358
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,280
 - Amazing!
- It's Naegok-dong! 

359
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,480
 Please share the location with us! 

360
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,960
 The address is Naegok-dong 3589-1. Come quick. 

361
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,260
 You can meet Angel 

362
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,440
 Yay! Let's go! 

363
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,030
You upload the address.

364
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:34,290
If you get people to gather in front of the house in an hour's time, I'll let you take a picture with her. Understand?

365
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,060
Hooray!

366
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,440
What?

367
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,490
This article broke out.

368
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,810
Now they even know her address.

369
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,060
Move Anna away, hurry!

370
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:58,320
That... the internet users and reporters are already surrounding her house.

371
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,600
Listen up to what I have to say.

372
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,930
- Hello.
- Yes, Madam?

373
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,080
Where are you now?

374
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,150
I'm going to the safe house.

375
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,610
You know what you must do, correct?

376
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,130
What more do I have to wait for?

377
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,120
Shouldn't I just start preventing people from talking?

378
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,530
Yes. Do not fail me.

379
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,570
 Yes. 
 But Madam?

380
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,970
Yes?

381
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:56,230
I need you to authorize me on a matter.

382
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,390
What is it?

383
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,950
I will make my decision at the site

384
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:05,090
as I watch the situation.... But just in case...

385
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,670
Just in case?

386
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,870
If Anna is revealed to the public,

387
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,900
is it ok if I take care of it myself before I report back to you?

388
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,870
Isn't that obvious? Why ask?

389
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,350
It's a hundred times easier to take care of a dead dog than a barking dog!

390
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,300
 Yes, I understand. 

391
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:29,600
But I don't think Assemblyman is on the same page.

392
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,280
Call the strike team captain.

393
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,920
Are you trying to bargain with me right now?

394
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,430
 It's not like that, Madam. 

395
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:53,000
Doing something to the daughter of a person who will become president

396
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,380
is making me nervous.

397
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,060
Yes, Manager Ju.

398
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,820
He's right next to me now.

399
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,630
I understand. I'll be on standby.

400
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,460
The person you need to be scared of right now is me.

401
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,280
Of course! If it is your order,

402
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,730
I would do it by any means.

403
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,370
I'll see that for myself when I get there. I'm on my way.

404
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,100
- Cancellation of standby. Let's go.
- Okay.

405
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,150
I'm at Naegok-dong 3589-1.

406
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,570
Find me the identity of the person who owns the house.

407
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,410
Also, look into her connection with Eom Hye Rin.

408
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,280
Okay.

409
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,610
What should I do, Manager?

410
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,020
What are you saying? Close all the doors and wait quietly.

411
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,640
Hello? Hello?!

412
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,200
Yes, Manager?

413
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,750
President Gook is on his way over there.

414
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:13,540
He's with the strike team. Assemblyman Jang is in the Public Prosecutor's Office and I can't make any movements.

415
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:21,350
Sergeant Kim, now Anna is in your hands.

416
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:34,020
Your mission is to prevent the media from making contact with the target

417
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,440
Especially if the target starts talking about her father,

418
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,270
you must kill her by any means.

419
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,590
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes!

420
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,280
We're about to arrive.

421
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,730
When we get out of the car, everyone must move quickly to their appointed positions.

422
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,450
Yes!

423
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,540
You, go to the closest distance to the target and be on standby.

424
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,410
If remote interception does not work, eliminate the target from a close range.

425
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,380
After the elimination, quickly leave the site

426
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,900
and remain on standby at BT.

427
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,480
Yes.

428
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,160
If by chance you are captured, you don't know me, understand?

429
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,080
Yes.

430
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,040
Get up. It's time now.

431
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,750
Hey, don't worry.

432
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,300
You can do it.

433
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,250
Oh! Someone's coming out!

434
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,000
Wow! Oh!

435
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,120
Geez, what's up with her!

436
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,720
It's not me. I'm not her.

437
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,160
My Miss will come out in a minute.

438
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,480
Wooow!

439
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,550
But I have a favor to ask you, that's why I came out like this.

440
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,070
You can take photos but

441
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:14,020
you can't have your flash on. Never!

442
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,120
She really hates flashing cameras, you know?

443
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,800
Sure! Don't worry.

444
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,880
Yes, thank you.

445
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,870
I'm leaving it to you.

446
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,380
 Alright. 

447
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,520
Shooter 1. Ready.

448
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,590
Miss. It's now your turn.

449
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,330
Be strong!

450
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,960
Freeze?

451
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,580
Target in position.

452
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,230
 Ready, 

453
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,820
Go.

454
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,660
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

455
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,980
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

456
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,160
♫  Run, run. I'm fine.  ♫

457
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,670
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

458
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:53,970
♫  Look out. Look out. Look out. Look out.  ♫

459
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,250
Oh! It's the angel!

460
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:04,230
The angel has finally appeared!

461
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:09,530
Wow! So beautiful!

462
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,960
Please look this way!

463
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,480
You're so pretty!

464
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,010
Wow. This is so awesome.

465
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,060
Please look over here!

466
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,600
Wow, so pretty. We love you!

467
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,640
Awesome

468
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,850
Wow, we love you!

469
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,370
You're so pretty!

470
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,340
Look over here!

471
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:36,140
Hey, hey, hey. Quiet! Quiet!

472
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,190
Hello,

473
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:59,960
I am the daughter of the deceased Eom Hye Rin, Go Anna.

474
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,490
Your voice is beautiful.

475
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,650
Wow.

476
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,200
Wow!

477
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,770
Are you the Barcelona Angel?

478
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:13,880
I'm no angel, but the fact was right that I was in Barcelona.

479
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,940
Woah, it's her! It's her!

480
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,510
Then what is your nationality?

481
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,850
Ah, and who is your father?

482
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,210
Shoot!

483
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,300
Right now! Shoot!

484
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,160
- My nationality is Korean,
- Wow! A Korean!

485
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,440
and my father is...

486
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,430
You can't.

487
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,210
my father is...

488
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,070
the deceased movie director, Go Joon Ho.

489
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,670
Oh, a movie director?

490
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,570
Wow, so cool.

491
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,280
 What are you doing right now? 

492
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,030
 Not sure. I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. 

493
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,890
Hey, what are you doing? Stop using flash!

494
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:39,720
Stop it! Don't use it!

495
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,640
Stop using flash!

496
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,680
Stop it! Stop it!

497
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,780
The lady said not to use flash!

498
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,750
Miss! Miss!

499
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,490
Anna! Anna!

500
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,020
Anna, stay with me! Anna, stay with me!

501
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,440
Anna, are you okay?

502
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,370
Anna, come to your senses!

503
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:21,460
Please stop it! My child is sick!

504
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,730
Anna! Anna, are you okay?

505
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,750
Those two haven't done anything wrong.

506
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,290
It was all done by my command.

507
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,930
Yes, Madam. We thought it was from you.

508
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,700
Shut up!

509
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,720
Why did you do such a thing?

510
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:02,050
Isn't it better this way? Instead of the angel dying in front of them?

511
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,920
Then why didn't you report in advance?

512
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,440
It's true,

513
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,880
if she died, it would've been a hassle.

514
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:21,370
Alright, you handled today quickly and well.

515
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,000
Good job.

516
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,570
Madam, it's a lie. You can't fall for it.

517
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:35,400
It's fine. I can just kill her tomorrow, then.

518
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,770
Isn't that right?

519
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,720
You guys did a good job today, too.

520
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,420
Thank you, Madam.

521
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,670
Thank you.

522
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:07,500
Will you please excuse us? I need to speak with this guy.

523
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:24,100
Take a seat.

524
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:36,330
You've had a busy two days, rescuing the Assemblyman Jang from Park Gwan Soo,

525
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:43,310
and rescuing Anna from my grasp.

526
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,490
But

527
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,330
are you really going to keep cleaning after childish people only?

528
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,660
Have you given up on Raniya's revenge?

529
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,070
Since they started their first move already,

530
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:09,690
I want to pull the trigger now.

531
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,560
Madam, it's definitely a lie. They must've planned it toget—

532
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,270
I know!
-What?

533
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:30,180
Are you stupid? Why would you argue there? Do you still not know the difference between being fooled and letting myself be fooled?

534
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,620
Anna is already wielding the knife.

535
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:49,240
 Recently, the famous designer, Jean Paul LaFelt 

536
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:53,280
 uploaded a post gaining netizen attraction, nicknamed "Barcelona Angel" 

537
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,200
 She has recently been found to have been of Korean descent. 

538
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,670
 The person of interest, Go Anna, has been found to be the daughter of the deceased movie director Go Yoon Ho 

539
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:05,080
  and the deceased actress Eom Hye Rin, and has gained more interest. 

540
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,570
 In addition, Go Anna has been 

541
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,580
Anna?

542
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:14,020
 ... under the care of Senator Jang's wife, Choi Yoo Jin. We are curious about their relationship. 

543
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,200
We can live!

544
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,560
 This is the next story... 

545
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:31,470

00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,530
Oh my, mommy!

578
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,780
What are you doing here?

579
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:15,960
Oh, you know, just...

580
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,560
Doesn't it hurt?

581
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,040
It doesn't hurt.

582
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,060
It looks like you're hurt. Are you okay?

583
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,970
Yeah, I'm okay.

584
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,870
Hey, you really! So dangerous up here!

585
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,070
I'm going.

586
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,680
Don't go.

587
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,440
What?

588
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,850
Stay for a bit and then go.

589
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:58,560
Don't stand. If you fall off it's dangerous. It's dangerous even if you slip.

590
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,670
Just like you slipped before and cracked the tiles.

591
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:04,800
Hey, it's not dangerous! I'm not in any danger at all.

592
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,680
It hurts, doesn't it?

593
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,430
It doesn't hurt.

594
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,620
Thank you.

595
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,500
For everything. All of it.

596
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:38,130
For the train station in Barcelona, the ramen, the ice cream,

597
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:43,050
for bringing my dad,

598
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:47,430
for earlier today, and for right now.

599
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:52,030
♫   Seeing you is painful for me   ♫

600
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:56,310
Well, I mean, all those things are, uh,

601
00:55:56,310 --> 00:56:01,190
you know, things you should be thanking me for.

602
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:02,160
What?

603
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,970
Be grateful to me.

604
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,900
♫   Every so often I used to cry silently   ♫

605
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:16,360
From now on, your life will be different. You've started getting the interest of many people.

606
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,840
♫   Every so often I used to think of you   ♫

607
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,760
From now on, if you have somewhere you want to go, you can go there.

608
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,480
If you have something you want to do, you can do it all you want.

609
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:31,530
And if you want to be by yourself, there isn't anyone to stop you.

610
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:36,910
But, you can't be alone.

611
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,330
The moment you walk away from the crow

612
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,360
that's when you'll die.

613
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:53,400
The reason you've survived up to now is because Choi Yoo Jin didn't need to be wary of you.

614
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,690
But now, the situation's changed a lot.

615
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:03,850
You have become Choi Yoo Jin's most vulnerable point now.

616
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:08,580
With your one word, she can lose everything.

617
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:19,190
From the outside, she'll try to win you over. But once people's interest in you fades,

618
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:24,550
Choi Yoo Jin will aim for that moment.

619
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,990
Then, what if I first

620
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,130
reveal that Jang Se Joon is my father?

621
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:34,540
Then you'll become a child that ruins her father's life.

622
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,940
Will you be okay with that?

623
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,200
I understand now.

624
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:50,000
That's why mother died too. She was afraid that my politician dad would be ruined because of her.

625
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,420
On the day that my mom died,

626
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:00,050
she was expecting that my dad would come. Like an idiot.

627
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,520
On that day, my dad was supposed to come

628
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:07,980
but in the end he didn't come.

629
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:14,760
That's when my mom started drinking. Just like all the other days my dad couldn't come.

630
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:24,630
 Hey, Jang Se Joon. You said you'd come. 

631
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,350
 You said you would come today. 

632
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,580
 Alright. 

633
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:39,450
 Those words were right. You never had any intention of coming to America with me. 

634
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:46,520
 Being an Assemblyman? Is it that good? 

635
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:54,850
 Now, I'm going to tell the whole world! 

636
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:59,590
 Politics? I don't give a crap! 

637
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:04,600
 But she knew she couldn't. 

638
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:12,100
I hated seeing the image of my mom drinking.

639
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:18,940
I was sick of the smell of her alcohol, the sweat, the tears. And when she went to her room,

640
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,510
she would drag me in and cry herself to sleep.

641
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:23,900
 Mommy 

642
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:28,790
Sometimes, I thought: because mom is like this,

643
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:33,060
daddy must not want to come home.

644
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:41,090
 That's right. My Anna. To mommy, she has her Anna. 

645
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:44,160
 My lovely daughter. 

646
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,100
 Come to mommy. 

647
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,120
But I didn't go to her.

648
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,630
 Do you not like mommy? 

649
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,750
 You smell. Alcohol smell. 

650
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,660
 I'm sorry. 

651
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:06,130
 But, mommy is so sad. She's so sad so that's why. Because she's so sad. 

652
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:12,550
 Anna, mommy is so sad. 

653
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:17,260
 Can Anna hug Mommy very tight? 

654
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:24,030
I didn't hug her. That day I just thought that Mom

655
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:28,460
I just thought that Mom was drunk.

656
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:40,700
Mom, Mom I'm so sorry.

657
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,590
Mom

658
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:49,530
I did wrong. Mom,

659
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,670
It's okay.

660
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,280
It's just that you were very young.

661
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:10,860
It's just... that you were young. It's okay. It's okay.

662
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,330
No, it's not.

663
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:18,150
I was so bad.

664
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:23,030
If I think about what I did next,

665
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,630
 Mommy, take this. 

666
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:39,430
 My Anna, you must not like me crying. Do you want me to sleep a very very long time? 

667
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:46,330
 Yes. I don't like seeing this. I want you to sleep without waking up. Please. 

668
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:50,570
 I wish I could sleep for a very very long time too. 

669
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:59,860
 Mommy, take this and sleep. When Dad comes, I'll wake you up. 

670
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:10,610
 When Dad comes? Then I'll have to sleep a very long time. 

671
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:47,930
I.. I killed my mom like that!

672
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:51,030
I killed my mom!

673
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,370
I'm sorry!

674
01:02:56,090 --> 01:03:00,960
If I had known that was the last time I'd see her...

675
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:12,500
Mommy, it was my fault.

676
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:19,720
♬ When she sees a beautiful flower ♬

677
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:26,620
♬ He whispers something in her ear ♬

678
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:32,820
♬ To get the beautiful flower ♬

679
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:41,860
♬ Without ceasing, treading in the deep forest ♬

680
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:11,170
Elder, the chief of police is here.

681
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:13,020
Send him in.

682
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:20,340
Party Leader, have you been well?

683
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:20,990
Take a seat.

684
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,190
Yes sir. Thank you.

685
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,160
- You seem you are doing great.
- Pardon?

686
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:34,800
Ah, yes. All thanks to you, Party Leader.

687
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:39,120
Since you have great insurance, you must feel very assured.

688
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:43,150
What? What insurance do I have?

689
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:47,960
Me, and Jang Se Joon. Both sides of the coin.

690
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:54,090
No, Party Leader, what insurance would I have apart from you?

691
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,940
It's fine, it's fine. Did you bring it?

692
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,970
Oh, yes. Here it is.

693
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:11,860
Right now, he's registered under the alias of Kim Jae Ha.

694
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:16,540
That guy was a mercenary in Iraq, but murdered a citizen and then escaped.

695
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:23,340
Right now, Interpol is looking for him.

696
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,630
Iraq? Blackstone?

697
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:39,700
No, Blackstone?

698
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:44,190
No way!

699
01:05:54,740 --> 01:06:00,280
♫  My heart is aching and I can't breathe  ♫

700
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:06,420
♫  I can't touch you who have turned cold  ♫

701
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:12,580
♫  No matter how I try to reach, you who are going farther away again  ♫

702
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:16,170
♫  are spending the day in tears  ♫

703
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:20,090
♫  I can only stare at your back blankly.Eveyday.  ♫
