Are you crazy! You can't call 911!

16
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,220
President, JSS's ambulance would take too long. We have no time!

17
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,230
We can't! I've already cancelled the 911 call. Wait for the JSS ambulance!

Hey, what are you doing? Why isn't the ambulance coming?!

Ugh, I'm going to go crazy!

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,940
Get her in! Hurry!

29
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,200
Get out of the way.

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,520
You, get out.
-What?
-I said get out!

31
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,060
This is K2, we are en route to the closest hospital.

32
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,460
We can't go to the hospital. Go to the JSS infirmary.

33
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,320
What? We can't go that far in this situa—

34
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,930
Shut up and step on it! If we go to a hospital, we're all dead.

What is it? What's the rush?

43
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,900
You were totally acting pretty! This is photoshopped right?

44
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,540
  Episode 7  
No, I didn't! 
-You totally did.

45
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,260
Totally pretty... where have I seen her?

46
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,150
What do you mean? You're sitting right next to her.

47
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,650
No! The girl sitting behind you.

48
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,190
I've seen her a lot somewhere.

49
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,190
Isn't it her? That angel! The one Jean Paul LaFelt is looking for.

50
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,800
No way, I don't think so.

51
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,670
She's in Korea? Wasn't she in Spain?

52
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,170
I don't think so... she totally looks like her.

53
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,380
Oh! I can put it up online.

55
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,860
Jae Ha, please wait outside.
-What?

56
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,270
Oh, alright.

57
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,330
I said to wait outside! If you stay here, you only get in the way of treatment.

58
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,030
I understand.

59
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,270
 Hurry and take this, before it melts. 

60
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,330
 This is what your father told me to give you. 

61
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,820
 Really? This is what Dad sent? 

62
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,190
 Of course. 

63
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,310
 Alright. 

64
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,120
 If it's what Dad sent, I have to eat it. 

65
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,160
 It's good.

Are you alright? Miss, are you alright?

79
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,770
Please calm down.

80
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,540
Are you uncomfortable anywhere?

81
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,490
Where is this?

82
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,170
This is JSS's infirmary.

83
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,510
The guards brought you here.

84
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,320
If you were only a little later, it would have been bad.

89
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,300
Unni! What happened?

90
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,650
Her allergy improved a lot.

91
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,400
Don't we need to move her to a hospital?

92
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,290
I'm a doctor too. And plus, the equipment here is better than any hospital emergency room.

93
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,700
Although, if we give her medicine, her body will get better, but the problem is her state of mind.

94
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,330
I'm concerned about what she'll do in her mental state.

95
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,600
In the end, she'll need some psychological treatment.

96
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,140
You'll need to watch her well.

97
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,320
But Unni, did she mention me?

98
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,410
That I bullied her or something?

99
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,240
What kind of nonsense—

100
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,900
Do you think that's on her mind right now?

101
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,200
Why was the ambulance sent back?

102
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,720
Manager Ju!

103
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:22,530
Gosh. I was trying to get some shut eye before starting the night shift. Jeez.

104
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,970
That is Anna's predicament:

105
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,170
it is better to let her die than publicly expose her to others.

106
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,680
Do you get it now?

107
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,000
On top of that, if you brought her strawberries like today,

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,790
and she ate that even knowing she would die

109
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,290
where would there be a better opportunity for some people?

110
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,370
No matter that he is an assemblyman, he couldn't blame anyone else for the situation.

111
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,110
Who is it? The one who sent the ambulance back?

112
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,860
What are you going to do about it?

113
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,770
No matter what you do, Anna's predicament won't change.

114
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,830
The only thing you can do is to make sure guarding Anna does not fail under any circumstance.

115
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:10,960
If you had brought Anna into a hospital earlier, everyone would have died:

116
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,970
the guards, even MI Ran, Mrs. Chef,  the ER doctors and even the nurses.

117
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,090
Anyone who saw Anna.

118
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,930
Of course, you might be exempt. Since you're a Cloud 9 member.

119
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,030
Have you forgotten already? About why the old orchard farmers almost died?

120
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,190
You being like this... isn't normal.

121
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,540
If they find out you're acting like this, protecting Anna will become harder!

122
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,500
If you really want to protect Anna, act naturally.

123
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,340
You are dismissed.

124
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,910
That girl's kind of pitiable.

125
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,370
You should be nice to her.

126
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,030
Do you know her? Anna?

127
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,180
I don't know her well.

128
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,080
I just know she got bad parents,

129
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,220
so that young'un gets dragged around to different countries.

130
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,100
Yeah, she definitely got bad parents.

131
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,300
Why did her father become a presidential candidate.

132
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:32,190
Who is her father? Her surname is Go! Go Anna.

133
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,950
According to official records, Jang Se Joon isn't her father.

134
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,030
Go?

135
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,920
You didn't know?

136
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,650
She's from a "Go" family.

137
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,730
A long time ago, there was a man with the surname Go who was a director. An American.

138
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,660
That's the guy her mom, Eom Hye Rin, married.

139
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,430
So then... Jang Se Joon got involved with a married woman and then Anna—

140
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,620
No, that's not it!

141
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,260
It's just complicated. All this to say...

142
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,770
I've lived a long time. So what happened was

143
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,460
she definitely went to America to get married,

144
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,500
but she went when she was already pregnant

145
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,850
with Jang Se Joon's child!

146
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,520
Do you understand what I'm saying?

147
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,280
She probably didn't even know about her pregnancy.

148
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,270
But later, I don't know if she got kicked out or what.

149
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,260
But one day, the Eom Hye Rin who was in America

150
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,510
showed up in front of Jang Se Joon with a young Anna,

151
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,050
who by that time was happily married with Choi Yoo Jin.

152
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,830
You get what I'm saying?

153
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,450
So Jang Se Joon, without Choi Yoo Jin's knowledge,

154
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:47,880
had a second family.

155
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,580
Gosh, but that child ended up having a bad fate.

156
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,870
In the end, her mother died of an accidental death.

157
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,700
After that, Anna immediately got taken overseas.

158
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,580
That's why I'm saying she's pitiable.

159
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,420
An accidental death?

160
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,890
Huh?

161
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:11,150
Oh, I mean if not a suicide, then it's an accidental death. Right?

162
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,010
But in any case, if Anna keeps going on like that,

163
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,160
I don't think Choi Yoo Jin will leave her be.

164
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,180
Have you given it any thought?

165
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,950
Why are you in such a rush? Let's start with a meal.

166
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,040
The acorn jelly here is very good.

167
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,590
You probably don't have much time.

168
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,560
Lame duck started a long time ago.

169
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,930
The President doesn't seem to trust

170
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,060
you or Assemblyman Jang Se Jin yet.

171
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,530
Even if he rallies the party members to help you win the election, once you get into the Blue House,

172
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,120
you'd stab the former President in the back to save yourselves---

173
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,330
It's not that the chief is testing the waters first?

174
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,600
While I'm grasping the situation at hand, these are the things that are happening around the President.

175
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,790
Of course, it's not including the things that have already come to light.

176
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,210
Are you threatening me?

177
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,360
This is Pyeong Chang Scholarship Foundation, 
 Pyeongchang Scholarship Foundation Internal Material (Confidential) 

178
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,210
and JB Group's corruption catalogue.
 JB Group Accounting Funds
Confidential 

179
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,140
All In!

180
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,790
With these, you have more than enough to destroy me.

181
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,660
So what you're saying... is to share each others' weaknesses.

182
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,540
Yes. If it's to this extent,

183
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,130
will we be able to make a deal?

184
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,900
Indeed!

185
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,230
I apologize, we are closed for today.

186
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,320
C'mon. There are still people inside. The lights are even on.

187
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,650
Those people will be our last guests today.

188
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:26,570
Come on, let us drink some rice wine before we leave.

189
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,130
Must you go in?

190
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,430
Hey, this place

191
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,730
must really do well. They even turn away guests. Let's go.

192
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,190
Yes, it's me.

193
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,160
The reason that Chairman Choi fears his sister, I finally understand.

194
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,590
That's a compliment, right?

195
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,140
Oh, of course!

196
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,890
Would I dare treat the person who will become the most powerful in the entire country in the future  any differently?

197
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,650
It's definitely a compliment.

198
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,190
Those words sound like a tease.

199
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,270
The most powerful person, would be my husband.

200
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,830
What?

201
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,770
Oh, is that so?

202
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,330
Yes?

203
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,140
So, when would you like to begin your Party entrance?

204
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,730
Hmmm, well

205
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,430
we can't make a boring entrance.

206
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,240
We're planning out the scenario.

207
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,390
Before that, we'd like for you to make a way.

208
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,160
Is that so? I got it.

209
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,800
Conversation went...

210
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,060
well, didn't it?

211
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,080
Does it look like that?

212
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,200
Congratulations, Madam.

213
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,330
Thank you

214
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:39,090
It's a wonderful night!

215
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,360
Am I not funny?

216
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,930
What?

217
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,870
Do you think they'll really make a party entrance?

218
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,490
It seems so. When the country is in chaos,

219
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,230
the rotten politician and dirty businessmen will have a field day with the government.

220
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,870
I've warned him so much.

221
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,890
Yet he still in colluding with them.

222
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:31,440
Then I'll tweak the internal structure of the party and set the party's primary election in a hurry.

223
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,090
We shouldn't make him come there.

224
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,480
What?

225
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,350
The person who is cutting out the rotten and dirty parts

226
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,930
is the hero in  troubled times.

227
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,150
Jang Se Jin, where is that clown, you said?

228
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,830
Assemblyman,

229
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,270
the madam has just ended her conversation.

230
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,020
Looking at your expression, it seems to have gone well.

231
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,770
Yes.

232
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,990
Alright. Well, then, shouldn't we change the content of tonight's concert?

233
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,010
We can't talk too brashly about the presidency.

234
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:23,590
Right? Why don't we start out a little softly? I'll go ahead and change the interview questions.

235
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,110
Alright. Go ahead.

236
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,700
Yeah.

237
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,560
Sincere congratulations, madam.

238
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,330
Congratulations for what.

239
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,890
How is that child doing?

240
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,450
Yes, she's at the infirmary.

241
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,040
Really? She really came back alive then.

242
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
I apologize.

243
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,720
What are you apologetic for? It's all her fate.

244
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,240
Where is the infirmary?

245
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,230
What? Are you going to meet her?

246
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,480
Yes.You go ahead to Cloud 9.

247
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,060
Where is it?

248
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,070
Oh, I will take you.

249
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,120
Status? Can she talk?

250
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,240
Yes.

251
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,880
Her body's stabilized a lot, but a suicide attempt like today

252
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,540
will need psychiatric help—

253
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,720
At a hospital? Forget it.

254
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,080
Just watch her better! So she can't do anything stupid.

255
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,190
Please step outside for a moment.

256
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,310
Oh, yes.

257
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,960
Hey, follow me!

258
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,270
Hospital?! Jeez.

259
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,670
What?

260
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,890
A nun's habit seemed to fit you well this afternoon.

261
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,740
Your singing was also moving.

262
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,610
Is it something you learned at the convent?

263
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:08,340
But I'm curious. What the hell were you expecting, coming to that place?

264
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,840
Were you thinking that I've been blocking your reunion this entire time?

265
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,860
You saw for yourself at the cathedral right?

266
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,160
 Dad 

267
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,230
 Why is Anna... 

268
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:48,180
Your father has no desire to meet you.

269
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,560
Your father will never show up in front of you.

270
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,480
Like the day that your mother, Eom Hye Rin, died, and the day you left for Spain,

271
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,320
he will not appear in front of you.

272
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,990
It must hurt. Yeah,

273
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,430
so you must want to deny it.

274
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:16,040
But this is reality. Your father is normally just like that.

275
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,620
I, too, know because I've been a daughter.

276
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,060
To daughters, fathers have

277
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,720
a bit of a special feeling.

278
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,490
But fathers are just all like that.

279
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,170
Those people don't really know how we feel.

280
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,610
To you... your father

281
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,900
must have been all you're living for.

282
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,680
But you're not everything to your father.

283
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,280
You're just a very small, and a very burdensome past.

284
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,960
Then let me meet my father. I'll ask him myself, and—

285
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,550
But how? Do you want me to drag him in here?

286
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,130
No matter how loving our marriage is, we have our etiquette.

287
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,880
Your father doesn't want to meet you. What do you want me to do about it?

288
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:26,300
Dad... doesn't love you.

289
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Did your mother say that to you?

290
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,490
That's right. I understand your mother's heart.

291
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,800
How much she must've hated me. But Anna,

292
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,560
you were so young back then. You didn't know much about your mother.

293
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,810
It's hard for us to understand,

294
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:06,370
but do you know what life goals a politician has?

295
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,220
It's to be re-elected in the next election year.

296
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:14,760
Your father wasn't an exception, but do you know what your mother said?

297
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,630
Your mother, set you up

298
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,020
and used you to blackmail him. Right before an election year.

299
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,100
To you...

300
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:32,050
she might have been a good mother, but well,

301
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,820
it must have been hard for you too, with a drug-addicted alcoholic mother.

302
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,840
Why else would a young child give her mother pills with her own hands?

303
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,540
No! My mother didn't die from the painkillers I brought her.

304
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:52,170
There was someone else in that house. They tried to kill me too.

305
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,830
So then,

306
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,260
was that me?

307
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,800
Anna, your memory is lying to you.

308
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,390
The truth is too horrific.

309
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:15,070
However, this is reality. Your mother

310
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,250
died after she took the pills you gave her.

311
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,400
LIes. I heard it all from my nanny!

312
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,250
Your nanny? Oh, the person inside that nursing home earlier?

313
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,830
Your old housekeeper?

314
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,920
Anna, if I killed your mother,

315
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,450
and if that nanny knew about everything, would I have left her to live?

316
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,130
Please stop now.

317
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,160
Anna is very sick.

318
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,790
Indeed,

319
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:15,260
today I must have said a lot of unnecessary things to a sick child.

320
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:20,090
Okay, Anna. Since you've been running around since dawn,

321
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,350
you must be tired. Rest up.

322
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,070
Take care of your body!

323
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,400
Come to Cloud 9.

324
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,670
Don't cry. And wait.

325
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,190
I'll bring your father.

326
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,270
What are you doing here?

327
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,900
I'm here to watch the concert.

328
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,270
What? Watch the concert?

329
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,760
What are you up to?

330
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,340
What do you mean? But those peo—

331
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,800
Who?

332
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,200
Nevermind.

333
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,860
Hey! That mannerless kid.

334
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,010
Everyone, nowadays hasn't it been hard?

335
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,160
Yes!

336
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,770
Yes, that's right. We are now at a crossroad.

337
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,990
The income is irregular. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.

338
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,460
We are getting more senior citizens.

339
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,270
But the proportion of the young  who have to carry the burden for the elder's pensions is shrinking.

340
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,490
Plus the working population is saying

341
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,970
that they don't have quality work available.

342
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:06,450
There's a conflict between the rich and poor, and the young and old are feuding.

343
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,930
Furthermore, the young couples in love to be married--

344
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:15,000
This is K2. Suspicious individuals at front of audience in the center.

345
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,260
So while the population is shrinking, the marriages and birth rate is nosediving--

346
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,400
This is Team Leader.

347
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,380
What are you talking about.

348
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,790
Why do you think it is? It's the economy, stupid.

349
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,500
Stupid! The problem is the economy!

350
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:36,430
Of course, I was not calling you stupid.

351
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,050
From upstage center, 10, 11, 12 and 2 o'clock

352
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,490
 the 4 people holding bags. 

353
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,350
 Floor seats B12 and C16, 

354
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,870
are hiding something on their persons.

355
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,340
 The problem is still the economy. 

356
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,990
This is Team Leader.  Earlier security completely searched those people at the entrance.

357
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,900
Don't be concerned.

358
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,200
 But someone said this, 

359
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,120
"You go to the hospital when you are sick."

360
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,250
That's right!

361
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,470
We have a sick person over there, too.

362
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:18,220
 That's right. We are sick now. 

363
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,160
  Police  

364
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,440
I am sorry to say this to your generation who are busy trying to get employed.

365
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,650
Actually, in my generation, we didn't study that much.

366
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,140
 For a starter, we were too busy dating. 

367
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,400
 But it was hard to get a date for an ugly person like me. 

368
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,690
Hence, I was able to pass the bar exam in the 3rd year of my college. The first place at that!

369
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,560
Yeah, you are right. I am bragging.

370
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,460
I am sorry.

371
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:21,100
Second, you didn't have to study if you got involved in the democracy movement and the labor movement.

372
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,980
How can your grades be important when the country was in shambles?

373
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,570
That's why we didn't worry about the employment or the marriage.

374
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,860
Why? Because the country was like the candle in the wind!

375
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,600
Actually, it was because we were expanding the industrial sectors then.

376
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,790
 We had an abundance of jobs! 

377
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:46,990
 We didn't worry much when the price of goods rose every day. 

378
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,380
- Our pay increased a lot, too! 
- This is K2.

379
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,910
Listen Team leader, we need to stop the concert. VIP's in danger.

380
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,340
Are you crazy? K2, where are you?

381
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,210
On stage.

382
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,580
  That's why many of the elders still 

383
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,120
 talk about the good old days. 

384
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,640
  But how is it now? 

385
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,930
 It's the economy, stupid! 

386
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,660
Stupid, the problem is the economy!

387
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,990
 It may sound like a story, but I want to tell you about my younger days. 

388
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,570
Don't do anything stupid and stay put.

389
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,320
 When I started dating now my wife. 

390
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,360
I was poor and had

391
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,240
no money in my pocket.

392
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,930
Hey, K0 what are you doing? What are you doing here?

393
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,780
Get out of the way, don't make a scene.

394
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,300
Jang Se Joon must resign!

395
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,430
Jang Se Joon who is favoring International Finance Group must wake up!

396
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,270
Wake up! Wake up!

397
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,350
You are delusional.  Delusional!

398
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,860
Hold on!

399
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,330
Guards! Let go of them.

400
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,850
Don't try to muffle them!

401
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:34,340
They don't deserve to be treated like that.

402
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:41,200
They have the right to throw eggs  at me and to the politicians in the country,

403
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,300
They have been conned by too many politicians all this time.

404
00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:00,130
And plus, I won't die from getting hit with a few eggs.

405
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:08,400
If these people really wanted to hurt me,

406
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,380
they would have thrown stones. Isn't that right?

407
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,090
Yes.

408
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,430
I believe that these individuals,

409
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,250
had affection for Jang Se Joon so they threw eggs.

410
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:26,040
Plus they chanted "wake up" didn't they?

411
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:31,140
Politicians must be awake.

412
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,310
I'll heed your words.

413
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,670
I will be awake.

414
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,590
I am now

415
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:04,210
requesting the prosecution office investigate

416
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:09,850
the International Finance Group that they thought I was favoring

417
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:15,560
and the other finance groups that are suspect these days.

418
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,720
In addition, from this point on,

419
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,830
I will not exercise the rights of immunity given to assemblyman.

420
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:28,580
And tomorrow morning,

421
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:33,560
I'll go to the prosecution office voluntarily to be investigated.

422
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,360
Also my residence, my office,

423
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,600
my campaign office, and all the places that are related to me

424
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,690
to be searched and seized

425
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,380
for the purpose of not leaving any doubts about me

426
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,030
and I am asking to be investigated thoroughly.

427
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,800
So if even a shred of doubt

428
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,540
comes out that you can't accept,

429
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:09,900
then I will as they chanted resign.

430
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,090
To the people who threw eggs at me,

431
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,710
if the investigation is done properly

432
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,850
and the result

433
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,460
is satisfactory

434
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,110
then don't throw the eggs at me

435
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,660
and give them to me.

436
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,710
Although I like the egg pack,

437
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:51,220
I'd rather bring the eggs to my wife

438
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,690
and be loved.

439
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,990
Jang Se Joon. Jang Se Joon. Jang Se Joon.

440
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:18,410
Jang Se Joon. Jang Se Joon. Jang Se Joon.

441
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:25,590
Jang Se Joon. Jang Se Joon. Jang Se Joon.

442
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,770
Ugh, so fishy. You can smell a strong fishy scent right?

443
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:38,170
- It's fine.
 -These punks. I asked to throw a few, so why are they throwing so many?

444
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,830
Do these punks have hidden resentment towards me?

445
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,110
But the effectiveness was 100%!

446
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,590
You have resentment towards me too?

447
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,830
What? Maybe something like this?  (Heart shaped fingers) 

448
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,030
I have to shower,

449
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,200
so it'll take a bit of time.

450
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,430
I'll call you when I'm done.

451
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,430
Yes, sir. Understood.

452
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,470
Did you wait long?

453
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,940
Have you eaten something?

454
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,620
Yes.

455
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:27,000
I'll be in first, so hurry in.

456
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,670
Yes, sir.

457
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,680
Cutie.

458
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:44,220
Should we go somewhere and grab coffee? You know it'll be a while.

459
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,520
You stay here and guard.

460
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,390
Yes, sir.

461
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,210
What are you doing? Why aren't you coming in?

462
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,590
Yes, sir. I'm coming.

463
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,380
  Waiting room 
 Assemblyman Jang Se Joon 

464
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,280
It's troublesome.

465
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,520
Get your clothes on! We have to leave quickly.

466
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,200
What are you? What are you doing?

467
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,880
Move.

468
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,020
Hey!

469
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,690
Get out of my way!

470
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,070
What is this?

471
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,360
- He's with the girl. 
 - What?

472
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,350
And now, the police will be coming in. They're all in it together.

473
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,510
Do you want to get arrested?!

474
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,770
Don't look around.

475
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,830
There he is!

476
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,420
Run!

477
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,100
Stop!

478
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,940
Follow them!

479
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,470
What's going on?

480
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,280
It's a police set-up! I'll leave it to you!

481
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,400
- Who are they? 
 -Park Gwon Soo's henchmen. Run.

482
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,130
Set-up?

483
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,840
Seriously, these little. Hey!

484
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,930
Hey you should know that this is obstruction of justice.

485
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,000
Then why do you arrest us?

486
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,830
The suspect has escaped. Block the exits!

487
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,690
Hey! Get all the CCTV footage now!

488
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,950
Show us your arrest warrant.

489
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,670
Planning this and then waiting... you probably didn't have time for a warrant.

490
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,830
Warrant? I don't need something like that.

491
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,680
The victim reported sexual harassment.

492
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,410
Manager Ju! Manager Ju!

493
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,360
Look. Those two are in it together.

494
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,720
Call the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office #5. This is an assassination attempt by the police.

495
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,500
Submit the photographic evidence right away!

496
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,530
 We lost him! 

497
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,680
Well, it seems like the show's over.

498
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,440
That's right. I'll see you next time.

499
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:30,400
Wow, that could've been bad!

500
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,690
Wow, thank you.

501
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:36,690
It's nothing.

502
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,430
No, if it weren't for you, it would've been a huge failure.

503
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,470
It might have been.

504
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,310
Anyway, where are we going right now?

505
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,180
To your daughter.

506
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,920
What?

507
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,070
Stop the car.

508
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,420
Stop the  car!

509
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,770
If you don't want to meet her!

510
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,430
If you don't want to meet her, then tell her directly yourself,

511
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,490
instead of torturing a child's hope.

512
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,580
Who asked you to do something like this?

513
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,510
I don't do something like this even if someone told me to.

514
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,330
Oh, you f***er

515
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,270
Do you think you'll be safe after this?

516
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:26,940
That girl?

517
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:32,090
Some say if you feed a stray dog, you're taking responsibility for its life.

518
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:35,020
You even have a child, don't you have responsibility to have this kind of inconvenience?!

519
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:39,220
- You rude little punk! How dare you—
-Do you know...

520
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,200
where I found Anna today?

521
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,850
Dreamland.

522
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,330
Do you remember now?

523
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,010
When I met Anna today,

524
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:59,200
do you know what she said first?

525
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,580
 Did he get mad? Because I appeared so suddenly? 

526
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,160
She was worried about her father.

527
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:11,970
 But I know now, 

528
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,850
 that I 

529
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,620
 that I was that bad person. 

530
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,520
What? She ate strawberries?

531
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,680
Because of her allergies, if she eats strawberries —

532
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,430
That's right! You're right!

533
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,510
S-s-she'll die.

534
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,740
I don't think Anna

535
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,250
tried to die because she hated her father.

536
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,200
I think she realized that she was the one who was bothersome to her father,

537
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,410
and she tried to take care of it by eating strawberries.

538
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:30,780
If you really are purely doing all this for Anna,

539
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,650
then promise me.

540
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:37,890
That you will protect Anna until the end.

541
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:39,860
Then I will meet her.

542
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,800
I will.

543
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,440
I will promise you.

544
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,740
Yes, Manager.

545
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,080
 Hey! Why aren't you picking up your phone! Where are you right now. 

546
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,600
 I said where are you! 

547
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,980
It's me, Manager Ju.

548
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,760
My ears are about to fall off.

549
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,020
  Assemblyman, I'm sorry. 

550
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,610
 I've escaped to JSS. 

551
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:15,920
 Come get me here. 

552
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,390
Yes, sir. I understand.

553
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,730
The reason why I haven't met Anna all this time,

554
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:30,800
is because it'll put Anna in danger.

555
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,980
For the sake of my greed, I'm someone who sold my soul to the devil.

556
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:41,760
Because of that, I've lost the person I love and my conscience.

557
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,310
But in the name of greed,

558
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:52,390
there weren't any brakes. I, too had to accelerate

559
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:55,590
in order to get out of Choi Yoo Jin's power.

560
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,950
Anna is a hostage.

561
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,250
I have to have the most power in order to save her.

562
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:10,080
If I back out now, Choi Yoo Jin

563
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,680
will see no need for Anna as a hostage.

564
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,980
If that happens, Anna will be in danger.

565
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,800
On the other hand, if I meet Anna and say even one word wrong,

566
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,990
Choi Yoo Jin will know my true feelings,

567
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:31,650
and she'll hide Anna all the more so I can't find her.

568
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,920
That's why Anna being here in Korea

569
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,020
feels completely empty for me.

570
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:50,170
Also, it wasn't right for you to take me here.

571
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:59,060
But what can you do? It's already happened.

572
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:05,540
Keep your promise. I beg of you.

573
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,610
Okay, let's go.

574
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,950
To my pitiable daughter.

575
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,010
To make her more sad.

576
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,350
Assemblyman, what is all this fuss?

577
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:38,190
I heard Anna is staying here.

578
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:41,870
What? Oh, yes.

579
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,680
The Assemblyman is at the infirmary?  Okay...

580
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,740
Mirror, show me the CCTV footage from Anna's room.

581
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,030
Anna, your father is here.

582
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,250
Is she sleeping?

583
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,180
N-No, she is not. Not yet...

584
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,300
I see.

585
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,090
Then Anna is mad at her father, right?

586
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,500
I'm sorry, Anna.

587
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:41,340
I've been very busy recently.

588
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,970
But, where is she sick? Why is she here?

589
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,590
S-she ate strawberry ice cream.

590
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:52,120
Strawberry ice cream? What about it?

591
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,720
What?

592
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,110
Oh, Miss has a strawberry allergy.

593
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:58,850
What?

594
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,210
She has a strawberry allergy?

595
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,020
Oh, why couldn't you be more careful? Why would you give that to her?

596
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,220
Anna,

597
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:23,220
were you bery sick? (Using cutesy tone)

598
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,700
The man called 'father'

599
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:37,120
doesn't even know his daughter's allergies.

600
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,980
Well... why don't you wait outside, so I can speak to her comfortably.

601
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,790
Yes, sir.

602
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:16,210
Anna, now no one is here.

603
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:20,590
So would you like to talk to your father?

604
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,550
Dad

605
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,590
Dad

606
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,780
That's right, my Anna.

607
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,380
My daughter.

608
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:11,070
 I'm sorry, Anna. 

609
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,180
I missed you, Dad.

610
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,910
Yeah.

611
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:27,490
Okay, I missed you too.

612
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,450
Let's see.

613
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,690
My daughter is all grown.

614
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,760
You can even get married.

615
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:59,480
Okay, Anna. Wait just a little more.

616
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:05,430
When your father is President, I'll pick out a good man for you. You can date,

617
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,710
and make friends, and live a happy life.

618
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:13,070
When it becomes time, I'll even send you off for marriage.

619
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:20,640
So don't worry anymore, okay?

620
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,990
Dad, listen to me. Mom didn't commit suicide.

621
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:27,600
I remember everything from that night.

622
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,600
When I came into the room, Mom was already unconscious.

623
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,130
And then someone covered my eyes

624
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:38,770
and covered my mouth.

625
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:45,430
Anna, all those things are now in the past.

626
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,250
You need to forget it now.

627
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:52,190
It's the truth, Dad! And then that woman walked in.

628
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:56,070
I'm sure that Choi Yoo Jin killed Mom.

629
00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:00,580
- Anna! You can't say things like that!
-Dad...

630
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:04,250
Don't ever say that outside  again. If anyone were to hear you say that,

631
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:09,770
you'll block my way and make trouble for yourself.

632
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,350
Anna, because you were young and went through something you couldn't handle

633
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,100
you imagined it.

634
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:24,700
No, Dad. That day, Mom cried a lot so I did give her some pills, but—

635
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,850
Anna! Are you really going to be like this?

636
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:33,950
Do you want to see something bad happen to your dad?

637
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:39,450
If you ever say that again, I won't see you again.

638
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,170
Is that what you want?

639
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:44,290
Dad...

640
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:51,870
That's right. You're good, right, my daughter?

641
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:58,800
Right, of course.

642
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:07,630
 I'm sorry Anna. Please wait for me. 

643
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,980
I wanted to ask you something, Dad.

644
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,870
Hm? What is it?

645
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,910
Did you love Mom?

646
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,360
What?

647
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:46,690
Of course! That's why you were born.

648
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:52,400
And did she really use me to blackmail you?

649
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,820
What?

650
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:03,900
 Choi Yoo Jin. You devil. 

651
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,280
Is that why you threw me and Mom away?

652
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:28,130
Anna... that is adult business.

653
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:32,390
I'm now an adult, too. I want to know.

654
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:38,150
Anna, all of that is now meaningless.

655
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:43,460
Why? You said you loved Mom.

656
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:46,690
But Mom died.

657
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:51,560
And then I got dragged overseas, but you never looked for me.

658
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,900
But why is that meaningless?

659
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:10,160
Anna, I am someone who will do big things in our country.

660
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:16,870
If you do big things, small things are bound to be forgotten.

661
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,380
She's right...

662
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:29,210
What?

663
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:35,500
 You think you were everything to your dad, 

664
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,330
 but you aren't everything to your dad. 

665
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:44,170
 You're just a very small part, and a burdensome  part of his past. 

666
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:47,120
What Choi Yoo Jin said was right.

667
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,750
Vana ilusion 
 (Futile dream) 

668
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,880
Anna

669
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:28,180
Okay, today's been hard, so it's best that you rest.

670
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:33,120
And from now on, don't think useless thoughts.

671
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,580
Make sure to take care of yourself.

672
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,340
In the future,

673
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:46,000
I'll come often. Okay?

674
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:36,110
 That's right. I hung my entire destiny, 

675
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:39,370
 on a man like you. 

676
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,050
 The K2 

677
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:11,780
 I ask for an honest investigation. 

678
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,710
 I need to draw a real sword. 

679
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,050
 Why did you bring my dad? 

680
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,170
 So you don't die. 

681
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:20,900
 Stand by close to the target. 

682
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,500
 My father is... 

683
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,570
 No! 

684
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,500
 Anna is now in your hands. 

685
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,380
 I'll be protecting you from now on. 

686
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:34,240
 I'm going to make sure no one messes with you. 

687
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,040
 Thanks.
