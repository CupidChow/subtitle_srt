1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,110
 The K2 

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,140
 The K2 

3
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,800
An enemy's enemy is a friend, isn't it?

4
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,610
If the appropriate time arrives

5
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,370
JSS will be your gun.
   

6
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,740
You have to be the bullet. I will pull the trigger. 
  

7
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,460
This is Agent Kim Jae Ha who will work in the VIP team.   

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,880
His caller ID will be K2

9
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:06,120
But this child read my heart and mind.

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,480
But ... the child didn't need my command or permission. 
  

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,420
He wasn't a hunting dog. He is a wolf.

12
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,220
I probably won't be able to tame him.

13
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,190
Dad, I think I'm lost.

14
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,690
Please come get me.

15
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,770
Really? My dad sent me this?

16
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,900
 I think she realized that she was the one who was bothersome to her father,  

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,430
 and she tried to take care of it by eating strawberries.  
   

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,820
Anna, you can't. Please don't die.
  

19
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,350
Promise me that you will protect Anna until the end.

20
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,810
I will.

21
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,930
Niece!

22
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,520
Who are you?

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,340
Me?   I'm your uncle!

24
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,300
If it's brother-in-law's child, then wouldn't she obviously be my niece?  
  

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,620
You can't.

26
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:13,240
With what plan did you take Anna from Choi Yoo Jin's grasp?

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,260
I know the big secret that Anna is brother-in-law's biological daughter.

28
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,550
So if Anna is by my side, my sister won't be able to take JB easily.
 

29
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,860
- I'm sorry. 
- Since you didn't tell me in advance,

30
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,740
I almost killed your wife.

31
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,500
 I'll be protecting you from now on. 

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,900
 I'm going to make sure no one messes with you.
&lt;  

33
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,880
Jae Ha, If the situation gets dire...

34
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,660
You can just come back.

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,200
Be sure to return alive. That's an order.

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,300
 

37
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,220
I can't. I can't. 
  

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,830
 He can't kill Park Gwan Soo because he is alone. 

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,650
I told you not to touch Anna. 
  

40
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,430
The very first time in my life I got slapped by that damned hand, I thought about giving orders to sever it,

41
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,870
But I am letting it remain attached because you might need it to shake hands during the campaign.

42
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,480
Take care of it well.

43
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,400
Anna. We, later ... shall we live in Spain?

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,170
Let's go. 
  

45
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,900
- Welcome. Because you are the hero who saved JSS. 
 - A hero?

46
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,100
It's about the time to set up a trap. 
  

47
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,200
- A trap? 
 - Yes.

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,200
You have to get close more and more to Park Kwan Su.

49
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,500
From among the tips I collected over time about Eom Hye Rin,

50
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,250
this one seems to be something.

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,420
Don't you remember me? We met that night.

52
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,530
in your mother's room.

53
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,500
Oh! Do you not remember me because I shined my flashlight in your eyes?

54
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,600
Uncle- this tabloid report, did you really put it out there? 
 

55
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,130
We have to do this so that my sister will get taken in for witness testimony in the investigation.

56
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,900
and during that questioning, there will be an investigation on the alleged murder.

57
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,220
While someone else's house is on fire, it looks like this house is having a party.

58
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,250
Yes.

59
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,000
Anna is ...

60
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,390
my daughter.

61
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,200
Eom Hye Rin showed up to me with young Anna.   

62
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,140
She notified me that Anna is my biological daughter.

63
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,270
Ever since then, to me and my wife

64
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,400
the days have been like a continuing nightmare.

65
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,100
What?

66
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,640
Evidence on Kumargate? 
  

67
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,040
I think they are very close to finding it.

68
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,190
How did you know about that?

69
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,710
It's as planned. Manager Ju.

70
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,930
- Yes? 
 - Please back Jae Ha up.

71
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,180
Please surveil one doctor for me. Totally obviously. 
 [Jae tries to find evidence from Seok Han by risking his life

72
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:35,950
Our target is in possession of some important data evidence hidden somewhere in this hospital.

73
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:41,610
Because we need to make him nervous enough to check the hidden material himself.

74
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,370
 Episode 14 

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,740
What are you doing? Get him quickly!

76
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,480
 It was there. 

77
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,490
What are you?

78
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,940
- What's up?
- Ah, that's is...

79
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,830
I came out because I got a call from the security team.

80
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,270
Are you Chief Kim Seok Han?

81
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,610
Yes. I am.

82
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,860
Please step out first. Let us escort you.

83
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,670
No. I am okay.

84
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,040
Then.

85
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,940
Why don't you step out first?

86
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,040
Put your hands on your head.

87
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,400
Are you from Park Gwan Soo's side?

88
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,860
Or from Choi Yoo Jin?

89
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,610
Follow him!

90
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,060
Hey!

91
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,990
Stop there!

92
00:08:51,970 --> 00:09:00,060
  Timing and Subtitles by the K2  Minions @ viki  

93
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,990
Where are you trying to run away like a rat?

94
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,020
Come down.

95
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,150
Come down quickly!

96
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,090
Damn you!

97
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,030
Get him!

98
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,470
Give me that.

99
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,300
After I got up there.

100
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,680
Give me that first, f**king bastard!

101
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,990
F**king ass**le.

102
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sergeant Kim! Get on quickly!

103
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,140
Sergeant Kim! Sergeant Kim! Come to your senses!

104
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,970
Wake up!

105
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,840
Come to your senses! What are the hell you doing? Step on!

106
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,640
Hold on tight!

107
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,440
Come to yourself!

108
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,190
Wake up!

109
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,900
Madam! It's Manager Ju.

110
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,020
Hello.

111
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,530
Miss.

112
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,990
Miss! Miss!

113
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,420
Why? What?

114
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,620
Jae Ha...

115
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,020
Jae Ha...

116
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,250
Wake up! Wake up!

117
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,010
Wake up!

118
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,880
Come on, man!

119
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,110
Team Leader, now!

120
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,650
I got it.

121
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,950
Right now! Block the police cars!

122
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,030
Get out of the way, out of the way!

123
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,640
Get out of the way!

124
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,470
How can you block police cars?

125
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,070
What?!

126
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,710
The president's s-son?? Are you sure?

127
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,860
O-o-okay. Okay. Did you find it?

128
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,460
What? JSS?

129
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,010
I got it.

130
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,000
Is there any news?

131
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,000
Jae Ha, you must return safely.

132
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,920
Please help Jae Ha come back.

133
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,340
Please make him come back safely.

134
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,020
Please.

135
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,570
Miss!

136
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,100
 Dr. Kim Seok  Han fell off the parking tower at his work place, St. Tomas Hospital, this afternoon.  

137
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,320
 The president son, Dr. Kim Seok Han got into a mysterious accident by falling off a parking structure] 

138
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,240
 The severeness of his injury has not been revealed.  

139
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,130
 And it was reported that the police are still pursuing the culprit. 

140
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,140
 Let me repeat the breaking news. 

141
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,430
 The president's son, Dr. Kim Seok Han fall off the parking tower   

142
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,180
 at his work place, St. Tomas Hospital, this afternoon. 

143
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,070
 The severeness of his injury has not been revealed.  

144
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,930
 And it was reported that the police are still pursing the culprit. 

145
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,130
 Currently, the suspect is known to be an employee of a big private security firm in Korea.  

146
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,800
 As to why the suspect  attempted to harm Dr. Kim is still being investigated.   
 - All right.

147
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,980
With this opportunity under the justification of searching for the culprit,

148
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,630
I will strike the JSS headquarters.

149
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,070
Okay.

150
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,170
Yes, Police Chief.

151
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,700
This is me.

152
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:37,090
You go and search the JSS 9th floor for Cloud 9 or something in person.

153
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,430
I will send some of my technicians

154
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,070
so you go personally

155
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,670
and seize and search all the dangerous secrets which Choi Yoo Jin has

156
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,530
and delete the main server completely.

157
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,600
Alright.

158
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,810
Then, work hard.

159
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,960
Wow. This is a true example of turning misfortune to our advantage.

160
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,440
But the real worry is

161
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,980
Kim Jae Ha may have gotten the Kim Seok Han's memory card

162
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,990
and Choi Yoo Jin takes it from Jae Ha.

163
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,100
That is...

164
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,240
How about Jae Ha? Where is he?

165
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,470
We came to JSS because policemen were checking through all the emergency rooms in the hospital.

166
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,790
Good.

167
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,730
I am taking him to the infirmary room.

168
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,160
No.

169
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,020
Bring him into Cloud 9.

170
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,250
The police will come.

171
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,060
Yes. I got it.

172
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:17,200
Move all the equipment which is required for his surgery and treatment quickly.

173
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,890
Okay.

174
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,150
Infirmary Chief.

175
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,360
Yes. Yes, Madam.

176
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,150
You are a member of Cloud 9 from now.

177
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,500
Yes?

178
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,470
Ah, yes.

179
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,500
The fate of our company is in your hands.

180
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,370
Save him by all means!

181
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,750
Yes. I will do my best.

182
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,910
 Detective Squad 

183
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,900
 Police 

184
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,080
Make sure nobody can go in and out of here, not even a mouse.

185
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,670
- Understood?
- Yes.

186
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,100
Let's go.

187
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,710
Mr. Police Chief came all the way here. What brought you here?

188
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,810
Now JSS is finished.

189
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,290
What do you mean by that?

190
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:31,780
Choi Yoo Jin crossed the line which she never  should have.

191
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,040
Hey...

192
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,450
 Search Warrant 

193
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,720
- Search in every nook and cranny of this building.
- Yes.

194
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,270
Hey, punk!

195
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
Sergeant Kim!

196
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,460
No. No, Jae Ha.

197
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,270
Don't die.

198
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,610
No.

199
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,610
A little more!

200
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,630
 Jae Ha, please. 

201
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,580
His heart is beating again. Let me use a defibrillator.

202
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,490
Oh, please, please.

203
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,280
Sergeant Kim. Sergeant Kim.

204
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:22,150
♫  You are going away.  ♫

205
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:30,210
♫  There are still many words which couldn't be said  ♫

206
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:40,280
♫  They couldn't be expressed to the end. Are my feeling showing?  ♫

207
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:47,780
♫  I'm still like this.  Just looking forward to see you  ♫

208
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:58,740
♫  Love you, even though I forget it and forget it  ♫

209
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:06,510
♫   Even though I try to end it  ♫

210
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:12,780
♫  No matter how hard you try to erase you from me  ♫

211
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,310
♫  all I can do is yearn for you,   ♫

212
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,580
♫  my love  ♫

213
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,310
♫  Love you. No matter how hard I try to stop the feeling  ♫

214
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:35,950
♫  It keeps growing bigger and bigger,  I can't help it.  ♫

215
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,450
♫   I love you. I love you.  ♫

216
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,740
 Jae Ha, come down quickly. You may be late for the flight. 

217
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,610
♫  Even today, love you.  ♫

218
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,620
 Jae Ha, 

219
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:04,110
♫  Everyday, I love you   ♫

220
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,510
 Anna, don't come here. 

221
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,260
 Go down first. I will follow you shortly. 

222
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,590
 What's up, Jae Ha? What's wrong? What's.... 

223
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,390
 - Jae Ha, what happened to you? 
- No, Anna. I am okay. 

224
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,930
 What's happening? Jae Ha What is it? Huh? 

225
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,930
 What's happening? Jae Ha! 

226
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,710
 What should do? Please wake up! 

227
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:37,390
 Come to your senses. What's wrong? 

228
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:44,720
 Jae Ha! Kim Jae Ha! Kim Jae Ha! Come to your senses! Kim Jae Ha!   Kim Jae Ha...

229
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,480
Miss.

230
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,960
Jae Ha is at JSS.

231
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,200
Sunbaenim (Senior).

232
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,450
Sunbaenim, I already know everything before I came.

233
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,270
If you don't start the elevator now, I can let you be arrested at once.

234
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,100
For concealing an offender and obstructing a police officer in the performance of his duties.

235
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,150
It's the main server!

236
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,850
Really? Okay.

237
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,230
Mirror. Will the important data be safe?

238
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,620
Yes. The 9th floor server only contains the general business data of JSS.

239
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,180
Yes. Party Leader. I made it to seize the 9th floor.

240
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,120
Really? Good job! Good job! Good!

241
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,370
Hurry and take care of it.  Quickly take care of it. Okay

242
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,700
Okay.

243
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:35,190
Now Choi Yoo Jin is nothing but a female cat without her claws.

244
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:44,650
Now it's the end of the thorn in our side, Cloud 9.

245
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:52,130
But still, the classified information in Cloud 9 won't go over to Park Gwan Soo's side, right?

246
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:57,430
Don't worry about it. Since I sent our technician, he will retrieve it well.

247
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,800
Congratulations on dominating JB.

248
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,420
But isn't it still too early to celebrate?

249
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,660
Choi Yoo Jin may have Seok Han's memory card in her hands.

250
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,760
In any case, the President may not let this slide by because his precious son had been taken out.

251
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,530
He may not leave this alone, but there won't be anything he can do, either.

252
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,400
Is it true that Seok Han really lost the memory card to the enemy?

253
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,240
Well, we will know for sure once Seok Han wakes up.

254
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,790
Do you come to your senses, Dr. Kim?

255
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,900
That guy.... what happened to that guy?

256
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,420
He is on the run now.

257
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,820
He seems to have snuck into JSS, but we will catch him soon, I think.

258
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,260
JSS.

259
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,150
No. You can't touch that guy.

260
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,470
Pardon? What do you mean....?

261
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,850
No, that person helped me.

262
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,020
- When I was chased, he helped me.
- What do you mean?

263
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,600
That bastard was after you from the hospital...

264
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,770
If I say it, just believe me.

265
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:30,310
That guy.. you can't chase him. No way!

266
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,910
- Please contact them (the police). Hurry!
- Yes.

267
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,930
- Why? 
- Something is strange.

268
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,280
- What? 
- It's all general data only.

269
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,790
It can't be!

270
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,380
Search it properly! Properly!

271
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,190
Why?

272
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,330
What? withdrawal?

273
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,920
By whom?

274
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,180
The Blue House?

275
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,510
What the! Okay.

276
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,020
Damn it.

277
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,700
Geez! What the...

278
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,520
You are so lucky, Sunbaenim.

279
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,530
Luck is also a skill, isn't it?

280
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,100
I told you that she is not an easy opponent, right?

281
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,740
Yes.

282
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,370
Hey, bring some salt. ( Salt is scattered to ward off unlucky  visitors including ghosts.) 

283
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,200
Geez, what was it? It made me lose my face.

284
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,870
What the.

285
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,270
Ah, yes. Party Leader. I was ordered to withdraw.

286
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,570
What? Withdrawal?

287
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:18,130
Yes, Party Leader. It was ...  from the Blue House.

288
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,800
The Blue House?

289
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,910
It ( the memory card ) must have been taken.

290
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,280
Pardon? What...?

291
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,820
Damn it!

292
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,680
That's it!

293
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,260
Jae Ha must have taken the memory card from Kim Seok Han.

294
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,030
Excuse me?

295
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,660
That's why as soon as Kim Seok Han wake up in the hospital...

296
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,930
Then, Kim Seok Han thinks K2 has the memory card...

297
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,340
That's right.

298
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,580
Now they understand that they can't provoke me recklessly.

299
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:06,620
They are afraid that Jae Ha or our side may reveal the contents of the memory card, if they chase after us recklessly.

300
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,840
That must be it for sure.

301
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,950
That could be it. For real.

302
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,300
I am certain of it.

303
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,700
Have you searched Jae Ha's body?

304
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,720
Was there any memory card by any chance?

305
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,420
No. There was not.

306
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:28,040
Perhaps, just in case, try searching in the car or something.

307
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,960
Okay.

308
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,560
From now on, remember to control your facial expressions.

309
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,970
What facial expressions?

310
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,360
Confidently and relaxed.

311
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,430
The look of saying, "the memory card is in our hands."

312
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,600
For the meantime, Manager Ju should find that.

313
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,020
Yes. I got it.

314
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,910
I heard you got into big trouble.

315
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,500
So, was it taken?

316
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:09,430
What? What was taken from me?

317
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,430
What are you going to do? Gosh.

318
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,280
When your father's term is almost over....

319
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,330
Mind your own business. Don't lose your company to your Noona.

320
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,450
Kim Jae Ha. That was the guy, right?

321
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,930
He is capable of taking it away from you.

322
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,070
Is it really in Choi Yoo Jin's hand?

323
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,900
Pardon? What are you referring to?

324
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,450
 If he only knows it's in your hands, Park Gwan Soo will resign by himself. 

325
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,810
 Perhaps everyone in the finance world will bow down in front of you.  

326
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:55,710
 And of course Choi Yoo Jin and JB will collapse at once. 

327
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:02,280
 This is the very way to get rid of Choi Yoo Jin and Park Gwan Soo at the same time. 

328
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,560
 To protect Anna 

329
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,880
 and to recover Anna's mother's reputation as Anna wants. 

330
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,490
Where is Manager Ju?

331
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,620
I found his location.

332
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,280
 Parking Lot 

333
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,860
We need to be careful so that they won't notice we are searching for something.

334
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,370
No matter how much we looked for, we can't find it.

335
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,810
Yes, Assemblyman.

336
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:08,820
By any chance, are you looking for something that Jae Ha lost?

337
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,610
How on earth do you...?

338
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:17,360
Jae Ha was intending to give that to me.

339
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,800
To help me defeat Park Gwan Soo for the presidency and to escape from Choi Yoo Jin's grasp.

340
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,090
It must be hard for you to believe that.

341
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:32,370
But it's true. Otherwise, how could I know about it?

342
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,360
Yes.

343
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:40,120
If you find it, I wish you can hand that to me.

344
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,060
I wish to do that...

345
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,080
I understand you trust Choi Yoo Jin more than me.

346
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:53,510
However, if Choi Yoo Jin has that in her hand, I can't be a proper president.

347
00:33:53,510 --> 00:34:03,590
I will be the only half, no, I will end up my presidential term as a perfect puppet of Choi Yoo Jin.

348
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:10,270
And the national affairs will be controlled by the businessmen for their profits.

349
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,800
Please don't say any more.

350
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,450
I am not sure yet if I can find it myself or not.

351
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,350
What are you talking about now?

352
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,860
Kim Jae Ha almost died, I said. Get out of here anyway.

353
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,380
Yes. Madam. Yes.

354
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,440
Okay, I will go up now.

355
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,620
Going up? Where?

356
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,520
The ninth floor.

357
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,410
Jae Ha is in the 9th floor?

358
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,840
Mr. Master. Do you know where Jae Ha is?

359
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,400
Well, I don't know.

360
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,200
Jae Ha is very injured. Please tell me where he is.

361
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,410
I don't know well....

362
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:14,090
but since he is the Cloud 9 member, don't you think he may be in there?

363
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,790
The 9th floor?

364
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,790
Miss, you can't go there.

365
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,650
It's not a place where anyone can access.

366
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,650
 Please scan your access card. 

367
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,970
I told you so.

368
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,810
It will be no use.

369
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,370
Jae Ha, Jae Ha.

370
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,300
 Jae Ha. 

371
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,660
Take her out.

372
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,330
Yes.

373
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,490
What are you doing?

374
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,110
Take that outsider on the 9th floor stairs.

375
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,330
How is he?

376
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,860
His condition is more stable.

377
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,280
Good. You've worked hard.

378
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,760
If there is any change in his condition, notify me immediately.

379
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,690
Okay.

380
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,140
Miss, you can't do like this here.

381
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,990
Please tell the Madam to allow me to meet him. Just once.

382
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,650
Please ask her to let me see him just once.

383
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,750
Miss, later. Let's come back later.

384
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,770
Even if she comes back later, it will be no use.

385
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,090
Ajumma, please let me see Jae Ha.

386
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,060
Ajumma?

387
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,510
What kind of manner is that between family members??

388
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,820
Say "Mom",

389
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,160
"Mom."

390
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,780
Isn't a stepmother a mom?

391
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,930
Please let me see Jae Ha just once. I beg of you.

392
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,080
No, I can't.

393
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,580
Go back home.

394
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,920
Mom.

395
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,550
Mom.

396
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,910
Please I request of you.

397
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,910
Please let me see Jae Ha.

398
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,930
Mom.

399
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,720
What are you doing?

400
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,730
Gosh, you poor thing.

401
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,350
Anna, get up.

402
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,590
Oh, my. You poor thing.

403
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,040
 Right. I have to think of the occasion after Jae Ha wakes up. 

404
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,990
Anna, Jae Ha is still in a serious condition.

405
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:10,300
The wound is not completely healed after his surgery. Be careful.

406
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,040
Okay.

407
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:23,570
By the way, Anna, aren't you really going to leave?

408
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:30,560
With his current condition, Jae Ha won't be able to protect you, don't you think so?

409
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,070
When Jae Ha gets better, I will leave.

410
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,530
When Jae Ha gets better, will you leave for sure?

411
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:05,100
Jae Ha can't go to the hospital with that condition.

412
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:10,050
If he does, he will be arrested for a murder attempt on the President's son right away.

413
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:17,240
I am protecting Jae Ha with everything I have.

414
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:24,190
Anna, it's the time for you to protect Jae Ha.

415
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:30,080
Jae Ha is exposed now. As long as you are here, Jae Ha won't be able to leave.

416
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:36,070
Then, he will be ultimately arrested.

417
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:41,490
I will save Jae Ha. You just leave.

418
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:47,180
That's the best thing you can do for Jae Ha.

419
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,540
Leave and do anything you want. I will sponsor you for everything.

420
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:07,800
And then, if the fate brings you together,  you can see him.

421
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:24,680
Don't you think you need to save the chef woman, Mi Ran and Seong Gyu as well?

422
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:49,210
Yes. I will leave.

423
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,710
In return,

424
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,900
please save Jae Ha.

425
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:33,300

428
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,120
Jae Ha.

429
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,960
Why did you get hurt a lot?

430
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,800
♬ When she sees a beautiful flower ♬

431

♬ He whispers something in her ear ♬

432
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:13,080
Jae Ha. Are you hurt?

433
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:19,220
You  are so badly hurt. What am I going to do?

434
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,640
What should I do? Jae Ha. What should we do?

435
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,900
Jae Ha, can you hear me? Huh?

436
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,910
Don't die. You can't die, Jae Ha.

437
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,390
You have to live.

438

440
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,670
Jae Ha,

♬ He's an evil beast ♬

442
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,410

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,630

445

♬ Without ceasing, treading in the deep forest ♬

448
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,280
So where are you going to send Anna?

449
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,090
To La Felt.

450
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:14,420
Don't worry. I won't hide that girl any more.

451
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,120
I don't need to conceal any more when the whole world knows about her anyway.

452
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,040
They all know that she is the daughter of that famous Eom Hye Rin.

453
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:32,640
Eom Hye Rin became a vicious witch already inside Korea.

454
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:39,180
The bunch of crazy comments brought Anna down from being an angel.

455
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,820
But it will have no effect overseas, right?

456
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,800
That child won't want to even look back anymore toward Korea.

457
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:58,340
I will treat her really well.

458
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:04,210
To make her really happy. Just like a real daughter.

459
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:10,380
So that she won't remember her own mother any more.

460
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:18,810
Yesterday, she even called me, "Mom."

461
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,250
It was the first time of my life, hearing that.

462
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,530
Mom.

463
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,200
What a relief.

464
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:44,130
Whatever you are intending, the end seems to be an happy ending.

465
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:53,040
I am sure that Seok Han lost his memory card to them.

466
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,170
Even though he denies it.

467
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:59,400
If it's in Choi Yoo Jin's hand,

468
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,280
don't we need to re-establish our positions?

469
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,800
Are you talking about the next presidency?

470
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,290
Of course.

471
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,720
Don't jump the gun.

472
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,140
While we observe the situation-

473
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,880
   

474
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,370
Did you all get it?

475
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:35,220
We don't have time to observe or something.

476
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,970
When she knows all of our members exactly.

477
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:43,090
We have a very cute new member for our meeting.

478
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,330
Don't we have to reply back to her?

479
00:48:55,610 --> 00:49:00,780
Welcome, to have you as a new member.

480
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:33,190
Oh, Chairman Choi, what brought you all the way here?

481
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,480
- Are you on the way to your work?
- Ah, yes.

482
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,570
I will take you there.  Let's have the chat we haven't had in a long time.

483
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,170
Y-yes?

484
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,840
There is not much to pack anyway.

485
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,290
We can't go with her.

486
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:56,180
Isn't Choi Yoo Jin going to get rid of us later?

487
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:59,150
What?

488
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,410
That won't happen.

489
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,730
She promised me.

490
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:09,950
Miss.

491
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:13,300
She promised not to touch you guys.

492
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,040
So don't worry too much.

493
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:39,820
 With his current condition, Jae Ha won't be able to protect you. 

494
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,940
 I will save Jae Ha, so you just leave. 

495
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:50,350
 That's the best you can do for Jae Ha. 

496
00:50:51,120 --> 00:51:00,680
 And don't you need to save the chef woman, Mi Ran and Seong Gyu as well? 

497
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,130
 Yes. 

498
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:13,340
 I will leave. In return, please save him. 

499
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,070
Ah, you're here.

500
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:28,580
Hello, Sunbeanim (Senior). You look less energetic today.

501
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,330
Huh? Right, right.

502
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:39,360
I am not any better or worse than you, Chairman Choi, who are about to lose the whole company.

503
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,600
That's right. But you can't jump to the conclusion yet.

504
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,020
Would you like to form an alliance with me?

505
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,000
We may find a  way out.

506
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,600
When you had so much fun in Iraq thanks to me,

507
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,070
you had teamed up with my father-in-law who doesn't know anything. That's why nothing goes well for you.

508
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,520
I will take back the Cloud 9.

509
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,880
And you just have to retrieve  Seok Han's memory card.  Isn't that enough?

510
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,050
Of course, you are right about that, but...

511
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:13,270
If you have any more to lose than now, then forget it.

512
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:18,150
I am hesitating because I had someone search the whole 9th floor already.

513
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:23,830
Why do all people assume the Cloud 9 is located on the 9th floor?

514
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,430
So, have you found it?

515
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,810
Not yet.

516
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,900
If you couldn't find it, even though you went through with a fine tooth comb like that...

517
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,300
It will be great if Jae Ha wakes up and tells me where it is.

518
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,990
I know, right?

519
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:50,920
But if we take our sweet time while we can't locate that memory card...

520
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,900
then Madam's bluffing may be discovered. Don't you think so?

521
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,860
That's why Jae Ha has to regain consciousness.

522
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:20,650
Jae Ha. Are you coming to your senses?

523
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,090
Yes. Madam. Jae Ha has waken up.

524
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,950
 Really? I will be there. 

525
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,590
Yes.

526
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:41,780
Oh, no. Jae Ha, you can't move now.

527
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,810
Stay lying without moving at all for a while.

528
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:51,110
By the way.... where...is this?

529
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,830
Madam hid you from the police pursuit.

530
00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:02,400
And Miss Anna came here yesterday.

531
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,620
Did Anna come?

532
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:10,520
Because Miss Anna begged so much, Madam let her in, I guess.

533
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,600
How was she?

534
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,490
Huh?

535
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,080
I meant Anna.

536
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,280
So so.

537
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:25,710
Mirror.

538
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,000
 Yes. Agent Kim Jae Ha. 

539
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,630
Do you perhaps record here as well?

540
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:31,780
 Yes. 

541
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:34,620
Then, when Anna came by yesterday,

542
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,760
can you show me the record of that time?

543
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,660
 Yes. 

544
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,010
Let me see.

545
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,330
 Does it hurt? Does it hurt? 

546
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,920
 Does it hurt a lot? 

547
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,950
 Jae Ha. 

548
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,890
 Jae Ha, what should we do? 

549
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,660
 What should I do now? 

550
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:40,100
♬    Like illuminating the way in the deep bottomless darkness   ♬ 
   I love you. 

551
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:46,300
♬    I think you who are smiling   ♬  
  I love you, Jae Ha.  

552
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:55,300
♬   Seem like a warm flower.   ♬ 
   You must live. 

553
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:59,230
♬   As if time stopped  ♬

554
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,910
♬  As if I have fallen into a swamp  ♬

555
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,910
♬   I can't move.     ♬

556
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,230
♬    I can't reach you.   ♬

557
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:11,430
♬    As if the wind stopped   ♬

558
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:14,660
♬    As if I've fallen under a spell     ♬

559
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,290
♬    At the end of a fragrant path    ♬

560
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:22,220
♬    I think I see you.    ♬

561
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:25,080
 I am sorry. 

562
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:30,870
 But love can't be shared. 

563
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,100
♬     The flower was you?  ♬

564
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:48,970
So if we ambush her now,

565
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:54,220
we can get the Cloud 9 and Choi Yoo Jin at the same time. Huh?

566
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:01,470
But if anything goes wrong, it will be like we kicked the bee hive.

567
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:03,730
As for the ambush, the timing plays a critical role.

568
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:10,200
Even if Kim Jae Ha wakes up, he won't be able to resist that much with such an injury.

569
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,290
Do you really have someone to open the door to the castle?

570
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:16,660
Geez, don't worry about it.

571
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,520
You just need to focus on your task.

572
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,500
Oh.

573
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,330
Are you awake?

574
00:57:55,620 --> 00:58:00,750
Did you get the memory card from Seok Han?

575
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,570
Where is it?

576
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:11,220
Hey, it's not the time to waste our sweet time.

577
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:17,770
As for that, I didn't get it to give to you.

578
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,040
What are you talking about now?

579
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:27,370
Hey, punk. To save you, how much we had risked...

580
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,290
That's okay.

581
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,800
Then, why did you get it from him?

582
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,860
To defeat Park Gwan Soo.

583
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,180
Right. That's why you have to hand it to us.

584
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:48,280
No. Because you can't use it to defeat Park Gwan Soo anyway.

585
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:55,660
- Why?
-  It's because if you reveal this, JB will collapse too.

586
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:00,500
Besides the exposed consortium, Chairman Choi is the most deeply involved person in that project.

587
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:06,600
Therefore if you don't intend to ruin JB Group, you can't expose it.

588
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:16,840
Okay. Then, it can be a means of defense at least.

589
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,590
No.

590
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:26,210
I didn't get it to defend you, either.

591
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,090
Then?

592
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:33,130
That will be the second email between you and me now.

593
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:39,710
For the safety of Anna and me.

594
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:57,930
I am telling you there is no hope.

595
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:02,290
If he is like that, there is no hope he will give it up.

596
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:06,960
- In any case, what should I do with my dirty feelings?
- What do you mean?

597
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,720
In my opinion, Madam is out of her mind completely.

598
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,950
Which means?

599
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:18,330
For that punk, Jae Ha. She fell for him too much, I meant. 
 - "Fell for him?"

600
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:23,270
When you have keen eyes for everything, how come you are slow to read the relationship between a man and a woman?

601
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:26,350
Listen to me. With Madam's personality,

602
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:30,730
If that punk is reluctant like that, whether we twist his legs or torture him in order to make him confess,

603
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:35,850
she would have found it out no matter what! Don't you agree?

604
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:42,740
So, Manager Ju,  are you still thinking of staying here?

605
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:49,440
What I am saying is your dream of being the exalte security chief in the Blue House may vanish,

606
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,600
By the look of it. That's why I am asking.

607
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:59,320
President. Please calm down first.

608
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,870
Huh?

609
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:15,820
Ah, Manager Ju, didn't you say you are escorting Assemblyman Jang for an event?

610
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,150
Yes. I have to leave now.

611
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:21,010
Let's continue discussing once I come back.

612
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,120
Okay. Let's do that.

613
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:39,520
Then, was it to destroy me?

614
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,000
That was it.

615
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,380
But why?

616
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:58,730
You are my friend, aren't you?

617
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:03,090
Have you ever cried from feeling pitiful?

618
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:12,290
My life is full of tears.

619
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:23,300
No,  not for yourself, but for someone else.

620
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:29,930
You guys are very sensitive to your own pains but

621
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,810
you are very insensitive to other people's pains.

622
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:39,100
But still, others feel the same pain, too.

623
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:46,320
Even the cleaning lady, the grandmother in a fruit farm, Seong Gyu, Mi Ran and Mrs. Chef.

624
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,410
And Raniya also.

625
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:54,070
And those want to be happy as much as you guys want.

626
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:59,260
Everyone wants to be happy in their own places.

627
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:03,320
For your places, as if you killed Eom Hye Rin,

628
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,280
you guys are the people who can kill others with ease.

629
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:12,790
That's why I can't be your friend.

630
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:22,370
Ah, one more thing. What you need now is not a friend, but a person who can worship you

631
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:27,210
or a person whom you can worship.

632
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,750
Just like young Jang Se Joon.

633
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:37,370
However, I am sorry that I don't belong to any of those categories.

634
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:03,260
So have you made up your mind?

635
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:10,720
I will wait for you.

636
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,200
The time is running out. Hurry up.

637
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,260
Ooops, I spilt it.

638
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:48,290
Hey, hey. Those two come and clean this up.

640
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,230
Right. Right. I don't make such mistakes often.

641
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:58,310
Go get the mop.

642
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:01,960

I...

651
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:58,010
don't expect you to worship me.

652
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:04,100
I just...

653
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,720
You just wanted to own me.

654
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,680
It's nothing but another slave.
