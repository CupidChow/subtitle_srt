 Episode 11 

5
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,700
Aigoo my sunbae is calling me often these days.

6
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:02,410
  Hey, I'm ...  I am thinking about get an insurance policy from you.

7
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,420
Uh, hey. Give me a seat, too.

8
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,270
Master.

9
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,550
Please just go inside. Get in quickly!

10
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,350
Hey! Did you just disrespect me?

11
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,270
I am not disrespecting you, but I am concerned about you getting hurt.

12
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,840
What getting hurt? Is getting hurt the problem now?

13
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,140
All the kids are about to die in the war.

14
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,280
And you want me to just watch?

15
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,380
Where is it? Where is a vacant spot?!

16
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,510
Ah Master.

17
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,560
What shall we do?

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,770
Take him in our car, but you make sure he won't get in the way, okay?

19
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,410
Yeah.Let's go this way.

20
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,220
Get in quickly!

21
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,640
They are departing now. Yeah.

22
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,100
But, the size of the squad is no joke.

23
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,770
Wow... look at those arrogant bastards.

24
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,710
Yeah.

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,270
Yeah, I understand. Then I trust you'll take care of this.

26
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,420
Yeah.

27
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,760
Who is it?

28
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
It was the Police Chief.

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,250
As expected, Choi Yoo Jin is ambushing your house tonight,

30
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,770
he told me.

31
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,580
- My house? 
 - Yes.

32
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,560
They are desperate. Now they are being ruthless.

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,190
Mr. Police Chief already mobilized a security measure around your house.

34
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,360
So they'll be captured without a doubt.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,100
Okay. Let's end it tonight, this election.

36
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,790
Then, I'll take you to there and not to your residence.

37
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,520
Okay.

38
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,360
Tae Yi, is the JSS bastards still following us?

39
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,860
Yes.

40
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,300
Park Gwan Soo is going towards his house.

41
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,970
Okay. Keep up the good work.

42
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,760
Can't you see that? 
  One way street 

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,560
Let me see your license.

44
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,420
Just send me the ticket.

45
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,890
What is that?

46
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,550
I think I lost him.

47
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,210
What? Damn you!

48
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,520
 One way street 

49
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,470
I found him.

50
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,940
Yeah. He's going towards his house.

51
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,170
Stand by in your car until further notice.

52
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,220
Understood.

53
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,310
All stand by until they get out of the car.

54
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,440
Get ready. If they resist, fire away!

55
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,720
Wow! Are we filming spy movie or something?

56
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,780
This too, is the end as of tonight.

57
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,460
Mr. President!

58
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,920
Mr. President?

59
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,700
Aigoo this is really sucking up!

60
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,950
Mr. President!

61
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,250
Ah, let's end it! End it!

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,040
 SWAT team 

63
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,300
Park Gwan Soo has arrived.

64
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,560
As we expected, Park Gwan Soo showed up at his hideout.

65
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,720
Is that right?

66
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,040
We got him.

67
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,820
That was a really good insurance policy.

68
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,220
I know, right?

69
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,810
You all are working hard.

70
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,920
This feels really eerie.

71
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,330
You haven't been here for a while, right?

72
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,360
Right.

73
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,100
Have you all eaten?

74
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Yes, we've eaten.

75
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,400
 What? We've eaten? 

76
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,770
 Have you all eaten was the code. 

77
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,170
I'll blow your head off if you move.

78
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,770
Just shoot them.

79
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,090
Cover us!!

80
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,620
If you stick it out a little longer here, re-enforcements will come.

81
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,790
This won't do. This won't do. Let's hide inside.

82
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,030
Cover us! Cover us!

83
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,870
Cover us! Cover us!

84
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,960
If he goes in, we are done.

85
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,190
Cover us.

86
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,600
You are killing me.

87
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,170
Party Leader! Now is the time!

88
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,290
Hurry and run! Hurry!

89
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,430
Cover me.

90
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,240
Are you okay, uh?

91
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,320
Keep going! Just go!

92
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,220
If you lose the target,

93
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,270
we'll all die!

94
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,870
Ayi, you are killing me.

95
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,080
Go. GO!!!

96
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,990
Cover me.

97
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,720
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

98
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,700
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

99
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,190
♫  Run, run. I'm fine.  ♫

100
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,450
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

101
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,710
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

102
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,510
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

103
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,700
♫  Look out! Look out! Look out!  ♫

104
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,440
I got you, Bastard.

105
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,310
H-hold on. Hold on.

106
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,120
This damn...

107
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,670
I can't. I can't.

108
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,160
Damn it!

109
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,470
Wait. Wait.

110
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,680
Hear me out.

111
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,110
Even if you kill me,

112
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,170
you can't leave here alive.

113
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,680
 Be sure to return alive. 

114
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,300
 It's an order. 

115
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,140
How much is it? The money you are getting for killing me.

116
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,130
Tell me how much you are getting.

117
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,150
I'll double that.

118
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:52,110
 A bullet isn't the only thing that can kill people. 

119
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,160
You know it so well.

120
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,910
What words the mercenaries like the most.

121
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,060
I know, right?

122
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,530
So we understand each other.

123
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,190
- Please have a seat. 
- Uh?

124
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,240
I said sit down.

125
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,740
And call your assistant

126
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,740
and let the people who accompanied me go out.

127
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,960
- Very safely. 
- Yeah, yeah.

128
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,920
I'll do that.

129
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,620
Indeed, it was you, the mercenary.

130
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,020
 He knows me. 

131
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,250
Do you know me?

132
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,810
Of course, I know you well.

133
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,930
I heard you killed someone and ran.

134
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,370
 I wonder how much he knows about me? 

135
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,340
Then you know very well why I am here, right?

136
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,100
But...

137
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,130
Even if you kill me here,

138
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,000
you won't be able to get out of here easily.

139
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,810
 He doesn't know that I can't kill people, yet. 

140
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,870
That's my problem after you are dead, so just leave that to me.

141
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,200
Double...

142
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,290
Did you say double?

143
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:23,400
But still, I should have the thing called ethics in a business relationship, I need to ask the other side as well.

144
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,360
Yeah, Madam. It's me.

145
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,810
Assemblyman Park is right in front of my eyes.

146
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,370
 He's saying that he'd pay double if I don't kill him. 

147
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,500
What? What are you talking about?

148
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,270
There is...no operation team members next you, right?

149
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,780
Don't you know what I am saying? The price went up, I meant.

150
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,620
Three times. Three.

151
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,780
Shouldn't you have some ethics in business? How can you raise the ante in the middle of negotiations? Huh?

152
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,570
 He can't kill Park Gwan Soo because he is alone. 

153
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,700
 What should I do? 

154
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,440
 What should I do? 

155
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,890
Park Gwan Soo.

156
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,760
- Put him on the phone.
- Alright.

157
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,270
Oh, Madam.

158
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,720
Gosh, Madam. I got scared.

159
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,950
I thought I was almost dead.

160
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,960
Yes. Party Leader.

161
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,190
How are...

162
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,400
You must be not well, I guess.

163
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,760
Well,

164
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,760
would like to do a betting race with me from now?

165
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,820
Madam.

166
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,710
I've lost.

167
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,120
 Please spare me. 

168
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,900
I will give in to Assemblyman Jang at once.

169
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,010
That still doesn't feel like a great deal for me,

170
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,920
when my knight got the king at the moment.

171
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,860
Even if you killed me now,

172
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,060
Assemblyman Jang won't be released.

173
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,140
Please let me take back one move.

174
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,490
I don't know.

175
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,290
We all need to wait and see if Assemblyman Jang can be released or not.

176
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:26,030
If you insist that way, how about making Assemblyman Jang join the party?

177
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,660
I will announce it right away.

178
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,370
 How is it? 

179
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,170
Will you be satisfied with that much?

180
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,670
Well,

181
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,730
on top of that,

182
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,760
how about adding

183
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,270
your resignation from the presidency election?

184
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,510
Pardon?

185
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,100
Madam.

186
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,320
Madam.

187
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,330
Just kill me. Yes. Kill me.

188
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,850
It must be so hard for you to give it up.

189
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,800
I understand.

190
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,280
Then, I will give you fifteen minutes. I will wait for your answer.

191
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,930
- Put that guy on the phone.
- Yes, yes.

192
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,350
 (He is handing over the phone very respectfully by using both hands). 

193
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,420
Accept the phone.

194
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,760
Yes.

195
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,560
Come back alive.

196
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,140
For sure.

197
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,520
Yes. I got it.

198
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,830
Withdraw. Everyone withdraw.

199
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,960
Withdrawal?

200
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,060
Those bastards are leaving.

201
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,930
Let them be.

202
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,190
What? What was it? Without fighting?

203
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,860
Because we already got the big horse in this game.

204
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,860
Master, we won.

205
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,290
We got Park Gwan Soo.

206
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,550
What are you talking about?

207
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,360
 Interrogation Room 

208
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,700
Huh? Here he comes!

209
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,750
What kind of charges did you get specifically?

210
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,250
Was it about the campaign contributions you got from the International Finance Co. and JB Group?

211
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,080
What was the reason you were found to be not guilty of the charges?

212
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,890
What were the additional charges you were accused of?

213
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,880
Are you planning to file a formal complaint to the prosecutor's office?

214
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,930
Please give us some comments.

215
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,270
I want to tell you.

216
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,300
But I only want to reveal the fact that Prosecution Office acknowledged their absurd mistake

217
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,270
and I accepted their apology.

218
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,660
Are you going stay independent? I understand that you got an offer to join the majority party but it was canceled.

219
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,220
What is your future plan?

220
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,640
Please tell us!

221
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,240
Was the investigation coercive?

222
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,420
Please tell us!

223
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,820
Please give us a comment.

224
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,310
Congratulations, Madam.

225
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,240
You can congratulate me when K2 returns alive.

226
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,800
Did something happen?

227
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,740
You are coming here at this hour?

228
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,190
Are all the reporters on duty gathered?

229
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,820
Yes, I called most of the places.

230
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,250
Just what is it?

231
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,560
This is a breaking news.

232
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,420
Today, the prosecution office found no evidence for the charges filed against presidential candidate Jang Se Joon.

233
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,360
We are expressing our congratulation to him. In addition,

234
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,600
our party has decided to officially offer Assemblyman Jang Se Joon to join our party

235
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,930
and run for the presidential election. That's it.

236
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,690
Did Assemblyman Jang Se Joon agree with this as well?

237
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,980
So is it correct that the top was just formed now?

238
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,450
You can post this article on the internet news sites right now, right?

239
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,070
We can post it, but---

240
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,430
Mr. Spokesman! 	Mr. Spokesman!

241
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,000
 Chief Kim 

242
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,900
Here. $2 million.

243
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,570
You probably saw the inside of the safe.

244
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,920
Will you be satisfied with this amount?

245
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,590
Everything in there... I can give it to you.

246
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,930
I am not a robber, though.

247
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,270
Indeed, you are a pro. I like it.

248
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,530
The damn thing about the business ethics ...

249
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,540
I heard you were a member of Blackstone.

250
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:42,720
Why so surprised? Where in Iraq were you stationed?

251
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,990
- Falluja. 
 Oh, I see.

252
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:56,660
Were you also a customer of Blackstone?

253
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,830
You can say that,

254
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,970
since they did my security details.

255
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,970
So... did you get big bucks there?

256
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,640
Why stare at me so unpleasantly?

257
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,640
I am a bit ill mannered.

258
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,430
Plus a VIP like you who can pay $30 grand per day for basic service by Blackstone,

259
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,330
would not go there for pleasure.

260
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,980
And,

261
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,620
I think I can smell oil from this.

262
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,920
Not the smell of oil, but probably the smell of blood.

263
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,970
 Smell of blood? 

264
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,670
I like you.

265
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:50,960
I actually was looking for a way to meet you in secret.

266
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,490
But thankfully Choi Yoo Jin

267
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,600
sent you to me herself.

268
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,500
Me? Why?

269
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,520
What do you mean why?

270
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,910
Aren't you the person who can approach Choi Yoo Jin very closely?

271
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,020
For a capable person like you,

272
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,300
how long will you live like this?

273
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,030
Then how should I live?

274
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:30,450
How about if you work

275
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,860
with me for the country?

276
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,630
Ah the country?

277
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,130
I worked so much for the country before, though.

278
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,080
And make some money as well.

279
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,140
Let's do that. Call me when the situation arises to make money.

280
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,660
It'll be easy to call me, now that you know who I am.

281
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:59,290
I'll do that. Next time, I'll hire you first.

282
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,940
When that happens, keep in mind business ethics again.

283
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,030
I'll do that.

284
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,090
Party Leader!

285
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,460
- Are you okay? 
- Um.

286
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,420
Get that bastard!

287
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,040
No, no. Stand back.

288
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,420
He's my guest.

289
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,670
Then, let's see each other again.

290
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,580
This... how... what?

291
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,670
Um. I am sending him off with some deposit today.

292
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,560
Yeah?

293
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,930
Everything in the world is politics.

294
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,670
Isn't it right?

295
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,970
Are you okay?

296
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,330
What is this?

297
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,810
This is money.

298
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,060
I am asking what this is?

299
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,690
Yeah.

300
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,120
So that happened.

301
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:57,610
Okay, thanks for keeping Anna safe, Chairman Choi. Please take good care of her in the future, too.

302
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:02,270
Okay. Then let's meet up soon.

303
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,390
So... she was going to kill Anna...

304
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:20,410
Assemblyman it's true, but it was Chairman Choi who provoked first.

305
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,510
Manager Ju.

306
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:28,600
Are you ultimately saying you are Choi Yoo Jin's person?

307
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,750
Assemblyman. That's not what I am saying.

308
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,470
Then,

309
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,090
did Anna do something to deserve to die, you mean?

310
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,500
Still, the person who saved you from the prosecution office,

311
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,220
was the Madam. That's what I wanted to tell you.

312
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,100
Shut that mouth.

313
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,030
Congratulations for saving your neck.

314
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,460
Don't touch Jae Ha.

315
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:13,360
If you touch him... I just might kill you first.

316
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,460
Madam. Everything Kim Jae Ha can do,

317
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,190
I can do it all for you.

318
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:40,270
Then you can understand it, too. What you want to do for me,

319
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,770
I want to do for Jae Ha as well.

320
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,970
So... don't make me kill you.

321
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,640
Don't try to do what Jae Ha can do, either.

322
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,940
You should do what you do well.

323
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,110
Yeah.

324
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,750
 Let me see you at home. 

325
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,630
Okay.

326
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,250
Miss! Come and eat!

327
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,310
Miss! I said come and eat!

328
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,100
Just leave her alone. Will she be able to eat now?

329
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,490
Why can't she eat? Even at war,

330
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,790
we eat then fight.

331
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,790
K2 had probably eaten first before the battle.

332
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:15,150
No, I think J4, only you would do that. You monk fish like thing.

333
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:20,320
Aisi. It's her loss for not eating. I don't even have energy to fight.

334
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,040
♫   You are going far away   ♫

335
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,920
He must have returned.

♫    There are still many words which couldn't be said  ♫

337
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,660
Aigoo, is it that good?

338

343

You can't watch this without tears.

344
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,400
Why is it like they are filming a movie scene?

345
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,770
This. This is different.

But... I couldn't buy your oil tteokbokki because I didn't have money.

355
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,580
I forgot to take my wallet.

356
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,560
It's okay.

357
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,070
I let you off the hook this time.

♫   This is all in the end   ♫

359

shall we go eat something more tasty?

00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,830
♫  I want you.    ♫

364
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,920
I am okay. Leave.

365
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,390
I told you not to touch Anna. If something bad happens to Anna,

366
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,640
our contract is over. If I don't become the resident,

367
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,980
you are nothing, Choi Yoo Jin!

368
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,940
Okay, I got it.

369
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,910
I'll leave Anna alone.

370
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,030
Does that mean,

371
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,440
you don't want to be the President?

372
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,600
You've become very childish. Are you saying that as a threat?

373
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,500
If I make a deal with Seong Won,

374
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:18,060
it may not be all of JB

375
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,940
but he probably would give me a few subsidiaries.

376
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,360
And I probably don't have to worry about feeding me.

377
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:39,940
Wow, what a joke. You can never do that.

378
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:44,050
Your ambition won't be satisfied with that,

379
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,380
you know it, too.

380
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,320
Is that right?

381
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,400
I guess so.

382
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,470
It that's so, then should I increase the size a bit?

383
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,520
This time,

384
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:11,110
should I make a deal with Park Gwan Soo?

385
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,700
Like I made a contract with you.

386
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,690
Frankly, there isn't much difference to me.

387
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:27,590
You and Park Gwan Soo are the same corrupt individuals.

388
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:34,970
If I give him your head and ask JB in return when he becomes the President,

389
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:42,240
do you think Park Gwan Soo will decline?

390
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,450
You must think I am joking.

391
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,300
Have you forgotten who I am?

392
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,370
You really did forget.

393
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:09,480
It's you who are nothing without me.

394
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,530
So don't dare to fool me.

395
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:18,100
Anna will die if her action merits death.

396
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,490
Tell me anytime if you don't like it.

397
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,760
That you are resigning from the candidacy.

398
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:38,050
What is that? The expression like you were wronged?

399
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,400
Don't you think I am the one who's been wronged?

400
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:50,240
You are the one who seduced me when I was so young to use me to fulfill your petty political ambition.

401
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,960
And I fell for it because I didn't know any better due to never having received proper love.

402
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,060
Should I tell you something embarrassing?

403
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,310
I was excited when you touched me, that is until recently.

404
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:10,610
You knew it, too, right?

405
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:15,130
You used it sometimes to play me.

406
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,070
But what to do now?

407
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:25,860
I feel nothing~ towards you now.

408
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,440
There. You want to touch me?

409
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,030
You sense those things well since you are a pro at that, right?

410
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,600
Okay, I admit.

411
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,030
You were dashing.

412
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:02,840
You were young, smart and righteous.

413
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,500
I believed that, too, like the other voters.

414
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,100
But you weren't that.

415
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:21,400
You were old, manipulative and dirty like you are now.

416
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,000
That's why

417
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,260
you betrayed Eom Hye Rin who loved you desperately and let her die

418
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,490
by using my jealousy and anger.

419
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,160
You vulgar thing.

420
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:56,340
The very first time in my life, I got slapped by that damned hand.

421
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,430
I thought about giving orders to sever it.

422
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:05,420
But I am letting it remain attached because you might need it to shake hands during  the campaign.

423
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,400
Take care of it well.

424
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,300
When you don't need to campaign anymore,

425
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,070
I'll take it back.

426
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:46,400
♬ A pure girl meets a wolf in the thick forest ♬

427
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:53,890
♬ She doesn’t know, what is fear? ♬

428
00:42:53,890 --> 00:43:00,700
♬ He's an evil beast ♬

429
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:10,200
♬ When she sees a beautiful flower ♬

430
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:17,690
♬ He whispers something in her ear ♬

431
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:23,750
♬ To get the beautiful flower ♬

432
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:33,440
♬ Without ceasing, treading in the deep forest ♬

433
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,130
Where to, Madam.

434
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,050
Let's toast!

435
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,390
Team Leader, say something.

436
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:22,030
You all worked hard. Let's eat and die! Cheers!

437
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,150
Hey, hey, hey. You are breaking the mood.

438
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:29,820
What if your face gets hot again?

439
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,870
I am okay.

440
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,970
Hey. Just leave her alone. It's just one drink.

441
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:36,710
What's with him?

442
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,900
Will you really be okay?

443
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,860
I can handle this much.

444
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:51,890
Drink, drink, drink! Booze is going in!

445
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:55,610
Wow!

446
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,140
You drink it fine.

447
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,440
What the heck?! That isn't it.

448
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
What?

449
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,070
You lose if you are envious.

450
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,950
No wonder she took two pieces of meat.

451
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,040
What are you doing?

452
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,440
Just eat the wrap and not the hand.

453
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,560
I think it smells.

454
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:39,020
Was he always close with the rapid response team?

455
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,800
No. He wasn't.

456
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,700
Should I call K2?

457
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:52,060
No. He's probably tired.

458
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,810
Let him have a drink and rest today.

459
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:07,500
Bring him to Cloud 9... tomorrow morning.

460
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,550
Understood.

461
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,650
We are home!

462
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,240
We need to stay strong.

463
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,770
Watch this carefully.

464
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:28,630
♫ Cheer up baby. Cheer up baby. ♫

465
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:33,460
Get your strength a bit more.

466
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,790
Jae Ha. Thanks.

467
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,490
About what?

468
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:52,700
What's wrong? What's up Hyung? It's not like you. You are weird.

469
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,980
Hyung?

470
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,730
Me what?

471
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,630
What's with you? Let go quickly.

472
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,540
Ah, this is so gross.

473
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,720
I really hate being hugged by men.

474
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,280
Creepy.

475
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,190
Miss, thank you for tonight. We enjoyed it.

476
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,270
We had fun!

477
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,500
I enjoyed it, too.

478
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,610
- We are leaving. 
 - Hurry and leave! You are so noisy.

479
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,010
Let's go!

480
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,860
Hey! Who's driving? Anyone who didn't drink?

481
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,560
None. I think you have to drive yourself.

482
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,110
These punks really...

483
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,110
Wow! This is really funny.

484
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,850
You too Team Leader.

485
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:59,000
No. I don't want it. I don't want it. Ah!

486
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:05,960
This is why all the substitute drivers ran off. Even men need to take care their faces these days.

487
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,670
Really?

488
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,050
Jae Ha, have a seat!

489
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,260
What a sight? Seriously...

490
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,330
You too come here--- What's wrong? Are you hurt somewhere?

491
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,560
No. It doesn't hurt.

492
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,590
If you are okay, then have a seat.

493
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,400
- Let's put it on. 
- I don't want to.

494
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,610
Why?

495
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,450
I don't want to. These things are only needed for ugly people like that.

496
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:29,290
Looking like me, don't need---

497
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:32,080
Come here punk!

498
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,850
Don't look at me. It's quite creepy.

499
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,710
But are you faces wrong or the pack is wrong?

500
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:48,000
I said I don't want it. Seriously...

501
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:00,330
I said don't watch!

502
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,560
Uh Mi Ran.

503
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,860
I am not Mi Ran.

504
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:22,660
What? You scared me.

505
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,070
Why am I here?

506
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,860
I can't kill them all, either.

507
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,420
 You too come here--- What's wrong? Are you hurt somewhere? 

508
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,980
 No, it doesn't hurt. 

509
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:02,200
 Are you asleep? 

510
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,930
 No I am not. 

511
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,210
 Where are you at? 

512
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,010
 The roof. 

513
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,290
Did you clean up like this?

514
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,390
No, I asked Ahjumma.

515
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,860
I asked her to clean up since you come here often.

516
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,970
Wow!

517
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,310
- What do you think? 
- I love it.

518
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:34,340
- You like it? 
- This is awesome.

519
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,200
Wow!

520
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,900
What are you doing now?

521
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,010
Take it off.

522
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,280
Here? Suddenly why?

523
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,690
- Take it off. 
- Isn't it too racy? 
- No.

524
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,890
Why? Take it off.

525
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,770
I am not ready.

526
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,680
It must hurt really bad.

527
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,950
No, I am okay. It's just nicked a bit.

528
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:15,170
Nonsense. You call this nicked, uh? Uh?

529
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,250
Anna.

530
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,280
Be sure to go to the hospital tomorrow, um?

531
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,190
Uh, okay. I'll go to the infirmary tomorrow.

532
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:30,780
You are mine, aren't you? Should you be careless like this?

533
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,640
Okay, I won't.

534
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,060
Hold on.

535
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,470
All done.

536
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,280
- Are you done? 
 - Yeah.

537
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,590
Thank you. It doesn't hurt at all.

538
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:11,780
The night air is chill already.

539
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,680
I know, right? But it's okay now.

540
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,250
Why is that?

541
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,660
Wait here for a minute.

542
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,230
♫   When I see you my heart hurts ♫ 

543
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:31,860
♫   What good does that do to my heart ♫ 

544
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:37,810
It's chilly. Whoa, so warm.

545
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:41,280
Really warm.

546
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,920
♫   Saying it's okay I keep trying ♫ 

547
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,870
I am just kidding. Kidding.

548
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:50,040
So cold. Cold.

549
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,580
Here.

550
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:57,170
How is it? It's warm, isn't it?

551
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:02,390
Yes.

552
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,740
By the way,

553
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,630
♫   Every so often I used to cry silently ♫ 

554
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,600
do we have only one blanket?

555
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,230
No.

556
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:13,900
Then, why are we sharing one like this?

557
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,240
Huh?

558
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,030
♫   I'm standing by myself ♫ 

559
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,680
Just... you know.

560
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:36,850
♫   Will running again and again toward you ♫ 

561
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:45,480
♬   do any good for this heart?  ♬

562
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,530
Anna.

563
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:48,870
Huh?

564
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:54,570
We, later, later...

565
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,460
shall we go live in Spain?

566
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:07,350
♬   When my mind which cannot go to you  ♬

567
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:09,540
Why? Don't like it?

568
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,980
♬   becomes fixated on "I want to see you"  ♬

569
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:15,150
That place is...

570
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,800
where I hated so much that I tried to escape from.

571
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,670
Right.

572
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,740
Because it's the place we met for the first time as well.

573
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:31,680
Let's go.

574
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,460
I will be okay if we go together.

575
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:43,450
♫  I always recall your face again.  ♫

576
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:47,530
When I come to think of it, I don't know that much about you.

577
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,440
What did you do in Spain?

578
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,620
I was on the run.

579
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,930
Why?

580
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:19,130
Because I was accused of murdering someone whom I could not protect.

581
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,650
Did you love that person?

582
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,430
Yes.

583
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,870
Is that why you were having a nightmare every night?

584
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,250
Yes.

585
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,390
It must have beeen hard for you.

586
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,780
No.

587
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,290
It must be hard even now.

588
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:21,160
I am

589
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,920
okay.

590
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:32,480
♫   You, who are smiling innocently ♫ 

591
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:40,100
♫   For some reason you weren't even afraid of me ♫ 

592
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,570
Anna.

593
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:50,550
I didn't have anything I wanted to protect.

594
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,720
So I had nothing to fear.

595
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,490
But now I have someone I want to protect.

596
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,520
So

597
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,920
I think I can be happy.

598
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:19,930
♫   I can't move and I can't get close either  ♫

599
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:25,790
When can we 
 ♫   As if the wind stood still, as if I've fallen into a spell   ♫

600
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:34,130
go to Spain? 
♫   It's like I've seen you at the end of  a scented path   ♫

601
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:40,780
After this war is over.

602
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:46,620
♫  Maybe it was you, the flower was you   ♫

603
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:53,680
♫  Maybe you ooh ooh   ♫

604
00:58:53,680 --> 00:59:00,850
♫   It's you, it was you  ♫

605
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,540
Cool!

606
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:26,120
Welcome.

607
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,760
Madam is waiting for you.

608
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:33,050
Don't worry since I couldn't get Park Gwan Soo's head.

609
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:34,960
Please forgive

610
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,470
my rudeness before.

611
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,380
Welcome.

612
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,100
What wrong with her?

613
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,960
Chief Kim?

614
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,370
Why? Isn't it natural?

615
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:01,250
Because you are the hero who saved JSS.

616
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,880
A hero?

617
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,760
Don't be bothered with Chief Kim.

618
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,350
She is probably scared that you may ask for her head.

619
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:16,540
I guess there is nothing I can do since I couldn't bring Park Gwan Soo's head.

620
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,590
Should I still give you anyway?

621
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,650
Chief Kim's head? Well?

622
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:33,770
Sometimes your joke sounds

623
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:38,080
so real to me. Why is that?

624
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,210
Maybe my acting is so good, don't you think?

625
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:52,640
So is there anything you found out from Park Gwan Soo?

626
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,240
Well, I just got the deposit on the payment to kill you later.

627
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,240
Is that a good result?

628
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,080
After what you went through, did you sleep okay at night?

629
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,490
Yes.

630
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:15,840
What a relief.

631
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,180
Ah, Mrs. Chef and you guys,

632
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,350
I had assigned you as JB Chairman's side.

633
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:21,700
I gave you salary raise as well.

634
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:26,420
Was it okay? I did without your agreement. But if you don't like it, just say it.

635
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,590
We are....with your kindness--

636
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,340
I will pledge my loyalty.

637
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:34,560
Alright. You guys don't need to worry about JSS from now on.

638
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,520
Just focus on keeping Anna safe.

639
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,300
Yes.

640
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:44,960
Ah, since this is a JSS safe house, the security is...

641
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,830
This place?

642
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:50,260
No, this place belongs to the JB Construction originally.

643
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,540
I was lending it to Nonna.

644
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:55,260
So cut off the previous security system and set up new one.

645
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,500
If you call my secretarial team, they will support you with labor and expenses.

646
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,650
Yes, I understand.

647
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,280
Ah, you need some money.

648
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,930
This is a card with no limit. Use it when you need.

649
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,990
Geez. Take it quickly.

650
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,420
Thank you.

651
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:17,980
And I will put this house under your name. Live here.

652
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,890
My name for this house?

653
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:24,820
Right. It mean you can live here for good.

654
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,170
I was going to do that anyway.

655
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:30,450
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you very much.

656
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,780
Miss does't understand what you mean.

657
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,790
Miss, you should say, "thank you," in this case.

658
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:39,650
No, it's okay. She doesn't need to know such a thing.

659
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:47,330
Blood smell...

660
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:50,100
Not the smell of oil?

661
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:54,480
He must have said it unconsciously.

662
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,820
Couldn't he mean that he earned that money from selling weapons?

663
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,670
It could be.

664
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:07,540
I will look into it with my mirror.

665
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,240
More than that

666
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:14,550
it's about the time to set up a trap.

667
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:15,910
A trap?

668
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,360
Yes.

669
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:23,310
It won't be long

670
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,650
for Park Gwan Soo to approach you.

671
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:31,410
Since he will want to kill me more and more.

672
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:36,190
You have to get close to him

673
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:39,300
more and more as well.

674
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,710
Uncle.

675
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,670
By any chance,

676
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,470
do you know where my mom's grave is?

677
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:56,810
Yes. Of course.

678
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:01,010
I was waiting for you to say that.

679
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:04,280
Great timing. Since there is a commemorative fashion show for your mom tonight,

680
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,500
let's stop by there on the way to your mom's grave.

681
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,030
Now,

682
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:42,390
you have to do your job as well.

683
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:45,990
Yes. I started it already.

684
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,440
Is that so?

685
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,330
No matter what,

686
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:57,700
don't let Jae Ha know.

687
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:02,810
- You know that, right?
- I will keep that in my mind.

688
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:13,990
♫  My heart is aching and I can't breathe  ♫

689
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:20,070
♫  I can't touch you who have turned cold  ♫

690
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:26,190
♫  No matter how I try to reach  ♫

691
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:31,860
♫  you whoare spending the day in tears. I can only stare at your back blankly  ♫

692
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,620
♫  Everyday  ♫

693
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,070
♫  Because you remain  ♫

694
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:39,010
 I want to show my mom is inside me. 

695
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:42,570
 You need to remind people of Eom Hey Rin who was forgotten. 

696
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:45,730
 Don't you remember me? We met on that night. 

697
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:48,120
♫  Don't tell Jae Ha about this.  ♫

698
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,480
♫  Are you on my side or Choi Yoo Jin's side?  ♫

699
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,800
♫  The person who spread the dirty rumors.  ♫

700
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,380
♫  I must find them.  ♫

701
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,600
♫  I will have them punished.  ♫

702
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,700
♫  Mom  ♫

703
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,680
♫  Madam!  ♫

704
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,050
♫  Choi Yoo Jin won't do such a job to get blood on her hand.  ♫
