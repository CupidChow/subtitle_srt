00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,000
Do you have your ID?

139
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,080
- No.
 - Then you can't go in. Please return tomorrow.

How can you just send him away? The Chief is going crazy asking for it to get fixed right away.

143
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,660
Also, he's the same person that was here previously to hang the banner.

144
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,500
Still, without an ID, he can not.

145
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,790
You're in big trouble now. I think the Chief got quite an earful from the Madam.

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,100
 A story about our neighbor: "the person Jeong Ji Hyeon meets." Today's guest is Choi Yoo Jin. 

163
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,490
 Let's give a big round of applause. 

164
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,120
Wait.

165
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,750
 Hello.  Hello. 

166
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,790
-  Welcome.
- Thank you. 

167
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:10,220
 Lately, you're just as busy as Assemblyman Jang Se Joon. 

168
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,120
-  Thank you for taking the time to come today. 
 - I'm not that busy and not doing much. 

169
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,730
Aren't you tired of your seeing your wife's same face everyday?

170
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,700
 Do you know why we brought you here today? 

171
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,580
Let's hear what she has to say.

172
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,430
 We conducted a public opinion survey on the preferred candidate for the next first lady. 

173
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:30,940
Among the wives, you came in first across the board from the people who are in their 20's to their 70's.

174
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,010
What?

175
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,390
So among prospective presidential candidate's wives, you were number one from the popular vote.

176
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,280
Congratulations.

177
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,440
 - Me?
- Yes! 

178
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:09,560
 Eh, what do you mean? In the political circles, you are already known and praised as the queen of housewives. 

179
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:16,210
 Being a nice wife for my husband? I don't do much except take care that he doesn't skip breakfast. 

180
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,390
But do you personally make the assemblyman's breakfast?

181
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:25,460
I'm embarrassed to admit it. I think I spoiled him too much.

182
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,620
He's a picky eater, so he won't eat unless I cook for him.

183
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:34,570
I see. Well, your amazing cooking skill is the word around town.

184
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:38,370
People might believe you!

185
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:44,140
It's just something guests who came to visit say out of politeness.

186
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,620
You cook for your guests personally as well? With your own hands?

187
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,110
Yes. My cooking skills are embarrassing.

188
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,950
 How amazing. 

189
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,290
No more now.

190
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,560
You're being naughty.

191
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,790
Okay then.

192
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,490
Look at that.

193
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,700
I'll show you what's really naughty tonight.

194
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,240
Look at you.

195
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,320
You're going to get punished.

196
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,300
 Citizens' voices always fill my  ears. 

197
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,000
 Social Welfare Task Force 

198
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,190
Be sure to have the camera with you. Get everything on tape.

199
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,470
Yes.

200
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,510
Close the curtains.

201
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,410
Ow, my head.

202
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,220
You... damn it...

203
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,250
Why I'm going to--

204
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,790
Sleep well. It will be over soon.

205
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,900
- This is a restricted area.
 - Oh, I know. I'm going to do the restriction.

206
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,870
Grandma!

207
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,670
Grandma!

208
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,510
Grandma! Don't do it (to grandma)!

209
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,260
No! No!

210
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,700
Is anybody there?

211
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,690
What's this?

212
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,020
Rescue unit, please reply! Please reply!

213
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,060
- Team Leader, now...
- I'm on my way. Stay in your spot.

214
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,840
Yes, understood.

215
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,570
Get me out of here. Hurry!

216
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,240
Take me out of here! Hurry up!

217
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,710
Move away from the door!

218
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,480
Grandma!  Grandma!

219
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,380
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

220
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,680
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

221
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,960
♫  Run, run. I'm fine.  ♫

222
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,000
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

223
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,480
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

224
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,580
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

225
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,830
♫  Look out. Look out. Look out. Look out.  ♫

226
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,540
 This is P1. This is P1. 

227
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,680
 Advance squad, respond. Respond. 

228
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,530
Open the door.

229
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,560
 Team one to the stairs. To the stairs. 

230
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,250
 Take over the second floor. Take over. 

231
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,600
Hurry up, the SWAT team are here.

232
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,440
 Roger. 

233
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,010
 Hurry. 

234
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,000
 We should clear the situation before the police arrives.  

235
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,300
Pull out!

236
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,930
Pull out.

237
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,610
Grandma! Grandma!

238
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,750
Grandma! Grandma, are you okay?

239
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,350
The Assemblyman? What about him?!

240
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,240
Thankfully, they didn't penetrate the door to the special guest room.

241
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,720
Call 119. Call 119! ( 119 is the emergency number in Korea) 

242
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,880
Call an ambulance.

243
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,110
Situation room. Please disarm the lock on the door to the special guest room.

244
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,150
The door is unlocked!

245
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:38,370
But... This is something that came out while talking about you being a nice wife.

246
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,840
To be honest, Assemblyman got to his current position...

247
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,210
all thanks to his in-laws' support. Correct? There's a rumor like that.

248
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,830
In-laws?

249
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,650
Did he have anymore in-laws besides me?

250
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,710
That's funny.

251
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,750
Anyway, it's a fact that you are the eldest daughter of JB Group's Chairman.

252
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:08,840
And it's true that JB Group is one of the most successful conglomerates in our country.

253
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:17,500
Actually, I feel bad for him.

254
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:24,400
For meeting a person like me. Just... if he'd met a different woman,

255
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,760
his in-laws would've carried him on their backs, because he is such a great son-in-law.

256
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,270
Oh... you sound like there were some difficulties in the past.

257
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,730
You know, my late father...

258
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,400
hated  having a politician as his son-in-law  so much.

259
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:52,970
So... can it be that your late father cut you out because of the Assemblyman?

260
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:00,190
I'm sorry. Looks like it's a sensitive topic.

261
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,560
No, it's fine.

262
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:12,820
Men and woman... shouldn't they protect whom they love?

263
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,670
Madam, you loved  the Assemblyman so deeply,  didn't you?

264
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:21,630
So much so that you were able to give up your wealthy heiress position for your love?

265
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,910
Yes.

266
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,480
And actually I still...

267
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,340
respect him.

268
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,360
 119 

269
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,120
They're coming out!

270
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,790
How is the patient's condition?

271
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:53,140
Please tell me. How is the patient?

272
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,540
Please give a statement.

273
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,920
- He works for an advertising company...
- Yes.

274
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,790
He broke that tempered glass...

275
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:25,690
So, Madam, you don't have anymore shares of JB Group  now?

276
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:30,630
Even before marriage, I know you inherited a lot of them.

277
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,070
Ah...

278
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,870
You mean the shares I had when I was still unmarried.

279
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,270
I donated them a long time ago.

280
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:47,570
Ah. Are you referring to the Pyongchang Scholarship Foundation?

281
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,800
Yes.

282
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,970
However there is speculation that the Chairman and the Board of Directors of that Scholarship Foundation

283
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,030
have a special relationship with you.

284
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,700
 If that's true, don't you still 

285
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:03,320
have a lot of JB Group shares?

286
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,990
 PD, she wants to cut now for a break. 

287
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,980
Anchor Jo!  We' ll continue after the commercial break. 

288
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:24,560
Then, we'll hear your answers after the commercial break.

289
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,030
We'll do the commercial break!

290
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,830
Ji Hyeon.

291
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:47,820
Yes, Eonni?

292
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:52,360
I thought I told you that I didn't want the previous topic to be covered.

293
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,910
Eonni,  someone would've provoked you on this issue eventually.  (Eonni is a word for a woman to address an elder sister or woman.) 

294
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:01,610
Wouldn't it hurt less if the provocation were coming from me?

295
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,990
Right.

296
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:10,510
Everyone has at least one issue that hurts when you prod it.

297
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:20,830
Just like it would be your son for you.

298
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,510
The commercial break is over.

299
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:26,760
We'll be shooting. Please, turn on your mics.

300
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,840
Come on, shall we start?

301
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,060
Eonni, I apologize. I over did it.

302
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,400
Sure, Ji Hyeon. Let's just follow the script.

303
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:01,040
Madam, your interview today was so touching.

304
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,250
Really? Thank you so much. I was so nervous!

305
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:09,330
No! It was so genuine and you were so beautiful.

306
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,400
Could you excuse us for a moment, please?

307
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,940
What?

308
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,470
It's okay now. I will cleanse the rest of my make up off. Thank you.

309
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,720
Yes, Madam.

310
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,590
Oh, wait!

311
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,010
Thank you for today.

312
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,370
These are cookies that I made. I don't know if they are tasty though.

313
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,110
Oh, Madam, I'm so touched!

314
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,540
Can I take a picture of this?

315
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,930
What?

316
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,630
Ah, taking a photo...?

317
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,620
Yes.

318
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,270
I will not eat this; I will treasure it.

319
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,360
Thank you.

320
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,580
Again? Which side is it this time?

321
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,500
We haven't finished looking into it, but I believe it may be Assemblyman Park's side.

322
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,030
It's obvious.

323
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,740
 Cookies that Madam made by herself. 

324
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,870
 Behind it, Madam's 20 year old handbag. 

325
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,510
 I love you , Madam. It's an honor. Heart. Heart. 

326
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,230
Hey! What are you doing?

327
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,020
I'm so honored! These are made by Madam!

328
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,440
Really?

329
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,340
Give me some.

330
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,510
No! This is a treasure for my family.

331
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:57,470
Ah, you're such a cheapskate. Just show me the pictures.  Wow.

332
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,530
Looks tasty!

333
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:11,040
What should I do?

334
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,170
First  publish a statement that thieves broke into the office

335
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,900
and tried to steal the pledge book.

336
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,060
Yes, I got it.

337
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:25,360
Then, what about that girl?

338
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,840
After getting all the information out of her, just keep her for now.

339
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,190
I'll probably find a need for her later.

340
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,890
Yes, I got it.

341
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,300
That's enough.

342
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:52,240
There always seems to be more wrinkles.

343
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,810
How old is she?

344
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,940
Pardon?

345
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,620
That girl.

346
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,790
In her late 20's.

347
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,350
At least this time it's not a minor.

348
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,420
 It's me. 

349
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,280
Will I be eating your home-cooked breakfast starting tomorrow?

350
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,550
You looked very photogenic.

351
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:36,820
Is that so? I knew you would've taken care of it well.

352
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:42,210
Also... I'm concerned about that banner worker.

353
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,170
I hope you can take care of it specially.

354
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,190
That guy, so uselessly, saw me right in the face.

355
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:55,310
Banner... worker?

356
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,800
Okay.

357
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,920
Hello, Chairman Gook.

358
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,410
Yes.

359
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,430
Are you hiding something from me?

360
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,440
 What? That's not possible. How could I dare to? 

361
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:29,570
I shouldn't be like this with you, but I keep getting an unpleasant feeling.

362
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:34,270
Madam, that... it's not like that. I just tried not to bother you with little things.

363
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:37,330
After taking care of it myself, I was going to... Yes, yes... I am sorry.

364
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,680
I will keep that in mind.

365
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,660
I will definitely handle it.  I will report the results to you.

366
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,470
Yes.  Yes.  Please be at ease.

367
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:50,460
Crud. How did she find out?

368
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,320
Has the Rapid Response Team left?

369
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,400
Yes, we will capture him soon.

370
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,980
What's this mess because of one  sign hanger?

371
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,150
37 NAH 4012

372
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,210
Is that the only view you caught?

373
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,690
Yes.

374
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:31,210
Hold on, rewind back a little bit.

375
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,960
Yeah over there.

376
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,810
No way.

377
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:45,020
 JSS 

378
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,820
Oh, Manager Ju.

379
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,140
- Bring back the Rapid Response Team.
- What?

380
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,430
Or else they could all die.

381
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:19,030
What are you talking about?

382
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:50,130
Manager Ju, after following the candidate around recently, you seem to have learned how to exaggerate.

383
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:51,410
The crew is in danger.

384
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,960
Yeah, what you are saying is...

385
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,540
The kid ... Colonel Ju, no, no, no.

386
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:00,100
Manager Ju, you are saying  that guy was one of your subordinates when you were in the Special Mission Battalion, right?

387
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,570
Yes.

388
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,190
I understand.

389
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:29,240
So you want to say the Special Mission Battalion which you developed is the best in the world (by exaggerating about a banner fixer who used to worked for you).

390
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,770
- That's not what I'm saying. 
 - Manager Ju!

391
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:34,700
You don't understand what I am saying.

392
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,550
I say a full belly counsels well. 
 (I have to follow the order given to keep my job.) 

393
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:42,190
I had to send the  Rapid Response Team to catch a mere sign hanger.

394
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:48,250
JSS's Rapid Response Team, which is the most skillful in Korea, is being wasted (for a mere banner guy).

395
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,390
You will soon come to understand what I mean.

396
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:59,190
T-That... ar-arrogant bastard!

397
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,920
Look at that pu--

398
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,690
Hurry, let's go!

399
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:32,000
 Report in! Report the situation! 

400
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,580
 Report! 

401
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,900
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

402
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,860
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

403
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:50,370
♫  Run, run. I'm fine.  ♫

404
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:53,640
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

405
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,650
Hey! What happened?

406
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:20,740
I asked what happened!

407
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,130
What a relief.

408
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,970
What? Why are you saying it's a relief?

409
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,040
There's no one dead.

410
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:53,980
Why are you still in the living room?

411
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,540
It seems that I will be going to bed late tonight, as there is a situation that I need to be briefed on.

412
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:05,400
Why? Is there someone besides me who's stirring up trouble?

413
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,450
Your daughter.

414
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:42,870
What about Anna?

415
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:47,090
She ran away again.

416
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:53,360
It's about time that she had some sense, but still ...

417
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,250
Is it because of something hereditary?

418
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,790
If something bad happens to that child,

419
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,450
you know that our contract is over, right?

420
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:53,330
♬  Dies Irae (Latin)  The day of Wrath  ♬

421
01:00:55,290 --> 01:01:02,250
♬  That day  ♬

422
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:07,510
♬  Spare the supplicanting one, O God  ♬

423
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:12,030
♬  Save me, O font of mercy  ♬

424
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:17,900
♬  Judge me according to my deeds  ♬

425
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,990
♬  Before the Judgment Day  ♬

426
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,920
 "Dies Irae" is a 13th century Latin hymn 

427
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:46,440
♬  Spare the supplicanting one, O God  ♬

428
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:51,180
♬  Save me, O font of mercy  ♬

429
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:56,050
♬   Judge me according to my deeds   ♬

430
01:01:56,050 --> 01:02:00,990
♬   Before the Judgment Day   ♬

431
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:06,500
Okay, okay, okay! Yes, yes, let's do it. Let's do it.

432
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,070
No, no, no, we are going to sleep soon.

433
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,970
Champagne for everybody!

434
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,930
- You dance very well.
- Very well!
- Bravo!

435
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,420
Get this party started.

436
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,010
Party!

437
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,460
A kiss for Daddy!

438
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,430
Oh my God!

439
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:41,140
- What happened? 
- What's going on?

440
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:25,500
I didn't kill her.

441
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,180
I didn't kill her.

442
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:33,820
♫  My heart is aching and I can't breathe  ♫

443
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:39,860
♫  I can't touch you who have turned cold  ♫

444
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:43,200
♫  No matter how I try to reach  ♫

445
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,060
♫  You who are going farther away again  ♫

446
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,010
♫  Are spending the day in tears  ♫

447
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:51,810
♫  I can only stare at your back blankly  ♫

448
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:53,720
♫  Everyday  ♫

449
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,770
♫  In my heart still   ♫

450
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,460
 The K2 

451
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:00,250
 You mean to say you missed that banner man in the end? 

452
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:03,490
 He is someone we cannot catch with JSS. 

453
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:04,650
 Who sent you? 

454
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,910
 If I come a second time, you will die. 

455
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,370
 You saw the wrong thing in the wrong place. 

456
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,050
 I'm sorry. 

457
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:15,790
 You're pretty because you take after your mom. 

458
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:20,110
 I remembered everything! Mom did not commit suicide! 

459
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:25,530
 That child is the reason that I could not help but live all these years as Choi Yoo Jin's puppet.
