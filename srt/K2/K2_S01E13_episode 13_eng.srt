 "Choi Yoo Jin: Voluntary Prosecutor Appearance for Eom Hye Rin Case" 

18
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,330
I am deeply sorry

19
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,280
for not being honest with you throughout this time.

20
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:46,880
Everything is a result of my incompetence.

21
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,090
Yes, Anna is

22
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,810
my daughter.

23
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,910
She is my child, born of my heart.

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,430
So she's not? What is she saying?

25
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,490
She's not biological?

26
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,780
Anna is

27
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,200
my husband, Assemblyman Jang Se Joon's

28
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,560
biological daughter.

29
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,030
Are you saying Go Anna is Assemblyman Jang Se Joon's daughter?

30
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,000
Mr. Assemblyman, can you comment?

 "Barcelona Angel, Go Anna, Revealed to be Assemblyman Jang Se Joon's Daughter"

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,260
Assemblyman, give us a statement!

33
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,500
Is this true?

34
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,860
Please comment!

35
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,660
Is this really true?

36
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,420
Please give us a statement!

37
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:35,460
I apologize, everyone. For more details,

38
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,930
I will set a separate time and place

39
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,520
to tell you everything.

40
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,840
Please confirm.

41
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,730
Are you acknowledging Go Anna as your daughter?

42
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,350
Assemblyman, please give us a comment.

43
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,000
It's over.

44
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,560
Jang Se Joon is over!

45
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,230
 "Barcelona Angel, Go Anna, Revealed to be Assemblyman Jang's Daughter" 

46
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,920
That crazy...

47
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,110
Brother-in-law, what are you doing right now?

48
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,880
Are you crazy?

49
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,770
Chairman Choi, how are you taking care of business? I'm disappointed.

50
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,600
What? What are you talking about?

51
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,390
That witness...

52
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,120
the one who said he saw Choi Yoo Jin that night.

53
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,340
Yeah?

54
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,810
He's an actor. Bait.

55
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,690
You've been fooled by your sister.

56
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,980
He's here.

57
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,610
I met Eom Hye Rin in 1993,

58
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,590
when I was a labor and human rights lawyer.

59
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,990
I was working ad hoc for animal advocacy groups back then.

60
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,850
We came to love each another.

61
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,130
We were even engaged to be married.

62
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,880
But during the by-elections in 1974, for being the leader of  Hanchongryun group, and hiding some of the leading members of the group,

63
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,670
I was arrested and imprisoned.

64
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:16,610
When Eom Hye Rin went to the US to film a movie,

65
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,090
I received the heartbreaking news in prison

66
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,610
that she married director Go Joon Ho.

67
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,320
When defeat and tribulation pain came,

68
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,050
the one who brought me back up is my current wife,

69
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,580
Choi Yoo Jin. 
 Presidential Candidate  Assemblyman Jang Se Joon emergency press conference. 

70
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:48,190
After that, we were married. We were happy.

71
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:57,260
And in 1996, I was elected to the National Assembly thanks to my wife's tearful hard work.

72
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,250
Wow. I never expected this.

73
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:07,980
Right. Your wife bought you a party nomination. He is surely trying hard to make a story sad.

74
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,090
After many years passed, one day

75
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,230
Eom Hye Rin showed up to me with young Anna.

76
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,850
She notified me that Anna is my biological daughter.

77
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,960
Ever since then, to me and my wife,

78
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,380
 the days have been like a continuing nightmare. 

79
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,690
A nightmare?

80
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,670
 My wife tried to forgive my past with her big heart 

81
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,990
while working on placating Eom Hye Rin.

82
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,730
But Eom Hye Rin insisted that I should divorce with my wife

83
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:56,090
and she asked me to come with her to America.

84
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:03,610
She blackmailed me that she was going to reveal to the media that I had a child from an affair otherwise.

85
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,470
Is that true?

86
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,760
A lie.

87
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,660
No. It's a lie.

88
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,790
- It's all lie. 
 - Even though I would have to risk my political life, 

89
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:23,360
I had no choice but

90
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,770
to refuse the threat to betray my wife whom I love.

91
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,250
My dad...

92
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,060
how can my dad say such a thing?

93
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,340
On one night,

94
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:44,300
if I would not rush to her at once,  she threatened to commit suicide with sleeping pills.

95
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,530
Since I heard the same thing before,

96
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,420
I didn't believe her.

97
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,730
And on the very next day,

98
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,820
Eom Hye Rin was

99
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,220
found as a cold body.

100
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,500
According to the police investigation, it was a suicide.

101
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,370
But still,  I know well

102
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,410
that I caused Eom Hye Rin's death.

103
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:43,740
I have been living in remorse and agony.

104
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,870
To the country's citizens, I am truly sorry.

105
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,290
As the saying goes, a person who can run a happy and peaceful family can run a happy and peaceful world, too.

106
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,650
I couldn't live in such a way.

107
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,990
I am responsible for every sin.

108
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:09,450
She tries to embrace the daughter whom she didn't give a birth to and has lived in agony.

109
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:17,420
Therefore, please don't blame my wife.

110
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,080
 No matter how much you blame or censure me, 

111
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,460
or even whip me for my wrongdoing,

112
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,450
I am willing to take and accept all humbly.

113
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,770
However, as for my poor wife,

114
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,570
I beg of you from the bottom of my heart

115
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,530
to protect her from being blamed.

116
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,100
Thank you for  listening to me fully.

117
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,320
Wait and see.

118
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,430
When a witness comes forward, it's going to be the end of Choi Yoo Jin.

119
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,100
So is this the person you had witnessed at the scene?

120
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,450
No, I was saying that I had seen something.

121
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,680
 Hey, look at her carefully.  

122
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,270
You had said that you saw this woman at the scene of Eom Hye Rin's murder.

123
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:07,960
The thing is... I was hoping that.... if Go Anna got me a capable lawyer for my case,

124
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,360
it could be a great help for me,  To be honest, I had so unfairness done to me.

125
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,810
 I heard that you saw this lady at the scene. Huh? 

126
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,390
You.... then, you were falsely accusing this lady, do you know?

127
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,790
Why was I accusing her falsely? I was just saying I might have.

128
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:30,480
When did I? What I am saying is... that girl was asking,

129
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,330
if this person who was on TV with her killed her mother or not.

130
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:40,140
I said it might be.... I answered, "maybe." Something like that.

131
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,500
He is driving me crazy.

132
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:58,900
Well, I heard that bastard was being questioned in the Jongam Police Station at the time of Eom Hye Rin's death.

133
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,300
What? Gosh, my head. my head.

134
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,530
Please send her out. Hurry!

135
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,390
The longer she stays, the worse the public opinion gets of us.

136
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:16,460
I mean, what sin did Choi Yoo Jin commit? The bad one's the girl who dumped a guy for going to jail and then ran away to America.

137
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,730
In any case, women and men all need loyalty.

138
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,040
She just didn't expect him to be released as "not guilty."

139
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,830
However, don't you think Eom Hye Rin also came back to live close to him because Jang Se Joon gave her some hope?

140
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,880
Gosh, what else would he do? Would he say 'not my problem' even though the child is his?

141
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,250
Then that would be even worse! They say that Choi Yoo Jin already knew everything.

142
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,340
She probably lost a lot of money from it.

143
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,850
Right? Isn't Eom Hye Rin's face something?

144
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,930
In any case, good looking ones are always causing some troubles.

145
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,570
I know, right?

146
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,700
 However, I hope that you look favorably upon my poor wife 

147
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,500
What did I tell you? I told you it was all an act!

148
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,340
  I beg of you. 

149
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,840
You're right.

150
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,420
Gosh, so scary eh?

151
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:12,450
If she sets up a trap like that, there's no way you wouldn't get caught.

152
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,370
That guy is a fraud. An actor that my sister set up.

153
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,470
What? How can that be? Then that guy was just acting in front of us?

154
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,660
You and I would be lucky if we don't get called in for investigation for perjury instigation.

155
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,360
A sin? What did we do wrong?

156
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,380
We did do wrong. And very wrong at that.

157
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,980
Hey, don't worry about it. The lawyers will take care of it, okay?

158
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:52,680
That prison witness... is probably your doing?

159
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,490
Yes.

160
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:00,050
Well, of course. And this is all a trap for Choi Yoo Jin to catch Anna?

161
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,270
Do you know how despicable it is... to think up these things without a second thought?

162
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,680
Well, I'm not too sure.

163
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,320
You didn't need to go this far.

164
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,110
You didn't need to bring up the investigation of her dead mother!

165
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:27,030
Then, do you expect me to stand and watch the forces that threaten madam!

166
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:32,070
Hey. You guys made a mistake.

167
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:53,060
Madam, you've gone through a great ordeal. Thank you so much for participating in our questions.

168
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,560
It's nothing. Just my civic duty as a citizen.

169
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,180
Gosh, if you say it like that, I'm even more grateful.

170
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,210
Honestly, we just wanted to take off the stigma of your false accusation

171
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,620
as a simple reference witness questioning.

172
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,480
Whatever. Send my regards to Assemblyman Park.

173
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,490
What?

174
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,870
Which Assemblyman Park?

175
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,480
Let's go.

176
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,950
Are you going to retaliate against the tabloid reporters? It's true that Eom Hye Rin blackmailed you?

177
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,140
Then will Go Anna now be Jang Anna?

178
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,090
How is your body's condition? Was there any excessive investigation by the police?

179
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,430
I'm sorry.

180
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,810
I'm sorry. About everything... It's all my fault.

181
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,310
What kind of threats did Eom Hye Rin give you?

182
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,350
Does Go Anna know these facts too?

183
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,260
I'm sorry.

184
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,110
I'm sorry.

185
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,940
Can you give us one statement?

186
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,620
I'm sorry, her condition is very weak.

187
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,860
What did you say during the cross-examination?

188
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,770
What will become of Anna now?

189
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,820
Does Anna know about these facts?

190
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,690
How are you feeling now?

191
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,530
What will you do with Anna?

192
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,130
Please stay strong!

193
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,420
Get well soon!

194
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,370
Gosh, will you look at that. She looks half dead.

195
00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:00,330
The world's so strange. What sin did Choi Yoo Jin commit that she has to go through such humiliation?

196
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,460
Is being a politician's wife a crime?

197
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,200
I know, right? It's a relief that my husband doesn't want to be President.

198
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,940
What?!

199
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:15,990
But, this is all no doubt all set up by Park Gwan Soo to humiliate Jang Se Joon.

200
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,670
Right?

201
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:21,160
It's obvious! Is there anyone who never dated before they got married?

202
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,740
If there is, they're more pathetic ones. Isn't that right?

203
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,900
Yeah.

204
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,020
Chief of Police!

205
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,200
Please give us a comment!

206
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,610
I don't have anything to say!

207
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,320
Chief of Police, what happened in the confrontation?( The accused is allowed to request a  confrontation with the accusing witness  )

208
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,030
A confrontation? What confrontation?

209
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,960
There were rumors floating that there will be a confrontation  between Choi Yoo Jin and the eyewitness of Eom Hye Rin's case.

210
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,160
Hey! How can reporters write such trash?

211
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,340
Is it true that Eom Hye Rin was a blackmailer?

212
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:49,230
Well, we were just having Madam Choi Yoo Jin as an innocent victim of a wrong rumor...

213
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,790
We just conducted a simple reference questioning. Then that's all.

214
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,060
Wow, I got tricked again.

215
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,510
Wow, that con-couple.

216
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,430
Oh, my my. Those things!

217
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,030
Madam, please get well soon!

218
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,990
Yes, please!

219
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,450
Madam, stay strong!

220
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,750
Get well!

221
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,690
Stay strong!

222
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,320
We all understand!

223
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,090
Please don't let down.

224
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:41,590
We'll root for you until the end!

225
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,450
Madam, fighting!

226
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:53,620


227
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,560
Sister, I have nothing to say. I'm sorry.

228
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:25,080
It's cool that my little brother has the nerve to come see me.

229
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,870
Isn't that right?

230
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,620
Your acting skills weren't subpar either.

231
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,190
So go and wait. Until I make up my mind on what to do with you.

232
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,820
Okay, alright. I'll leave myself in your hands.

233
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,890
And...

234
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,500
from now on, you probably shouldn't get involved with Anna, right?

235
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Oh, of course I shouldn't!

236
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,150
I got it.

237
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,350
And those JSS security guards you took away.

238
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,640
Who? Oh, Mrs. Chef, Mi Ran and Seong Gyu?

239
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,320
You even know their names?

240
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,210
Since they're your employees, it's your responsibility to take care of them, right?

241
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,190
Take care of them?

242
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,430
After I send Anna overseas, take care of them cleanly.

243
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,670
Oh. I got it. Don't worry.

244
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,970
Just take care of your body. I'll get going.

245
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:42,000
Oh, that's right. That's you, right? The one who killed Eom Hye Rin.

246
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,370
Are you wearing a wire?

247
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,870
What are you talking about? With a relationship like ours?

248
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,820
Hey now. Take care of yourself!

249
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,360
"Anna"

250
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,030
 Save me. 

251
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,370
 Please save me. 

252
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,440
 I'm sorry 

253
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,900
♬ Be good in the meantime ♬

254
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:04,600
 Love isn't supposed to be divided.  
♬  Lock the door well ♬

255
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:12,900
♬ And be careful of the wolf ♬

256
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,970
 The person you have dialed is unable to answer. 

257
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,180
I should have told you back then.

258
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,940
That I went to the prison.

259
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,210
I'm sorry.

260
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,120
That I lied to you.

261
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:26,130
I must be really dumb.

262
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,520
It's okay.

263
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,390
It's okay.

264
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,980
Don't cry. If you cry, you lose your strength. If you lose your strength,

265
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,390
you can't fight.

266
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,000
Fight?

267
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,130
The real fight...

268
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,590
begins now.

269
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,130
Your dad is here.

270
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,430
Make sure to meet him today.

271
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:12,290
Meet him and listen to what he has to say.

272
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,390
Anna,

273
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,370
I'm sorry.

274
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,960
I... am a foolish person.

275
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,040
And...

276
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,110
I am a liar.

277
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:33,290
Everything I said at the news conference was all a lie.

278
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:39,600
Your mother never threatened me.

279
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,850
She just...

280
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,960
just begged me is all.

281
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,910
And your mother

282
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,130
did not commit suicide.

283
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,720
Everything I said

284
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,690
at the JSS infirmary the other time when we met

285
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,510
was a lie.

286
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,310
Choi Yoo Jin was watching us,

287
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,510
so on purpose

288
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,070
I tried to hurt you.

289
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,620
Why are you telling me all this now?

290
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,980
I don't really want to hear it.

291
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,380
It's because I'm a scaredy-cat.

292
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,610
I'm afraid that I'll lose even you.

293
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm being honest.

294
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,170
You're probably afraid that you won't be able to stay in politics.

295
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,230
Anna, that's...

296
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,850
That is...

297
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,490
because it's all I have.

298
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,200
If I lose that,

299
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,830
I will never be able to take you back,

300
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,330
or make you happy again.

301
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,810
Why do you think politics is all you have?

302
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,330
It's because you...

303
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,170
threw away Mom and me.

304
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,620
So what it is that you want to say?

305
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,440
That until you become President,

306
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,630
to stop causing trouble and stay quiet?

307
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,970
Stop rebelling against Choi Yoo Jin, the one who killed Mom?

308
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,150
The things you said back at the infirmary...

309
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,610
weren't lies because Choi Yoo Jin was watching.

310
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,950
Think about it again.

311
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,390
It was your true self. 
♬  Come, please me  ♬

312
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,940
So don't be afraid anymore.

317
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,490
lost your daughter.

318
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:44,280

331
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:50,570
♬  My beloved one not  ♬

332
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,480
Okay, let's start again.

333
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,360
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

334
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,500
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

335
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,860
♫  Run, run. I'm fine.  ♫

336
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,160
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

337
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,400
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

338
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,060
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

339
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,370
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

340
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,620
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

341
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,920
♫  Run, run. I'm fine.  ♫

342
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,220
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

343
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,520
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

344
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,740
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

345
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,990
Mom,

346
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,490
I'm sorry.

347
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,990
I ruined everything.

348
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,840
I'm sorry.

349
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,720
Your mother liked hydrangeas.

350
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,690
One day, your father came home drunk and bought hydrangeas. He said, "Don't you like these?"

351
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:20,580
Honestly, I don't like hydrangeas, but it did feel good.

352
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,540
But... later when I went to your house,

353
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,660
your living room was full of hydrangeas in vases.

354
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,070
You probably hate me so much you could kill me.

355
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:55,160
But even in the moments I thought I should kill you, I never hated you.

356
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:02,400
Because in some ways, you are similar to me.

357
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:15,020
When I was your age, I didn't have a mother.

358
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:21,630
Instead in that place, I had a stepmother who stole away my father.

359
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:29,180
She was first my father's secretary, then his concubine, and then even occupied the master bedroom.

360
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:36,380
That woman is the mother of the one you call "uncle"- Seong Won's mother.

361
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,250
But ironically enough,

362
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,220
I have now become your stepmother.

363
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,200
That's right,

364
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,200
your mother could have been like that.

365
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,100
Your mother might not have known about her pregnancy,

366
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,260
and she could've gotten married while pregnant with a child,

367
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,850
and she could've given birth to the child, and gotten a divorce.

368
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:19,940
If she wanted to see the baby's father, she could've come back.

369
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,930
However,

370
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,360
what was I supposed to have done, then?

371
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,410
I threw away everything that I had in order to choose your father.

372
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:39,600
Then now, are you trying to say that's the reason why you killed my mom?

373
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:53,820
How good would it have been if you were my biological child instead?

374
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:07,140
You are no longer Go Anna, but Jang Anna. You will become my daughter.

375
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,340
Real, lawful daughter.

376
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:20,330
And I don't have any other children. If you just stay still, you can become the President's daughter,

377
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:26,880
and later, if you're lucky, you can become JB Group's owner. Even after you've inherited everything I own,

378
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,430
if you still want to take revenge, do it then.

379
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,030
I don't need any of that.

380
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,400
Then just quietly leave! Yeah,

381
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,380
go find LaFelt. Be a model, muse, designer,

382
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:06,890
whatever you want to do! I can support you however you want. You can't do anything here.

383
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:12,180
You can no longer act like a sad celebrity, either.

384
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,560
Your mother's dead. Your father's not very trustworthy.

385
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:23,100
But do you really want to continue living with a stepmother like me?

386
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,200
What if I said I don't want to?

387
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,010
What if I want to look for my mother's killer until the end?

388
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:42,650
Then your life will continue to only have sad stories.

389
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,080
You'll see the death of everyone you love.

390
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,260
Mi Ran, Chef woman, Seong Gyu, AND!
Kim Jae Ha

391
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:58,130
Everyone will die protecting you, die fighting for you.

392
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:01,480
Nope. Before that,

393
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,510
Jae Ha will kill you.

394
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:14,680
You don't know, do you? Why Kim Jae Ha is working with me.

395
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:22,260
Just like you have PTSD with flashlights, Jae Ha also has PTSD.

396
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,260
Jae Ha can't kill anyone,

397
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:31,990
so I agreed to pull the trigger on his behalf to get his revenge.

398
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,750
Revenge?

399
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,790
Yeah, revenge!

400
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:40,160
He's holding hands with me to get revenge for the person he loved.

401
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,640
He said he was engaged?

402
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:50,020
And in the end, when he gets revenge, he'll probably leave your side.

403
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,130
So don't have lingering attachments to guys.

404
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,400
You didn't know, right? Why don't you ask your uncle some questions?

405
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,010
Lies.

406
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:09,080
You didn't know, did you? I'm going to leave with Jae Ha.

407
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,460
Is that what he said? "Let's leave together"?

408
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:23,020
Do you even know the name "Kim Jae Ha" is an alias?

409
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,690
You don't even know anything!

410
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,290
He can't travel overseas with his real identity. He's wanted by Interpol.

411
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,790
I know, too. He was framed.

412
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:43,820
So that's what he told you? That he was framed for Raniya's murder?

413
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,230
Raniya?

414
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:54,120
You didn't even know her name? But that's not it. Kim Jae Ha didn't become wanted because of Raniya's murder.

415
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,420
He was referred to the war crimes court for allegedly slaughtering civilians in Iraq.

416
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,040
If you don't believe me, then ask him yourself.

417
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,320
He can't live without the identity I made for him, and

418
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,810
with one phone call, he'll be forever locked in a prison cell.

419
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,060
Do you really want to make him that way?

420
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:29,870
Hello

421
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,960
Please eat comfortably.

422
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,520
Bon Appetite. Be healthy!

423
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,190
Eat as much as you'd like!

424
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,030
Eat a lot!

425
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,520
Yes, yes.

426
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,210
Hello.

427
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,580
Do you need any more?

428
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,590
Yes.

429
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,760
Do you need anything else?

430
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,280
Oh, no. Everything's great!

431
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,540
Alright.

432
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:52,800
That's how it went...

433
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,620
Is Anna doing okay?

434
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,060
Yes.

435
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:23,890
Physically... she is fine.

436
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,180
Alright. What is it you wanted to say?

437
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:33,210
I think you're really a bad father.

438
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,900
So what?

439
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,560
So...

440
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,220
I want to give you the opportunity to be a good father.

441
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:48,820
I think that's already an impossible feat.

442
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:54,600
I'll make Park Gwan Soo lose the presidency and take you out of the grasp of Choi Yoo Jin and Choi Seong Won.

443
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:00,860
Instead, I want you to bring Anna's mother's killer to light. For Anna's sake.

444
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,710
It seems you have something.

445
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,560
Then Jae Ha was here all along?

446
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,000
Yes.

447
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,250
He worked quite hard.

448
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:29,440
Uh, Madam. Did you really need to give K2 full access to Mirror?

449
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,830
Do you know why Mirror's name is Mirror?

450
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:43,500
It's because if you want to get an answer from Mirror, you first have to show your true reflection.

451
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:51,380
Mirror, what did Kim Jae Ha ask you about so far?

452
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,910
 Kumar autonomous government military scale status. 
Oil field development status in northwest Iraq. 

453
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:01,170
 Geological survey reports of major oil regions.
List of Kumar oil field business consortium. 

454
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,420
 List of subcontractors related to Kumar oil field business. 

455
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,730
Enough. That's enough.

456
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,570
If you combine the items on the list, what was Kim Jae Ha looking for?

457
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:13,100
 Evidence on Kumargate. 

458
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:17,320
Kumargate? Did you make the name?

459
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,310
 Agent Kim Jae Ha created the name for the Kumar oil field development scam. 

460
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,410
If you can get me out of Choi Yoo Jin's grasp like you say,

461
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,050
I'll make the promise.

462
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,770
So tell me now, what is it that you know?

463
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:44,720
There is tremendous corruption scam which was masterminded by Park Gwan Soo and the financial world together.

464
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,690
I mean, it hasn't been fully revealed yet

465
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:55,050
but inside, the President seems to be deeply involved as well.

466
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,720
Really? Do you have any ground for that?

467
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,140
Not just any ground, but I'll bring you water-tight evidence.

468
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,260
Water-tight?

469
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:08,140
Yes. Just the fact that you have it will cause Park Gwan Soo to back off on his own.

470
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:13,200
Because perhaps every one in the finance world will kneel down in front of you with that real evidence.

471
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:20,060
And, of course, we will be able to break down Choi Yoo Jin and JB in one moment.

472
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:34,480
But what is the reason you want me to have it?

473
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,660
Because the Assemblyman is a really bad politician.

474
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,810
You're also always ready to betray Choi Yoo Jin, aren't you?

475
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,900
Right now, Choi Yoo Jin set up the deaths of everyone around Anna.

476
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:03,390
And this is the exact way that we can get rid of Choi Yoo Jin and Park Gwan Soo at the same time.

477
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:10,950
In order to save Anna, and also in order to do  justice to Anna's mother.

478
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:17,860
Alright, fine. Let me be a good father for once.

479
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,670
Mirror,

480
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,420
did Kim Jae Ha ask anything about me?

481
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,830
 He did not. 

482
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:46,520
Then what about Eom Hye Rin?

483
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,420
 He did not. 

484
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,750
I told you he has good manners.

485
00:46:53,750 --> 00:47:00,990
Perhaps he knew that he wouldn't be able to get any of your information from Mirror?

486
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,630
Well, I don't care.

487
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:13,530
Mirror, then what did Kim Jae Ha ask at the very end?

488
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:18,930
 A list of non-political non-combat and non-political Korean civilians who stayed in the Kumar area. 

489
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,710
There were people like that in Kumar?

490
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,710
 Yes, there were. 

491
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,320
Show me.

492
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,120
They're just medical volunteers.

493
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,660
 Woo Sang Hyeok, Kim Seok Han, Do Yeong Gyoon] 

494
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,620
W-why are you like that, madam?

495
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,760
Kim Seok Han...

496
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,490
Mirror, is that Kim Seok Han  that  Kim Seok Han?

497
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,930
 It is as you have guessed. 

498
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,840
Are you talking about the doctor? The neurologist?

499
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,550
He's the son.

500
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,220
The President's son.

501
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,680
Jae Ha finally found it.

502
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,860
 Kim Seok Han
Songdo Hospital, Neurosurgeon 

503
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,150
Kumargate's vessel.

504
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,630
Is everything ready for the surgery?

505
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:24,060
Yes, everyone's waiting.

506
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,040
Alright, let's go.

507
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,120
 Assemblyman Park Gwan Soo 

508
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,700
What brings you in? You've come a long way.

509
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:08,840
Well, you know the deposit you gave me for the contract?

510
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,760
I wanted to get the remaining balance.

511
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,730
Why?

512
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,200
What do you mean why? It's because I need the money.

513
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:22,070
Why? So you can run away with Jang Se Joon's daughter in the middle of the night?

514
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,170
Wow, there's really nothing you don't know!

515
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,530
Have a seat.

516
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:44,700
But you know, last time after the troublemaker daughter's incident,

517
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:52,310
Choi Yoo Jin's popularity rose up by a little but Jang Se Joon's popularity went down by a lot.

518
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,300
So, in a time like this,

519
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:03,200
I am in a doubt if I really need to use you or not.

520
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,820
But I don't really think it's a situation you can be relaxed about.

521
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,670
Did you hear something?

522
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,720
Kumargate evidence?

523
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,700
I think they're very close to finding it.

524
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,050
You...

525
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:31,270
How did you know about that?

526
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:38,000
How would I know about that? Kumargate?

527
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,190
Oh, and Kim Seok Han. It seems they're surveilling him too.

528
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:03,710
Last night, it seems Kim Jae Ha met Park Gwan Soo in secret.

529
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,990
What did you say? Park Gwan Soo?

530
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:12,170
Oh, did you not know too, Madam?

531
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,160
Then, this punk, by any chance..?

532
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,530
Leave him. It's as planned. Manager Ju?

533
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:22,470
Yes.

534
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,880
Please back Jae Ha up.

535
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,650
Yes, ma'am.

536
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:35,340
Please do your best. This mission will change the direction of the election.

537
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:42,520
No, this might change the map of the finance world in this country.

538
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:57,380
-Welcome.
-Oh, yes. I apologize.

539
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,690
Coming in so early.

540
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:03,320
No, not at all. We're more thankful for coming so far away.

541
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,530
Oh, is that right?

542
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:10,740
Candidate's health is also subject to screening. I can't help it.

543
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,300
This way.

544
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,290
Yes yes. Wow, this hospital is so large and nice.

545
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:16,990
Hello,  Director.

546
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,850
Yes, hello.

547
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:24,940
But Director, the guards this time are too eye catching.

548
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,170
Right?

549
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:34,920
Hey! My team members are complaining that you're too eye catching!

550
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,960
Director, I think you'll need to go to the CT room for a walk-in patient.

551
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,700
CT?

552
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,720
I don't have any CT scans scheduled today.

553
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,710
They say it's a presidential candidate. Assemblyman Park Gwan Soo.

554
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,270
Please do not move.

555
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:09,730
Doctor Kim, I want to get a health consultation done.

556
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,860
Why don't we do it now?

557
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,770
I'll do it alone.

558
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,950
If you come find me directly, things will get risky.

559
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:27,530
Then you should get in the habit of answering your phone.

560
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:34,210
Well, I just came in for a candidate health check up, so don't worry about prying eyes.

561
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,500
Why are you here?

562
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,360
You better protect the dangerous material well.

563
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:44,070
Someone's recently targeted it- Choi Yoo Jin.

564
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:48,800
Someone from that side got wind of it.

565
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,190
You should move the hiding place,

566
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:54,570
or you could just get rid of it altogether.

567
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:56,890
Well, we'll see.

568
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,940
I thought about it,

569
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,870
but looking at how you got rid of my father's Chief Secretary with that,

570
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:07,320
I got the sense that I should take really good care of it.

571
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:14,500
So even after you do get into the Blue House,

572
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:17,390
you don't forget that I have it.

573
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,320
Alright, it's all done.

574
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,310
The diagnostic screen didn't show anything.

575
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:41,060
You don't need to review the results separately.

576
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,400
Alright, thank you.

577
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,480
As it says, "Fast bind, fast find." Before I get seriously sick,

578
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,220
it's best to get regular screenings in advance.

579
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,980
You should also strengthen your guard.

580
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:02,460
If something goes wrong, your father may be struck with lightening without knowing anything about it.

581
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,520
Geez.

582
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,510
Where did my shoes go?

583
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,820
Oh, here.

584
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,700
Good job.

585
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,430
Yes, it was very comfortable.

586
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,940
Well, I have a busy schedule, so I'll get going.

587
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,350
Please drive safely.

588
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:30,360
You did great today!

589
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,650
I'll escort you.

590
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,630
No, please go in.

591
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,510
No, it's alright.

592
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,810
Yes.

593
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,270
 That's not all. 

594
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:15,990
 At your 10, 2, and 4 o'clock 

595
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:18,490
 Park Gwan Soo's guys are posted. 

596
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,460
Those guys are from the Blue House, the ones following are Park Gwan Soo's.

597
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,370
You should go back.

598
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:42,600
I don't know what mission this is, but it'd be hard without some help.

599
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,520
Follow me.

600
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,950
How did you know to come here?

601
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,290
The Madam sent us.

602
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,490
Mirror?

603
00:57:56,290 --> 00:58:00,130
She said that you would brief us when we landed on site.

604
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:01,870
What's going on?

605
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,280
Please surveil one doctor for me.

606
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,080
Totally obviously.

607
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,690
What?

608
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,930
What's obvious surveilling?

609
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,330
From what I've gathered so far,

610
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:19,360
our target is in possession of some important data evidence

611
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,880
hidden somewhere in this hospital.

612
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,870
Important data evidence...

613
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:29,060
wouldn't he have hidden it in a secret safe or a lab?

614
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,970
No.

615
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,320
I looked through the hospital records,

616
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:38,590
and in the past, there was a trail of robbery in the target's lab.

617
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:41,150
It means someone's already combed through it.

618
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:44,660
Then... it must've been Park Gwan Soo's people.

619
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,290
Probably.

620
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:51,720
Ultimately, this data is so important that people don't mind risking any means and methods when trying to steal it

621
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,190
so you probably couldn't find it even with a search and seizure warrant.

622
00:58:55,190 --> 00:59:01,510
Therefore we need to leave out any personal places including his lab, home or bank account.

623
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:05,850
Oh, and he probably didn't hide it in a hackable computer or web storage.

624
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:09,260
In the end, he probably put it onto a physical memory device,

625
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,380
and put it somewhere nearby where he can check it from time to time.

626
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:20,260
But then why are you asking to us to surveil him noticeably?

627
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:26,220
Because we need to make him nervous enough to check the hidden material himself.

628
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:31,730
JSS sent their guys to follow Kim Jae Ha, and they're now all over the hospital.

629
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:35,490
Kim Jae Ha was right.

630
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,330
How many guards does Kim Seok Han have?

631
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:42,760
Normally, he has 3 guards from the Blue house with him for close guarding,

632
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,970
and then in emergency situations, the police will come to help

633
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:50,460
but since the police are all on our side, you shouldn't have to worry.

634
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,410
I'm still feeling anxious.

635
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,470
Alright, let's watch him for now,

636
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:04,620
and if we notice that JSS gets their hands on the evidence,

637
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:07,850
we have to be ready to take it immediately.

638
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:11,490
Or else, destroy the evidence on site.

639
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,640
I understand.

640
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,580
No matter what, the evidence must not get into Choi Yoo Jin's hands.

641
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,740
Got it?

642
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,190
Yes.

643
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:18,700
-Where is it?
-3rd seat.

644
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,590
You don't look so good.

645
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,370
Is there something going on?

646
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:51,190
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

647
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,470
From the beginning,

648
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:25,930
Kim Seok Han was not a suitable person for this kind of task.

649
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:27,860
How interesting it is!

650
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,930
To find out who will get the hands on this thing.

651
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:32,890
If it gets into Choi Yoo Jin's hands,

652
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,470
Chairman Choi will be in trouble, I think.

653
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:40,220
Well, we will see.

654
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,680
Will it be really true?

655
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,160
In any case, Choi Yoo Jin is surely something.

656
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,790
Now that she figured out our true identities,

657
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:55,430
it's the time for us to decide on one side, either Park Gwan Soo or Choi Yoo Jin, isn't it?

658
01:02:55,430 --> 01:03:00,660
Isn't that obvious that anyone in this table has to hold hands

659
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,330
with the person who got the Seok Hwan's  memory card?

660
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:04,630
I know, right?

661
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:07,130
If Choi Yoo Jin brings that memory card to us,

662
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:11,370
Park Gwan Soo and us, we will all be tamed by her.

663
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:15,190
If Park Gwan Soo brings it,

664
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:17,410
there will be no change anyway.

665
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:22,780
Then, it seems that the next president will be decided on this table today.

666
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,790
 Since the call is not being answered, you will be connected to  voice message. 

667
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,450
What is it?

668
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:06,790
What?

669
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,780
Yes!

670
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:17,960
Yes.

671
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,960
Hey! Found it! Mission cleared.

672
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,430
Wow.

673
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:45,420
What are you doing? Grab him quickly!

674
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,860
 It was there. 

675
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:11,430


676
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,890
Who are you?

677
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,020
♫  My heart is aching   ♫

678
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:29,880
♫  and I can't breathe, I can't touch you who have become cold  ♫

679
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:36,320
♫  No matter how I try to reach  ♫

680
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,130
♫  You who are going farther away again  ♫

681
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:42,760
♫  are spending the day in tears  ♫

682
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:46,030
♫  I  can only stare at your back blankly Everyday    ♫

683
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:48,940
   

684
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:53,190
 If we do a sudden attack now, 

685
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,730
 we can get Cloud 9 and Choi Woo Jin at once. 

686
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:58,290
 Would you like to form an alliance with me? 

687
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:01,100
 In your hand, 

688
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,640
 the fate of our company depends on it. 

689
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,630
 No. 

690
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,520
 No, Jae Ha. 

691
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,660
 Don't die. 

692
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,620
 Please let me see Jae Ha, only for once. 

693
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,090
 I am begging you. 

694
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:13,390
 No. 

695
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:15,130
 Mom. 

696
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,170
 Mom.
