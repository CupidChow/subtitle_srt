00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,300

 The K2

  Timing and Subtitles by the K2  Minions @ viki  

4
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,770
This is the second meeting that I told you about.

5
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,790
Shoot.  Shoot.

6
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,230
SHOOT!

7
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,030
 Please help me. 

8
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,140
 Please save me! 

9
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,490
 Please save me. 

10
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,140
SHOOT!  SHOOT!

11
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,580
I said shoot! Shoot!  Shoot!

12
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,490
Kill her! KILL HER!

13
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,530
SHOOT!  KILL HER! KILL HER!

14
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,220
SHOOT!  HURRY UP, SHOOT HER!

15
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,790
KILL HER! I'M TELLING YOU, KILL HER! KILL HER!

16
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,180
Other than me,

17
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,260
there is another person  who wants you dead.

18
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,720
Madam!

19
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,350
Throw down your guns. Throw down your guns!

20
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,290
Madam is in danger.

21
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,850
Everyone leaves, and have a car ready outside.

22
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,660
Do what he told you to do.

23
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,860
Have Madam's car ready.

24
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,360
Did you come back to kill me?  But you know what?

25
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,560
If you kill me, you will never be able to leave here alive.

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,400
Rather than worrying about me,

27
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,810
shouldn't you worry about yourself first at the moment?

28
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,120
Why don't you throw that gun away and beg me to spare your life?

29
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,920
That's the best hope for you to save your life.

30
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:29,880
My finger is already halfway through pulling the trigger. In addition

31
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,550
this gun is a Walther, the trigger of which is a bit soft.

32
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,740
I got it.

33
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,250
Turn the car around back, we're going back to the house.  Speed up as fast as you can.

34
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,190
- What's going on?
- Madam is being held as a hostage.

35
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,300
Pull over the car there.

36
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,760
Pardon me?

37
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,910
You have a cigarette, don't you?

38
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,650
What are you doing now?

39
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,650
I have sent an email.

40
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,970
Attaching a video file that recorded all the words you said

41
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,960
and what happened in this place.

42
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,280
To the media, the prosecutor's office and... the Blue House. 
 (the Blue House: the residence of the President of South Korea) 

43
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,740
But don't be discouraged too much, because I scheduled it to be automatically sent in 24 hours.

44
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,130
Therefore,

45
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:07,120
don't mess with me and the people around me.

46
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,200
By any chance, if I end up dead, there will be no one who would postpone the delivery of this email.

47
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,880
So, you guys should just pray

48
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,910
that I live my life well, day by day.

49
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,420
Here.

50
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,800
- No. 
- NO!

51
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,090
Now, you, get out there and sort out the situation.

52
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,850
Just in case, if your bodyguards do some silly things and I get killed,

53
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,380
it would be a big problem, right?

54
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,890
- Manager Ju, isn't your duty to protect me from any danger?
- That's correct.

55
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:19,880
Then, if we go home now, it's dangerous for me, isn't it?

56
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,020
Don't you think so?

57
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,530
I'm going there to keep the promise with you, sir.

58
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,030
- What? Promise?
- Right now, at your home,

59
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,640
Anna is there.

60
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,020
What are you doing? Step on it!

61
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,660
 Episode 3 

62
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,340
Aigo, Madam, how are you?

63
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,020
Fine, thank you for your hard work.

64
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,830
Don't mention it, ma'am.  What a thief to steal a motorbike and cause trouble in this peaceful lane ...

65
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,280
Is Madam... also driving the  car for someone?

66
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520
- Hurry. Hurry! 
 - Yes.

67
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,320
I've totally misjudged you.

68
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,810
Well, not misjudged, but probably you were too conscious of me.

69
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,840
I wasn't interested at all in your husband's love affair.

70
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,500
I wasn't interested either, whether you're interested in that or not.

71
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,380
Fine, I'll admit my mistake anyway.

72
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,080
- Then, shall we make a deal?
- A deal?

73
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,140
Tell me the price.

74
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,080
You're telling me to sell that e-mail?

75
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,470
Because there is nothing in the world you can't put a price on.

76
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,130
Fine.  The price for that email... well...

77
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,540
It would be similar to the price of my life, because I'll be dead if I hand over that email.

78
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:49,460
Tell me the price first, and I'll pay you twice of that price.

79
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,620
Then, how much are you worth?

80
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,050
If I tell your husband that I'm going to sell only one thing

81
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,040
between the email and you, what would your husband choose?

82
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,350
Would he choose you and give up his candidacy, or would he choose the candidacy by selling you off?

83
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,910
Why? Are you not confident?

84
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,190
Then, does that mean you're worth less than that email?

85
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,060
Your subordinates are not obedient.

86
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,790
Team Leader Kim!

87
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,450
I'm sorry, we failed to guard Madam.

88
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,470
Damn... What about Anna?

89
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,650
Miss Anna is safe.

90
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,190
 Where is she now? 

91
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,470
Shall I... ask Miss Anna to come here?

92
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,430
No, never mind.

93
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,710
I have to...  rest.

94
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,080
♫   Come, please me. They beckon to you for me.   ♫

95
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,660
- I'm tired. 
- Yes, sir. 
♫  In the moonlight.  ♫

96
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:29,110
♫  Come to me, beloved. They beckon to you for me.   ♫

97
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:35,160
♫  Beloved, hear me.  ♫

98
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,540
♫  Don't be scared, my dear.  ♫

99
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,490
Why? How about slowing down a little? Huh?

100
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,430
I-I'm not speeding up.  T-The car is strange.

101
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,530
The brakes aren't working!

102
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,540
The car has been hacked, I think.

103
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,000
There is someone else who wishes you were dead.

104
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,720
What?  Who?

105
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,370
Over there.

106
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,230
- Who are they? 
 - Them?

107
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,830
- A motorcycle is tailing Madam's car. 
 - A motorcycle?

108
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,680
It's useless. It's bulletproof glass.

109
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,270
The intersection.  The intersection.

110
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,990
Right now.  Quickly move to the passenger's side.

111
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,950
It's accelerating at a fast rate. It's totally weird.

112
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,470
They must've seen us.  Go after them faster!  You mustn't lose them.

113
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,960
They're switching their seats!

114
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,970
- What?  The hostage taker and Madam (are switching their seats)?  A motorcycle is continually tailing them, isn't it?

115
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,460
 Yes. 

116
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,750
- Who the hell are they?
- Why?

117
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,220
- Motorcycle guys are cahoots with the captor, aren't they? 
- If it's the team operation, they wouldn't do it this way.

118
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,620
In 5 km ahead, there's a sharp turn.

119
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,270
That's the best place to disguise a collision as an accident.

120
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,290
- What are you doing now? 
 - Because I can't slow down, but I can still accelerate.

121
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,420
Are you crazy?  Accelerate?

122
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,020
Their remote control has an effective range of about 20 meter around them.

123
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,450
That's why they are doing their best to keep up with us.

124
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,780
If I widen the distance further than 20 meter with them,

125
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,300
I can go beyond the effective range of the remote control.

126
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,620
Madam's car is speeding up even more. What should we do?

127
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,990
Why do you ask such silly things?  Chase them faster!

128
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,300
Don't lose them.

129
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:02,000
Accelerating?  But they should  be in the vicinity of the sharp curve soon.

130
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,260
Continue  to push the window switch.  Until the window opens ...

131
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,360
 Signal lost 

132
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,960
We can't lose them! Speed up!

133
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,470
We're going to lose them. Step on it. Quickly!

134
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,930
Yes.

135
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,160
 Signal Lost 

136
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,200
It's done.

137
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,250
 In approximately 3 km 

138
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,890
Watch out.

139
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,860
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

140
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,180
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

141
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,490
♫  Run, run. I'm fine.  ♫

142
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,690
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

143
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,560
Chief,  there was shooting from the car.

144
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,470
What? At Madam?

145
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,900
 No.  The firing was out of the window. She is unharmed. 

146
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,570
Outside the window.  Outside the window.

147
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,200
That motorcycle!  Quickly deal with the motorcycle.

148
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,640
Finally they clicked (to understand the motorcycle guys are trying to harm their Madam).

149
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,110
I mean your bodyguards, although it's already too late.

150
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,050
 Safety first 

151
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,670
Kill them!

152
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,100
What is it? You lift, and I will get him out.

153
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,710
Huh? Huh? What is it? What? What?

154
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,570
Hey there!  Hey there!

155
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,400
Chief!  Chief!

156
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:47,190
Wake up!   Hey there!  Wake up! Hey!

157
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,530
Chief, are you okay?

158
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,170
What about Madam?

159
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,220
No!

160
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,520
It's too late.  It's going to explode.

161
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,930
Bull s##t!  Go and rescue Madam!

162
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,910
Don't.  If you go close, it's dangerous.

163
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,120
Let go.  Get out of the way.

164
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,190
- You can't.   
 - I said to let go. 
 - Chief!

165
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,070
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

166
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,980
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

167
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,950
♫  Run, run. I'm fine.  ♫

168
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,950
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

169
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,210
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

170
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,240
♫  Lies, lies. ...  ♫

171
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,330
- Madam. 
 - Madam!

172
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:33,700
♫  Look out. Look out. Look out. Look out.  ♫

♬    God will not leave you  ♬

176
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,710
He's alive.  What should we do with him?

177
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,910
Drag him away to the dispensary. Get ready to interrogate him.

178
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
All right.

179
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,410
Hospital.

180
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,870
Yes, Madam.

181
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,050
Move him to the hospital.

182
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,720
Yes, Ma'am. We will take you immediately to the hospital.

183
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,210
No.

184
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,520
Him.  I said to move him to the hospital.

185
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,990
Pardon?

186
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:36,140
That person cannot... You cannot ever let him die.

187
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,540
Yes.  I know that very well.

188
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,660
 No.  You don't know. 

189
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:03,890
 Is the sunset in heaven more beautiful than this? 

190
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,790
 Heaven? 

191
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,430
 Is there such a thing? 

192
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,200
 Heaven is somewhere where there is no war. 

193
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,250
 So I bet Korea is like Heaven. 

194
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,830
 For some, it could be heaven. 

195
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:28,430
 And for others, it could be the very opposite.  Well ... 

196
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:32,420
 Oh! And 2NE1 is in Korea. 

197
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,450
 That's why it's heaven. ♪ Who's the one who's the best? ♪  

198
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,550
 Wny?  Did I do it wrong? 

199
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,890
 No.  For not even having gone to Korea but speaking Korean at such a level, Raniya is practically a genius. 

200
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:54,810
 Even amongst the Korean majors, ♪ "I am the best." ♪ (2NE1 song) 

201
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,330
 Raniya. 

202
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,540
 So ...  to tell you the truth ... 

203
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,740
 I think I will be going back to Korea. 

204
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:30,250
  Now I won't be able to work here again. 

205
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,380
  I know. 

206
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,730
 It can't be helped. 

207
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,640
 If so, when will you be going to Korea? 

208
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,760
 - Do you want to go with me? 
 - Pardon? 

209
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,530
  This ... this... 

210
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,510
 The thing is...  if you marry me, 

211
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,260
 you can get a passport as well, I heard. 

212
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,930
 M-Marriage? 

213
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,100
 Ah. Wh-wh-what I mean is ... 

214
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,450
 That ... m-m-marriage ... 

215
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:17,620
 It's so hard to get a ring in this area, so for now ... 

216
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,130
 So even this is ... 

217
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:29,040
  But don't misunderstand me. Just by an official document. I just wish to take you out of here. 

218
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,430
 Why... why, why are you suddenly crying? 

219
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,760
 Hey, I am not trying to do anything to you ...  

220
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:47,030
 So after you go to Korea with me, if... If you really don't like... 

221
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,810
 Well, you can go someplace else as you please. 

222
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,820
 Yes.  I will marry you. 

223
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:00,230
♬    Whispering something in his ear  ♬

226
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,210
Don't think of anything foolish.

227
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm telling you not to, please.

228
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,850
 Hey!  That's right we are the cops. 

229
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,250
I said I knew that!

230
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,130
Oh. I really am going crazy.

231
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,000
Hey, there's a big fuss going on outside.There was a terrorist outrage, they say.

232
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,600
And the person in there is a victim and the most important witness (for this case).

233
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Right now you guys are obstructing a police officer in the performance of his duties.

234
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,190
I don't know such things.

235
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,670
This person has to have complete rest according to a doctor,

236
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:08,280
and if you still wish to pursue your entrance, you need to have a warrant with you.

237
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,070
Do you understand me?

238
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:14,300
It's driving me crazy. Who are you?

239
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,030
Go tell the Security Manager (of this hospital) to come see me.

240
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:22,920
If you want to meet him, go see him. We have nothing to do with him. 
   

241
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:29,880
Geez, damn it. Since when did Korea became like this? I can't do my detective job properly in this crazy country.

242
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,150
Hey!

243
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,930
HEY!

244
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,140
Let's go. Come on.

245
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,860
Sunbae, how can you just leave?

246
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,050
What? They were right. We need to do it according to the law.

247
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,590
But still! So who on earth are they?

248
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,360
- JSS Security. 
- Se...?

249
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,020
A bodyguard company? Aren't they the mercenaries that we're surveilling?

250
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,250
Those arrogant pricks.

251
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:00,090
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come back, back, punk. Come here, punk!

252
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:06,020
Hey, the C.E.O of that company is our former Commissioner of the Korea National Police Agency,

253
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,880
and you punk, their Adviser is the former Prosecutor General.
 - P-Prosecutor General...?

254
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,220
You know nothing.  They are not like those bodyguards working for idol stars.

255
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,950
You have no idea, brat.   Which direction should we go now...?

256
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,950
Ah, S-Sunbae...

257
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,670
 The scene you are witnessing now is that of Madam Choi Yoo Jin, the wife of Assemblyman Jang Se Joon, 

258
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,620
 arriving at the hospital in an ambulance. 
   

259
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,300
 Assemblyman Kim, how do you understand this case?
   

260
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,920
 That is... This is without a doubt 

261
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,440
a clear case of terrorism.

262
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,350
In one of the OECD countries, the Republic of Korea,

263
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:52,260
how such a pathetic, barbaric, uncivilized political terrorism case could occur,

264
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,170
is beyond deplorable.

265
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,510
But, so far, there has been no definite evidence

266
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,930
to confirm this is a political act of terror, don't you think?

267
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,550
Well, with all these, don't you think the definite evidence is already out there?

268
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,790
Please think about this. To disguise it as an accident,

269
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:12,980
someone hacked a car system. Such a high level of technology

270
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,250
was used for this terror.  With that fact alone,

271
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:23,360
this is way over the limit of the crime level that any individual can commit.

272
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,060
- That's what I'm saying. 
- That's indeed true.

273
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,710
But anyway, the investigation on the deceased suspects must conclude

274
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,650
first in order for us to determine their exact motivations.

275
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:38,030
Ah, that's right, of course.  However,

276
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,530
in all sorts of crimes, through those crimes,

277
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:45,620
there could be any organizations or individuals who might reap an indirect benefit.

278
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,060
Shouldn't we place them as prime suspects?

279
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,610
Excuse me, Assemblyman Kim, I understand why you say so, timing-wise.

280
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:00,800
But because of that timing, I think your words right now can be interpreted in a very dangerous way.

281
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:05,120
Well, I mean... What I'm trying to say is...

282
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,590
 Well, I'm just saying it can be possible.  When did I say, 

283
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,880
 "This was caused by Assemblyman Jang Se Joon's opposing rival candidate"? 

284
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,410
 Did I say such a thing? 

285
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:22,210
 And, there are individuals or groups who can benefit from this crime. 

286
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,560
Wow, that gentleman is so funny.

287
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,380
He's openly accusing Park Gwan Soo as the mastermind, isn't he?

288
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,720
Chief Kim, did you give this guideline to him?

289
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,650
No, Ma'am.  He's doing it on his own.

290
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:42,150
After the news, call him to tell him that he did a good job and that he will be invited after my discharge.

291
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,050
You don't have to do that much.

292
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:49,490
As per our usual management level, it's natural that he should do such things on his own.

293
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,920
Assemblyman Jang.

294
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:05,430
Madam. Did you have a good sleep last night?

295
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,300
Yes, thanks to you.  I appreciate that.

296
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:14,200
No, please don't mention it. We're honored that you chose our hospital.

297
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,030
Whenever you call, we'll be there.

298
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,370
By the way... The man who arrived with me,

299
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,300
how is he?

300
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Ah, that bodyguard, you mean?

301
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,570
- Bodyguard? 
- We put his left thumb in a cast because of a fracture

302
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,620
and stitched up a few wounds, but other than that, there is no problem as per the CT scan.

303
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:45,120
Overall, as he has a very sturdy body condition, there will be no serious problem.

304
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,740
I see, that's a relief.

305
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,720
Well, I think that bodyguard was trained very well.

306
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,290
If you were exposed to such impact directly, Madam,

307
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:00,110
it could've been a very serious problem.

308
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,780
Do you think he would be able to regain his consciousness by this evening?

309
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,450
Of course, he will wake up very soon.

310
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,220
Then, I'll take my leave now.

311
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,730
If you have any issue, please call me any time.

312
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,390
Yes.

313
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:31,540
Well, that bodyguard... If he blabbers something when he wakes up later,

314
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,570
don't you think it would be troublesome?

315
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,760
I'm going to use him as my real bodyguard.

316
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,450
- Will he do that, though? 
- Him? Well, we don't know that yet.

317
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,490
Is that really important?

318
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,220
The person whom I should keep my eyes on the most

319
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,240
should be placed in the closest place to me.

320
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,540
Like Anna.

321
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:21,200
♬  Mirror, mirror on the wall  ♬

322
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:26,480
I can't leave Anna near you.

323
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:49,500
♬   Who is the fairest in the land?  ♬

324
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,330
Hey, First Sergeant Kim.

325
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,230
Have you been well?

326
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:06,050
Why are you so surprised? Relax, man.

327
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,990
Wow, what's this all about?

328
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,370
Manager Ju!

329
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:17,450
It's okay, these things are useless anyway.

330
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,720
And you, leave us alone for a moment.

331
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,700
What are you doing?  I said leave.

332
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,370
The attacking the origin, the trap...

333
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,810
It was you, Lieutenant Colonel Ju.

334
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:51,470
Hey, I was discharged as Colonel.

335
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:56,180
And I was dishonorably discharged as a private.

336
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:02,410
- I'm sorry, I didn't have any power back then. 
- Not power,

337
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,470
but you didn't have any will (to help me), I guess.

338
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,690
You should have the power to fulfill your will.

339
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,630
Sis!  What kind of bastards did such things to you? Are you alright?

340
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,070
When you open the door of my room next time, will you knock first as a cultured person?

341
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,330
Oh, right, sorry!

342
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,300
You were here too, Brother-in-law.

343
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,680
Chairman Choi, how have you been?

344
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,070
It's always same for me, you know.

345
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:44,440
- But are you really alright?  It's Park Gwan Soo's doing, isn't it? 
- Well, who knows.

346
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,380
No, it is Park Gwan Soo for sure.  He's totally capable of doing such things.

347
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,600
That bastard!

348
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,360
Oh my, I cursed, so ill-mannered.

349
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,840
Chairman Choi, if you want to look cultured to other people,

350
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,070
don't you think you should use proper formal language with me too?

351
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,180
Come on, Noona, I said I really hate that! It's so awkward.

352
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,310
It feels as if we're so distant.  No way.

353
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:16,270
Even so, we're not that close to each other either.

354
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,850
Assemblyman Jang, it's almost time for the news.  Cameras arrived too.

355
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,530
Oh, is that so?

356
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,380
Then, you two have a nice time as a brother and a sister.

357
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,960
Shall I launch myself now?

358
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,940
I wish you luck. Fighting!

359
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,860
Fighting!

360
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,070
Wait, please come to me for a moment.

361
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,070
Me?

362
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,560
Why?

363
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,780
Closer.

364
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:29,550
As a husband who stayed up all night next to his sick wife, you need to look like this at least, right?

365
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,300
Wow, you're such "a wise mother and a good wife" indeed.

366
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:46,860
Ah, we don't have a kid, so the "wise mother" part needs to be removed though.

367
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,450
You guys should stay a step behind me.

368
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,930
Yes.

369
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,060
Assemblyman Jang, how is your wife?

370
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,730
Who do you think is behind this accident?

371
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,030
Have you spoken with Assemblyman Park Gwan Soo over the phone yet?

372
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,270
Oh, please, give us one comment.

373
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,730
Did you just say... one comment?

374
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:12,740
From a man who had to watch his wife all night when she almost went to death's door because of him...

375
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:20,190
what kind of comment do you think he has?

376
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:28,730
The only thing she knows is to take care of other people, but she is now horror-struck,

377
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:35,540
and crying with unintelligible words during her sleep with the painkiller and sleeping pills all night.

378
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:42,130
All this pathetic husband could do was just watch her suffering.

379
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,320
So what kind of comment do you want from me?

380
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,970
 Presidential Candidate, Assemblyman Jang Se Joon's sincere comments 

381
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,310
Are they playing background music (BGM) for a live news broadcast?

382
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:06,180
- Wow...
 - My wife gave up everything for me.  

383
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:13,660
Although she herself was the heiress of a conglomerate, she gave up all the privileges.

384
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,150
She has walked on this thorny path with me,

385
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,950
as a wife of a poor politician.

386
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:28,780
When I was young, I was such a pathetic man.

387
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:36,260
Ever since I was arrested and detained in jail for working for the labor movement and pro-democracy,

388
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:44,240
I have made her suffer.

389
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:55,880
This man, who was getting distorted because of anger toward to the world, couldn't hold on to her hand.

390
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:07,830
Because I was too inferior to accept her sincerity for the fact that she was a daughter of a conglomerate.

391
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:17,590
But my wife was a courageous person.

392
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:21,420
She threw away everything she had,

393
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:30,610
and loved me who had nothing.

394
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:38,510
Wow... Brother-in-law is almost like an actor.  It really looks real. Wow.

395
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:48,150
 Because... that was true. 

396
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:52,050
 I, who couldn't protect such a good wife... 

397
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,450
I, who couldn't bear such a petty person as myself...

398
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:05,240
will I really be able to bear such a heavy weight of the immense position who must share the pain and sorrow

399
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:10,350
of 50 million people of Republic of Korea?

400
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:22,490
No, even before that, to my wife who is still horror-struck and crying in her sickbed,

401
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:31,390
will I really be able to ask her to continue walking such a path with me?

402
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:53,620
As of now, from all political activities as a presidential candidate,

403
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,200
I'm withdrawing myself.

404
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,080
What?

405
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,170
What's going on?

406
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,310
Then, are you saying you're retiring from politics as of now?

407
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,730
 What the heck? 

408
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,860
 What's going on...? 

409
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,960
- You can't! 
 - That's right! 
 - You should never do that!

410
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,530
 No, please! 

411
00:47:52,970 --> 00:48:00,420
Instead, I'm going to start a new fight now.

412
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:05,280
Against those who commit a terror of filthy violence to the opposing party...

413
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:13,690
Against those who attack our wives and daughters, and those who trample on those with no social standing...

414
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:19,420
Against all those terrorist authorities, I will fight.

415
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:32,190
To a politician, fighting with all his might against evil is more valuable than being the president.

416
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:37,590
That can be done even though you're not the president.

417
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,040
That's right!

418
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,470
Jang Se Joon! Jang Se Joon!

419
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:46,940
That can be done even though you're not a politician!

420
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:51,340
This is something we can all participate in. 
 Jang Se Joon! President! Jang Se Joon! President! 

421
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:56,330
And I will stand at your side!
 Jang Se Joon! President! Jang Se Joon!  

422
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,180
President!

423
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:06,430
With you all, I will definitely win this fight, everyone!
 Jang Se Joon! President! Jang Se Joon! President! 

424
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:29,470
 Jang Se Joon! President! Jang Se Joon! President! Jang Se Joon! President! Jang Se Joon! President! 

425
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:34,730
 President Jang Se Joon! 

426
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:43,090
Not bad.  Although his conscience is dead, his (political) sense is still alive.

427
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,980
Yes... Isn't it quite a shocking announcement?

428
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,530
Assemblyman Kim, what do you think?

429
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:56,190
It's really, really shocking.

430
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,960
For his wife whom he loves, he's going to give up his candidacy... wow...

431
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:07,210
It's a bit unclear, but we can take it as his withdrawal from the presidential candidacy, right?

432
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,670
What are you talking about now?

433
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:17,180
Assemblyman Jang's announcement was the declaration of war against the parties of violence and corruption in this society, wasn't it?

434
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,300
That's... right...

435
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:23,120
Then, if such a person gives up his presidential candidacy because of violence,

436
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:29,440
that means he submits to those violent parties at the end, doesn't it?

437
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,080
Those who committed the terror this time...

438
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,300
One moment please.

439
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:46,910
Those who committed the terror this time want exactly the same thing, that's what I'm trying to say.

440
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:51,180
In my opinion, such things must never happen.

441
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,040
Ah, I see...

442
00:50:53,040 --> 00:51:03,730
Oh, and in any case, by any chance, if the wife of Assemblyman Jang Se Joon is watching this show,

443
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:07,680
I have something I must tell her.

444
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,610
What do you...

445
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:19,750
 Please cheer up.  And please, please send Assemblyman Jang back to the embrace of us, the people of Korea. 

446
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:22,140
 I'm begging you, please. 

447
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,260
Oh, we'll be back after the commercials.

448
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:31,060
Come on, Hyung, aren't you sucking up to them too much?

449
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,820
No, no, no.  It's okay to do this much.

450
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,760
Hey, for this election, today is the turning point.

451
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,230
Just wait and see.

452
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,330
 President Jang Se Joon! 

453
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:51,700
 President Jang Se Joon! 

454
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,380
Jang Se Joon.

455
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,990
 Jang Se Joon! 

456
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,040
 Park Gwan Soo 

457
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,130
Get a car ready.

458
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,370
Where...?

459
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,460
Well, a person is sick, so we should pay a visit at least.

460
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,420
Pardon me?

461
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,930
Bring my jacket.

462
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,660
Yes, sir.

463
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,310
Jang Se Joon... Geez...

464
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,930
Here, a present.

465
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,700
What's this?

466
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,710
 Resident Registration Identification Card 

467
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,630
Kim Jae Ha?

468
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,340
Come on, is it something like a henchman of JB?

469
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,980
Just... why don't you think of it as a subject of an empire?

470
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,860
Don't worry, this is authentic.

471
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,060
He's missing in action from the mission abroad.  There is no problem with it.

472
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,850
Your fingerprints are transferred under this name too.

473
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,970
In return, don't make a passport with this name yet.

474
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,370
Since we couldn't handle it abroad.

475
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:13,140
Wow, Noona.  At this rate, you might really end up at the Blue House.

476
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,860
Then, take care of yourself, Noona.  I'm leaving.

477
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:24,620
By the way... Is the Group having some financial problem?

478
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,900
Why am I hearing a talk about funds from the campaign camp?

479
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,170
Ah, about that?  Well, there are too many eyes watching, so how can we just withdraw the cash from the accounts?

480
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:38,130
Be patient, Noona.  It takes a bit time, as your money has to take a long detour from the oversea accounts.

481
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,700
- Is that so? 
 - Sure.

482
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:48,170
Well, I misunderstood that you were too miserly to support the campaign camp.

483
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:53,670
No way! If you go to the Blue House, then (my investment) will be returned several times over.

484
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,630
Don't you think, huh?

485
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,420
Bye.

486
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,210
- How are you, Assemblyman? 
 - Yes.

487
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,220
How come you are armed?

488
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:24,110
Why? Are you going to arrest me?

489
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,410
Could that ever happen?

490
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:30,320
Because of yesterday's incident, an alert was issued a moment ago to a strengthen special security for dignitaries.

491
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,810
I sure go through all sorts of things. (Being accused of causing an act of terror and being protected from a terror at the same time)

492
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:42,520
Party Leader, are you going to be okay? This side (Assemblyman Jang's) seems to be all charged up.

493
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,940
Please don't create useless nonsense.

494
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:50,030
- Huh? Are you recording? 
 - No, it's not recording.

495
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,530
- Oh, are you sure? 
 - Yes.

496
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,750
There are also rumors that you are a mastermind of an act of terrorism.

497
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,170
Hey, I wish to get that kind of terrorism on me.

498
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:03,410
My approval ratings would go up and I could  rest easy for a couple of days in a place like here.

499
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:08,490
Sir, do you perhaps view this incident as a self-fabricated plot by Assemblyman Jang?

500
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:13,290
There you go again. I asked you not to make  up stuff before.

501
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,940
That's your habit (as a reporter).

502
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,590
Why? That wasn't funny?

503
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,230
What kind of talk would you plan to have with Assemblyman Jang?

504
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,670
No, no, no.   That's not it.  I'm here to visit a patient.

505
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,030
This (act of terror) is serious. Something like that shouldn't be happening. Never.

506
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:30,770
I'll see you later.  Later.  That's enough. Enough.

507
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:36,860
Oh!  Hello.

508
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,800
My condolences. How could this happen ...

509
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:46,470
- I will take my leave. 
 - Take care.

510
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:58,850
A bodyguard?

511
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:04,700
Yeah.  It was the nature of your work even in Iraq.

512
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,720
Wow, in the horrific job market of today, (a position) with the coverage of  the four basic types of insurance.

513
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:13,530
On top of that, your salary will also be quite high, based on your experience.

514
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:19,220
I won't give my loyalty to anyone nowadays.

515
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,380
Neither to the country nor any entity.

516
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Being loyal?  What's that? Give that bullshit to a dog.

517
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:31,490
I don't do that, either. We just do as much as we get paid.

518
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:34,890
Then,  Lieutenant Colonel, how much do you get paid for your job?

519
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:40,840
In any case, you know very well that you will be tossed away in the end, after being used.

520
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,570
We can just throw them away first before they do.

521
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:55,190
True.  I see you have changed a lot.

522
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,220
Not me. The world has been changed.

523
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:07,650
As for the JSS which I am working for now,  it's not an ordinary security company.

524
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:11,560
If I were to compare it as something in the military, it's a place full of massive amounts of data and information.

525
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:16,490
JSS can go through full reports on all trade secrets and the details of every transaction within the JB Group.

526
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:21,560
For outside JB,  they gather intelligence and monitor all dignitaries' moves of politics, finances, and media

527
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:26,100
in this country, through JB's Economic Research Center.

528
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:30,360
These people are not to be taken lightly. They will for sure make headway into the Blue House.

529
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,090
Then you can be completely pardoned.

530
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,970
Lieutenant Colonel. As for me,

531
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:48,490
I am nothing but a remnant. I am sick of it.

532
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:52,790
Now that dream is utterly useless.

533
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:57,210
Why?  Because you can't kill anyone any more?

534
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,410
PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).

535
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:06,650
I received your reference checks from Blackstone this morning.

536
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:15,090
Don't worry. I was the only one who saw it, and I destroyed it right away.

537
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:20,110
I became suspicious when I saw you didn't kill Rapid Response Team which was sent to assassinate you on the first day.

538
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:22,570
Even though you know such things,

539
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,650
why are you insisting on having me like this?

540
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,920
Hey, do you think a bodyguard is the same as a killing machine mercenary?

541
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:38,930
You were trained to be the best offensive attacker with beast-like instincts in a war.

542
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:44,320
You can be the best defender who can read the moves of the enemy attackers through your own experience.

543
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,320
And now, you can't bite your master.

544
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:52,150
You're the most qualified person to be a bodyguard.

545
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,770
I hope you remember that I still have that email in my possession.

546
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:06,580
First Sergeant Kim, go with me to the Blue House.

547
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:12,110
Then we can make those a**hole generals, who made us like this, kneel in front of us.

548
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:16,170
The Blue House?  Those a**hole generals?

549
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,600
As for me...

550
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:22,360
I planned never to come back to this damn hell-like Korea.

551
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:27,340
But I can't recall the reason even though I spat to swear inside Incheon Airport before my departure.

552
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:32,050
Also, making someone kneel down?

553
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:34,060
That's even more bothersome.

554
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:38,350
It's just until the presidential election.  Be in JSS until then.

555
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:43,240
Then we both can relax. You won't have to be on the run.

556
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:50,040
Because I was so exhausted, I returned. I've given up any interest in the world for a long time.

557
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:55,610
If no one messes with me, I won't do anything to hurt anyone else.

558
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:59,970
The email will be erased after the election.

559
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:04,130
Hey, First Sergeant Kim. Hey, First Sergeant Kim!

560
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,660
So how are you feeling?

561
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,100
Thanks to you, I am getting better.

562
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,120
 Kim Jeong Hoon of the President of Korea's Office:  Praying for your fast recovery 

563
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:50,300
It was such an honor to get a visit from the State Minister of Political Affairs.

564
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,550
The  Minister of Political Affairs?

565
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:56,400
Oh, no. The Chief Secretary should have personally come. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

566
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,720
Not at all. When he is busy with the affairs of state, how can he pay a visit to a mere housewife for sickness...

567
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,350
No. That's not the case.

568
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,650
He must have eaten lots of fermented bean-paste soup in your house.

569
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:08,880
No. He shouldn't have done that. Geez, he is so ill-mannered (not to visit you in a hospital).

570
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:14,440
The Chief Secretary is a man of integrity. No way someone like him would have come to my humble abode.

571
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,690
- Is that so? 
 - Of course.

572
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:24,280
Oh, come to think of it, you used to visit my place for the fermented bean-paste soup a lot,

573
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,650
when my late father was alive.

574
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:34,790
And we store the fermented bean-paste away nowadays,

575
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,580
because it stinks. (Meaning: she doesn't play old-fashioned politics like him because it sucks.)

576
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,470
It was very delicious. Very delicious.

577
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:47,440
Looking back, your late father had keen insight.

578
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,680
At that time, he already had a vision for the future and

579
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:54,350
he had chosen your brother as his young successor (instead of you).

580
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:05,730
Anyway, I wish you a speedy recovery.

581
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,950
Then, I will take my leave.

582
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:10,210
I'm sorry.  Because my condition, I won't escort you out.

583
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:13,530
No, no. Not at all. It's not a big deal.

584
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:24,320
  Timing and Subtitles by the K2  Minions @ viki  

585
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:36,990
That's a spunky b*tch. How bodacious!

01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,870

01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,180
 As long as the scary madam is alive, not a single person will come here. 

597
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:46,140
 It's not that Dad won't come. It's that he can't because of that woman. 

598
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:50,630
 Since there are many cameras, how about you wave before you leave? 

599
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:56,070
 As for a hunting dog, just put them into the cage.
