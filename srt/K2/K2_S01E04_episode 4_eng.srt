 The K2

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,900
 The K2

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:46,420

00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,590
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

5
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,830
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

6
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,980
♫  Run, run. I'm fine.  ♫

7
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,220
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

8
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,680
Are you okay?

9
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,260
Wait a moment.

10
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,750
Geez. There are so many sick people.

11
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,000
Are you okay?

12
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,720
Who is that person? Who is he!

13
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,290
Who? That white-haired guy earlier?

14
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,540
Are you joking now?

15
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,620
 Episode 4 

16
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,470
Yes, Team Leader.

17
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,320
After he had a personal meeting with Manager Ju, he came.  It seems he's not feeling well.

18
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,250
 Who? The white-haired guy earlier? 

19
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,840
 Are you joking now? That's Assemblyman Park Gwan Soo. 

20
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,620
 He is the strongest presidential candidate. 

21
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,300
 It is for certain that that man instigated you and Madam's murder. 

22
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,220
 Okay. 

23
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,180
Park Gwan Soo, you son of a b*tch!

24
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,190
How old is your son this year?

25
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,250
Yes, he will be about 32.

26
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,500
Yes, that's right.  It was when I was a first-term assemblyman.

27
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
I met you for the first time in the barbershop of the Assembly office building.

28
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,640
It was about the time your son probably started elementary school, wasn't it?

29
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,830
Yes, that's right, Sir.

30
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,340
Jeez.  Time flies.

31
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,060
At that time I also had jet black hair.

32
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,510
I am already 60 with gray hair.

33
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,700
Yes, that was so, Sir.

34
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,660
Umm. Then ... Mr. Party Leader.

35
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,840
Yeah?

36
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,850
I think it would be better for you to leave shaving to someone with young eyes.

37
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,520
I also am getting old now.  My eyes are getting blurry.

38
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Huh? What are you saying?

39
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,770
Among all the people holding a razor in their hands,

40
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,230
who else can I trust the safety of my life to except you?

41
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,020
How about wearing glasses?

42
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,970
I am very flattered.

43
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,760
But there are a bunch of skillful barbers, aren't there?

44
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,600
In any case, you are in big trouble.

45
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,900
Starting next year, you have to come down Mount Bukhak for a business purpose every morning.  (I will hire you as a presidential barber when I become a president.) 

46
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,860
Of course I must go, Sir.

47
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,310
For over twenty years, you have been coming to see me.

48
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,250
Serving you another  five years will not be a trouble but an honor, Sir. ( When Park becomes President for five years). 

49
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,600
- Really? 
 - Yes.

50
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,670
- Do you promise? 
 - Of course.

51
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,040
That's enough now.  Finish up, please.

52
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,590
What?  But how about shaving or washing your hair?

53
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,060
Something has come up, so I am in a rush.

54
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,740
Yes.

55
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,040
Thank you.

56
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,740
Wait a moment.

57
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,530
What is it?  Is there something missing?

58
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,610
Didn't you see a business card case, perhaps on the floor?

59
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,610
A business card case?

60
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,520
Yes. Where did it go?

61
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,170
Ah, here it is.

62
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,220
 State Tower 

63
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,750
Yes.

64
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,490
Kid, you can't go there.  Wait a minute.

65
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,520
Hey, wait a moment please.

66
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,190
You, punk. You tried to cut in line and locked yourself up. Good on you!

67
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,160
- Mom. 
- No, no, no.

68
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,730
Don't cry.  It will start moving again very soon.

69
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,020
Huh? Hold on.

70
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,090
Mom.

71
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,840
Assemblyman. You can leave this way.

72
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,040
All right.  Don't cry.  Yes, okay.

73
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,400
Mom.

74
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,920
Mom.

75
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,640
Yes. Okay.  He just left.

76
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,890
Excuse me.

77
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,360
 Public Official: Choi Su Ho, National Police Headquarters 

78
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,400
Could you show me your ID card?

79
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,260
- I see it's you. 
 - Glad to see you.

80
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,040
Code Blue. Code Blue. Agents, block all exits and guard the exterior!

81
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,750
Suspect is a male in his 30's wearing a white shirt and dark color clothing top and  bottom.

82
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,320
Stop!

83
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,460
 Scanner 

84
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,880
What's this?

85
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,860
What the heck is this?

86
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,320
Main gate! Main gate!

87
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,390
Get in.

88
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,660
Setting up a booby trap in the revolving door to be triggered by a sensor.

89
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,700
It's so like you.  Your operation was good, but ...

90
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,840
I should at least say this.

91
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,160
- Thank you. 
-  You are out of your mind.

92
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,380
You are doing a dangerous thing like this even when you know you'll be in big trouble if something goes wrong.

93
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,410
Are you postponing the email on a regular basis?

94
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,760
Don't you think that's why you are still safe?

95
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,260
Kim Jae Ha.

96
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,620
If you shoot at the enemy,

97
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,290
will the person be killed by the bullet or by the gun?

98
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,660
If not, is it by the finger pulling the trigger?

99
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,280
I heard you can't pull the trigger due to PTSD, right?

100
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,010
I'll pull it in your place.

101
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,270
I don't need that because I'll do it myself.

102
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,790
No.  You've been exposed.

103
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,560
Now you can never do it yourself. As you might have learned that already today,

104
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,760
Park Gwan Soo is not an easy person for you to harm.

105
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,660
And from now on, security will be much tighter.

106
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,100
I don't know what the situation is that you are out to get Park Gwan Soo,

107
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,660
but an enemy's enemy is a friend, isn't it?

108
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,820
Let us help you now, just wait.  And if the appropriate time arrives,

109
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,850
JSS will be your gun.

110
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:12,410
You have to be the bullet.  I will pull the trigger.

111
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,580
We have met in good time, as a good fate,

112
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,270
Friend.

113
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,660
- What is this? 
 - Why?

114
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:04,230
I thought when I really returned, Madame would promote me and I would receive a huge bonus.

115
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,750
Working overseas sounds fancy

116
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,140
but I haven't even once seen Messi's face and rotted for two years.

117
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,080
And now here I am again.

118
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,270
I am just thankful to be back.

119
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,160
It was like living in a prison when I was in a foreign country where I can't communicate in their language.

120
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,060
Huh? You are still in a prison. If not, what is it now?

121
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,750
- Sh, Miss may hear you.
- Who cares!

122
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,180
She is sleeping now!

123
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:34,330
 Right. In the end, I won't be able to get promoted, nor date someone. 

124
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,700
 I will age and die right here with you, even without seeing the sunlight. 

125
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,360
 Be patient. Only one more year left before the election. 

126
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,470
That's what I am saying! When will that one year will pass! Why should I be like this?

127
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,340
Hey, clean up your mess a little while you are making more mess! What are these?

128
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,350
How will do you if Assemblyman comes in all of a sudden?

129
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,920
Assemblyman? That kid's father?

130
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,280
What would Assemblyman come here for? He will never come.

131
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,830
He may come. After all, she is his daughter.

132
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,450
It will never happen.

133
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,730
As long as that scary madam stays alive,

134
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,220
no one will ever come here again! No one!

135
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,100
She may hear you, I said!

136
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,020
Nobody will come!

137
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,160
It's not that Dad doesn't come.

138
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,810
He can't because of that woman.

139
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,540
Hey, Japanese person!

140
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,990
- Me? 
- Yes.

141
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:05,350
- Why am I a Japanese person? 
 - Because you just finished going.  (Person who finished something sounds like Japanese person.) 

142
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,590
Geez! I see red!

143
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,490
That's the world's hottest ocean!  (It sounds like "see red.") 

144
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,860
What wrong with him? What the!

145
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,040
No.

146
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,720
Hello! Mr. Kim Jae Ha! Welcome!

147
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,670
- You must be here to remove the cast.
- Yes.

148
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,350
Please have a seat and wait for a little.

149
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,590
Hello! Mr. Kim Jae Ha! Welcome!

150
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,530
How dare she to some gigolo looking guy!

151
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,100
- How is it? Do you feel alright?
- Yes.

152
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,000
The way you're treating him is totally different

153
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,590
than when you treated me.

154
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,060
What are you doing here?

155
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,030
Please get out of here quickly!

156
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,660
Hey!

157
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,910
You! Since your hand is healed now, come to the training room.

158
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,530
I didn't bother you with that because of your hand before. But a newcomer must take a training course.

159
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,200
Got it? Come right now!

160
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,160
- It hurts. Hurts! 
- Don't be a crybaby!

161
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,360
Ah, for real! For real!

162
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,190
Huh? Hey! Don't. Don't! Don't sit down.

163
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,600
Come over here.

164
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,700
Come on.

165
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,960
You! Have you ever heard my name?

166
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,490
No. I haven't.

167
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,790
Song Yeong Choon.

168
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,640
- Yes, Song—
 - Not Song, but Yeong Choon!

169
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,970
Doesn't it ring a bell?

170
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,500
- Seo Yeong Choon? (An old famous comedian)
- Damn it!

171
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,850
What the! An ignorant punk! Don't you know the Yeong Choon martial arts?

172
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,890
I am the very famous successor for the Yeong Choon martial arts,

173
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,770
- Master Song Yeong Choon! That's what I want to say!
- Yeah.

174
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,560
- Forget it. We don't need to waste time talking. Come on.
 - What?

175
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,680
Come on. Try attacking me!

176
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,390
When did I say you could do that?

177
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,260
Sparring should be like this.

178
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,290
Pay respect to each other before you start.

179
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,400
By the way, who trained you? Huh?

180
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,630
Look, if the opponent is standing like this, his center of balance is in his front...

181
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,820
you could avoid like this.

182
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,190
Huh? Did you get it? And suddenly!

183
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,700
Gosh, great job! Great job!

184
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,340
Meanwhile, when he is not focusing...

185
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,070
Okay, okay. Enough!

186
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,320
Did you see that? You saw that, right?

187
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,500
When the opponent is trying to break through your weight balance constantly,

188
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,160
you should lower your body and tighten him.

189
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,400
You have to counterattack! Do you get what I am saying? Got it, huh?

190
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,040
Agent Kim Jae Ha?

191
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,330
Huh? What?

192
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,710
He is called by Manager Ju.

193
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,150
Is that so? Geez, I was going to give you proper lecture today,

194
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:28,060
but it seems to be your lucky day. You can go. Go.

195
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,330
Okay. Wait. Huh? What?

196
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,630
Pay respect.

197
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,910
What? Why?

198
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,940
You got rid of the cast, I heard.

199
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,700
Yes.

200
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,530
Then I guess your training period is over.

201
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,900
Go to the VIP team starting today. Team Leader Seo, you assign him.

202
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,780
Manager,  that's too fast.

203
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,160
Team members are not ready to accept him as their colleagues yet.

204
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,690
If you are done, I would like to leave. I want to take a shower.

205
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,620
Alright. You can go.

206
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,110
Manager, those who were attacked by that guy are extremely upset.

207
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,800
Team Leader Seo.

208
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,290
Yes.

209
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,300
Do you like hunting?

210
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:51,440
Let me put it this way. A hunter happened to get a nice hunting dog somewhere.

211
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,400
So he was so happy that he brought that dog home with him.

212
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,410
But there were already many hunting dogs in the cage at his place.

213
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,660
And as expected, those current dogs started to bark at the new hunting dog.

214
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,590
At this time, what is the hunter supposed to do?

215
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,960
You just put the new dog into the hunting dog cage.

216
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,200
They will sort out their ranks by themselves.

217
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,560
Whether they will lower their tails or will be bitten to death...

218
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,150
If not, whether we may have a new leader of the dog herd or not,

219
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,670
we will get to know naturally when we check the cage the next morning.

220
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,560
 Honor, Destiny, Glory 

221
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,230
Hey, how have you been?

222
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,910
Hey, hey, hold on.

223
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,990
Damn it! My eyes sting.

224
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,100
This bastard!

225
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,060
Hey, hey, hey!

226
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,040
Watch out for the slippery floor.

227
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,700
I warned you it was slippery.

228
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,730
Hey, let's get him together.

229
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,590
Master Seo Yeong Choon.

230
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,670
- About the floor...
- It's Song Yeong Choon, not Seo. Song!

231
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,350
 Ouch! Geez, my butt!  

232
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:30,720
I was telling you it was slippery. You were the one to cut me. See!

233
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,130
Is there anything?

234
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,200
No. Could there be anything significant here?

235
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,760
Is that right?

236
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,790
Let me introduce a new member

237
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,990
who will work in VIP team from today.

238
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,830
Agent Kim Jae Ha. His caller ID will be K2.

239
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,670
What's wrong with you guys? Huh?

240
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,960
Why are you making sour faces?

241
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,190
We failed to guard VIP. We were defeated utterly and pathetically

242
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,670
by an attack from just one person.

243
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,360
However, that one person

244
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,510
has given us a chance to know clearly

245
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,590
what problems we have in our security system.

246
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,260
We should be thankful for that.

247
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,340
Therefore, the research team has been analyzing the problem in our security system so far

248
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,200
based on this valuable experience.

249
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,840
As a result, a new security system and formation have been decided

250
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,160
to prevent the same thing from happening.

251
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,100
Therefore, now we have inevitable member exchanges and the change of working positions.

252
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,090
The new organization table will be displayed on the bulletin board in the hallway. Go check it out.

253
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,500
That is all, best of luck.

254
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,870
K2.

255
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,700
You will get to work in a place where it won't require that much team play.

256
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,330
I don't really care much.

257
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,940
 JSS Second Half Response Organization 
 VIP Security 

258
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,760
- Yeah. Unni.  
 - The breaking news!

259
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,690
- What is it? 
 - Did you hear the news about Kim Jae Ha?

260
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:28,990
- No, Why? 
 - Jae Ha has been assigned to  night surveillance Group C.

261
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,010
Team C?  Night surveillance.

262
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,160
 Aigoo, he stood in the wrong line. 

263
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,550
 So pitiful. How did someone normal turn out like that? He got on Team Leader's bad side just like me. 

264
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,480
I know, right? He's so pitiful.

265
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,860
Only one wench got the jackpot.

266
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,970
One wench? Why? Who's that wench?

267
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,560
- You!
 - Huh? Me?

268
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,480
You are Group C! Girl!

269
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,310
Yes! Yes! Yes!

270
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,330
 Great!  I'm damn happy! 

271
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:10,150
 Woohoo!  Kim Jae Ha, you are dead meat! Damn happy!  

272
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,370
Hey!  Who exactly is your C team guarding so closely?

273
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,620
There is someone. It's security.

274
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,090
Well that's obvious.  Is it our skirt-chasing candidate's girlfriend?

275
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,860
No, no. Don't ask that kind of stuff.

276
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,460
But you?  Are you dressed in clean clothes?

277
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,430
Clothes?

278
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,090
I just put on clothes to wear around the house.

279
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,120
Yikes.  That's why it can't be you, nope.

280
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,400
Jae Ha is heading there right now. You know?

281
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,130
Huh?  Jae Ha is?

282
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,850
Why are you just telling me that now?  Damn.

283
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,600
 Kim Jae Ha? 

284
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,120
Won't you still not tell me what happened with Park Gwan Soo?

285
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,120
It would be better if you didn't know.

286
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,660
Who is the Miss Anna?

287
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,280
The hidden daughter of Assemblyman Jang.

288
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,350
Which means she's not Madame's daughter, right?

289
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:28,020
So that child can never be revealed to the world.

290
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,780
- In other words, she is an explosive.  
 -  That sums it up.

291
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,770
Even within the company, few people know this fact.

292
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:41,160
Accordingly, everyone who knows the fact is subject to special supervision.

293
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,920
Me too?

294
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,930
You punk! From the get-go, you are someone subject to special supervision.

295
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:52,170
No matter what happens, that child must be kept out of contact with the world until election day.

296
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,040
Especially from Park Gwan Soo.

297
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,970
 JSS 

298
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,690
How are you, Mr. Manager?

299
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,620
Okay. Is work going smoothly?

300
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,730
Yes. There hasn't been anything unusual.

301
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,080
- Is there a problem? 
 - Huh?  What is it?

302
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,880
Introduce yourself. This is our staff member Kim Jae Ha. From now on, he will be in charge of night duty.

303
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,010
- Have you heard rumors? 
 - Rumors? No.

304
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,500
Why would I?

305
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,250
That's strange. You really haven't heard any rumor?

306
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,430
Don't you know ... last time,  Madame's hostage situation!

307
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,780
No, it happened when you were there, probably.

308
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,370
Ah, that situation?

309
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,170
Yes, I know about it.

310
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,670
Hello.  I am K2 Kim Jae Ha.

311
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:46,540
Hello.  I am J4 Jang Mi Ran.

312
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,330
- Hello, Section Chief.  
 - What's with "Section Chief"?

313
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:58,340
Greet to Mrs. Chef! She's more senior than I am, the forever section chief.

314
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,480
Please treat me kindly.

315
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,240
Sit.  Shall we begin?

316
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,420
Okay. I will report on the C Group VIP tendencies and the office regulations.

317
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,860
- J4 Mi Ran Jang. 
 - Yes?

318
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,500
Just take a seat.

319
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,130
Mrs. Chef, please tell us comfortably.

320
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,470
Actually Anna has severe panic disorder.

321
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:36,070
Sometimes she gets seizures, especially when she sees a bright light.

322
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,310
That's why we always draw the curtains.

323
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:43,240
- Then is she like a vampire that can't see light? 
 - No.

324
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,280
No. She can go out during the day, but if she encounters sunlight or something like a bright flash of a camera directly,

325
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,690
she may suffer short-term memory loss.

326
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,280
That's why she rarely goes out during the day.

327
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,790
Even at night, she just stays in the house.

328
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:04,550
She wakes up at 9:00 pm. When she wakes up, she goes to the bathroom at the end of the hallway on the second floor.

329
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:09,610
She usually takes about an hour. During that time, I clean her room and make the bed.

330
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,650
- Also at the same time-- 
- We search her room thoroughly.

331
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,330
We look for any dangerous or forbidden items.

332
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:22,210
Miss has a panic disorder and also severe social phobia. She doesn't like outsiders and doesn't like to run into us either.

333
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:28,240
 If I prepare her meal on the table ahead of time, she comes down at night and has her meal alone. 

334
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,280
That's why we never go upstairs after 10 PM unless Anna calls us.

335
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,650
We don't leave our rooms if at all possible.

336
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,510
 Very good job! 

337
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:48,310
However, I am always on high alert.

338
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,020
Whenever anyone calls, I am ready to run out.

339
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:06,730
Then what does she usually do at night?

340
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:11,610
She watches TV, usually the home shopping channel.

341
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,630
You don't have to worry about anything inside the house. You can just monitor the CCTV in a separate building.

342
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,540
Of course you go inside if the VIP is in danger.

343
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,740
After all necessary action is taken care of, report the outcome.

344
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,580
Yes, I understood.

345
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,490
Good evening.

346
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,250
Have you guys met each other?

347
00:38:53,060 --> 00:39:05,640
 Ludwig Van Beethoven - Minuet in G major 

348
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,280
- Can you please look over here. 
 - Yes. It's nice to meet you.

349
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,670
- Assemblyman, please look over here. 
- Please give us some comments.

350
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:29,680
Please turn around this way. Please smile. Thank you.

351
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,640
So there are a total of six cameras inside and five outside.

352
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,710
To protect privacy, each bedroom and bathroom are monitored by thermal imaging cameras.

353
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:41,940
So there are no blind spots in the house.

354
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,710
Recording is continuous 24 hours a day and is automatically deleted after 24 hours.

355
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,240
Night shift surveillance begins at 9 PM and ends when the guards inside wake up

356
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,950
at 6 AM plus one hour. Work ends at 7 AM.

357
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,010
That's all. Any questions?

358
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,270
Nope. None.

359
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,190
- None?
 - Yup!

360
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,860
Did you speak... informally to me?

361
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,360
Yeah.

362
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,250
This young bastard... Hey!

363
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,610
You look like a deer. I know how old you are!

364
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:28,450
Also I have much more seniority than you, you punk!

365
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:34,180
Hey! I heard you're from the Special Mission Battalion. Sergeant Kim told me.

366
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,920
That's right!

367
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,650
So?

368
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,440
I'm from No. 040, 151st graduating class. You?

369
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,980
How about you?

370
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,350
But...

371
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,820
We are out in society.

372
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,070
- Sunbae-nim.
 - Yeah.

373
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,030
Go get me a cup of coffee.

374
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,380
What?

375
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,780
We only have premixed coffee.

376
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,890
Okay. That premixed one.

377
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,350
Do you prefer strong flavored coffee?

378
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,140
Yes. Two.

379
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,030
No, I am okay.

380
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,910
For me (two packets of premixed coffee powder in my coffee).

381
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,850
Ah, two.

382
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,610
And leave your cigarette here.

383
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,080
- Cigarette is over there.
- The light as well.

384
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,660
Did you find anything?

385
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,630
No. Could there be anything?

386
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,420
They're all useless things.

387
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,310
You know, right? You are wasting your efforts on this.

388
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:09,390
I was hoping for something on the way here, but I end up going back empty-handed.

389
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,810
Congratulations.

390
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,790
This is my wife.

391
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,320
Nice to see you.

392
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,980
How have you been?

393
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,700
This is my wife.

394
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,680
You are getting prettier.

395
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,640
Thank you for coming.

396
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,540
I will see you later.

397
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,630
Mrs!

398
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,650
Why?

399
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:10,180
Oh, my goodness! Why are you walking around half-naked?

400
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,240
I am wearing it. It's just hard to see.

401
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,190
What's for dinner tonight?

402
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,960
Why not do a strip show?

403
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:21,020
Let's see how long it will last.

404
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,300
Last time in Barcelona, you put on quite a show for that foreigner guy.

405
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,320
In the end, you wore sweats and acted like this on the sofa. Like this.

406
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,810
The person watching is much different now.

407
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,620
What's for dinner, I asked?

408
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,980
Well, I don't even have any appetite.

409
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,650
Shall we have a super fancy instant ramen?

410
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,360
Damn good idea!

411
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,050
If you wish to get married, mind your manners.

412
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,480
What's with "Damn good?" Damn good?

413
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,300
What's wrong with it? It's standard language.

414
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,850
Most of all, my Jae Ha can't even hear it anyway.

415
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,780
"My Jae Ha?"

416
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,610
By the way, when summer is all gone,

417
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,840
why is it so hot?

418
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,010
You unbuttoned one more button now, right?

419
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,020
How did you know?

420
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,100
It's like a video playing before my eyes. A crappy video.

421
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:23,320
In any case, is your Jae Ha watching your crappy show?

422
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,950
I bet he is busy wiping his drool, you know?

423
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,240
Hey, aren't you getting off your work?

424
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,210
Huh? Hold on.

425
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,420
Who boiled this?

426
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,230
Who else could it be?

427
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:34,050
Assemblyman Jang is so popular with women, isn't he?

428
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:38,860
How lucky he is. Since half of the voters are women.

429
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:44,710
You are right. The world is so wide that there are so many pretty women.

430
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:54,740
That's why I am telling you to laugh more.

431
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:03,550
I'm envious of Assemblyman Jang because he has such an understanding wife.

432
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,080
I really can't give it to you.

433
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:14,150
Well, is there any dignity below the waist?

434
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,880
Did you regain your strength after you left the hospital?

435
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,190
Yes, thanks to you.

436
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,180
I don't understand what's become of this world.

437
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,120
It's so frightening. Can you ride a car with ease anymore?

438
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,280
I know. You can't feel at ease

439
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,800
going to the barber anymore.

440
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,330
Did you hear about it?

441
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,330
Yes, I heard.

442
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:53,180
Thankfully, it appears the culprit will be caught soon.

443
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,450
Then the mastermind would also be revealed, right?

444
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,180
You came?

445
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,680
The mastermind behind my case will also be revealed soon.

446
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,790
Since we found evidence from my car.

447
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,310
How have you been, Principal Secretary?

448
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:46,750
Oh~ You must know our Ms. Kim very well.

449
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,080
She just recently started working for our foundation.

450
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,660
You did a good job. You can go.

451
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,620
What are you doing?

452
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,660
What?

453
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:17,390
The world has not been kind to even someone as pretty as her.

454
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:20,400
Truthfully speaking, is it a crime to be beautiful?

455
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,980
Snake-like guys are the problem.

456
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,210
She keeps talking about the incidents she's caused,

457
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,900
and how she wants to confess for the sake of her conscience.

458
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,000
What should I do?

459
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,620
Anyway, our subordinates are the problem.

460
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:51,930
They keep doing useless things.

461
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,780
I know. Lately I don't understand

462
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,920
why so many subordinates act deviant on their own accord.

463
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:11,440
Then, are we even?

464
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,040
Are you calling for an armistice?

465
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:23,470
We can hurt each other's feelings, but must we hurt our bodies?

466
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:27,710
That's right. I feel I'm on the losing end.

467
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,150
But I will accept your truce.

468
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,810
As expected, you are so generous.

469
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,350
Cheers.

470
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,010
 Camera 6 

471
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,640
 Camera 5 

472
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,310
 Camera 4 

473
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,820
 At this thickness, be sure to spread it out flat. 

474
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,850
Jae Ha, don't go. Don't go.

475
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,900
 Camera 2 

476
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,510
Why?

477
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,710
Ah! Y-Y-You scared me!

478
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:22,340
Why? What?

479
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:44,450
Where are you going?

480
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,720
What are you looking for?

481
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,310
 Camera 11 

482
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,890
Are you hungry?

483
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,940
It's not there?

484
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,850
Cupboard? On the left.

485
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,030
That's right.

486
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,180
Up!

487
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,750
What? Not there either?

488
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:53,670
What is she looking for?

489
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,670
What?

490
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,800
Oh, ramen? Ha...

491
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,580
♫   When I see you my heart hurts   ♫

492
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:52,190
♫   What good does that do for my heart?  ♫

493
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:57,870
♫   The closer I approach the farther apart I am  ♫

494
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:06,770
♫   Seeing you is too painful for me  ♫

495
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:10,420
♫  Saying it's alright  ♫

496
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:15,760
♫  I keep trying to comfort my heart  ♫

497
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,720
♫  When it's too difficult.  ♫

498
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:26,980
♫  Every so often I used to cry silently  ♫

499
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:34,230
♫  Every so often I think about you  ♫

500
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:39,510
♫  On the road I walked with you like a fool  ♫

501
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:43,120
♫  I'm standing by myself  ♫

502
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:49,410
♫  I try to call out your name  ♫

503
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,350
No, that's too big.

504
00:54:55,350 --> 00:55:00,240
♫  How will running again and again toward you  ♫

505
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,900
♫  Do any good for this heart?  ♫

506
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,160
That's it. It's perfect.

507
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:14,300
Now, you need some water...

508
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:19,240
♫  Stripping you away is too painful for me.  ♫

509
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,800
Stop.

510
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,770
Hey, stop.

511
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:29,050
Too— that's too much water. Too much... I said too—

512
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,210
It's too much water.

513
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,350
She must've really wanted it. Some ramen.

514
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,600
Why? The fire?

515
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,870
♫  In the painful times filled with you  ♫

516
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:59,500
♫  I reflect by myself  ♫

517
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,810
Why isn't the stove turning on?

518
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,280
Oh... the valve is shut.

519
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,550
Valve.

520
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:21,500
No, not the bottom, top... look at the top.

521
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,230
Left side. It's on the left.

522
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:27,080
Upper left, at your 10 o'clock.

523
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,070
Upper left at 30 degrees- the valve!

524
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,960
Open the valve.

525
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:44,370
Why are you looking for the valve on the bottom? It's on the top...

526
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,130
Hey? Wait, where are you going? Aren't you going to eat the ramen?

527
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:57,250
If you just open the valve...

528
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,430
Why that?

529
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,000
Where'd she go?

530
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:22,440
Don't give up! Don't go! No! The ramen!

531
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,630
Ugh, come on!

532
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,350
How can you miss the gas valve?

533
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:43,950
Couldn't even eat the ramen just cause you couldn't open the valve.

534
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:48,370
I mean, that valve's just 30 degrees upper left! I mean, it's right there...

535
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,650
So frustrating, seriously.

536
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:54,290
How can a girl not even be able to cook ramen? Seriously.

537
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,350
So frustrating.

538
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,400
Do I need to cook the ramen in advance?

539
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:28,240
Ride a different car back.

540
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,110
What?

541
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:34,730
You need to leave anyway.

542
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:40,090
It'll be cumbersome to the workers... and that lady will be waiting too long.

543
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:45,140
You don't need to think of me that much.

544
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,990
Well, okay then.

545
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:52,300
Then, I'll see you at the meeting tomorrow.

546
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,510
Car!

547
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:55,470
Wait.

548
00:58:55,470 --> 00:59:00,620
There are a lot of cameras. Why don't you wave before you leave?

549
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,790
Shall we?

550
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,830
You've done a great job.

551
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:20,990
Assemblyman, please give us an affectionate pose.

552
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:25,970
Hey... you can't ask those kinds of favors. Jeez.

553
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,760
There, satisfied?
