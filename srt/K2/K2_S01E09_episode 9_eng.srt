1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,970
  The K2 

2
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:48,010


3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,460
♬  Come, please me   ♬

4
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,930
 Hey, don't worry. 

5
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,960
 You can do this. 

6
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,460
♬ In the moonlight  ♬

7
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,310
♬ Come to me, beloved  ♬

8
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,800
Then,

9
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,310
as for her social phobia, was it all just an act?

10
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,310
She probably just didn't want to see us. It possible, don't you agree?

11
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,210
All this time, she probably knows

12
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,040
all the things I've done to her and all the things I've said about her.

13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,270
Gosh, that's why I've always told you to speak more nicely to her.

14
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,020
But who knew that a day like this would come?

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,980
- Good morning! 
- Geez, so hot!

16
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,300
Good morning! ( She hands a respectful ending) 

17
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,930
Oh, Miss, is there something wrong?

18
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,880
Can I eat breakfast too with you guys? I'm hungry.

19
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,440
Yes.

20
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,840
What?

21
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,920
Oh, yes. Of course. Of course. You can! You can.

22
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,320
I'll wash up and come back down.

23
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,560
What is it?

24
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,460
You eat so well, but all this time...

25
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,200
I think it tastes better since we're all eating together.

26
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,380
I wish... we could all eat breakfast together like this.

27
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,160
Yes, Miss.

28
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,880
Unni.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,900
Me?

30
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,750
- I'm sorry.
- Hmm?

31
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,090
W-why? What did I do? I didn't say anything?

32
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,380
All this time, I only thought of myself, so I never thought that you'd be having a hard time too.

33
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,220
And thank you. For saving me yesterday.

34
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,520
That's- just-

35
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,040
I'll make sure that you can leave without getting hurt because of me.

36
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,440
What?

37
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,800
She'll at least listen to me to that extent.  Choi Yoon Jin will.

38
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,700
Uh,

39
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,830
if I can just say something.

40
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,090
Pardon me, but we won't be able to leave here.

41
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,990
Even if we wanted to.

42
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,420
Don't mess with Madam. I'll kill you myself.

43
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,660
Do whatever you want.

44
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,870
Is it unnecessary pity this time as well?

45
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,080
Not sure.

46
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,390
It might be.

47
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,020
You didn't come here to clean up after a little girl.

48
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,230
I also didn't come in here to see her die,

49
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,340
because someone cancelled an ambulance.

50
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,890
Did something like that happen?

51
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,810
Why don't you think about it again,

52
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,780
why I want to kill Park Gwan Soo.

53
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,280
Killing an innocent person for translating a secret meeting,

54
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,480
or trying to kill a banner hanger

55
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,330
who saw something through a window. They're not that different.

56
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,990
Oh! And by the small chance of hearing a story from a banner hanger,

57
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,090
there was someone who tried to kill an old farming couple.

58
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,950
Look here, people like you... are all like Park Gwan Soo. Do you know that?

59
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,400
I also don't want to make another Raniya.

60
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,200
So that's what it is.

61
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,300
I see

62
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,980
you could  think of Anna as a second Raniya.

63
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,130
Anna must be happy.

64
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,590
Alright, I got it.

65
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,420
Let's not fight

66
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,170
over something like this.

67
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,650
You know we have something else we need to do.

68
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,380
We need to get Park Gwan Soo.

69
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,850
But you know,

70
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,930
if every perpetrator in the world is Park Gwan Soo

71
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,120
and every victim is Raniya,

72
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,080
then wasn't I also a Raniya?

73
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,210
And my father Park Gwan Soo?

74
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,620
To Jang Se Joon,

75
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,010
I might have also been a Raniya.

76
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,200
Just because it kills a lamb,

77
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,400
doesn't make the wolf evil.

78
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,950
Wolves normally eat lambs, and plus

79
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,300
the child of a wolf

80
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,560
will also become a wolf himself.

81
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,010
Anna, too, isn't a child of a lamb.

82
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,810
Anyway,

83
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,080
while we've been busy with Anna

84
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,420
Mirror hasn't slept at all and has been working diligently.

85
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,220
I'm asking you what the reason is.

86
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,650
If something happens to you, it means we would all die.

87
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,150
What?

88
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,580
What does that mean?

89
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,830
Who said that?

90
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,450
It's something that the Manager told me before I came over here.

91
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,750
Apart from the chief executives, everyone who knows of the VIP's identity will all

92
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,450
be subsequently removed later.

93
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,660
In other words, the relationship between Omare and Park Gwan Soo

94
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,550
isn't just about oil drilling rights.

95
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,140
There's definitely more to it than that.

96
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,170
And because of thorough security, they needed to find someone

97
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,550
who didn't know English or Arabic,

98
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,370
but a special translator who spoke Korean and Kumar's language

99
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,160
Unfortunately enough, that person was Raniya.

100
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,150
Now all we need to do is find evidence to confirm all this.

101
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,700
Wait, how do you even know

102
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,770
that evidence like that exists? It might already be destroyed.

103
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,140
Villains always leave evidence when making deals.

104
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,610
So when it gets dangerous,  that evidence can be insurance.

105
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,720
Choi Yoo Jin is the devil.

106
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,760
She's been using us this entire time,

107
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,310
and what?! She's just going to bury us?!

108
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,160
You were always "Oh, Madam! Madam!"

109
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,870
That's why you need to protect Anna well from now on. That's how we'll survive.

110
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,360
And you heard Seong Gyu right?

111
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,270
If the Assemblyman really becomes President, then we'll all—

112
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,650
- A faithful subject? 
- That's right.

113
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,500
- Fine, you faithful subject. 
 - Are you nuts?

114
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,390
You're right. That's how it is.

115
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,970
Alright, I've made up my mind.

116
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,070
- From now on, I'll just until the end ... 
- Unni.

117
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,930
- You, she's calling you.
- Me? Me?

118
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,090
Yes, Miss?

119
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,980
So what you're saying is

120
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,580
if I bring the proof, Park Gwan Soo will be out of the presidential candidacy.

121
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,730
That's right.

122
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,280
I think you're misunderstanding something.

123
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,220
I don't have interest in that kind of political stuff.

124
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,510
- The reason why I'm collaborating with you is—
- To kill Park Gwan Soo.

125
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,720
For Raniya's revenge.

126
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,370
This is exactly that.

127
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,010
 Unni, please give me your autograph! 

128
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,050
It's okay, Miss. They all like you.

129
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,180
Please be strong. You did so well yesterday.

130
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,390
You can do it.  Be strong!

131
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,980
Pardon me.

132
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,570
Pardon me.

133
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,700
- Please get in.
- Please give us your autograph.

134
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,010
I don't have an autograph,

135
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,470
- but would you like to take a picture together?
- Yes!

136
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,650
I-I can take the picture! Me, too!

137
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,500
- Please don't push, folks!
- I'll take it now!

138
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,320
1-2-3!

139
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,330
One more! 1-2-3

140
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,280
What is death for a politician?

141
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,930
Real death for them is no longer being able to be in politics.

142
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,350
No longer being able to dream that dream.

143
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,620
No, forget it. I'm telling you I have no interest in that type of death! Got it!

144
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,570
I just want Park Gwan Soo to regret killing Raniya,

145
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,720
while dying by my hand.

146
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,150
He who dreams...

147
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,380
is not afraid of death.

148
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,450
He is someone who has dreamed his whole life of the presidency.

149
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,260
While he is still dreaming of that presidency,

150
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,600
being killed by your hands out of the blue,

151
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,490
wouldn't it be a little strange? What kind of revenge would that be?

152
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,090
First, we have to destroy his dream.

153
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,790
So that he could never dream any dream,

154
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,450
and destroy him without a chance of resurrection.

155
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,950
And in that last moment,

156
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,820
you can hand him a rope.

157
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,260
Then,

158
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,620
he'll probably hang himself.

159
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,380
While regretting killing Raniya so deeply.

160
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:50,600
Bullets aren't the only things that can kill people.

161
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,270
We came to get some medicine.

162
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,230
Our miss can't sleep these days.

163
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,330
You're all done.

164
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,520
What are you guys doing? Get up right now and bow- say that you're sorry!

165
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,830
Get out! Go go go.

166
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,680
Miss, if I can say something

167
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,570
as the last true teacher of martial arts,

168
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,180
and the best of the martial art Yeong Chun Martial arts' successor,

169
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,230
called Master Song Yeong Choon.

170
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,080
- And you?
-If I were to introduce my miss,

171
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,670
she's that famous "Barcelona—

172
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,310
"Angel", punk. I know, I know.

173
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,030
Miss, have you any interest in learning self-defense from me?

174
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,770
- What self-defense? Just go, Master Song
-Alright.

175
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,580
- Self-defense?
- Yeah!

176
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,390
Alright, starting from now this is a class

177
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,360
for the ladies on self defense.

178
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,070
This "self-defense" isn't very complicated.

179
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:26,390
Let's say you were walking along and you come across a molester like this. He's kinda bad looking.

180
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,650
So do you think a child like you Miss,

181
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:33,300
could take him on with your strength? Of course not.

182
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,190
Then first, look. Look him in the eye.

183
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,950
Then he'll probably look at you. Make sure you open your eyes wide.

184
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,660
- That's when you BAM!
- Ow, ow, ah!

185
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,620
Who cares if he's the bad guy if he can't even see?

186
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,330
Then now, it's the body.

187
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,420
It hurts it hurts. It really hurts!

188
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,850
See, he says it really hurts!

189
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,720
But even if a child like you has no strength,

190
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,240
you have the strength to twist that one pinky.
-Yes.

191
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,290
Then for the finale

192
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,100
You know what that is right?

193
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,090
You just grab him like this and then—!

194
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,490
If you kick him, game over!

195
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,260
You see right? Self-defense isn't complicated.

196
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,170
Now, let's practice for yourself.

197
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,650
- What?
- Come out

198
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,720
Come

199
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,120
Hmmm, yeah. You.

200
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,530
You, you. Come out.

201
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,850
Let's say that there's a molester-looking guy, okay?

202
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,020
Then just like last— hey!

203
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,090
Stop! Where are you going!

204
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:12,920
Miss, those guys are just guys that pitifully follow orders.

205
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,270
So don't hate them too much, okay?

206
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,530
Okay.

207
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,010
I want to try it! Master Song, be my opponent.

208
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,870
No, no, no. It'll be completely unfair to you.

209
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,480
Lesson over. Over.

210
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,620
Why-why are you stopping in the middle of a sentence? Master, why aren't you finishing?

211
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,420
Master!

212
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,690
Niece!

213
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,780
Nice, it's nice to see you.

214
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,100
Wh-who are you?

215
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,380
Me? I'm your uncle!

216
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,800
You grew up so beautifully.

217
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,700
Anna, you totally saved me.

218
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,560
Be careful with your body.

219
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:18,050
Don't worry. I won't die, and I'll make sure to continuously delay that email.

220
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,600
I'm not talking about the email.

221
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,860
Oh? Sister!

222
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,800
You guys wait here for a minute.

223
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,300
What are you doing right now?

224
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,870
Me? Well I just came by to see my niece.

225
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,460
- Niece?
- Yeah!

226
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,940
If it's brother-in-law's child, then wouldn't she obviously be my niece?

227
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,300
Isn't that right?

228
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,490
Why are you so surprised?

229
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,650
What are you f***ing scheming?

230
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:52,430
F***ing scheming? For you who are pretending to be graceful, how can you say such a thing like  "f***ing scheming"?

231
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,390
It doesn't suit you! Don't use those words.

232
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:02,500
I'm going to take her out front and get something good to eat.

233
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,100
See you!

234
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,600
You can't.

235
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,560
I can't?

236
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,390
In that case, I'm going to shout to everyone here about who she really is, Noona.

237
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,990
Hey everyone! Do you know who this girl is?

238
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,360
- She's my brother-in-law—
- HEY!

239
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,670
I was only playing with you, Noona!

240
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:46,130
You got so serious over a joke.

241
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,690
Besides, your relationship with her isn't one that you can boss her around.

242
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,570
And Anna doesn't need your permission, either.

243
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,310
Isn't that right?

244
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,610
No, I do need to get the permission.

245
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:15,240
K2. Is it okay if I go with this person?

246
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,450
Then I'll accompany you, Miss.

247
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,150
Okay, what's the big deal who she goes with?

248
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,530
I am surrounded by the JSS's guards anyway.

249
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,790
Let's go!

250
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,140
Watch her...

251
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,550
Carefully.

252
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,900
Madam, are you okay?

253
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,580
No.

254
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,880
I am not okay.

255
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,100
Get in.

256
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,480
If you tell me your destination, we'll follow you.

257
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,370
Forget that and get in the front seat.

258
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,700
Let's go to St. Thomas hospital.

259
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,560
- To hospital? 
- Um. They got good food.

260
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,710
Ayi, you poor thing. You can't even go to the hospital when sick.

261
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,860
Now... what are you doing?

262
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,400
Hey! Why don't you live with some humanity?

263
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,960
Did you not here Yoon Mi earlier? Didn't she say she is sick?

264
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,730
 The problem is her psyche. In her current state, I don't know what she'll do. 

265
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,300
 At the end, she'll need some psychiatric treatments. 

266
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,330
Anna, do you want to eat or go to the hospital?

267
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,150
Dr. Kim!

268
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,960
You go ahead first.

269
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,640
Have you been well?

270
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,060
What bring you here?

271
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,870
You are still the same.

272
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,740
Ah? This is my friend, the chief of the neurosurgery department of this hospital.

273
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,590
This is my niece, Go Anna.

274
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,720
Hello.

275
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,860
We came to get my niece examined by you.

276
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,120
Would you please guide us?

277
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,970
Okay.

278
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,250
Dr. Lee is doing fine, right?

279
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,270
You'd be very surprised when you see the doctor.

280
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,290
You can go in there.

281
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,330
 It's been a long time, Anna. 

282
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,170
Do you know me?

283
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,630
Do you not remember me?

284
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,960
It's understandable.

285
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,770
You were so young back and in shock back then.

286
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,740
 Don't be afraid, Anna. 

287
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,090
 Your name is Anna, right? 

288
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:49,980
 Anna, can you tell me what happened yesterday? 

289
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,210
Ah? Doctor.

290
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,430
You remembered.

291
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,920
You've grown so pretty.

292
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,600
I worried a lot about you.

293
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,480
See~ It's 100 times better than just eating, right?

294
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,230
Did you say your name is Kim Jae Ha?

295
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,180
Shall we have a chat?

296
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,650
Let me borrow a room.

297
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,480
Okay, fine.

298
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,290
Mi Ran, stand guard here for a minute.

299
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,110
Okay.

300
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,370
Don't be so nervous.

301
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,580
Psychiatric treatment take a long time with consultation and testing.

302
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,350
I heard you are a great fighter.

303
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,700
What are you trying to say to me?

304
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,850
Come to me.

305
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:12,180
No. Come to Anna and don't stay by my noona.

306
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,630
What are you saying?

307
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:19,510
I don't know why you'd stay by my noona, but I'll match your conditions.

308
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,030
Why? Don't you trust me?

309
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,880
Look here! I may look like this, but I am a mega rich chairman.

310
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,770
I am in a much higher place than a president with a 5 year term.

311
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,740
I think you may not even last 5 years at that rate.

312
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,690
What?

313
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,330
That may have been true, if I didn't have Anna.

314
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,650
But Anna will choose me.

315
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,830
So, you protect Anna by my side.

316
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,800
I'm not sure...

317
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,190
You ask Anna yourself later.

318
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,370
By now Anna probably made her decision.

319
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,760
J4, J4!

320
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,970
J4, J4. This is K2, J4!

321
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,650
Do you know where Go Anna went who was sitting there earlier?

322
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,440
She went home after the treatment a while ago.

323
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,470
She left with that guard.

324
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,120
What happened to Chairman Choi and the Miss?

325
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,190
Yeah? Weren't you supposed come with her?

326
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,190
We can't contact Chairman Choi Seong Won.

327
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,390
JB Chairman's office, Seong Won's house and his villa,

328
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,450
search everywhere that Seong Won might go to.

329
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,400
And notify all the JSS agents who are dispatched in JB.

330
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:29,810
Anyone who catches Choi Seong Won and Anna can come up to cloud 9.

331
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:36,110
I got it. But Madam, first we need to stop the bleeding--

332
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,160
Quickly...

333
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,040
Quickly notify them!

334
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,830
Yeah.

335
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,680
We'll search for an urgent security reason.

336
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,590
Please cooperate.

337
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,240
What? Even to our house?

338
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,730
Okay.

339
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,180
Why so surprised? It's is just as we expected.

340
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,990
Yoo Jin, this arrogant one.

341
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,780
She dares even in the place where the Chairman used to live?

342
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:35,970
Don't worry about it, In-law. It'll go as we planned.

343
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,520
Ah, Manager Ju.

344
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,530
What? The license plate is a fake?

345
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:56,070
You all heard it, right? If we can't find them, that'll be the end of us.

346
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:02,730
But still Manager Ju, he is the chairman of our JB Group.

347
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,090
Do you think it'll be alright?

348
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:10,130
I am a bit nervous, too. But we do need to find where they are.

349
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,240
 

350
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,170
Chairman Choi Seong Won has fired the dispatched JSS agents from JB security duty.

351
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:30,630
From now on, Jin Han Group's security team will take care of security and bodyguard duty for JB Group.

352
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,750
All of JSS agents, please leave the premises.

353
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,840
Oh no! It's all ripped.

354
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,670
Hey, can you read this?

355
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,840
No, sir.

356
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,160
What? Extraction?

357
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,940
What do they see us as?

358
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,900
They took Anna with that kind of plan?

359
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,250
This is war.

360
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,760
I'm going to kill them all.

361
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,970
You should stop right now.

362
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,220
Enough.

363
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,200
Madam issued the order.

364
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,130
I found her! This is headquarters!

365
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,920
Vehicle location:  Moonchon Intersection in Janghak.

366
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,280
Vehicle is at a standstill.

367
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,130
This is K2. I'm on my way.

368
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,170
What the... what is this?

369
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,440
What's the problem?

370
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,830
President, the CCTV has been cut off.

371
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,310
What? Hey, hey, what's wrong with the screens?

372
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,420
Hey, hurry and fix it!

373
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,770
I think that it's been cut from the police's side.

374
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,480
What? Ah this...

375
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,600
We are too busy for this...

376
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,700
This is me. Our CCTV feed is all cut off.

377
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,180
What's going on?

378
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,350
Gosh, Hyungnim! Anymore would be over-reaching.

379
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,560
What did you say?! Hey!

380
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,540
What are you saying all of a sudden?

381
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,730
Are you crazy? You don't need my insurance anymore?

382
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,440
No, Hyungnim,

383
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,990
you have to make sure you're really behind the right people.

384
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,020
Why don't you take the chance and take insurance from me.

385
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,870
What?

386
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,730
Are you testing me right now?

387
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,580
Did Park Gwan Soo put you up to this?

388
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,740
Oh gosh, you should switch over sometime.

389
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,710
Get some hot alcohol and have a heart-to-heart.

390
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,910
Get out.

391
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,750
Get out you jerk off.

392
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,290
Where is she?

393
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,800
The chairman would like to speak to you.

394
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,660
Where are you?

395
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,940
I'll send you the location through text.

396
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,050
Come alone.

397
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,590
Or else Anna will be in danger.

398
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,850
Where's Jae Ha?

399
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,490
No word yet.

400
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,560
This son of a b**** how dare he!

401
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,760
You here?

402
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:59,050
Jae Ha's here! What'd I say? I told you he'd be here closer to dinnertime.

403
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,300
Go on in.

404
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,740
What took you so long?

405
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,240
What are you doing? Take a seat.

406
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,710
You've prepared enough food, right?

407
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,550
This guy looks extremely hungry.

408
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,030
Yes, Chairman.

409
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,340
Welcome, Jae Ha. You were surprised, huh.

410
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,040
Oh, Jae Ha!

411
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,300
Welcome!

412
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,980
You're here?

413
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,120
What are you doing, take a seat.

414
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,930
I fell for it, crap.

415
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,030
Madam, it's K2.

416
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,890
Yes. What happened?

417
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,970
Yes. I've found her.

418
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,060
I'll hand you to Chairman Choi.

419
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,710
Yes, Noona. You must've been really worried.

420
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:46,740
I'm going to be with Anna a little longer. It's okay, right?

421
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,980
You should've told me ahead of time.

422
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,940
I'm sorry.

423
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,480
The child was saying she felt suffocated.

424
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,060
 Oh, that's what happened. 

425
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,320
Since you didn't tell me in advance,

426
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,560
I almost killed your wife.

427
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,390
Noona, don't you know my personality?

428
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:18,310
If you keep on nagging me, I really won't go back.

429
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,520
But,

430
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,000
why is your father-in-law acting up again?

431
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,330
The Jin Han Security guards?

432
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,820
Because of you, he keeps on worrying about his daughter and son-in-law.

433
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,680
How long are you going to keep freeloading off of your father-in-law?

434
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,820
If you keep that up, your father-in-law might start to drool over JB company.

435
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,400
Stop worrying about others, and wipe your own spit.

436
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,300
Noona, I'll play with Anna a little more okay?

437
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:55,200
- Oh, and by the way, I've talked to my father-in-law to remove Jin Han's people. 
 - Are you okay? 

438
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,200
I'll put Jin Han's people for the personal security and bodyguard duty on my house and family members.

439
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,500
My father-in-law worries about his daughter so much.

440
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,850
Got it? I'll hang up now!

441
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,320
I got the report that Jin Han's security guards are evacuating from the JB headquarters.

442
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,670
Take out our guys

443
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,700
from Seong Won's house.

444
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,600
Understood.

445
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,310
"Come alone. Otherwise, Anna will be in danger"

446
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,750
You were surprised, huh.

447
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,210
Eh, a little.

448
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:06,360
I was surprised too, cause Uncle's acting was so good.

449
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,100
Uncle?

450
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,870
I just decided to call him that.

451
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,420
Ah! This place is so nice!

452
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,690
The stuff you said this morning,

453
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,140
Yes.

454
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,210
You said that it was all things you heard from the Manager before coming in.

455
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,540
Yes.

456
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,530
Then you came there knowing that you could die?

457
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,330
Yes.

458
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,970
Why?

459
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,270
Is it  because...

460
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,170
Yes, it's because of you.

461
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,790
To save you, I volunteered.

462
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,140
What kind of crappy lie is this!

463
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,740
What?

464
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,500
Why? Was it not very good?

465
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,920
This is what a man's supposed to do!

466
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,500
So are you planning on staying here?

467
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,440
I'm thinking about it,

468
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,720
it's not like I want to go back anyway.

469
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,850
And it's not like I have any other place to go.

470
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,760
Do you trust Chairman Choi?

471
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,490
I don't know for sure yet, but

472
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,220
I think we both hate Choi Yoo Jin.

473
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,350
Don't worry too much. I have you by my side.

474
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,390
Catch me if you can!

475
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,300
Take your time.  If I catch you, you're dead!

476
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,660
Why?

477
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,910
You catch too.

478
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:45,980
Catch what?

479
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,980
Catch me like them.

480
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,990
It looks fun.

481
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:55,780
Hey, how can I- how does that look fun? They look crazy.

482
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,430
Catch me. I'm going.

483
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,980
You better catch me.
-I don't wanna!

484
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,460
I don't want to! I can't! What are they even doing? They're so childish!

485
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,660
Freeze. Freeze. Wait, got it?

486
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,820
You better catch me. Go!

487
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,220
You sure like saying "go". I'm not doing it!

488
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,420
Come on, let's have a good time like them.

489
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,690
Having a good time is fine and all...

490
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,930
Come catch me okay? Go!

491
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,700
Just go. I'm not doing it.

492
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,780
Go!

493
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,920
So childish. I said no!

494
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,220
Go!

495
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,940
Ugh, I don't want to. Seriously.

496
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,930
Why are we doing this?

497
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,870
Those two, are they dating?

498
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,830
Gosh, no way.

499
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:42,200
No, no. They look so good together.

500
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,240
Punk... I'm fine with his looks, but...

501
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,640
You really do seem like her uncle.

502
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,360
I'm really her uncle!

503
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:01,650
Thank you, Chairman. For rescuing the rest of us too.

504
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,900
Of course! You all are Anna's family.

505
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,590
From now on, don't worry about anything.

506
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,200
Just take care of Anna well.

507
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,080
Yes, sir.

508
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,110
Should we really join you for dinner?

509
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:21,150
Gosh, of course! Sit, sit, sit.

510
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,090
Hurry and sit comfortably.

511
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,940
You sit too.

512
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,670
Sit down.

513
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,610
Here, let's all toast.

514
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:49,380
Everyone lift their glass. To Anna's dreams!

515
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,980
Cheers to Anna's dreams!

516
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,770
♫  Amazing grace    ♫

517
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:04,430
♫   how sweet the sound   ♫

518
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:12,900
♫  that saved  a wretch like me   ♫

519
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,590
Just stay here over night.

520
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:21,710
♫   I was  once lost  ♫

521
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:24,830
♫   But now I am found   ♫

522
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:27,790
♫  I am found   ♫

523
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:37,350
♫   Was blind but now I see   ♫

524
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:40,860
What are you thinking about so seriously by yourself?

525
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,960
What could he be really thinking?

526
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,070
Something like that.

527
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:57,980
But I am so simple-minded. You should be able to read me easily.

528
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,350
With what plan

529
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,730
did you take Anna from Choi Yoo Jin's grasp?

530
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:09,530
You probably had to risk some danger, right?

531
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:11,830
You saw at the funeral,

532
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:15,660
Noona is trying to take away JB from me. I'm trying to keep my company.

533
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,790
But, Anna shows up. Total surprise.

534
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:23,660
I know the big secret that Anna is brother-in-law's biological daughter.

535
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,670
So if Anna is by my side,

536
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,630
my sister won't be able to take JB easily.

537
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,380
That's a very astute strategy.

538
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,840
Of course! I'm a businessman.

539
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,940
Okay, so my thoughts are straight-forward.

540
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:42,640
I hope that Anna stays by my side, healthily, for a very long time. As my guardian angel.

541
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,180
 Brother-in-Law 

542
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,300
Yes, Brother-in-law

543
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,180
Of course I've been well. No need to worry about me.

544
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,480
Yeah, that guy is also doing well.

545
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,850
What do you mean, I've done you a favor? It's for my benefit.

546
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,120
Oh, don't worry.

547
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,470
That guard fellow is here too.

548
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:17,360
Yes, just a moment.

549
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:22,760
Don't say any names. There's probably someone next to him.

550
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,470
Take it.

551
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,220
Yes, it's me.

552
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:43,320
Yeah, it's me. I heard you've had a long hard day.

553
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,170
You didn't forget your promise, right?
-Yes.

554
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,500
Alright, thank you.

555
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,980
I'll be out tomorrow. See you then.

556
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,580
Alright, I'll be going.

557
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:04,000
If you're busy, why don't you go on out now?

558
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,570
No way. How could I do that?

559
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:14,780
It's a high profile investigation. I need to stay at least 2 nights and 3 days.

560
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,560
Hey, Prosecutor Kim, take you socks off.

561
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,510
Why are you acting like you are visiting someone else's house?

562
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:26,110
You are something else.

563
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,380
Ya Saeng Yeon Hu Sal Ta.

564
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:34,960
I save myself first then strike you to death.

565
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,130
There.

566
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,720
Have you made your decision whether to stay by my side or stay by my noona.

567
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:54,840
I am going to leave once I finish what I need to do.

568
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,830
Really? That's disappointing.

569
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,680
I thought you matched with Anna well.

570
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,400
But what is that you need to do?

571
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,670
Later, you'll know.

572
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,550
You've come?

573
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:15,090
I am sorry to have you stay open late.

574
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:17,800
It's fine.

575
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:30,850
Why didn't you press on when help was offered?

576
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:36,440
My son-in-law, the owner is refusing, so how could I press on as his father-in-law and as an outsider.

577
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:42,430
Bon Rae Mu Il Mul (Originally everything is empty). Will there be an absolute owner for a company?

578
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:47,600
Owner becomes a guest, and the guest becomes the owner as well.

579
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:51,960
So that's what it means.

580
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,660
Not sure...

581
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:57,870
Ye Si Ah Mun (That's how I heard).

582
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,150
- Anna, where are you going? 
- Uhm?

583
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:28,230
I had a few glasses of wine and my cheeks are too hot.

584
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,020
So I wanted to get some ocean breeze.

585
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,010
Ocean? That's too dangerous. Come here.

586
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:36,430
Why? My cheeks feel like they are on fire.

587
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,130
How hot could it be---

588
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,530
Uh! This feel totally cool. So cool.

589
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:44,300
You do feel hot. Let me see.

590
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,840
Ah that feels so cool.

591
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,390
- Feels cool? 
 - Um.

592
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:51,100
Why did you drink so... much?

593
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,030
Ah, this feels so cool.

594
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,710
Why?

595
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,470
If I had one more glass, I'd have to call the fire truck.

596
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:16,120
Are they still feeling hot?

597
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,260
I feel much better.

598
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,300
Give it to me.

599
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,880
You might catch a cold trying to cool down your face, so do it again later.

600
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,280
Yeah.

601
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,680
Y-you have to leave again?

602
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,880
Yeah. I'll make another circle.

603
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,880
The security here isn't that tight unlike the safe house we used to be at.

604
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,050
Which means there's isn't a safe place for me.

605
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:45,100
But it's okay.

606
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,740
I really enjoyed today.

607
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,740
Here.

608
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,700
What is it? Is it a walkie talkie?

609
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:07,540
If you hear something weird, feeling cold, or if you need something suddenly, talk into that.

610
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,560
It's quicker than a phone.

611
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,100
Understood, over.

612
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,100
Are you an idiot? You need to press on this first.

613
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,030
Like this.

614
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,800
Ah, ah, understood K2.

615
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,840
Good girl.

616
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,430
 Ah, ah, where are  you. Over. 

617
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,460
I am in a living room.

618
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:41,130
Aren't you saying "over"? Over.

619
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,590
I will say "over." Over.

620

♫  What good does that do to my heart  ♫

623
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:04,600
You don't need to say like a robot. Over.

624
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,490
Is that so? I don't need to speak like that?

625
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:11,800
Where are you now? Over.

626
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,980
Now I am behind the summer-house. Over.

627
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,190
Are you scared being alone? Over.

628
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,390
I am not. Over.

You've come in now.

635
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,030
Yes.

00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,930
Okay. Good night.

647
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,060
♫  I am trapped in the time where you were together   ♫

648
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,260
Okay.

649
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:59,800
♫  While I'm standing by myself  ♫

650
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:05,100
♫  I'm usually calling out your name again  ♫

651
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,800
♫  Like tears  ♫

652
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:19,920
♫  If Iet down in my heart the sad memory of you  ♫

653
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:27,300
♫  Several times a day crying soundlessly  ♫

654
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:34,380
♫  I used to think of you countless times  ♫ 
 Jae Ha

655
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,900
♫  You are leaving and left on the road alone  ♫

656
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,780
I think I like you.

657
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:43,310
♫  I'm standing by myself  ♫

658
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:50,330
♫  For fear you will come I used to look back   ♫

659
00:57:54,410 --> 00:58:03,410
♫  Every so often I used to wait for you  ♫

660
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,810
K2, are you sleeping?

661
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,560
Why is he sleeping like this?

662
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,620
Anna.

663
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,200
Did you have a dream?

664
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:20,930
Uh, y-y-yes, I guess.

665
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:28,130
- Well,
- Huh?

666
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:31,770
I thought you might be cold. So I came to put this on you.

667
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:33,840
Oh.

668
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,520
No, I am not cold at all. I feel hot.

669
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,830
Did I have a hot dream or something?

670
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:48,110
Then, then, I am going in.

671
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:50,180
Okay. Go in.

672
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,940
I am leaving.

673
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,600
Yes. Good night.

674
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,510
Good bye.

675
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,820
Gosh.

676
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:27,860
Seriously.

677
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,890
Geez, I can't do it.

678
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:55,320
♫  You are going away  ♫

679
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:02,660
♫   There are still many words which couldn't be said  ♫

680
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:08,100
♫   They couldn't be expressed to the end.  ♫

681
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:12,000
♫   Are my feeling showing?   ♫

682
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,110
♫    I am still like this.  ♫

683
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:19,870
♫  Just staring at you.  ♫

684

♫   Love you, even though I forget it and forget it  ♫

685

686
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:43,720

♫   Love you.  Even if I try to stop the feeling  ♫

689
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:07,800
♫  My love is growing bigger and bigger. I can't help it.  ♫

690
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:15,030
♫  I love you. I love you.   ♫

691
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:20,230
♫  Even today, I love you.  ♫

692
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:31,130
♫   I couldn't give you much  ♫

693
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:38,680
♫  This was all in the end  ♫

694
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:44,190
♫  I can't hold you  ♫

695
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:51,520
♫  who are leaving far away now.   But still, as ever   ♫

696
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,380
♫   I want you   ♫

697
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:06,250

699
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:20,610
♫  no matter how hard you try to erase you from me  ♫

700
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:28,460
♫  all I can do is yearn for you, my love  ♫

701
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:35,780
♫  Love you, even if I try to stop the feeling  ♫

702
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:43,690
♫  It keeps growing bigger  ♫

703
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:52,000
♫   I love you. I love you.  ♫

704
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,790
 Kim Jae Ha, you are mine now. 

705
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,730
♫  When are you going to come back?  ♫

706
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:59,820
♫  This is the police record about your mom's case.  ♫

707
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:05,730
 As for the Chairman, Anna is not a shield to protect himself but a knife to attack Choi Yoo Jin. 

708
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:10,050
 I have invited Miss Go Anna to this studio as my surprise guest today. 

709
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:14,660
 It's almost zero chance for him to survive and come back safely. 

710
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:20,100
 I am begging you. If we are together,  we both will die.
