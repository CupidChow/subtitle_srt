 The K2

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,810
An enemy's enemy is a friend, isn't it?

5
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,860
  
 If the appropriate time arrives

6
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,500
  
 JSS will be your gun.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,400
You have to be the bullet. I will pull the trigger.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,200
This is Agent Kim Jae Ha who will work in the VIP team. 
  

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,750
His caller ID will be K2

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,900
What is she looking for?

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,800
Oh, ramen ...

12
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,820
 

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,600
Ride a different car back.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,520
There are a lot of cameras.  Why don't you wave before you leave?

15
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:31,000
But this child read my heart and mind.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,400
But ... the child didn't need my command or permission. 
  

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,470
He wasn't a hunting dog. He is a wolf.

18
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,040
I probably won't be able to tame him.

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,860
Dad, I think I'm lost.

20
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,510
Please come get me.

21
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,700
Really? My dad sent me this?

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,660
 I think she realized that she was the one who was bothersome to her father,   
  

23
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,080
 and she tried to take care of it by eating strawberries. 

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,720
Anna, you can't. Please don't die.
  

25
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,820
Your father will never show up in front of you. 
  

26
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:20,510
To you your father must have been all you're living for,

27
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,700
but you're not everything to your father.

28
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,290
Promise me that you will protect Anna until the end.

29
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,900
I will.

30
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,560
Anna is a hostage.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,340
I must have the most power in order to save her.  
  

32
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,860
I missed you, Dad.

33
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,760
- Why did you bring my dad? 
 - So you wouldn't die.

34
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,310
My father is ...

35
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,570
You can't.

36
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,350
Anna is now in your hands. 
  

37
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,140
I'll be protecting your from now on.

38
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,240
I'll make sure no one messes with you.

39
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,410
- Miss. Miss. 
 - Anna

40
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:05,800
Please stop. My child is sick. 
  

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,370
Anna.  Anna, are you okay?

42
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,120
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah. I'm okay.

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,320
  
  Thank you. 

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,520
Niece!

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,980
Who are you?

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,700
Me? I'm your uncle!

47
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,870
If it's brother-in-law's child, then wouldn't she obviously be my niece?  
  

48
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,100
You can't.

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,780
With what plan did you take Anna from Choi Yoo Jin's grasp?

50
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,600
I know the big secret that Anna is brother-in-law's biological daughter.

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,030
So if Anna is by my side, my sister won't be able to take JB easily.

52
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,290
- I'm sorry. 
- Since you didn't tell me in advance,

53
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,870
I almost killed your wife.

54
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,920
Noona, don't you know my personality?

55
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,940
If you keep on nagging me, I really won't go back.

56
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,100
So, you protect Anna by my side.

57
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,800
I'll ask you this.

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,600
If we are together, we'll both die. 
  

59
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,300
Jae Ha, If the situation gets dire... 
  

60
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,520
you can just come back.

61
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,630
Be sure to return alive.  That's an order.

62
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,100
I can't. I can't. 
  

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,210
 He can't kill Park Gwan Soo because he is alone. 

64
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,460
I told you not to touch Anna.  

65
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,540
The very first time in my life I got slapped by that damned hand, I thought about giving orders to sever it,

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,490
But I am letting it remain attached because you might need it to shake hands during the campaign.

67
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,300
Take care of it well.

68
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:07,330
Anna. We, later ... shall we live in Spain?

69
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,270
Let's go.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,700
- Welcome. Because you are the hero who saved JSS. 
 - A hero?

71
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,430
It's about the time to set up a trap.

72
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,880
- A trap?  
 - Yes.

73
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,590
You have to get close more and more to Park Kwan Su. 
  

74
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,820
You have to do your job as well.

75
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,200
- Yes.  
 - Don't let Jae Ha know.

76
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,370
 Episode 12 

77
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,360
Welcome.  You're climbing into the ring.

78
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,670
Thank you. Let's play a wonderful game together.

79
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,070
Well, someone has to die to finish the game.

80
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,220
Can it be an ending in a wonderful way? We will see.

81
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,550
Welcome!

82
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,090
Thank you! I will do my best in Democratic Party.

83
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,690
Please give me your hands.

84
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,050
Why were you wasting your energy on stopping our Assemblyman's joining the party when it was going to end this way?

85
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,870
Why was he crawling into our party when he is going to lose anyway?

86
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,750
Can't you be a little more creative in response to my comment?

87
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,830
Don't try mimicking me blindly. Keep that in your mind.

88
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,030
What the!

89
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,410
Lieutenant Colonel Ju. It's been a while.

90
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,160
Ah, you were discharged as a Colonel. Thanks to my Party Leader.

91
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,730
That's not it. Thanks to the Party Leader, I had to be discharged from the army.

92
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,540
Please take good care of me.

93
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,690
Congratulations.

94
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,610
The f***ing bastard sounds too happy.

95
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,940
Is that the place?

96
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,870
Where my mom is buried?

97
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,030
How can she take after her mother so much?

98
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,820
Her body proportions and the way she walks...

99
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,700
That's right. You can believe that she is just Eom Hye Rin herself.

100
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,890
By the way, isn't this too shabby for a movie star who used to be a big shot at that time?

101
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,220
I know, right?

102
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,960
When Choi Yoo Jin in the JB Group is a sponsor,

103
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,730
how can they bury Eom Hey Rin in this shabby place?

104
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,500
You're right.

105
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,890
Anna, please greet your mom.

106
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,360
Give her the flowers first.

107
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,400
Mom.

108
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,300
I am sorry to come so late.

109
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,470
♬ A pure girl   ♬

110
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,340
I wanted to come earlier.

111
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,250
But I couldn't.

112
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,620
♬ She doesn’t know, what is fear? ♬

113
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:04,790
♬ He's an evil beast ♬

114
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,020
Mom.

115
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,310
Daddy won't come. So don't wait for him.

116
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
So...

117
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,460
sleep well without any medicine.

118
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,340
What does it mean?

119
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:49,080
Anna. You mom probably has met your daddy in heaven already.

120
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,770
Mom. Mom. Mom.

121
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,910
Huh? Ji Hyeon?

122
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,740
From among the tips I collected over time about Eom Hye Rin,

123
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,070
this seems to be something.

124
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,680
Really? Where is it?

125
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,590
Thank you.

126
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,540
What you are saying is while other team members were pretending to attack Park Gwan Soo's residence,

127
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,360
- you were ambushing at his hideout. Was that right? 
 - Yes.

128
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,190
I didn't know that at all.

129
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:04,220
Wait. Which means other punks all knew about that except me.

130
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,170
Well, it could be because keeping it secret was the most important element for the operation.

131
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,980
Right. There is no way they could have shared such an important information with someone like me.

132
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,260
Don't say such a thing.

133
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,210
By the way, Mr. Master. I have something I would like to know.

134
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,920
What?

135
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,200
As for Chairman Choi Seong Won,

136
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,150
how did he win the succession process in the JB Group? I think Choi Yoo Jin wasn't an easy opponent to win over.

137
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,650
Of course. She wasn't an easy person to defeat at all.

138
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,850
Originally Yoo Jin had more support from the presidents of many subsidiaries in JB Group.

139
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,830
Yoo Jin, I meant, Madam...

140
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,320
she is so smart since she was young.

141
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,290
She also studied a lot as well.

142
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,910
But she doesn't know a thing about a man.

143
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,330
Don't you think It was possible since she was only focusing on the management study since she was young?

144
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:58,150
And then, some womanizer like Jang Se Joon showed up to seduce her. You can tell she would fall for him in no time, right?

145
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,780
So it's because she married to someone whom the late Chairman didn't approve of?

146
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,070
Right. In short, you can put it that way.

147
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,610
In fact, at that time, right after the 1997 financial crisis,

148
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,370
JB Group was having a hard time due to the failure in restructuring of the group.

149
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,240
So the late Chairman tried to solve the crisis by forming alliances with other companies through marriages.

150
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,890
He was trying hard to match Yoo Jin to someone from the  wealthy and stable conglomerates families for that reason.

151
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,610
But still, it was no use since she didn't want to.

152
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,280
On other hand, that Choi Seong Won married the person whom his father selected without any resistance.

153
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,260
That's why everything happened this way.

154
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,950
Chairman Choi became who he is now thanks to his in-laws.

155
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,760
That's why he is still tamed by his father-in-law.

156
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,360
Then, Chairman Choi must be not as mean as his Noona.

157
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,440
What? Geez. How naive of you. You don't know anything about what's inside a person.

158
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,000
He is way more meaner than Madam.

159
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,940
When Chairman Choi was little, he was so vicious that nobody could tell what he was thinking.

160
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,720
By the way, how can you know all of these things?

161
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,200
You didn't know that I am the oldest senior in JSS.

162
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,880
I used to work in  the security team of the JB Group.

163
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,420
And the JSS was developed

164
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,740
from the very JB security team.

165
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,720
Then, why wouldn't I know every nook and cranny of this JB family?

166
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,890
The meeting time is over.

167
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,130
Don't worry about it too much. You have your uncle here.

168
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,900
Don't be nervous.

169
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,610
Okay.

170
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,810
Do you have a cigarette?

171
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,950
Please let it slide by once. Isn't this the best thing out of a special meeting?

172
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,210
Here, but first you need to do one simple thing for me.

173
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,500
You're acting cheap for someone so wealthy.

174
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,580
That's the reason I'm wealthy.

175
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,120
Miss, don't you remember me?

176
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,690
We met that night

177
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,620
in your mother's room.

178
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,620
Oh! Do you not remember me because I shined my flashlight in your eyes?

179
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,990
Mom?

180
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,720
Do you remember now?

181
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,590
My specialty is burglary.

182
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:17,890
That night I entered your house to utilize my skills because it looked wealthy.

183
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,450
I would never in my wildest dreams have thought that it was the house of actress Eom Hye Rin.

184
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,080
I was going about my business thinking that everyone was asleep

185
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,830
but I suddenly felt someone entering the house without a sound.

186
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:35,640
So then I just hid because I thought they were a visitor of the night just like me.

187
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,730
It turned out not to be that at all.

188
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,040
After they quietly came into the room that I was hiding in,

189
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,390
to the owner, I mean Eom Hye Rin,

190
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,640
I'm not sure if it's appropriate for her daughter to be hearing this.

191
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,720
She'll probably be traumatized.

192
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,950
It's fine, tell me.

193
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,660
Ok. Brace yourself.

194
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,900
That person climbed onto Eom Hye Rin

195
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,680
and injected a shot into her neck.

196
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,780
It was correct. My memory was correct.

197
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,730
At that time I realized

198
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,910
that I was seeing something I'm not supposed to see.

199
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,560
Did you see the face of the person who gave her that shot?

200
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,650
I saw it.

201
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,290
Do you remember?

202
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,370
Probably

203
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,970
I should be able to.

204
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,140
Isn't this about the time when you should be listening to my conditions as well?

205
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,840
- Lawyer Kim?
- Yes?
 - What can we do for him?

206
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,770
Out of his three pending cases, one case already has a judgment which we can't do anything about.

207
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,380
One of the two case is trespassing while intoxicated.

208
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,870
The remaining case is conditioned on a settlement with the victim

209
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,230
for which he can stop serving time once it is settled.

210
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,670
Then he can avoid being punished from the Additional Punishment Law on Specific Crimes,

211
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,080
as a result, he can reduce his sentences up to total of four years.

212
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,490
Now, do you remember who gave her the shot?

213
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,510
Of course. I remember the face for sure.

214
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,210
Do you need to look at photos?

215
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,980
No, the woman who was next to you.

216
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,360
The woman who was next to you when you appeared on television,

217
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,480
it was that woman.

218
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,680
Will you be able to testify to this in a court of law?

219
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,630
Besides the reduction of my sentences, if you can help me out with my family for their living...

220
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,350
Sure. Are you going to do it or not?

221
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,790
Sure.

222
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,520
Mi Ran, Anna's not answering her cellphone.

223
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,250
-  She should be busy at the salon.   
 -Then where are you?

224
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,140
 I'm checking the security at the fashion show location. 

225
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,120
Then what about her close security?

226
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,650
 Don't worry about it. Anna is at the salon. I just talked with her a little while ago. 

227
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,780
 Anna said that she's coming with you. You bring her here. 

228
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,620
I understand.

229
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,970
Why? Why can't we accuse Choi Yoo Jin right now?

230
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,410
If we bring charges against my sister with the police, your father will immediately have to resign from his candidacy.

231
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,760
Are you ok with that?

232
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,160
It doesn't matter to me.

233
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,340
Anna, it is right for my sister who committed this crime to be punished

234
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,670
but in order for you to have more freedom you need your father to become President.

235
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:29,660
So in this case we need to make your father a separate issue.

236
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,650
With my sister established as assailant and your father as the victim,

237
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:38,490
when the populace are ensured of this fact, that's when we need to reveal the truth of my sister's crime.

238
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,350
Do you understand what I'm saying?

239
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,130
Then, finding the silver lining in this misfortune, your father can get the sympathy vote.

240
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,420
So, let's first turn the popular opinion to our side.

241
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,200
It shouldn't take too long. A few days is more than enough time.

242
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,710
-How? 
 -There's always a way. Just trust me.

243
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,270
Ah, you must definitely not tell Jae Ha.

244
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,860
Why?

245
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,190
If my sister hears about all of this, everything will go down the drain.

246
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,670
You think Jae Ha will tell Choi Yoo Jin?

247
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,180
There's no way.

248
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,120
Ah, innocent Anna, Jae Ha may love you

249
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,300
but he has no choice but to be Choi Yoo Jin's person.

250
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,470
Let's go back to the shop quickly before Jae Ha gets there.

251
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:33,080
Tonight's Angel needs to capture everyone's hearts.

252
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,240
 Correction for tomorrow and hope 

253
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,410
- You're here? 
- Why did you send J4 off first?

254
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,960
What?

255
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,070
Because it was too long for her to wait here.

256
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,500
Even if that's the case!

257
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,930
Ok. Don't do that again. Let's go.

258
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,350
By the looks of it,

259
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,350
you don't have the typical relationship of VIP and bodyguard.

260
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,260
-No...
 - Yes. He's my boyfriend.

261
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,650
- Oh, I see! Boyfriend come sit over here for a bit.
 - No thank you.

262
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,470
- I'll make it so you both look good together.
 - Thank you.

263
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,490
- Come sit here 
 - I'm fine.

264
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:33,260
Also, if a bodyguard shows up to a classy fashion show like this looking this scruffy, it will be embarrassing.

265
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,720
- Am I scruffy?

266
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,010
- No 
 - Sit here, I'll make you look good. 
 - Sit down. She said she'd make you look good.

267
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,520
- Am I scruffy? 
 -No, no you're not scruffy.

268
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,510
Ok.

269
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:57,200
Welcome. Are you ok?

270
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,890
Did you take the medicine I gave you?

271
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,830
Yes, I took it.

272
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,760
Good job.

273
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,770
If you need more medication, just tell me. I have more of it.

274
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,090
Let's do a good job today, ok?

275
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,290
Come over here.

276
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,370
How does it feel? Should I fix the sleeve?

277
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,690
Don't fold that up.

278
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,280
Is this okay? Should I let it down little more?

279
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,410
- Hello. 
 - Oh, Anna.

280
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,200
Oh my god!

281
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,220
I never thought that I would be doing an Eom Hye Rin commemorative fashion show.

282
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,050
It's an honor to have you standing on my stage before Jean  Paul La Felt.

283
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:08,310
It's an honor for me. I hope that I don't do anything to ruin the show.

284
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,330
I'm not sure I'll be good at walking.

285
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,570
Anna, what is walking? Walking means just walking.

286
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,090
So you just have to walk. That will do.

287
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,560
Then, my clothes will be wings for you.

288
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,290
- Please take good care of my Anna.
- Count on me, Chairman.

289
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,670
Hey, let's do a rehearsal.

290
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,740
 Gosh, just stand there. 

291
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,320
Uncle. Give me some medicine.

292
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,120
Why? Don't you feel well?

293
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,440
No. I just feel so nervous.

294
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,030
You should take one, then.

295
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,300
Again?

296
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,050
I am okay. I heard it's safe.

297
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,290
Here you go.

298
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,670
What are you doing now?

299
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,060
Just give me that.

300
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,780
Come with me.

301
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,710
Anna, if you take one more, that's the third one today.

302
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,470
I looked into this medication and I heard that it's not good to take too many of these and that you can develop a chemical dependence on them.

303
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,160
Let me do it just this once.

304
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,600
Look, they're all here because of my mother. There are so many people who remember her...

305
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,970
- Even so.
- It's a commemoration of her. I want to do well.

306
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,790
Help me, please?

307
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,450
I feel like I have to do it this way in order to not have any regrets.

308
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,630
I want to show them that my mother is living inside of me.

309
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,780
Anna.

310
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,680
Understand?

311
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:16,260
Anna, why are you taking so long? It's only 20 minutes till showtime. Let's go quickly.

312
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,260
Quickly get Anna ready.

313
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,180
What are you doing right now?

314
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,050
What?

315
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,370
What? Are you really asking because you don't know?

316
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:40,740
Why are you going to the extent of feeding her medication in order to expose her to the public eye?

317
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,760
She needs to commemorate her mother. Stars can easily receive love

318
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,820
but they can lose it just as easily. We need to make sure that Eom Hye Rin, who has been forgotten

319
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,880
is remembered by the public again.

320
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,950
And we also need to make sure that they are curious about why she died.

321
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,720
That's what Anna and I want.

322
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:17,780
Anna told me to bring this to you. She said it seemed like you haven't even had a drink of water today.

323
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:23,010
 Jae Ha, don't worry about me. I'll go walk fantastically. 

324
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,590
Yes, I understand.

325
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,540
Go Anna, come out! She's coming out now.

326
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,210
Come out this way.

327
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,880
Are you ready?

328
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,500
Wait a second! Wait a second.

329
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,670
The bracelet is the focal point.

330
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,660
Ah, that would have been a terrible mistake.

331
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:07,820
This is style of bracelet Hye Rin used to like. I prepared it specially to give to you today.

332
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,750
It looks like it suits you. Let's see: hair, earrings,

333
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,970
bracelet, one-piece dress.

334
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,270
Oh my, even your face is ridiculously perfect.

335
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:24,450
We're good. It's a go. Let's go.

336
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:43,150
Hello, I'm Eom Hye Rin's daughter, Go Anna.

337
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:49,350
I thought this version of me would be more familiar to you all, so I've come out this way.

338
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,690
For still remembering my mother

339
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,340
and attending this charity fashion show, I thank you.

340
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:08,920
Because I am able to do something good in the name of my mother even now,

341
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,800
I am truly happy.

342
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:18,250
I think that my mother is here with us today.

343
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,620
Thank you.

344
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,550
 Mom, 

345
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:39,040
 There are still this many people that remember you. 

346
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,820
 I will reveal the injustice done to you. Wait just a little longer 

347
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,460
You did well.

348
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,020
I was super nervous.

349
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,150
Are you ok?

350
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,970
Yeah.

351
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,250
You did good.

352
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,170
Anna, you need quickly go change your clothes.

353
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,820
Ok.

354
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,600
Let's walk out.

355
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,590
Excuse me, can you give me some medication?

356
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,370
Yeah.

357
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,840
Miss, are you ok?

358
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:45,750
♫   I can't breathe because my heart aches   ♫

359
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:51,950
♫   I can't touch you because you have become cold   ♫

360
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,110
♫   No matter how I try to reach    ♫

361
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,020
♫   You who are going further away again   ♫

362
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,650
♫   are spending all day in tears    ♫

363
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:06,560
♫   I can only stare at your back blankly everyday   ♫

364
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,050
♫  Everyday   ♫

365
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,890
 Eom Hye Rin Commemorative Fashion Show -- Daughter Go Anna Walks as a Model 

366
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,870
What is it?

367
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,680
A tabloid surfaced...but  I can't even utter...

368
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:50,650
When did we have something we can't discuss between you and me? Tell me.

369
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,820
Hurry up.

370
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:04,010
"Barcelona Angel, Go Anna, is Choi Yoo Jin and deceased director Go Joon Ho's biological child from an affair"...

371
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:09,050
Anna was my child? Go on.

372
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,640
"Not knowing that fact, Eom Hye Rin, who later married Go Joon Ho, raised Anna,"

373
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,070
"and upon realizing that Choi Yoo Jin was her mother,"

374
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,850
"blackmailed Choi Yoo Jin,"

375
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:25,880
"and Choi Yoo Jin, who became pressured under Eom Hye Rin's threats,"

376
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,550
"eventually had Eom Hye Rin killed."

377
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:33,700
"Afterwards, Jang Se Joon and Choi Yoo Jin..."

378
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,150
Go on.

379
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:41,140
"... became a wedded couple for show, and Choi Yoo Jin's daughter, Go Anna"

380
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,310
"now lives with her maternal uncle, JB Chairman Choi Seong Won." This is all.

381
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,670
It's too vulgar for me to listen to.

382
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,070
On top of that, Jang Se Joon is completely out of the story.

383
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:03,580
What do you think about cancelling today's volunteer event?

384
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,160
No. No need.

385
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,690
If I do, I become even more laughable.

386
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:22,450
Uncle- this tabloid report, did you really put it out there?

387
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,840
B-but.. but how could you even come up with such nonsense?

388
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,520
How could you make my mother into such a bad person?

389
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,190
Of course, it should be nonsense! If this were all true, what would happen?

390
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,980
What?

391
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,180
Someone would have to say something nonsensical about your mom in order for us to report to the police.

392
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:47,460
But this is something you put out. We should be accusing Choi Yoo Jin, but why are we reporting you to the police?

393
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,050
Gosh, my innocent little angel. I have to do this,

394
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,170
so that my sister will get taken in for witness testimony in the investigation,

395
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,300
and during that questioning, there will be an investigation on the alleged murder.

396
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,620
That's when we use our secret ace up our sleeve. Do you get it?

397
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:09,750
You have no idea what I'm saying, huh. It's okay, I'll be handling it.

398
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,980
And plus, do you really think I'd paint your mom in such a bad light?

399
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:21,350
After the investigation, everything will come to light. Choi Yoo Jin will also be arrested.

400
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,590
- You didn't tell Jae Ha, did you? 
- Yeah.

401
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,130
Okay good.

402
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,720
We need to go to the police station, so go get ready.

403
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,260
The rumor is very explosive, so it's going viral.

404
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:45,230
Anna is the daughter of Choi Yoo Jin cheating with another man.

405
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,230
But actually Anna was born

406
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:55,830
before Madam Choi Yoo Jin and Assemblyman Jang Se Joon got married.

407
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:59,460
Do you cheat first then marry?

408
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,120
Then can you call this a cheating?

409
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,640
I guess you are right since cheating comes after the marriage.

410
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,800
If we keep talking about this laughable nonsense,

411
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,770
the only thing that will happen is dirtying the reputation

412
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,520
of Assemblyman Jang Se Joon and Madam Choi Yoo Jin.

413
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,120
Therefore, I will stop talking about this..... but!

414
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,820
As for the rumor that Anna is Choi Yoo Jin's biological child-

415
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,160
Is technology these days just decent?

416
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,330
All they have to do is a simple simple DNA test.

417
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,800
That's right, yes.

418
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,510
And Eom Hye Rin blackmailing Choi Yoo Jin?

419
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,310
And that's why Choi Yoo Jin killed Eom Hye Rin?

420
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,970
This is completely ludicrous.

421
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:52,970
 In conclusion, don't you think that all this started because of the mystery surrounding Eom Hye Rin's death? 

422
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,510
 But Mr. Assemblyman, wasn't the case already ruled as a simple suicide? 

423
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:02,350
Last time, when I heard what Miss Anna said on TV,

424
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,590
I could totally understand her.

425
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:12,020
Wouldn't everyone else have the same doubts about the suspicious death of their mother?

426
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,980
 That's why I think Madam Choi Yoo Jin should take this opportunity, 

427
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,850
 to go to the police, and clarify the situation beyond any doubt. 

428
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:26,520
 And the police should again look into the mysterious death of Eom Hye Rin 

429
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,380
so that this re-investigation would reveal everything there is.

430
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,760
Ah, a re-investigation? But that only happens in the case

431
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,220
where there is victim testimony or some new evidence, right?

432
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:44,560
That's right. I'm just saying this as my personal opinion.

433
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,430
If there isn't, then nevermind.

434
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,810
That man...

435
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,080
 Alright. 

436
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,030
is he really on our side?

437
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,540
It no longer seems so now.

438
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,030
They're here!

439
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:06,300
Chairman! Please give us a comment!

440
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,290
Please tell us your thoughts!

441
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,930
Please, Chairman!

442
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,410
In my entire life, I have never seen such a revolting work of trash.

443
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,470
This is obvious defamation of the dead,

444
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,100
as well as dirtying of our household members,

445
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,630
I'll make sure to find them and hold them responsible in a court of law.

446
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,190
Are you here to sue?

447
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,960
Anna, can you give us a comment?

448
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,790
Hey, I'm good at acting, right?

449
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:36,450
Oh, Chairman! Welcome!

450
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,670
Ah, Police Chief.

451
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,110
This way.

452
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,710
I've also received a report.

453
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,940
How much pain you must be in.

454
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,780
Well, not much pain. We just have to catch them and throw them in jail.

455
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,420
This is our complaint.

456
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,680
Why would you personally bring this?

457
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,440
I thought about sending it via lawyer,

458
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,640
but I thought it'd be good to get some paparazzi footage and say a few words too in front of the prosecutor's office.

459
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,350
What?

460
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,960
Please take special care of the investigation.

461
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,730
Of course! These punks who created the rumor—

462
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:17,970
The rumor of course, but more importantly the case on Anna's mother.

463
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,890
What?

464
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,860
You can start off with the defamation of the decedent,

465
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,850
but once you investigate the material witness who is related to this case,

466
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,890
you might find more than you expect.

467
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,300
Material witness?

468
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,070
 Sharing Love Snacks 

469
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,000
Mother! I'll give you a hand!

470
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,040
Please rest! Rest!

471
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,190
You don't have to help to this extent. Thank you so much!

472
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,610
Not at all. You're always doing such great things.

473
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,490
I thank you all the more.

474
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,400
Should I put out the chairs, too?

475
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,750
What? Is that true?

476
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,000
Yes. Chairman Choi is definitely targeting Choi Yoo Jin.

477
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,980
From what I can see, he's already secured a witness.

478
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:32,350
Wow... the elites sure do make a mess of their household fights.

479
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,700
What should I do, Party Leader?

480
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:39,710
Hey, Police Chief. Why are you even asking? Of course you should investigate!

481
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,170
Is a dead person's honor not honorable?

482
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:47,370
We need to help the decedent reveal the unfairness done to her!

483
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:50,020
Yeah, yeah.

484
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,300
Unfairness? What are you talking about?

485
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,560
Hey! If you just leave everything alone,

486
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,780
I think it'll all collapse on its own.

487
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,190
Jeez. Hey, make a call to the prosecutor.

488
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,490
Yes, sir.

489
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:10,840
Wow, I have a good feeling about this. So good!

490
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,840
Mr. Prosecutor! What's going to happen with Go Anna's accusation case?

491
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,600
What do you mean, what's going to happen?

492
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,890
If an accusation is submitted, it's obvious that the police will have to investigate.

493
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,140
The malignant rumors and comments without grounds must be thoroughly investigated.

494
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,600
No, not that. The people in that accusation.

495
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,620
Choi Yoo Jin, Jang Se Joon... those kinds of people.

496
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,290
Police will have to go through the first round of investigation first.

497
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:41,440
Assemblyman Jang Se Joon might feel disgraced, but I don't think we need to get him involved.
-And?

498
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,290
And Choi Yoo Jin will have to get at least material witness questioning, right?

499
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,880
She is, after all, a victim of the rumors.

500
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,360
Really? So?

501
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:56,790
What do you mean so? As the accuser, Go Anna, expressed doubts about her mother's death,

502
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,360
if there are any suspicions in the process of questioning the material witness—

503
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,430
You're saying you'll re-investigate the death of Eom Hye Rin?

504
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,650
Isn't that obvious?

505
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,590
That's a fact, right? This is an exclusive for me.

506
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,400
Please hold it for one hour until I get this article published.

507
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,670
30 minutes.

508
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,880
 Actress Eom Hye Rin Murder Suspected! Resuming investigation after 14 years! 

509
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:30,930
Resuming investigation after 14 years... Good.

510
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,280
If it's not enough, please get more.

511
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,560
Please help yourself.

512
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,390
Bon Appetite! If it's not enough, please get more.

513
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,050
Hello.

514
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,160
Please help yourself.

515
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,580
Just a moment! Just a moment, Reverend!

516
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:51,830
Just a moment! Just a moment!

517
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:55,340
Just a moment! It'll take just a moment!

518
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,620
Just a moment!

519
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,140
Just a moment! She's coming! She's coming!

520
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,930
Madam! According to the prosecutor's office, Eom Hye Rin's case will be re- investigate. Have you heard this yet?

521
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,510
Is it true that there is an eyewitness to the murder scene?

522
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:14,080
Tell us your thoughts on the fact that you may be questioned as a suspect instead of a material witness.

523
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,850
If you go away now, we'll agree to an interview at a later time. I apologize.

524
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:20,830
Madam! Give us a comment!

525
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:24,950
Just one statement!

526
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:28,080
Please tell us!

527
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,980
Can you give us a statement?

528
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,880
Madam! Madam!

529
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,430
Madam! Madam! Open your eyes!

530
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,140
Madam!

531
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,250
Hurry call an ambulance! Now!

532
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:52,830
Madam! Madam!

533
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,080
Madam! What is your status?

534
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,170
What is the reason the Madam suddenly collapsed?

535
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,580
Please give us a comment!

536
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,000
Is she alright?

537
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,580
Please make way.

538
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,830
 Choi Yoo Jin, the wife of presidential candidate Jang Se Joon 

539
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:19,520
 was taken to the emergency room today while volunteering this afternoon. 

540
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,600
 Mrs. Choi recently found herself to be the center of a malicious tabloid rumor. 

541
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,860
Wow, my sister must have been really desperate.

542
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,410
How did she think to hide in a hospital with that temper?

543
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,460
 "Presidential Candidate Jang Se Joon's wife, Mrs. Choi Yoo Jin Hospitalized for malicious rumor" 

544
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,470
Then, are you saying that madam really collapsed? It wasn't a show?

545
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:41,440
Yes. It looks that way.

546
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,190
Oh, no. No way.

547
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,590
If that person happened to get shot,

548
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:49,790
she's the type to collapse when no one's looking.

549
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,990
That's all show! Show!

550
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:54,630
I really wish that too.

551
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:57,090
Don't worry!

552
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:00,830
It's all premeditated for sure.

553
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,900
My goodness!

554
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,200
It really doesn't make sense that Choi Yoo Jin gave birth to Anna.

555
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,290
Even though she claimed to be close to Hye Rin but she didn't know Hey Rin's close relationship with LaFelt, and then pretended to know it later.

556
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,500
Saying that she doesn't know anything about Eom Hye Rin's mysterious death.

557
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:23,000
Furthermore, there is a rumor going around that there is an eyewitness to the murder scene of Eom Hey Rin.

558
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,940
If you're a reporter, then act like a reporter by using facts! Facts!

559
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,970
Gosh, you little!

560
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,840
This world's going downhill.

561
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,400
Until yesterday, everyone was all "Madam! Madam!" and now there's all sorts of evil comments.

562
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,870
Who? Choi Yoo Jin?

563
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,720
Who else would it be?

564
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,520
What about Jang Se Joon?
-It seems like there's a lot more sympathy.
-Really?

565
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,280
Isn't it obvious? If he really took a wife with another man's child?

566
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:56,340
But if things keep up like this, then our Angel's going to be more of a laughingstock.

567
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,010
She's saying that she won't come out.

568
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:20,160
Really, then I'll have to go up.

569
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,380
When she waited before, he didn't even show a hair.

570
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,490
Anna,

571
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,620
Anna?

572
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,660
Open your door.

573
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,950
Anna, let's talk face to face.

574
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,770
I have something to tell you.

575
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:51,750
I don't have anything to say, so go away.

576
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,650
I think we have to quickly head over to Chairman Choi's place.

577
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:09,990
Anna, I'll just leave for today.

578
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,750
I'll see you next time.

579
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,180
Master Song.

580
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,560
Is Madam inside?

581
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,640
She is here but what business do you have here?

582
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,410
What business?

583
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,420
If a person is sick you're supposed to come visit.

584
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,220
Just leave. Hey, what are you doing?

585
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,300
Master, you should leave.

586
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,200
How dare you stop me?

587
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,310
That's not it, Madam is sick right now.

588
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:56,640
Stand aside kid so that I can enter.

589
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,980
Huh? You punks!

590
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,920
-Move, move! 
 - I mean that's...

591
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,250
Just leave now.

592
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,310
Move. I said to move.

593
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,530
Madam, it's me Song Yeong Choon!

594
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,000
We're telling you that Madam is sick right now.

595
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,630
What are you all doing right now?!

596
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,440
Chief Kim, let him in.

597
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,430
Yes?

598
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:22,620
Look at that you rascals. You punks!

599
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,650
Madam, how is your body?

600
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:34,110
Madam, drink some of this.

601
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,990
What are you doing?

602
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,680
This is the juice that I used to like.

603
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,220
You always used to ask for this whenever you were sick.

604
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,730
I guess they still sell this.

605
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,250
Yes.

606
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,630
It's delicious.

607
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,090
Isn't it? It's delicious right?

608
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,710
- Master. 
 - Everyone step outside.

609
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,880
I'm going to talk with Master.

610
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,420
I really do feel better after drinking some of this.

611
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:21,020
Is that so? That's a relief.

612
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,440
Madam, get better soon.

613
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,950
Speak informally with me, Ahjussi.

614
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,600
Shall I?

615
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,480
Well,

616
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,690
Yoo Jin,

617
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:40,930
Yes, Ahjusshi.

618
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:46,760
If it's at all possible, just leave Anna alone.

619
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:55,390
Did you come here to tell me this?

620
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:03,240
Even when you go hunting, you always let the child live when you kill their mother.

621
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:10,440
Ahjusshi, it makes me uncomfortable to hear that.

622
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:16,110
Yoo Jin, if your father was still alive,

623
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,890
he would have told you not to do this.

624
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,000
Ahjusshi.

625
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,920
If you keep going on like this,

626
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,630
I won't have any choice but to publicly reveal the truth.

627
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,430
See the master out.

628
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,450
Oh, have you arrived Brother-in-law? Please have a seat

629
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:41,530
While someone else's house is on fire, it looks like this house is having a party.

630
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,770
You're correct, we're having a party.

631
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,210
But you don't seem to be aware of whose party this is.

632
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:51,000
Whose party could it be? It's Jang Se Joon's party of course.

633
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,810
Were you concerned because of your wife?

634
00:53:55,810 --> 00:54:00,270
Brother-in-law, didn't you notice anything about this recent tabloid issue?

635
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,150
What?

636
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,880
Any story about you was completely taken out!

637
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,220
You will most assuredly rise, just like we've planned.

638
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,640
Now, you need to throw away Choi Yoo Jin.

639
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,210
Then, everything will go smoothly as you wish.

640
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,410
Are you okay?

641
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,490
I'm okay.

642
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,620
You should've met your dad.

643
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,580
I don't need him.

644
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:58,420
Anna. I know you're sticking close to Chairman Choi right now,

645
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:03,670
but Choi Yoo Jin isn't someone who would directly bloody her hands like that.

646
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:10,040
And plus, even if there were an eye witness, she would've covered her tracks and not left him alive.

647
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,110
This time, it's not like that.

648
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,440
But...

649
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,570
are you my side or Choi Yoo Jin's side?

650
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,570
What are you saying? Of course, I'm on your side.

651
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,870
Then why are you sticking so close to Choi Yoo Jin?

652
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:33,430
Mi Ran and Seung Gyu moved to work under JB chairman team.

653
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,070
You're still at JSS.

654
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,330
What are you working on with Choi Yoo Jin?

655
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:47,250
Anna, the reason why I'm not telling you what I'm working with Choi Yoo Jin on,

656
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:53,710
is because nothing good will come out of you knowing.

657
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:00,580
 Because I'll have to kill someone. 

658
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,160
Ta-da!

659
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:10,280
Look! The promised 40-year-old whiskey!

660
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,070
You sure this isn't fake?

661
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,930
What? Fake?

662
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:17,410
Hey, you punk! I went to S-S-Scotland and personally—

663
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:22,440
You were the one who falsely tried to get an insurance from me. How can I trust that this isn't a fake as well?

664
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,910
Oh, is this what you meant?

665
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:31,470
I'm sorry! That's why I got you this expensive drink as an apology!

666
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,630
Here. Pour me a glass.

667
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,910
Cheers!

668
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,480
How is it? Is it delicious?

669
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,060
Well, the taste is...

670
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,710
It's a killer, right?

671
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,510
It's a killer!

672
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:03,910
No, no, no.

673
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:06,930
Okay, okay.

674
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:13,480
So, this you come here to get the tip for Choi Yoo Jin's case?

675
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,680
A tip? What tip? No way. It's so obvious already.

676
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,180
It may not be easy this time.

677
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,850
It's meant to be just going through it if it's not easy.

678
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:27,750
Right, in any case, it resulted

679
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,890
that Assemblyman Jang joined the party. Didn't he?

680
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:36,940
And our Madam is not in a good shape right now,

681
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,500
but Assemblyman is okay. So don't worry.

682
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:46,820
Then, are you here to bring me around to your side?

683
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:50,720
Bring you around? No way!

684
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:56,250
You have to stick to Assemblyman Park Gwan Soo.

685
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:59,260
- What?
- In that way, when it comes to an emergency,

686
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,980
I can get insurance from Assemblyman Park. Don't you think so?

687
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:07,280
Then, in the case of an emergency, can I.... to Assemblyman Jang?

688
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,420
Of course!

689
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:12,960
You already got insurance from me, didn't you?

690
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,270
You don't need to worry about it.

691
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,940
How nice is it? Since between a senior and a junior,

692
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,180
we both have insurance on both sides.

693
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,830
Whatever happens, we both will survive.

694
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:27,560
You are so right.

695
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,770
Here, let's toast!

696
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:33,710
Yes, Senior.

697
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,000
As for me,

698
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:58,070
I won't be shocked even if you killed Anna's mom.

699
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:01,120
Were there only one or two who got killed by you like that?

700
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,980
So I wish you tell me something about it.

701
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:17,130
Why? Why do you want to know about it?

702
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,940
Because of Anna.

703
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:26,240
Anna strongly believes that you killed her mother.

704
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:32,440
I am not sure if I need to stop her or not.

705
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:41,720
Just let her do as she want.

706
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,340
Alright.

707
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:52,790
Then, just from my own pure curiosity, let me ask you one thing.

708
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,310
Eom Hye Rin...

709
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,570
Did you kill her?

710
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:08,770
Fine.

711
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:16,710
I will only tell the pure truth to you.

712
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:25,890
I... didn't kill Eom Hye Rin.

713
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:31,670
Of course, I didn't order to that she be killed, either.

714
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:41,290
Then, why are you letting Assemblyman Jang and Anna believe so until now.

715
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:50,510
In that way, Jang Se Joon will believe that I can really have Anna killed.

716
01:00:54,460 --> 01:01:01,190
And so on that day, and the days following,

717
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:06,200
Jang Se Joon wouldn't be able to leave my side.

718
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:16,080
And because I know the real killer.

719
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:23,300
But also because I can't say the real name.

720
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:35,380
If you have anything else you're curious about, ask Mirror.

721
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,680
Mirror knows everything about me.

722
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,770
I set up everything so that she'll answer everything you ask.

723
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:49,650
Only you... and me.

724
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:02,490
My only option now is to go to the police station.

725
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:06,970
I will fully cooperate with the investigation.

726
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:12,750
However, I don't know what kind of tricks they are going to play inside.

727
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:18,760
That's why someone else will need full access to Mirror.

728
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:23,680
But why does that someone need to be me?

729
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,230
Because you also believed in me and got rid of the email.

730
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:33,210
The email that was worth your life.

731
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,850
It's like the Mirror for me.

732
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,210
It's worth the same as my life.

733
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,080
I'll put it in your hands.

734
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:11,790
Oh! My bad, I forgot to knock again! I am sorry.

735
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,200
But what... is this atmosphere?

736
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,980
You can go now.

737
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:44,040
You're a lot better than I heard.

738
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:51,820
Seong Won, I was a little disappointed by your poor writing skills.

739
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,890
What are you talking about?

740
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:57,720
Even though I look like this, I got a prize for creative writing in the past.

741
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:03,280
Don't do anything else you'll regret. Otherwise, I'll even bring damage to your company.

742
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,130
Oh,  instead, you can hand JSS over to me.

743
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:12,810
No, wait. You keep JSS and hand Cloud 9 over to me. That will do.

744
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:18,730
Seong Won, recently I had this thought:

745
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:22,510
why did father give the JB Chairman position to you,

746
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:27,850
but give JSS to me?

747
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:33,850
In order to survive, we needed the alliance with Jin Han Corp.

748
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:40,160
Maybe he left JSS  to me to block JB Group from merging into Jin Han's hands.

749
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,810
But then your father-in-law, who has had his eye on JB,

750
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:49,980
why do you think he is eager to get his hands on Cloud 9?

751
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:53,680
But maybe Father back then didn't think that

752
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,450
Jin Han Corp. would come under JB.

753
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:04,120
Noona, if I had believed my father-in-law,

754
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,680
do you think JB would have survived this long?

755
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,840
Under that vile old man?

756
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,500
If I hadn't gotten caught by Cloud 9's surveillance,

757
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:18,560
Jin Han might already have been acquired by JB.

758
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:26,560
Is that right?

759
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,200
That's a relief,

760
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:34,680
that you don't take after your mother.

761
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:42,020
Alright, fine. Pick a few JB subsidiaries that you want. I'll give it to you on top of Cloud 9.

762
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,390
I'm about to cry from thankfulness.

763
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:46,800
Why do you think they say it's good to have a sister? But...

764
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,970
you don't have time to take your time in choosing. Hurry up and pick.

765
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:53,620
Whether you'll go through a material witness investigation,

766
01:05:53,620 --> 01:06:00,040
or be imprisoned for Eom Hye Rin's murder.

767
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:04,450
Mirror, do you know who I am?

768
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:07,050
 Yes. You are Agent Kim Jae Ha. 

769
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:09,890
Good.

770
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:12,590
Then can you answer my questions?

771
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:17,240
 Yes. Agent Kim Jae Ha has access to me. 

772
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,580
Are there any restrictions to my access?

773
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,800
 There is not. 

774
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,870
Then are you okay with whatever subject I ask about?

775
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,760
 Of course. 

776
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,300
Even if it's about Choi Yoo Jin?

777
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,480
 Of course. 

778
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:49,590
Why did you call me so early in the morning?

779
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:52,620
If I have to go to the police station,

780
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:56,450
I think going as a voluntary appearance.

781
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:59,290
would look the best.

782
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:02,860
Well, I suppose so.

783
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:13,100
In that place, I'd like it if you were by my side.

784
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:19,920
Why? Do you need someone to hold onto you?

785
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:26,030
Do you want me to send my body guards?

786
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,870
They're here!

787
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,820
Please give us a statement!

788
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:51,310
Please give us a comment on the rumors!

789
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:56,080
Please give us a statement!

790
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,400
Please answer our questions!

791
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,250
Please give us a comment on the rumors!

792
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:04,020
Please give us a statement!

793
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:07,380
Please tell us about the rumors!

794
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:10,290
There are rumors about Go Anna. Are they true?

795
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:13,090
Say what you think about the rumors.

796
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:27,340
Reporters... and citizens of this country...
   

797
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:31,560
I am deeply sorry

798
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,660
for not being honest with you throughout this time.

799
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:43,780
Everything is a result of my incompetence.

800
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,930
Yes.

801
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,670
Anna is...

802
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,220
my daughter.

803
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:16,560
Anna is a child born of my heart.

804
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,980
So she's not biological? What is she saying?

805
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,630
Anna is...

806
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,950
my husband Jang Se Joon's

807
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,830
biological daughter.

808
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:50,010
Are you saying that Go Anna is the daughter of Assemblyman Jang Se Joon?

809
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:58,350
 "Barcelona Angel, Go Anna, Revealed to be Assemblyman Jang Se Joon's biological daughter..." 

810
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:05,530
Is this true? Give us a statement!

811
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:12,470
