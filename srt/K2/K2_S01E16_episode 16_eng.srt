♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

 Jo Seong Ha

00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,730
  Look out! Look out! Look out! 

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,970
 The K2 

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,310
Promise me that you will protect Anna to the end.

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,880
I will.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,570
Niece.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,700
If it's brother-in-law's child, then wouldn't she obviously be my niece?

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,910
You can't.   
  

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,500
With what plan did you take Anna from Choi Yoo Jin's grasp? 
  

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,440
I know the big secret that Anna is brother-in-law's biological daughter.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,960
So if Anna is by my side, my sister won't be able to take JB easily.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,150
All this time I think I was mistaken.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,800
- You should've killed her. 
 - You know, right?

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,540
 

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,530
 I'll be protecting you from now on. 

22
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,960
 I'm going to make sure no one messes with you. 

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,500
Jae Ha, it the situation gets dire,  
  

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,660
you can just come back.

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,700
Be sure to return alive. That's an order.

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,300
I can't. I can't. 
  

27
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,360
 He can't kill Park Gwan Soo because he is alone. 

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,800
Anna. We, later ... shall we live in Spain? 
  

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's go.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,900
It's about the time to set up a trap. 
 -  

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,900
- A trap?  
 - Yes.

32
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,480
I think I can smell oil from this.

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,870
Not the smell of oil, but probably the smell of blood.

34
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,300
 You have to get close more and more to Park Kwan Su 

35
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,240
From among the tips I collected over time about Eom Hye Rin,

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,210
this one seems to be something.

37
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,400
Don't you remember me? We met that night. 
  

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,600
in your mother's room.

39
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,330
Oh! Do you not remember me because I shined my flashlight in your eyes?

40
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,680
Uncle- this tabloid report, did you really put it out there?

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,150
We have to do this so that my sister will get taken in for witness testimony in the investigation

42
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,910
and during that questioning, there will be an investigation on the alleged murder.

43
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,280
While someone else's house is on fire, it looks like this house is having a party.

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,940
Yes.

45
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,810
Anna is ...

46
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,500
my daughter.

47
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,600
Eom Hye Rin showed up to me with young Anna.  

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,300
 She notified me that Anna is my biological daughter. 

49
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,200
Ever since then, to me and my wife

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,580
the days have been like a continuing nightmare. 
  

51
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,100
What?

52
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,400
Evidence on Kumargate?
  

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,180
I think they are very close to finding it.

54
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,290
How did you know about that?

55
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,760
It's as planned. Manager Ju.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,800
- Yes? 
 - Please back Jae Ha up

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,330
Please surveil one doctor for me. Totally obviously.

58
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,390
Our target is in possession of some important data evidence hidden somewhere in this hospital.

59
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,970
hidden somewhere in this hospital.

60
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,590
Because we need to make him nervous enough to check the hidden material himself.

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,010
 The fate of our company is in  your hands.  
  

62
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,770
No.

63
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,700
Don't die, Jae Ha. 
  

64
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,320
I will take back Cloud Nine.
   

65
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,730
And you just have to retrieve Seok Han's memory card. Isn't that enough?

66
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:42,010
Why do all people assume the Cloud 9 is located on the 9th floor?

67
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,500
By the way, Anna, aren't you really going to leave?

68
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,260
With his current condition, Jae Ha won't be able to protect you, don't you think so?

69
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,970
Anna,

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,400
it's the time for you to protect Jae Ha.

71
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,800
I will save Jae Ha. You just leave. 
  

72
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,040
I will leave.

73
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,960
What's the occasion;.. for you to come all this way?
  

74
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,020
Ah, I came to set up a bomb.

75
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,660
- I'm sorry about this. 
 - You dirty traitors. What are you going to do?

76
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,050
 I have to catch Park Gwan Soo. 

77
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,210
 Miss has been kidnapped? 

78
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,390
Let's make the exchange there.

79
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,900
I am on my way.  

80
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,080
 If you want to keep your girlfriend alive, give up the memory card. 

81
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,130
- You bastard. 
- Don't be mad, uh?

82
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,700
Let's t-talk it over.

83
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,140
L-Let's t-talk it over, uh?

84
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,320
Where is Anna?

85
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,830
Anna went to where is it... c-cloud 9. She went there, so you should go there quickly.

86
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,100
- You drive. 
- Right now?

87
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,180
N-Now... we can't go there.

88
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,040
Why is that?

89
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,350
That... over there ...

90
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,100
Okay.

91
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,170
Bomb.... the bomb will go off soon.

92
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,790
If the bomb goes off, everyone there will die.

93
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,060
Then stop it.

94
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,460
That'll be nice, but...

95
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,320
Once it's activated, it can't be s-stopped.

96
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,780
Even Chairman Choi doesn't know about it.

97
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,220
Damn it.

98
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,320
No!!!

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,770
  Timing and Subtitles by the K2 Minions @ viki  

100
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,580
No.

101
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,860
No.

102
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,610
Don't you think you'd give up about now?

103
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,560
Now that I have Seok Han's memory card. 
   Final Episode 

104
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,940
Okay, congratulation. 
   Final Episode 

105
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,320
So, I've lost everything, right?

106
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,980
You are right, Noona. I guess I must die here today.

107
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,590
With this bomb.

108
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,500
Let me ask you one thing.

109
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,390
What is it?

110
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,370
I didn't see JB on the consortium list.

111
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,170
So how did you get involved with Kumar gate?

112
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:23,290
Ah, that? It was a trap to get consortium members and my father-in-law originally.

113
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:28,230
You know Seok Han was my fellow alumnus right? And he was in Iraq to volunteer on a medical team.

114
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,540
It happens that he was treating Abdul Omar, the most powerful political figure in Kumar.

115
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:39,330
So I asked him to set us up, and I had my father-in-law to come up with consortium members for the Korean side.

116
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,960
And you took yourself out of the consortium list?

117
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,420
Of course. Because I was going to blow up that story someday.

118
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:55,110
But Seok Han got clever and put my name on it as a safety precaution.

119
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:04,900
That's too bad. The pecking order in the finance world could've been changed.

120
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,880
Anyway, you were in the center of Kumar gate.

121
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,640
You can say that.

122
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,640
But how did you know? Without seeing what's in the memory card.

123
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,230
My Mirror's prediction.   Along with Kim Jae Ha. 

124
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:29,220
Wow! I am even more coveting the Mirror now.

125
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,580
Now. Let's wrap up our pleasant conversation between siblings here, and

126
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,720
take your bomb and leave.

127
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,600
Ah, right. Before you leave, sign the waiver to give up your shares of stocks.

128
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,520
I don't want to.

129
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,050
Then I will have nothing. What's the point of living? Let's just die here together.

130
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,100
Do you think dying is that easy?

131
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,690
Let us out! Let us out!

132
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,230
Just as I said.

133
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,640
Now, what should I do? Should I open the door?

134
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,780
They are about to get panicked and they'll do anything.

135
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,240
Do you want me to teach you what's harder than dying?

136
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,150
 Chief Kim is on the line. 

137
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,710
Take it.

138
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,070
Yes, Madam. We took control of the lobby.

139
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,520
Is that right? Well done.

140
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:23,510
But we still have remnants scattered in the building, so it'll take more time to chase them out.

141
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,930
Okay, understood.

142
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,380
Take your time.

143
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,490
- Hold on Madam. 
- Chief Kim, we got a big problem.

144
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,620
Anna is in this building.

145
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,790
 What are you talking about? 

146
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,310
Anna is running from the bad guys in this building right now.

147
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,900
 What? 

148
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,400
Why is Anna here?

149
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,660
Chief Kim, Miss Anna was dragged out by the cops just before the plane took off.

150
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,750
I suspect this is Park Gwan Soo's work.

151
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,870
What?

152
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,910
 And I got a call from Jae Ha. 

153
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,050
 He told me Miss was taken to here, so we rushed coming here. 

154
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,860
Find her fast. They are going to use her as a hostage.

155
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,900
Everybody look for Anna except the guys to take care the remnants!

156
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,680
Yeah.

157
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,330
At least she is on the run, thankfully.

158
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,770
Yes, Assemblyman. We are in the JSS building, but lost Assemblyman Jang's daughter.

159
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,670
What bastard?! Does Assemblyman Jang knows that?

160
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,170
No. Since she doesn't have a phone, I doubt she made a contact.

161
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,320
So why are you calling me now, you fu**ing bastard?! Go find her, hurry!

162
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,190
Understood.

163
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,330
Just in case, if Assemblyman Jang calls, drag a bit more time--

164
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,940
Hey!!! Don't worry about that and find her quickly bastard!!

165
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,790
Jae Ha is on his way there, so what are we going to do?!

166
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,590
Get off the phone and go find her, bastard! Ah seriously...

167
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,830
F**king ass****!

168
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,600
Damn it!

169
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,830
If... Jang Se Joon finds out about this... oh my head...

170
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,840
Oh my head...my head.

171
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,770
Since my Brother-in-law is a human being,

172
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,420
don't you think he'll give up Seok Han's memory card if Anna is taken as a hostage?

173
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,930
Not sure... do you think that'll work out the way you want?

174
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,190
I almost stopped the bomb for nothing. Tell them to come in.

175
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,430
I'll just take this space until my guys arrive.

176
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,140
If my guys don't come, then I'll stop it then.

177
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,610
Your guys?

178
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:58,090
Okay. I guess it's about time for them to go now.

179
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,060
I'll have my guys come down.

180
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,520
Hey, you all, Park Gwan Soo's henchmen.

181
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,790
Thanks for waiting for a long time.

182
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll activate the elevator, so you all can leave.

183
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,780
Chief Kim. The bastards on the elevator, chase them out the door.

184
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,150
 Leave your weapons. 

185
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,360
Chief Kim, what happened?

186
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,360
It was once conquered by Park Gwan Soo's gang but we are in the process of taking it back.

187
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,230
- How about Anna? 
- She is inside the building.

188
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,330
We don't know where she is yet but soon we will find her.

189
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:28,010
Then, my Anna is being chased by that kind of bastards right now?

190
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,070
Damn it.

191
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,790
Please quickly come into Cloud 9 with Manager Ju.

192
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,630
What? I need to find Anna first-

193
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,580
Aren't you going to trade her with the memory card?

194
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,690
You and the memory card should be in a safe place first.

195
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,510
 So that we can think of trading for Anna with it or now. If you are captured, even Anna won't be safe. 

196
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,280
 Please come in quickly. 

197
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,050
They will bring Anna here as soon as they find her.

198
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,940
Chief Kim, Escort Assemblyman and Manager Ju to here quickly.

199
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,590
 Yes. Ma'am. 

200
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,330
Damn it.

201
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,860
Jae Ha.

202
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,370
Gosh, Jae Ha. How can you be in this shape....?

203
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,340
- Hurry, hurry to the infirmary room.
- Where are you going, you bastard?

204
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,970
Hey, where is Anna?

205
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,500
Where is Anna, I asked?

206
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,990
We are looking for her at the moment.

207
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,830
Damn it.

208
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,320
Jae Ha.

209
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,220
There is only one exit. She couldn't get out of here for sure. Find her!

210
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,460
I got her!

211
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,530
No. Those bastards will rush to here.

212
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,160
Jae Ha.

213
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,160
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

214
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,420
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

215
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,420
Let go!

216
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,990
Let go of this!

217
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,190
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

218
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,310
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

219
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,190
Oh, my. Jae Ha.

220
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,210
Let me go. Let go of me. Jae Ha. Jae Ha.

221
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,290
Don't do stupid things. Then, she will die.

222
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,980
Stay still, f**k.

223
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,210
 Freeze? 

224
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,440
Got her. Cover the boiler room.

225
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,230
 Sit down. 

226
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,860
It was gun shots. It's from the basement! Hurry up to go there!

227
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,710
Yes.

228
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,140
Jae Ha.

229
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,370
Jae Ha.

230
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,640
Jae Ha, are you okay?

231
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,740
Come back to your senses, Jae Ha.

232
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,790
Anna. We need to get out of here.

233
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,880
I got it. Please come to your senses.

234
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,300
Are you here, Brother-in-law?

235
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,520
How about the memory card?

236
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,960
You stay here and wait. Manager Ju, you go out to defend the attack from the Park Gwan Soo's side.

237
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,670
Understood.

238
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,960
Mirror, turn it off.

239
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:55,090
This is how Cloud 9 looks like.

240
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:00,060
Why don't you hand me over the memory card now?

241
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,350
You want to get this from me?

242
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,530
I am sorry but I can't give this to you because I have to save Anna.

243
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:14,250
Then, becoming the President will come to an end.

244
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,810
I can't help it, even if that happens.

245
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,090
Even though you will lose everything?

246
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,730
I don't care.

247
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,810
Jeez, we are running out of time, you know?

248
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:36,770
Are you really giving up the President's position just because of your daughter?

249
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,530
I am not sure about it clearly.

250
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,480
The reason I made up my mind to be the President was

251
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,660
because I want to be stronger than you so that I can destroy you completely.

252
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,930
Oh, now you know how to talk harshly to me?

253
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,050
You should have acted this way a little earlier.

254
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,780
If you did, I would have considered you with a different point of view.

255
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,590
But still, it won't change anything

256
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,680
about my animosity towards you.

257
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,820
That could be right.

258
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:25,520
But the truth is I didn't kill Eom Hye Rin.

259
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,650
I didn't order to kill her, either.

260
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,690
Just because this is in my hand, are you pretending to be defeated?

261
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,570
No way.

262
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,290
Inside here, taking that thing from your hand

263
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,130
is easier than taking a candy from a little child.

264
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:03,920
Then, why have you been pretending that you killed Eom Hye Rin so far?

265
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:12,090
Would it because I was afraid of you leaving me?

266
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,430
No.

267
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:23,540
Perhaps, that was because

268
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,540
I was afraid to confirm and admit that I made a mistake in choosing you.

269
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:35,730
Until the very end to others, no, to my late father,

270
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,910
I wanted to prove I made the right choice.

271
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,620
Even if it was a wrong choice I made,

272
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,260
I wanted to prove that I could make it right by myself.

273
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,580
Although you pretended to be smart by yourself,

274
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:01,090
it turns out that you are very stupid.

275
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,290
You're right.

276
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,750
I was so stupid.

277
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:19,950
Because as for my happiness, I didn't need to prove that to others.

278
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:26,190
Then, I didn't need to live like this. Like me,

279
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,580
like you, either.

280
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:38,020
However, we already have lived like this for this long.

281
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,720
I am sorry

282
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,560
for making you live this way as well.

283
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,220
Sorry?

284
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:22,900
Did you just say sorry?

285
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,690
Hold it a little.

286
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:43,030
I will take good care of Jae Ha. You have to go to Cloud 9 quickly.

287
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,510
No way. Who's letting you be bossy around me?

288
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,460
I was! Get her.

289
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,350
What is it? Let me go. Let go of me. Jae Ha.

290
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,100
Jae Ha. Let me go. Let go of me. Jae Ha!

291
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,420
Madam. We found Anna.

292
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,470
How is she?

293
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,550
- She's fine. We are going down now.
- Jae Ha!

294
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:05,140
Jae Ha! Let me go, I said!

295
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,800
Happy?

296
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:18,550
Mirror. Call Chairman Park of Jin Han Company.

297
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,780
Let me borrow that.

298
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,790
Have you been well, In-law?

299
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,860
 For the people who don't believe I have the memory card, 

300
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,660
 the account numbers for your tax shelters 

301
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,370
 I am texting to each of you. 

302
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,670
 Please verify it. 

303
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,470
You don't have to go to this extent. We have no doubt anyway.

304
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:11,750
Then, even though Assemblyman Park Gwan Soo has the same data, he may not be able to publicize.

305
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,910
But you know well that I could publicize it.

306
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,230
In 10 minutes,

307
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,620
if Park Gwan Soo's cop henchmen remains in my building,

308
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:29,030
 I'll start revealing Cayman SPC accounts to the media that I showed you earlier. 

309
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,870
 Ah, please verify with the President as well. 

310
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,300
See if he got my text.

311
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,790
  Then... 

312
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,510
It's been a while, Anna.

313
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,110
Noona. Open this door.

314
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,290
What are you doing? Hurry and open it!

315
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,340
Mirror, open it.

316
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,680
Noona. You didn't know I'd carry a gun?

317
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,640
Um. That sort of item ...

318
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,780
I thought was used only by the lowly underlings.

319
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:04,550
That's right. You know my origin is a bit vulgar, right?

320
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,470
Ah, you two, don't stand there and come sit down.

321
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,310
And you give me the memory card.

322
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,880
No. Mirror the elevator--

323
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,420
- Stop it. 
  - Elevator is deactivated. 

324
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,120
No, no.

325
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
What the heck did you...

326
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,750
Brother-in-law, give the memory card.

327
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,850
Unless you want Anna to die as well.

328
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,050
What? So... you want to evacuate my guys now?

329
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:02,060
Assemblyman. Frankly, they are not your guys.

330
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,090
They are a special force team in the police department.

331
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:08,890
Besides, I have many special force team members slaughtered already for this deployment.

332
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,320
So how can I send more of them?

333
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,820
My neck is barely hanging now.

334
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,170
I see that you got a word from the high-ups.

335
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,990
Yeah? T-T-That isn't it, Party Leader.

336
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,750
If you'd put a word to the high-ups,

337
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,700
I may be able to work something out once more.

338
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,240
Understood. Stand by.

339
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,980
Yeah, Assemblyman Park.

340
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,070
Did Choi Yoo Jin tell you to evacuate the guys?

341
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,770
Indeed you are quick to catch on things.

342
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,350
Did she tell you again

343
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,310
that I could never reveal it?

344
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,490
It's possible that both of you can reveal it.

345
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:09,080
But, don't you think it'll be you getting hurt?

346
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,700
Along with you guys.

347
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,790
Time will tell.

348
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:21,360
Now you have 10 minutes.

349
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,710
 The bomb in cloud 9 now won't stop. 

350
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,340
 In 10 minutes, Jang Se Joon, 

351
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,500
 Choi Yoo Jin, Choi Seong Won in there 

352
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,390
and Kim Seok Han's evidence

353
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,420
all of them will disappear from this world.

354
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,620
After that, the evidence of Kumar,

355
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,510
I'll be the only one holding it.

356
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,860
 And I'll be only candidate left in the majority party as well. 

357
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,580
 Do you get what I am saying? 

358
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,400
I am curious as to see what kind of gasps will come out of your mouths in 10 minutes.

359
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,850
How can we be of help?

360
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,410
Cut off all the power to JSS

361
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,850
and the communication lines to the outside immediately.

362
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,720
That'll be our life line for me and you guys.

363
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,190
Ten minutes will suffice. Cut it off immediately!

364
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,690
Jae Ha, you can't move!

365
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,190
- You all have to leave immediately. 
 - Why?

366
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,760
A bomb will go off at cloud 9.

367
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,480
Hurry.

368
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,780
Um Manager Ju.

369
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:10,730
What? The bomb won't stop?

370
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:15,510
Yeah. It seems that Park Gwan Soo deceived Chairman Choi.

371
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,180
You must leave that place quickly.

372
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,510
Park Gwan Soo, this son of a bitch!

373
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,300
Noona. Noona, you have to activate the elevator. We don't have much time.

374
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,430
Mirror, Mirror! Activate the elevator, uh?

375
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,080
Mirror only listens to me.

376
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,360
Noona, you have to go to the hospital, uh?

377
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,650
Hurry and tell it. Noona, we don't have time. Noona!

378
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,720
You brazen bastard.

379
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,770
Mirror, ele---

380
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,070
 The power from the outside is cut off. 

381
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,680
 Temporary power is on. 

382
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,850
What?

383
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,510
- What about the elevator? 
-  It's deactivated. 

384
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,450
Then the communication, too?

385
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,000
 Yes. 

386
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,330
Congratulations.

387
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,000
It must be the  doings of your guys.

388
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,090
Don't worry.

389
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:16,150
Your guys will come to rescue you.

390
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:26,110
Anna. Would you come here to hold this for a little?

391
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,550
I'll go out there and check things out.

392
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,760
Anna?

393
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,640
Human beings should know shame.

394
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,630
Forget it.

395
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,700
Don't do it.

396
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,900
Congratulations.

397
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,260
Your wish came true.

398
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,380
Don't talk too much, or you will bleed more.

399
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,910
At this rate,

400
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,100
I will end up dying.

401
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,500
Right. Your mom was dying as well

402
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,050
at that time.

403
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,400
When I got there.

404
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,550
It was already too late.

405
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,570
But, I...

406
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,910
had a father just like you.

407
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,050
The funny thing about father figures was...

408
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,290
when you need them, they are not around you.

409
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,410
But when you don't need them, they tend to come forward.

410
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,870
My father knew about your mom's existence

411
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,310
and he made a move I didn't want.

412
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:03,320
Even though I tried hard to stop him...but in the end...

413
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,980
he ordered...

414
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,450
his henchman to kill your mom.

415
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,290
For his daughter.

416
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,760
Was it Master Song?

417
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,330
I see you knew that already.

418
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:28,320
Right. It was him.

419
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,970
 I am sorry. 

420
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:03,730
 Mom. Mom? 

421
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,210
 Mom. Mom? 

422
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,130
After I found out my father ordered

423
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,330
such a dirty thing, I rushed there.

424
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,450
But it was too late already.

425
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:51,010
And I knew Master Song was holding you...

426
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:58,570
who was young behind the door.

427
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,390
But I couldn't make myself turn around.

428
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,490
Because I was...

429
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,200
afraid to see your face.

430
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:23,380
And when I was turning around to get out,

431
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,490
your mom asked me to save her.

432
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,590
 My...Anna... 

433
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:46,090
I was, for a short time, for a very short time,

434
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,490
hesitating to call 911.

435
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,440
However,

436
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,270
I couldn't make a call.

437
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,390
 Please let me live. 

438
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,500
 I am sorry. 

439
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,450
 Love is meant not to be shared. 

440
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:21,230
And then, I turned around heartlessly.

441
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,390
I might have saved her.

442
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,210
It's right I killed your mom.

443
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,230
And ever since that,

444
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:51,010
I had lived like my father.

445
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,100
No,

446
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,490
even worse than the way he lived.

447
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,370
On the day of your mom's death,

448
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,930
I was bewitched...

449
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,150
by the devil who controlled me ever since.

450
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,520
Yes.

451
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:31,020
So, release that hand now.

452
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,180
I am...

453
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,800
your enemy who killed your mom.

454
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,370
What are you planning to do?

455
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:06,350
The time is running out. I have to get down as soon as possible.

456
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,740
Ah, please give that to me.

457
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,790
Hey, follow me. Let's get down to the lowest level.

458
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:13,620
That's the closet to Cloud 9.

459
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,260
Ah, Manager Ju, go and bring more people.

460
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,650
To lift up people from the bottom.

461
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,440
Team Leader Seo, send the support team in.

462
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,420
This is the end.

463
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,800
Geez, it's much deeper than I expected.

464
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,540
Master, please stay here for now.

465
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,120
I need help to lift people from the bottom later.

466
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,160
- Jae Ha.  
 - When I give you a signal, pull the rope straight up a bit.

467
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,860
Okay.

468
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,490
Take care.

469
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:37,070
Gosh, that punk is really fearless.

470
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,740
Jeez, Choi Yoo Jin.

471
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:34,670
Hey.

472
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,550
You all have to...

473
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,230
Jae Ha, Jae Ha.

474
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:56,720
Whoa, you are showing your true color finally.

475
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,840
Let's us go up first. Anna.

476
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,700
Let's go.

477
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,750
I don't want to. Let go of me. Let me go.

478
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,880
Hey!

479
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:17,900
Anna will get hurt.

480
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:23,570
Fine, Kim Jae Ha. Send them up first. And...

481
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,800
my wife needs something to lift her up.

482
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,740
Did you hear him?

483
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,390
Guide me.

484
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,390
It will be too heavy for two people, right?

485
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,200
You guys should come up after me. Hey, pull me up quickly!

486
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,300
No. Send her up first.

487
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,310
I don't have that much, damn it.

488
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,590
Jae Ha!

489
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:10,650
Hey! Lift me up quickly!

490
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:18,270
Jae Ha! Don't move.

491
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,610
Don't move, I said.

492
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,620
No. No!

493
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,130
How about Miss Anna?

494
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,270
If you want to save yourselves, just get out of here!

495
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,630
- Only three minutes left. 
- What?

496
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,910
- What? 
- What did you do? 
- What the hell were you doing?

497
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,460
Step aside! F**k you!

498
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,710
What are we going to do?

499
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:57,150
Damn it!

500
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:59,270
What should we do now?

501
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:02,610
Do you... have guns?

502
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,530
- Yes. 
- Yes. 
- Yes.

503
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:09,540
Wait for a minute. I will give you a signal.

504
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,890
- Cut the cable then.
- Cable? Cable?

505
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:19,030
- Got it.
- I need to go inside.

506
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,340
Hold on to me.

507
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,990
You have to leave here now.

508
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,780
Jae Ha.

509
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,240
We don't have enough time. You have to leave here quickly.

510
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,150
Forget it. It's too late.

511
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,110
We need to get out quickly! We don't have time to waste!

512
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,720
Come on. Let's go.

513
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:59,590
Do I... have a place to go any more?

514
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:07,610
Now... I want to rest a little.

515
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:20,260
Leave here with Chief Kim.

516
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,150
I am hopeless.

517
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,770
Hurry up and leave.

518
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,610
Save Anna.

519
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,860
Assemblyman, get into the elevator with Chief Kim.

520
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,730
- Now the elevator is...
- Hurry up! Time is almost up!

521
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,110
Just go.

522
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,310
Go.

523
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:27,950
Even though it won't go up, it can still go down.

524
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,850
Under the elevator, there is a place called a safe space-

525
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:37,380
if you can make it to there, even with the explosion,

526
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,540
since the shock only goes upwards, so there is a chance of surviving.

527
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:44,210
- Is that true?
- It's just my theory. But even if it's not, we have no other choice.

528
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,860
Hold on a little longer. A little longer.

529
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,080
Hurry up.

530
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,040
Hey, stand by!

531
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:56,710
Cut off the cable now!

532
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,310
Now is the time! Cut it off!

533
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,460
Dad, Dad, where are you going?

534
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,190
What are you doing?

535
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:30,820
The chance of saving you is too low at this situation. I need to reduce the explosion shock.

536
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,400
What are you planning to do?

537
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,140
Anna, you have lived well even without your dad so far.

538
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:43,030
You can continue doing that even in the future.

539
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:50,540
In fact, as for me,

540
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,880
the world will be better without me.

541
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:00,400
Please take good care of  my daughter Anna.

542
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,260
Dad, no! No!

543
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,970

 Timing and Subtitles Brought To You By The K2 Minions Team @ Viki.com 

557
00:54:55,430 --> 00:55:00,060
Why on earth have you come back?

558
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:05,750
I will take this inside.

559
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,860
In that way, we can reduce the explosion force even a little.

560
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:36,350
I heard this glass box is very strong. Is that right?

561
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:04,570
Get out quickly so that I can close the door.

562
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:16,590
The door ...close it.

563
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,240
Mirror,

564
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,490
close the door.

565
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,390
Firmly.

566
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,870
On the way to the underworld,

567
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:01,740
let's be friends together.

568
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,220
We look like

569
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,520
lovebirds like this.

570
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,210
I know, right?

571
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,310
Are you alright? Are you alright? Are you alright?

572
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:57,180
What happened?

573
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,950
K2, K2!

574
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:09,290
 K2, respond! This is Team Leader. 

575
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:12,760
- K2, K2! This is Team Leader.
- please.

576
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,620
Respond!

577
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:20,080
This is Team Leader. K2, respond!

578
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,690
K2.

579
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,250
K2!

580
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,210
This is Team Leader.

581
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,030
Jae Ha.

582
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:41,000
Please respond.

583
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,160
Please!

584
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,730
Please.

585
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:58,580
 This is K2, this is K2. 

586
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,840
 I  am responding, over. 

587
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:05,200
Miss, are you okay? How about K2?

588
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:14,180
 Take us out quickly. 

589
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:17,850
 I am in pain, over. 

590
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:20,460
Thanks, God!

591
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,570
He made it!

592
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:27,230
He survived!

593
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:31,970
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

594
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:35,350
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

595
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:38,570
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

596
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:49,340
♫  Look out! Look out! Look out!  ♫

597
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,330
This one here.

598
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,470
Witness, do you swear to testify only the truth

599
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:17,620
about the case of Blackstone's slaughter of non-combatant civilians?

600
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:28,570
Yes, I swear.

601
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:30,590
Ay, so good!

602
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,240
It's going to be cold.

603
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,210
Gosh, what a sight.

604
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:48,450
Now what will happen to us?

605
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:52,570
She inherited everything and moved into the Madam's house.

606
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:54,750
But may she call us in again?

607
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:59,530
Ever since the funeral for Assemblyman and Madam, we haven't seen Miss at all.

608
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:03,530
You don't think she'll act like she doesn't know us, do you?
-No way!

609
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:07,620
I... only need you.

610
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:11,080
I only have you guys.

611
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:43,310
Then, Anna is the only heir for Jang Se Joon and Choi Yoo Jin, isn't she?

612
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,830
Yes, she is.

613
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,940
Then, how about the Pyeongchang Scholarship Foundations?

614
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:54,780
Yes. But without Cloud 9, she won't have that much power.

615
01:02:54,780 --> 01:03:00,130
But since she has the memory card which is more dangerous for us.

616
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,040
She shouldn't do any silly thing with that.

617
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,460
No way.

618
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:12,610
As for the power, once you taste it, it's not easy to give it up.

619
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:17,360
Choi Yoo Jin used to be a girl with a naive and pure heart one time, wasn't she?

620
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:23,260
They all turn into witches from girls like that.

621
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:03,330
No, no matter what,

622
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:08,460
what can a young kid without parents possibly do?

623
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:13,960
Just wait and see. She will contact us for a negotiation.

624
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,920
Yes, yes. Just relax and wait.

625
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,550
Yes.

626
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:24,810
Let's go.

627
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,560
You must've suffered.

628
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:44,590
Oh, oh, I'm saved! I'm saved!

629
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,930
I thought I was going to die.

630
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,640
Hey, hey!! What is this?!?

631
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:31,950
Stop, please.

632
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:53,430
I never dreamed that I would be forced to take my own life.

633
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,290
What can you do when the world had been changed over night?

634
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:36,620
Did you testify well?

635
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,090
Yes.

636
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:41,820
How about your identification? Was it restored?

637
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:47,580
Yeah, now we can go wherever we want to.

638
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,300
That worked out well.

639
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:52,820
How about you? Was it fun today?

640
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:58,140
No. I tried everything how Choi Yoo Jin lived.

641
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:02,630
But there was nothing fun. I don't know how she lived.

642
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,120
Why don't we eat first?

643
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:12,280
You like eating this, right? You come here all the time.

644
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,910
How is it? Yummy?

645
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:20,120
Anna, won't you really regret?

646
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,580
No.

647
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:29,310
You really need to think carefully. With just one click,

648
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:32,900
you have to give up every power you got from Choi Yoo Jin.

649
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,680
Do you know that?

650
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:39,590
Why are you acting this way? I am really having hard time with Chief Kim's nagging.

651
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:45,260
Fine. Now all you need to do is press the enter key.

652
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,430
- This one?
- Yes.

653
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:52,850
Do you know what will happen once you press this? The political world and the finance world

654
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:55,680
are all in cahoots...

655
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,290
 Sending email 

656
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:05,460
Gosh, what did you...?

657
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:10,240
Things like this... this kind of historic moment has to be enjoyed little by little. With me!

658
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,690
I don't care. I don't want to enjoy such things.

659
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:17,950
Whoa, you run wild.

660
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,220
What? What! Huh?

661
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,280
Why?

662
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,550
Look at you. You are always like this.

663
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:46,140
For everything, you don't care how I feel. Only care for your --

664
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:53,730
♫  You are going away.  ♫

665
01:09:54,520 --> 01:10:01,290
♫  There are still many words which couldn't be said  ♫

666
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:07,390
♫  They couldn't be expressed to the end.  ♫

667
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:11,070
♫   Are my feeling showing?  ♫

668
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:14,840
♫   I'm still like this.  ♫

669
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:19,270
♫  Just looking forward to see you  ♫

670
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:25,030
 Anna, by the way, don't you feel little disappointed? 

671
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:26,470
 What about? 

672
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:29,040
 About losing your mom's reputation. 

673
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:31,700
 No. 

674
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,490
 Because, instead, I got my dad. 

675
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:42,750
 - Jae Ha,
- Yes? 

676
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:45,370
 I love you. 

677
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:47,030
 I know. 

678
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,250
 - Hey, Kim Jae Ha! 
- Why? 

679
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,250
 Then, what's your real name? 

680
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,840
 Me? 

681
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,740
 In fact, my name is.... 

682
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:06,870
♫   I can't help it.  ♫

683
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:14,450
♫  I love you, I love you  ♫

684
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:18,170
♫  Even today, love you.  ♫

685
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:29,120
♫   I couldn't give you much  ♫

686
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:37,020
♫  This was all in the end  ♫

687
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:43,330
♫   Now you are leaving far away  ♫

688
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:47,090
♫   I can't even hold you  ♫

689
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:50,810
♫   But still, as ever  ♫

690
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:55,160
♫  I want you   ♫

691
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:05,560
♫  Love you,  even though I forget it and forget it  ♫

692
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:13,310
♫   even though I try to end it  ♫

693
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:19,480
♫   no matter how hard you try to erase you from me  ♫
