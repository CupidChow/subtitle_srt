- What happened? 
- What's going on?

18
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,250
 Is this Uhm Hye Rin's daughter? 

19
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,800
 What is the cause of death for Uhm Hye Rin? 

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,600
 Is it true Uhm Hye Rin committed suicide?

 Your name's Anna, right?
 ♫  I want to run into the wild forest  ♫

 You have to say yes.  
 ♫  I want to run into the wild forest  ♫

33
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,790
 You can't do that.  
 ♫  I want to run into the wild forest  ♫

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,720
 Fine.

♫  And never come back again  ♫

36
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,540
 I don't know.  
♫  And never come back again  ♫

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,930
 Geez!  You said something earlier. Tell the truth. 

38
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,590
 Detective, if you are going to behave like that, please leave. 

39
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,960
 Doctor, when it comes to the crime investigation, a preliminary investigation is the most critical. 

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,070
 Especially for children, they tend to lose their memories easily. 

41
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,800
 If we do not record their initial testimony properly, we may have a hard time getting even testimonies from the children later on! 

42
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,100
♫  Are you scared?  ♫

43
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,190
♫  What are you afraid of?  ♫

44
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,600
♫  Be hopeful  ♫

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,550
♫  And just sleep peacefully  ♫

46
00:03:51,550 --> 00:04:00,600
♫   Lay my life for me.  ♫

49
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,200
 This child just lost her mother. To her, it means she has lost the whole world. 

50
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,160
  I had Mom killed. 

51
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,990
 What did you say?  Say again what you just said. 

52
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,480
 I killed Mom. 

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,530
 I said I killed Mom.

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:13,190
What is it?
♫  A pure girl meets  ♫

55
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,290

- Turn off, turn off, turn off the light! Turn off the light! Turn off the light!

56
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,910
♫  A wolf in the thick forest  ♫

57
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,290
- Please, get off!
- It's just that... 
♫  A wolf in the thick forest  ♫

58
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,570
She is just not moving. I don't understand. 
 ♫  And again it is an evil beast  ♫

59
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,400
♫  She does not know what fear is  ♫

60
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,250
- Look, she is my muse.
- Muse?
♫  She does not know what fear is  ♫

61
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,970
- Look at her. Please, wait.
- Leave her alone, she is fine. 
♫  And again it is an evil beast  ♫

62
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,070
You have two muses here. Let's go.
♫  And again it is an evil beast  ♫

63
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,330
Get in.
♫  And again it is an evil beast  ♫

64
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,520
Wait a moment, please.

65
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,780
♫  When it sees a beautiful flower  ♫

66
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,850
I didn't kill her.

67
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:53,640
♫  Whispering something in his ear  ♫

68
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,420
I didn't kill her.
♫  To get the more beautiful flowers  ♫

69
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,040
♫  To get the more beautiful flowers  ♫

70
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,770
It scared you to death, huh? Let's go.
♫  Without ceasing and treading in the deep forest  ♫

71
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,140
Come on, sweetie. Come on. Damned car. 
 ♫  Without ceasing and treading in the deep forest  ♫

72
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,300
Look!

73
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,730
Damned car.

74
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,960
I didn't kill her.

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,320
I didn't kill her.

 Hyejeong University 

77
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,550
 Restroom 

78
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,840
Since when did a reserved force training get so tough?

79
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,330
Weren't you aware of that?

80
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,090
Hey. The North Koreans are frantically trying to develop nuclear arms

81
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,970
all because of a reserved force.

82
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,800
- Quickly come out. 
- Okay, punk.

83
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,000
What the?  My uniform!

84
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,710
I hung them right here.

85
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,720
You are saying you lost track of the banner hanger in the end?

86
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,190
I-I-I'm sorry.

87
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,620
It can't be helped.  People live to the extent of their own ability.

88
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,800
Your ability just goes to there.

89
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,060
Yes.  You worked hard.

90
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,700
M-m-madam, I will definitely find him. Give me only a little more time.

91
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,300
Only a little ... you are saying only  little.

92
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,070
A little later... the guy might be meeting a reporter.

93
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,560
Or a little later... he could find the other candidates and fix his destiny (by selling what he witnessed).

94
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,390
Just a little more time?

95
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:03,800
I-I-I-I'm sorry.

96
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,250
Madam, this might be presumptuous, but  may I say something?

97
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,510
What you are worried about won't happen.

98
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,440
How can the security manager be so confident?

99
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,560
That guy was one of my subordinates when I was the commander of the Special Mission Battalion.

100
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,990
First, he is someone who cannot be caught through JSS's strength.

101
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:31,070
So, it's not that JSS is incompetent but his ability is  that great?

102
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,860
It may sound like an excuse, but that's a truth.

103
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,830
He was falsely accused and dishonorably discharged from the Special Mission Battalion.

104
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,770
He used to be an elite combat soldier in a PMC (private military company) called Blackstone.

105
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,250
Blackstone?  An elite mercenary?

106
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,990
- A PMC? 
 - Yes.

107
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,610
It's an internationally thriving enterprise nowadays, as an acting war mercenary company.

108
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,860
And he was the best mercenary in Iraq.

109
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,890
- Then someone may have hired that guy— 
 - That  is not possible.

110
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,260
How can you be so sure?

111
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,170
- He is a fugitive running for his life. 
 - Fugitive?

112
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,340
He became a hunted fugitive through some incident at Blackstone.

113
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,520
He's become most wanted by Interpol.

114
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,920
The rumor even said that he had gone to IS (Islamic State).

115
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,370
But it turned out that he snuck to Korea as I recognized him from checking the CCTV yesterday.

116
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:26,350
Enough. Anyway, the conclusion is that JSS can't take care of this guy according to what you said.

117
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,880
N-n-no, Ma'am! Is there anyone in the world who can't die by a gun? With my own hands, I'll definitely...!

118
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,740
Can you at least find out his location, President?

119
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,640
Pardon? Ah, I will certainly find him and—

120
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,800
- Chief Kim. 
- Yes Ma'am.

121
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,980
When you receive a report of that guy's location from President Gook, you resolve it yourself.

122
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,040
Yes, I understand.

123
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,070
Ma'am, please just give us one more chance.

124
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,780
That friend... it would be such a waste to just get rid of him.

125
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,380
Perhaps, if we could convince that friend to be our side—

126
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,340
- Manager Ju. 
 - Yes.

127
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,310
Please just be concerned about protecting the assemblyman.

128
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,990
Yesterday, I was a bit disappointed.

129
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,190
I apologize.

130
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,620
The assemblyman will come down here shortly.

131
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,990
- Yes. 
- Okay, please you two can leave now.

132
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,760
Yes, yes, please do rest, yes.

133
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,940
Drat.

134
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,500
Aigoo, why are your faces like that? Have you been scolded from the early morning?

135
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,200
Why? Because of me?

136
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,080
N-n-not at all.

137
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,240
Ah... it probably is though.

138
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,030
Straighten up your faces! This is not the first time it happened anyway.

139
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,290
How shameless he is.

140
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,680
Forget being husband and wife. If we are partners in name,

141
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,000
at times like this, shouldn't he at least say the word sorry to me?

142
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,790
Are you still...

143
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,840
saddened by these kinds of things?

144
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,710
Saddened?

145
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,920
That sign hanger is supposed to be dangerous, so be careful in taking care of him.

146
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,660
Don't worry.

147
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,980
- And... 
- And what?

148
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,800
There's just a small problem about Anna.

149
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,680
Anna? I was told she was caught last night.

150
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,200
Yes, but... something happened in the night to be concerned about.

151
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,900
What is it?

152
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,650
What is this?

153
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,340
It seems that while escaping, on the road she caught the eye of a stranger and he happened to take a picture of her.

154
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,260
- Then quickly-! 
 - But...

155
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,710
The person who uploaded the picture to the SNS is Jean Paul Lafelt. (SNS = Social Network Sites)

156
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,790
What? Jean Paul Lafe ...

157
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,850
The designer Jean Paul Lafelt?

158
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,030
Furthermore, already too many people, with the nickname 'Paul Lafelt's Angel',

159
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,170
are trying to find out her true identity.

160
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,600
No matter what happens, I will block her contact with outsiders.

161
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,430
Block it?

162
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,700
I'm hearing noises again! Why on earth are you all like this recently?!

163
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,480
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,030
How will you block it though?

165
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,790
If Paul Lafelt is searching for her, I expect the reporters and paparazzi

166
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,120
and all of Europe will be searching for her like crazy!

167
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,460
If we take this opportunity to just

168
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,770
disguise it perfectly as an accident—

169
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,750
Are you mad?

170
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,490
Anna is the only means I have to control Jang Se Joon. If something bad happens to Anna, from a bad accident or whatever,

171
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,160
do you think I will be able to control that creature Jang Se Joon?

172
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,750
I apologize.

173
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,280
Alright.

174
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,380
It would be better to put her right in front of us and watch over her.

175
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,410
Pardon?

176
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,390
Bring that child Anna right now.

177
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,490
If you bring that child back when you are already bothered with many things ...

178
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,940
The election is right around the corner. It doesn't matter how I feel now, does it?

179
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,740
Get moving immediately.

180
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,630
Yes.

181
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,170
She resembles her mother.

182
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,880
 Paul_lafelt 

183
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,060
What is the schedule today?

184
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,610
Oh, yes.  In the morning, a national parents solidarity meeting.

185
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,770
Lunch with the members of the Committee for Development of the traditional market.

186
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,520
In the afternoon, a press conference at the Press Center.

187
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,380
In the evening, a meeting with the Young Assemblymen Group. And also ...

188
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,880
You are killing me with a crazy schedule.

189
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,560
Ah yes, these are all events you must go to.

190
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,830
I understand, I understand.

191
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,810
- Manager Ju. 
 - Yes, Assemblyman?

192
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,740
Have you got cigarettes on you?

193
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,090
- We will briefly disembark in a quiet location.
 - Yes understood.

194
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,290
Aigoo, I wonder where our assemblyman goes to cause  problems.

195
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:14,290
Assemblyman, confidentiality is upheld inside this car.

196
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:18,830
And you can trust those guys as well. You may speak comfortably.

197
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,800
If that's the case, did we get backstabbed because your men weren't trustworthy before?

198
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,140
- Secretary Jeong. 
- Yes?

199
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,980
Get out of the car for a bit and take a break for a cigarette.

200
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,720
Y-yes, I understand.

201
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,070
You can understand why he was acting so sensitively like that, right?

202
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,760
Yes.

203
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,130
What's happening with Anna?

204
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,850
She returned safely.

205
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,930
I know that as well.

206
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,080
Miss Anna is the same as ever. So is her social phobia...

207
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,490
How about meeting her once?

208
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,670
You know already that I can't do that right now.

209
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,660
I'm pathetic, right? As a father...

210
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,970
- Manager Ju. 
 - Yes.

211
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,500
You, too, are thoroughly Choi Yoo Jin's side.

212
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,600
However, I am the person who will become president.

213
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,670
Of course.

214
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,440
I am the one who will appoint you to be head of security in the Blue House as well.

215
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,530
Until then, there is no other I can entrust that child to

216
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,200
except you.

217
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,300
I may not have enough paternal love towards Anna,

218
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,660
and I also know how much that child hates me.

219
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,010
Nevertheless, that child is the reason, for all these years,

220
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,010
I could not help but live as Choi Yoo Jin's puppet.

221
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,460
So go to that woman and convey my words clearly.

222
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,830
That if the hostage dies, the keeper of the hostage will also die.

223
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,340
If something bad happens to that child, everything that Choi Yoo Jin built up during her lifetime

224
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,660
will collapse in a single moment.

225
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,420
I will not relay the message.

226
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,420
Also, by all means, I will protect Anna.

227
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,110
Thank you.

228
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,240
Why is even the car now acting up? Damn it!

229
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,330
Do you know how to fix this? If you don't, then just leave us be.

230
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,880
Why don't you just call your insurance company?

231
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,620
Do you think I'd be here like this if I had insurance?

232
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,990
Then why don't you call a tow truck?

233
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,360
If I had the money to call a tow truck, I would have bought insurance.

234
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,300
So ...

235
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,730
Grandpa, hand me some gloves.

236
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,250
Do you really know what you're doing? You're not going to break it more, are you?

237
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,340
It's not like this car can get more broken, right?

238
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,430
Please give me the gloves.

239
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,790
Here you go.

240
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,250
Oh Hoobae (Junior)!

241
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,980
Oh, Sunbae (Senior).

242
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,940
We should have just met outside of work. You didn't have to come all this way to visit me.

243
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,560
It's because you are busy.

244
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,920
Ah, look at this.

245
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,610
This guy is a very bad guy.

246
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,930
I have to grab him but I have no idea where he's escaped to.

247
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:56,470
Ah, Sunbae. For something like this, you're supposed to file a report

248
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,310
and get a warrant before the police can search for him.

249
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,340
Should I call the Chief of the Civil Affairs over for you?

250
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,510
Are you crazy? If I were going to do that, why would I come all the way here?

251
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:16,500
Hoobae, what I'm offering you is some free insurance.

252
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,470
- What? 
 - As for my candidate,

253
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,690
what do you think are the chances of him becoming president?

254
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,210
Let me think.

255
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,920
Even though he's pretty popular, he's running as an independent so...

256
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,300
Right?

257
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:38,330
But the person up there  (implying the President of Korea)  thinks a little differently.

258
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,510
Candidate Jang Se Joon is probably

259
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,010
going to lose his Independent status soon.

260
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,530
So, he's going to join a party...

261
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,330
It's an absolute secret.

262
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:57,600
What do you think his chances of being elected are now?

263
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,430
With his popularity and organizational support?

264
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,920
Don't you think it's a good idea to get some insurance now?

265
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,780
How can I help you?

266
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,690
 Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 

267
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,070
Stay right there, be careful. Be careful.

268
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,430
Go.

269
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,140
Where's your lawn mower?

270
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,560
My lawn mower?

271
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,000
What do you want with my lawn mower?

272
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,840
I was going to cut some of your weeds.

273
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,020
Don't do that. Don't! I have no money.

274
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,490
I won't ask for money. Is that a shed? It must be in there.

275
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,710
I told you not to do work!

276
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,190
I'll feed you as I promised. Sleep over there tonight.

277
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,770
Leave here tomorrow.

278
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,470
It's not opening yet.

279
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,890
Just wait a bit. They'll definitely open it for us.

280
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,570
 Connecting... 

281
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,280
We're getting a signal.

282
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,160
What are you all doing?

283
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,810
Everyone, start searching.

284
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,720
Yes!

285
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,230
Excuse me.

286
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,870
Your companion probably needs to eat too.

287
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,650
She told me not to wake her until we land.

288
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,150
Ah, I see.

289
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,740
She drank too much yesterday.

290
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,260
I understand. Enjoy your meal.

291
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,650
 Get dressed, Anna. Your father is waiting for you. 

292
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,230
♬   Be good in the meantime  ♬

293
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,820
♬   Keep the door locked  ♬

294
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:24,500
♬   And be careful of the wolf  ♬

295
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,890
 Where's my father? 

296
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,540
 Drink this. It's motion sickness medicine. 

297
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,960
 Where's my father? 

298
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,000
 If you drink this, your father will come. 

299
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,950
 That's a lie. 

300
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,630
 Yeah, it's a lie. Your father is not coming anymore. 

301
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:47,280
 I want to go to my father. Take me to my father. 

302
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,470
♬   Be good in the meantime  ♬

303
00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:00,140
♬   Keep the door locked  ♬

304
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:08,270
♬   And be careful of the wolf  ♬

305
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,320
I'm sorry. This is all we have to eat.

306
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,280
We only eat to live.

307
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,880
It's okay.

308
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,570
I'm sorry for getting angry earlier.

309
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,840
I found him!

310
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,280
What? Where is he?

311
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,920
He's here.

312
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,010
- When was this? 
 - This morning.

313
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,070
However, he disappeared after he entered the bathroom.

314
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,390
He must have changed his clothes.

315
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:35,590
Track everyone who leaves from here.

316
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,550
Yes.

317
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:46,430
Yes, you punk.  Please help me to save my face (reputation).

318
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,920
 Why? 

319
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,540
 It's a minefield. Everyone, get out. 

320
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,410
 What? I can't walk. 

321
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:45,050
 Hey, listen to him. He saved my life. 

322
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,900
 Hey, we're entering a civilian territory. We have to take a detour. 

323
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,650
 I cannot walk anymore. I'm dying of pain. 

324
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,290
 We can't risk hurting civilians. 

325
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,680
 I am a civilian too! 

326
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,080
 Double. 

327
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,080
 - What? 
 - I'm going to pay you double the amount you get paid here. 

328
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,760
 Just go. 

329
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,170
 - No. 
 - Three times. 

330
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,020
 Back off. 

331
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,050
 What about you? 

332
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,380
 Hey! Go! Get out of here! 

333
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,020
 Go now! 

334
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,060
Want a sip?

335
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,730
Today is the 49th day after our son's death.  (Koreans believe one's spirit will be appointed to the special places on the 49th day after one's death.) 

336
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,750
We were on our way back from the temple earlier.  (Some people pray for the deceased on the 49th day after one's death.) 

337
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:16,830
Fruit trees are just like children. Since the caregiver was gone,

338
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,060
trees immediately turned into this mess.

339
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,590
Now I will just close down this orchard.

340
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,320
Since no one wants to buy it from me,

341
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,830
I'm going to cut all the trees down and burn them.

342
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,760
Mister,

343
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,580
could you cut all of these down for me?

344
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,340
Are you serious?

345
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,910
Yes. Cut them all down.

346
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:08,950
It's hard for me to do it by myself.

347
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,790
Okay.

348
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,860
Yeah? My heart feels lighter.

349
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:27,880
Then, please do it tomorrow. I'll give you cash in return.

350
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,490
I feel better. My heart feels relieved.

351
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:52,740
Let's all hang in there. Fighting.

352
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,510
Good, good. We must catch him for sure.

353
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,330
How are you going to catch him being this tired?

354
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:02,280
Let's keep our eyes wide open and catch him.

355
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:39,000
Yes, cut them all down.

356
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,660
President.  President.

357
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,270
We found him.

358
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,570
What? You found him?

359
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,130
You can stay here longer if you want.

360
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,910
If you insist on having me, I can stay a bit longer.

361
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,140
This is delicious.

362
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,220
This belonged to my deceased son.

363
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,740
If that doesn't bother you, you can wear it while you work.

364
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,140
It looks like it will fit me just right.

365
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,760
Thank you.

366
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,140
Grandpa, do you have any more weedwacker blades?

367
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,210
I don't think so.

368
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,210
Then, I'll go buy some more.

369
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,800
Is she feeling ill?

370
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,780
No, she just drank too much yesterday.

371
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,100
Please let me know if you need any help.

372
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,250
No. No.  What are you doing?

373
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,950
I'll ask you one more time.

374
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,800
Where is this guy?

375
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,080
I don't know. He left this morning.

376
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:41,160
I understand. If you don't know, I have no other choice.

377
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,500
W-W-What are you doing?

378
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,680
No, no! No!

379
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,730
Don't do that! Don't do that!

380
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,660
Don't. Don't.

381
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,240
Don't do that.

382
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,390
Don't.

383
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,180
Don't!

384
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,330
No!

396
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,880
Hey, who sent you?

397
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,560
I wish I could tell you such a thing.

398
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:07,830
Everybody says that.

399
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,900
It isn't personal; it's business for me.

400
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,350
We're both professionals, right?

401
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,880
I'm sorry, it's not personal for me.

402
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,450
I just have to make a living too.

403
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,700
Since you and I are professionals,

404
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,010
I'm sure you understand.

405
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,560
Even if it's not by my hands, you are already dead.

406
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,000
You're right. I was supposed to die a long time ago.

407
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,470
But, you bastard, I can understand you for trying to kill me.

408
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:50,190
What you were about to do to those elders,

409
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,830
I really can't understand you for that one.

410
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,770
What do you mean?

411
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:01,430
Then, are you saying I was going to kill those old folks just for my pleasure?

412
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,810
From now on, all the people who help you hide will be killed.

413
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,510
That's the order I received.

414
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:15,400
Eventually those people will die because of you.

415
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:23,430
Right. You can tell me now who sent you.

416
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,030
Or you can tell me 10 minutes late, I don't care.

417
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,670
I hate loud noise.

418
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,380
I'll get started.

419
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,700
Untie me.

420
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,900
Who is it?

421
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,720
Madam.

422
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,720
Did you eat?

423
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,950
You are an adult now.

424
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:56,250
You're pretty as you resemble your mom.

425
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,740
Devil.

426
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,640
Who? Me?

427
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,120
Why?

428
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,960
You shouldn't say such words to a person who looked after you, even though you haven't been normal.

429
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,370
Think about what you did to an innocent nine year-old.

430
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,550
Were you sad about it?

431
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,890
You were.

432
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:29,030
Anyway you should understand. I'm doing this because of you and for your father's sake.

433
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:35,080
I remembered everything. Mom did not commit suicide!

439
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:24,570
Sure. You won't be able to eat.

440
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,620
Such a pity, I couldn't see you enjoy your meal.

441
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:33,170
This was my first cooking in a long time.

442
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,970
Seems like she doesn't want to eat. Take her upstairs.

443
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,570
Yes, Madam.

444

446
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,510
Oh my.... Make some noise when you walk!

447
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,350
Wow! You are more handsome than I thought.

448
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,530
You're the banner hanger, right?

449
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:56,800
I imagined you'd have a rough face.

450
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,940
You managed to come in (despite of all the security setting).

451
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,980
I never thought you would appear right  in front of me.

452
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,100
I'm here to warn you.

453
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:19,160
Leave me and the people near me alone.

454
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,240
What if I don't?

455
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,820
If you don't, I'll come to find you wherever you'll be.

456
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,600
Even if I end our first meeting with just a warning,

457
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:41,290
I'll kill you the second time I come to find you.

458
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,820
Manager Ju was right about you. What did he say exactly?

459
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,010
Ah? The hitting on the origin?

460
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,870
When you are attacked,

461
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:59,170
you were trained to hit the origin of the attacking order towards you, I heard.

462
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:08,250
After knowing that,

463
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,890
even catching you was easy.

464
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:23,890
I'm sorry, you were at the wrong place at the wrong time and saw something that you shouldn't have seen.

465
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,780
That's why there's nothing I can do about it.

466
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:30,590
Is this how you love your cheating husband?

467
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:40,190
Love? How naive.

468
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:44,280
Thinking that you believe I could love that man.

469
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,200
I envy you.

470
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,570
By the way... I am curious about something.

471
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,300
Why did you come here?

472
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:01,300
At first, I didn't understand why you would come here to find the origin of the attacking order towards you.

473
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:07,130
Since you are a fugitive already, you could have been running forever, right?

474
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:16,310
I can't let the innocent people die because of me.

475
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,080
Innocent people?

476
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:28,620
Those people in the orchard? Didn't you just meet those people yesterday?

477
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:33,230
Yet... you took this kind of risk for them?

478
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,690
Really? That's the reason?

479
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:50,490
You people probably don't understand it because it's the reasoning you forgot long ago.

480
00:53:50,490 --> 00:54:00,350
In a long war, people tend to forget why they are in the war in the first place.

481
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,880
That's too bad.

482
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,890
You seem to be a very fine person.

483
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,360
If we met at a better time and in a better circumstance,

484
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,110
we might have become friends.

485
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:20,870
Those people... please don't touch them.

486
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,190
Those people at the orchard really don't know anything?

487
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,190
Yes. They don't know anything.

488
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,180
Okay.

489
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,210
For some reason, your words seem to be trustworthy.

490
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,500
Okay, I'll take your words.

491
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,960
But I don't think I can let those people live.

492
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,060
Stop!

493
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,260
This isn't a toy.

494
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,370
I said your words seem to be trustworthy, but putting my fate on your words

495
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:56,750
is a separate issue.

496
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,830
You... will regret this very soon.

497
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:10,080
Warning me on the first meeting... you shouldn't have.

498
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:17,290
Because there won't be the second meeting.

499
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:23,900
Take him and make it not painful.

500
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:09,310
You guys are working hard!

501
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,010
Hello. What brought you here?

502
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:20,800
Some punk stole a scooter from a delivery man.

503
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,970
And someone saw that scooter coming this way.

504
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:28,080
- This way? 
 - Yes.

505
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:30,660
He probably saw it wrong.

506
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:32,800
That's what I am saying.

507
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,730
That thief is in really bad luck coming here, don't you think so?

508
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:40,260
This place is like a tiger mouth.

509
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,010
Huh? That seems to be it.

510
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,900
Hold on.

511
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,900
Check this plate number for a motorbike.

512
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,640
Hold on.

513
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:55,100
Yes, 3812.

514
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,230
No, no. 38 like in the card game.

515
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:02,240
And 12. Right 3812. Yes.

516
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:05,850
Really? This is the one?

517
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,060
This is the stolen scooter, they said.

518
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,790
Told you.

519
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,000
Did something happen?

520
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,750
No, what? It's nothing.

521
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:08,170
No, no! Something is happening!

522
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,970
Hey, there's a rat in the garage. Come and take care of it, uh!

523
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:18,580
There's a rat in the house? That's a big problem.

524
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,300
You should leave now, yea?

525
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,990
Yea? Leave? To where?

526
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:25,550
I have to preserve the crime site.

527
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:26,270
What did you say?

528
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:30,210
Since we got the stolen scooter, the forensics team has to come here

529
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:33,020
and take the fingerprints and all to catch the culprit.

530
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:37,490
We investigate scientifically now. It's not like the olden days any more!

531
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,830
F*cker.

532
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:16,880
You come here!

533
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,620
I have a duty to preserve the site as the first witness—

534
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:29,360
Gosh, there's a big ruckus.

535
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:33,780
You guys are destroying things to catch a petty rat.

536
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,630

Yea, I got it and I am on my way now.

543
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:22,400
This is the second meeting that I told you about.

544
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,770
Shoot. Shoot.

545
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,320
SHOOT!

 This is how you should look after nursing your sick wife all night. 

560
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:43,610
 I will win in this fight, everyone! 

561
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,470
 Don't touch those around me. 

562
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:51,200
 If I go home now, it'll be dangerous. 

563
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,700
 The brake isn't working!  

564
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,040
 There were others who also had a death wish for you.
