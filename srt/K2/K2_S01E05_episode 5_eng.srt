What?

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,110
Ah, damn cat.

7
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,970
It startled me.

8
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,270
This is not good for you. Too hard to chew.

9
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,040
I said no!

10
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,510
I am hungry, too.

 Episode 5 

29
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,780
What? Jae Ha called me at this time?

30
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,300
Geez! I slept through without answering his phone call!

31
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,900
Come to think of it, this punk. Why is he so impatient from his first day here?

32
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,200
You scared me! You are always...

33
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,790
What are you doing out of the blue?

34
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,290
Huh? What are you looking for?

35
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,870
Okay! Come on!

36
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,640
Mrs. Chef, cook me some side dishes. Side dishes!

37
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,570
What are you cooking up?

38
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,970
Yes.

39
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,380
You are working very hard.

40
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,180
Welcome! J4.

41
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,890
Ah, why don't you eat some too, J4?

42
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,320
No, Ms. Mi Ran.

43
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,490
Help yourself, K1.

44
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,990
Okay. I will help myself.

45
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,510
There is soup missing.

46
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,790
What?

47
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,490
No, nothing.

48
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:57,390
By the way, K2... what about the night shift agent?

49
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,410
Ah, he seemed to have some urgent thing to take care of. He was discharged from his work and left earlier.

50
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,970
Ah, I see.

51
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,130
He could be tired from staying up all night.

52
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,660
You know, right?

53
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,800
- Ah, it is still hot, isn't it? 
 - Huh?

54
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,860
As I saw you on the security cameras, you seemed to feel hot.

55
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,220
Do you have too much hot energy on your body?

56
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,770
What?

57
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,470
 When the summer is over already, 

58
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,050
 why is it still hot?  

59
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:39,420
What the! You are meant to watch the VIP! Why were you monitoring me?

60
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,360
- M-M-Ms. Mi Ran, wait a minute! 
- What! Geez!

61
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,450
Return the containers after washing them, K1.

62
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,190
Why?

63
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,700
This is so refreshing.

64
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,270
This soup is so good!

65
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,250
Party Leader,

66
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,640
what are you eating to make yourself energetic like before?

67
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,370
Don't make a big deal out of it like that; you may fool other people.

68
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,230
What are you talking about? You scored even two goals today.

69
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,060
Look guys, if I can't score a goal

70
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,880
with the balls you passed to me deliberately,

71
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,570
how do you think I made my kids?

72
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,510
You just might make another child at this rate, Leader.

73
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,000
What? Another child?

74
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,490
Why not have a historical child's first birthday bash at the Blue House?

75
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,600
You want to get hit?

76
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,800
Hey, hey, hey. Stop teasing the old man and eat up.

77
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,710
Let's eat up and go to a bathhouse.

78
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,740
Cheers.

79
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,450
Good work.

80
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,690
So why are you guys looking so down these days?

81
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,110
Look at you guys.

82
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,950
Take a box of vitamin drinks when you leave.

83
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,890
Thank you, Party Leader!

84
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,570
Thank you!

85
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,430
Eat your vitamins and let's get pumped up, uh?

86
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,030
Good work.

87
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,750
Yeah.

88
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,000
Drink this and get energized.

89
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,840
Good work.

90
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,270
- Drink up. 
- This feels light. Are you sure I am getting the right amount?

91
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,120
I'll give you more next time.

92
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,210
Get energized. Fighting!

93
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,940
Ah, Assemblyman! Here you go.

94
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,850
Hey, hey, hey. Give me one more.

95
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,710
No, I can't. I will get blamed (for missing money later), won't I?

96
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,460
Eh hey. I'll tell him later.

97
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,960
Eh hey. I told you I can't.

98
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,810
This is what we call a delivery accident.

99
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,380
Ah listen to you...

100
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,630
Give him one more.

101
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,890
Assemblyman Kim has a larger area, so he probably has more expenses.

102
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,160
Give him one more.

103
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,910
Indeed, I love you.

104
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,730
You are gross. Hurry and leave.

105
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,450
Drink a lot!

106
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,690
What greed ...

107
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,470
- Oh, by the way, Party Leader! Madame Choi Sun Ja's obituary just surfaced. 
 - Choi Sun Ja?

108
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,830
Wait. Ah! Choi Yoo Jin's aunt?

109
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,460
Yeah.

110
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,720
Then her husband...

111
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,230
International Finance Group.

112
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,550
Ah right.

113
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,000
Shall we go there?

114
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,750
Is it necessary for you to go there in person? International Finance Group is so crappy that they can't even be ranked in the economical world.

115
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,070
I can't miss the great show. 
 (Meaning some arguments will occur there.) 

116
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,720
Yeah?

117
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,240
Let's go, go.

118
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,300
Is there anything to see?

119
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,470
Which one do you prefer?

120
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,700
Aren't they all the same? All my clothes look alike for the funeral home anyway.

121
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,340
Bring it ironed.

122
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,820
Yes.

123
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,770
Will I have all that misery without any children?

124
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,700
I am talking about my aunt.

125
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,130
She got married with a huge amount of assets.

126
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,460
She died lonely at a nursing home at the end.

127
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,670
Still, you took good care of her at the end of her life.

128
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,570
I only sucked up...

129
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,890
to inherit her shares of  JB.

130
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,330
No. Don't say it like that.

131
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,770
You two liked each other sincerely.

132
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:11,950
It was more like we pitied each other.

133
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,720
But,

134
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,050
I don't even have a niece like me.

135
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,650
When I am not good at applying everyday makeup, I will look much worse today (with crying).

136
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,770
I almost... look like an apparition.

137
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,930
In the fight, wouldn't it be to my advantage?

138
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,390
Manager! Where are you going? I was on my way to see you.

139
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,740
Follow me. Let's talk on the way.

140
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,540
Yeah? Where are you going?

141
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,370
Did you get anything?

142
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,440
No. He was just passing out some spending money to his henchmen.

143
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,530
Don't waste your sweat and just wait. Revenge takes time.

144
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,060
Here, put this on.

145
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,350
What is this?

146
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,260
You need to show your respect when you go to a funeral home.

147
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,950
Why are you standing here and not inside?

148
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,310
They are barring our entry into the temple.

149
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,460
What?

150
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,870
We were told it's the family's request. It's closed to the general public and

151
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,500
they are allowing only the invited along with a driver and a bodyguard.

152
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,030
You've been well, right?

153
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,150
Let's go.

154
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,810
You must be happy.

155
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,540
Because my aunt passed away?

156
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,420
You will have more shares of the JB Group.

157
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,900
Everybody knows that you will inherit the shares from your aunt.

158
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,820
I'm not sure of that.

159
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Will her husband and his son give up their shares that easily?

160
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,130
Well, that son is not her biological son, is he?

161
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,870
As you know,

162
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,670
sons are nagging jerks.

163
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,860
It's just as you expected. They have guards everywhere.

164
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,770
VIP has arrived.

165
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,700
Why?

166
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,340
You may have to consider cancelling the paying of your respects.

167
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,860
The entry of our staff is deliberately being prevented.

168
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,430
This place is being heavily guarded by International Finance Group people.

169
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,690
What on earth is this?

170
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,160
Are they filming a gangster movie?

171
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,730
They must be thinking this will psych me out. How childish!

172
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,800
Let's go in.

173
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,660
Madam, we must think about "what if."

174
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,880
What "what if"?

175
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,000
If an altercation occurs inside,

176
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,680
it may be hard for us to intervene.

177
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,640
No way, they'd kill me, would they?

178
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,800
I even have an assemblyman next to me.

179
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,100
I said let's go.

180
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,770
Then... let's do this.

181
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,280
Then, we'll escort you.

182
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,500
Let's go.

183
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,640
My condolences.

184
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,730
My sins harmed the decedent.

185
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,900
You came, Noonim!

186
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,330
Then let's go together.

187
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,860
Where are you going?

188
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,210
Madam.

189
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,460
There is a message from home.

190
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,740
Pardon?

191
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,420
You should go first.

192
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,160
Yes.

193
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,580
What is this?

194
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:54,030
If you think the atmosphere inside is a bit weird, press once.

195
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,410
So I could listen to what is going on inside.

196
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,030
What?

197
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,820
And if you feel like it's dangerous, press twice.

198
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,660
If I press it, then what?

199
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,610
I don't know.

200
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,100
 Amida Room 

201
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,990
 Decendent's Family Meeting 

202
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,590
Noona, welcome. How were you doing?

203
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,660
Son-in-Law, it's the house of mourning right now.  (Meaning: We are here for mourning, not for catching up each other.) 

204
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,570
Yes, Father-in-Law.

205
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,610
Come over here and sit.

206
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,490
What did you put in Madam's purse?

207
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,460
A pen.

208
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,560
Don't joke around.

209
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,030
Right. It's that pen. MJ7081 B type. Made in Italy.

210
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,080
It writes well with great reception despite  jamming. The only weakness is its short reception distance.

211
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,140
I hope she doesn't need to use this in any case.

212
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,480
It is normal to reveal the will

213
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,110
after the funeral.

214
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,170
But because it is hard for the bereaved family to gather in one place

215
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,080
and to fulfill the wishes of the deceased,

216
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,830
we will open the will right now.

217
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,900
But I don't have the key to this bag.

218
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,800
In this room, there is a person the deceased left the key to.

219
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,820
I hope that person gives me the key.

220
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,550
Do you have it?

221
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,210
 Is he saying  they knew everything? 

222
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,340
This is the will.

223
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,580
Then I will read.

224
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,990
One. I, Choi Sun Ja, will donate all my property

225
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,330
to Pyeong Chang Scholarship Foundation.

226
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,790
K2.

227
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,830
But why don't you have respect for superiors?

228
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,730
Just because I don't respect them.

229
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,840
As for respect for higher-ups in an organization,

230
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,970
it is basic manners for working in a society.

231
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,200
That's why I don't have basic manners.

232
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,530
That's right. You don't have manners.

233
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,900
But why don't you have manners?

234
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,960
I just said I don't have manners

235
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,800
but if you ask why I don't have manners, I just said I don't have manners because I don't have manners.

236
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,750
That's right. You've said it correctly.

237
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,240
There's no problem, right?

238
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,940
There is none.

239
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,940
Don't talk to me.

240
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,270
You always talk informally.

241
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,590
Yes. This is it.

242
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:06,220
Your mother must have a bad feeling towards her son.

243
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,630
Forget about that. Lawyer,

244
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,900
please take that out and wait.

245
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,710
Then I will go to my office and wait.

246
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,930
I said to wait outside!

247
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,260
Ah. I understand.

248
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,090
 Honestly, we didn't gather just to hear this obvious will. 

249
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,190
It turned on.

250
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,990
 Let's get to the point. 

251
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,620
Okay. What are you going to do, my in-law?

252
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,610
Respecting the deceased's will,

253
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,300
I must use it usefully for the Scholarship Foundation.

254
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,530
That's right, Noona. Talk to the foundation nicely and-

255
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:03,430
Chairman Choi. Stay still.

256
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,470
Yes, Mom.

257
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,170
Yoo Jin.

258
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:13,240
You can't have everything, right?

259
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,250
Well

260
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,310
if Uncle has to pursue filing a lawsuit,

261
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,400
he may get some of his shares as the law allows.

262
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,200
No. I mean the presidency and JB Group, not shares of the Group.

263
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,330
All of it.

264
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,630
In-Law, let's be honest with each other.

265
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,230
Everyone here knows that

266
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,170
you are the actual owner of Pyeong Chang Scholarship Foundation.

267
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,860
Isn't it also true that as the owner of the Pyeong Chang Foundation, you are using JSS

268
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,500
to spy on JB Group?

269
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,770
I don't know. I think saying the word spying is not true.

270
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,470
Maybe you can put it as an audit? That sounds more right.

271
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,910
Father-in-Law, so

272
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,930
just in case I might ruin Father's reputation,

273
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,670
Noona is worried. Isn't that right, Noona?

274
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,900
How much should I give you?

275
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,730
The JB shares Aunt gave you today and the JB's shares for Pyeong Chang Scholarship Foundation.

276
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,160
sell those to me.

277
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,730
I don't have interest in JB so don't misunderstand.

278
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,610
I'm going to give it as a present to my son-in-law.

279
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,760
Father-in-Law, you don't have to.

280
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,740
I will pay twice the market value.

281
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,400
What? Twice?

282
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,450
With that money, it would be enough until the election.

283
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,800
I will give you three times.

284
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,060
That is my last proposal.

285
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,300
I don't think it's a bad proposal.

286
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,580
With that money you can also conduct the scholarship business fruitfully.

287
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,100
I could go through the election more easily too.

288
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,860
That's right, right, Brother-in-Law?

289
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,670
How can I sell the property

290
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,230
of a public foundation that isn't even mine?

291
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,790
Is it because it's hard to decide

292
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,100
or because you don't want to?

293
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,240
Then I should help you.

294
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,360
Soon there will be an emergency board meeting of the Pyeong Chang Scholarship Foundation.

295
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,200
It is a meeting to elect a new chief director.

296
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,490
She turned it off.

297
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,640
Among the foundation's directors,

298
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,180
I saw that there were some who held bad feelings towards you.

299
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,120
A meeting of board directors without me?

300
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,300
It's invalid.

301
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,970
Of course. So

302
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,870
that's why the first agenda item is

303
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,830
to pass the motion to fire Director Choi Yoo Jin.

304
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,400
When the shares are sold

305
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,130
we will help you get into that position again.

306
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,370
And Assemblyman Jang, we will actively help you

307
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,460
for your election.

308
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,860
You have to be elected

309
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,940
so that we can get our pre-election investment back. Don't you think?

310
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,900
I guess so.

311
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,910
Your phone probably won't work in this room.

312
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:08,080
If you comfortably rest while waiting, it will be over quickly.

313
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,630
Assemblyman Jang, shall we play a game of baduk?

314
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,140
Let's do that since we don't have anything to do.

315
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,940
I fell into the trap!

316
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,930
I came here to receive the feather-like shares from Aunt

317
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,500
but it looks like I am going to lose the body-like Scholarship Foundation.

318
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,700
JB

319
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,440
is the company my father built.

320
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,870
He is Chairman Choi's father too.

321
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,170
No!

322
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:09,520
Before he brought in a pretty secretary as his mistress!

323
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,500
My mother and younger self went around with a straw food basket, and my father ate on the factory floor

324
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,560
with the laborers! THAT's the company my father built!

325
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,790
You seem to get more expensive compensation

326
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:29,470
for the snacks you delivered, huh?

327
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,750
What's wrong?

328
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,990
Isn't it a bit weird?

329
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,270
Don't you know? They're talking about money.

330
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,900
She turned it off herself so we won't hear it.

331
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,930
 That's right. This woman's ambition cannot be bought with money. 

332
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,360
Turn on the engine and wait in the car.

333
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,060
Why? Where are you going?

334
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:37,820
Do you know why your father didn't choose you as his heir?

335
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,410
Because you're a woman?

336
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,570
Not at all.

337
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,080
It's because he didn't love you.

338
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,610
Your father knew you were disgusting.

339
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:55,300
If he gave you the company, what would happen and what would happen to Seong Won,

340
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,820
your father clearly knew.

341
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,620
You make your husband president and use that power

342
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,260
to get JB Group. You didn't think that

343
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,590
he would know that secret ambition?

344
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:14,810
That's right. I am your father's second wife.

345
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,200
- Mom!
 - But you...

346
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,610
you who used marriage as a scheme!

347
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,000
Look at yourself.

348
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,180
So,  are you happy?

349
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,060
Why is everyone like this? Stop now.

350
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,510
What is going on?

351
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,900
I came here to escort Madame Choi out.

352
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,220
Without any order from higher-ups, no one can enter.

353
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,600
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

354
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,930
♫  Lies, lies. And the wind rises.  ♫

355
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,900
♫  Run, run. I'm fine.  ♫

356
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,430
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

357
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,830
♫  Run, run. Soon it will be too late.  ♫

358
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,210
♫  Lies, lies. It's also my fault.  ♫

359
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,200
♫  Look out. Look out.   ♫

360
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,700
What's going on?!

361
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,790
I think there is a fire!

362
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,910
What? Hurry up and open the door!

363
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,590
Hurry up and open the door!

364
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,760
Hurry up and open the door!

365
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,970
Move aside!

366
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:52,990
Hurry up and leave!

367
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,740
Let's go out.

368
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,400
Don't worry. I halted the scholarship foundation meeting.

369
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:46,300
♬  A pure girl meets a wolf in the thick forest  ♬

370
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,630
Let's go out now.

371
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,490
♬  She does not know what fear is  ♬

372
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:02,720
♬  He's an evil beast  ♬

373
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,950
You  can't go out like this.

374
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:13,200
♬  When she sees a beautiful flower  ♬

375
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,190
♬  He whispers something in her ear  ♬

376
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:26,190
♬  To get the beautiful flower  ♬

377
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:35,400
♬  Without ceasing, treading in the deep forest  ♬

378
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,700
 I didn't press it twice for sure. 

379
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,580
 But this child read my heart. 

380
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,630
 There hasn't been a person who moved without my command yet. 

381
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:59,580
 But this child 

382
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,760
 didn't need my command or permission. 

383
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,000
 That's right. He wasn't a hunting dog. 

384
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,310
 He is a wolf. 

385
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,960
 He's dangerous. 

386
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:20,300
 I probably won't be able to tame him. 

387
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:26,320
♬  To get the beautiful flower  ♬

388
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:34,100
♬  Without ceasing, treading in the deep forest  ♬

389
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,820
Straighten your back.

390
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,760
And lift your head. Your enemies are probably watching.

391
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,060
What is this?

392
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,480
Stay still.

393
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,800
- Are you alright?
 - I'm okay.

394
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,230
What is this?

395
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,710
Are you all right?

396
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,760
What? The meeting was halted?

397
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,630
What are you doing right now? Move aside!

398
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,760
Niece Yoo Jin.

399
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,300
I hope she rests in peace.

400
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,330
Aigoo. What is all this mess?

401
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,000
Come in a different car.

402
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,440
What?

403
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,400
After playing baduk slowly.

404
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,660
Everything is not real, so it's useless to be attached to any of those. ( Quoted from Bopjung, one of the most famous Korean monk.) 

405
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,000
Isn't that so, Mr. Monk?

406
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,900
Aigoo. People have to throw away their greed. Isn't that so?

407
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,560
Yes.

408
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,830
Don't move without my permission next time.

409
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Do you understand?

410
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,060
Yes. Whatever you say.

411
00:42:54,850 --> 00:43:00,670
I'm sorry, Madame. He isn't fully trained.

412
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,700
Well.

413
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,860
Let's go to Cloud Nine.

414
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,250
Yes.

415
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,290
Cloud Nine?

416
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,280
Madam, you aren't hurt anywhere?

417
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,120
No, my condition's very good.

418
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,690
Oh, yes.

419
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,870
What about the board of directors?

420
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:41,530
Yes, I personally went and personally stopped them.

421
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:46,560
Any traitors I found were punished, and I received their resignations.

422
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,010
You did such a great job.

423
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,490
Yes?

424
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:00,690
Th-th-thank you, madam!

425
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,780
How about Cloud Nine?

426
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,200
Yes, it's all ready. This way.

427
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,160
Kim Jae Ha all by himself!

428
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,850
He completely destroyed all the International Finance guards in that corridor.

429
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:38,280
All of them!

430
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,520
Oh, so cool!

431
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,880
And then the door was wide open.

432
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,490
Could they have kept the door shut? When there was a fire alarm?

433
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,860
Right? Right? This punk is so smart.

434
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,930
Did you see it yourself?

435
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,600
You're talking like you witnessed it first-hand.

436
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,150
That side's SDT body guard chief is my friend.

437
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,640
All the guards that were there today need eight weeks of rest. Those are the testimonies of those patients.

438
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,320
E-Eight weeks?

439
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,680
It's the same diagnosis when a passerby on the street comes in slight contact with my fist.

440
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,120
You can't even get a settlement from that.

441
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:22,060
Oh wow, what a surprise. Go and practice throwing people over some more!

442
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,150
Oh my my.

443
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,090
Unni, Unni. No need to listen to that. Hurry and tell me what happened next.

444
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,360
Oh! And after that,

445
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,390
underneath the sprinkler's water drizzle...

446
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,540
underneath the sprinkler's water spray,

447
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:39,320
he finally arrived and opened an umbrella for the madam.

448
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,590
Totally cool! Madam must've totally fallen for him.

449
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,260
Of course! Of course!

450
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,300
Kim Jae Ha? He finally found his road to success.

451
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,500
He's good looking too!

452
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,090
Totally a hottie.

453
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,620
Hello.

454
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,710
Hey!

455
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,160
Yes?

456
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,690
Are you busy?

457
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,550
No, not too busy but I need to wash up before my night shift...

458
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,120
Follow me.

459
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,020
Here!

460
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,000
It's good, right?

461
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,260
Yes.

462
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,500
Yeah, Korean pigs are yummier.

463
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,340
But

464
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,730
why are you treating me all of a sudden?

465
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,510
Huh? Eat, eat first.

466
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:06,180
Here, open up.

467
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,930
Good, huh?

468
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,340
Time to get off work!

469
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,130
How dare you be rude to an elder!

470
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:40,020
P-please let go and let's talk!

471
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,560
 - Please!
 - But the floor here is so hard! 

472
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,570
You can't be helped with just words!

473
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,500
Oh my. Oh my, oh my!

474
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,860
- Ya! Here! 
 - Ow, ow, ow.

475
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,990
Surrender! Surrender!

476
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:58,550
What are you... What is this!

477
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,090
Ow, my head!

478
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,270
- Ow, ow, ow...
- Are you okay, Mr. Jae Ha?

479
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,950
- Ow ow ow...
 - Are you alright?

480
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,620
Ow, my head!

481
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,690
You got a cut.

482
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:12,430
C-cut? Oh blood?

483
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:17,120
Oh, I'm dying!

484
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,550
What kind of a girl carries metal objects around in her purse?

485
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:31,960
I'm sorry. You know the world can be scary.

486
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:36,790
That's why you shouldn't have done that! Jae Ha, you too!

487
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,900
Just because you got bribed with some meat, you actually followed through with his request?

488
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,040
I apologize. I just, you know, wanted to help you build up a  relationship...

489
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,660
Oh my, unbelievable! Do girls actually fall for that? Huh?

490
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,840
Do girls fall for guys just because they're good at mindless fighting?

491
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,800
Yeah, I got it.

492
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:02,100
From now on, this won't happen again. Sorry about everything so far.

493
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,410
I'm sorry to you too. I got you involved for no reason.

494
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,140
Sorry.

495
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,310
Wait, hey.

496
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,120
Hey...

497
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,390
Master Song!

498
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,270
What are they doing right now?

499
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:40,630
Thanks, Jae Ha. This all happened thanks to you.

500
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,640
Not all thanks to me. This all happened because you have charm.

501
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:49,860
Right? I do have some charm, right?

502
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,040
But you should treat me to meat again.

503
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,660
Of course! There's a place over there that has great goat meat.

504
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,100
Let's go this weekend with the doctor.

505
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,640
I heard that goat is great for women.

506
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,170
Yeah.

507
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,540
Why does this girl use an electric blanket in this weather?

508
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:59,000
If you're cold on the inside, your body is cold too.

509
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,460
It's not like she brings in anything to the house. What are we expected to find by searching?

510
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,800
Come and help with the sheets.

511
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,820
Oh, so that's what it was.

512
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:12,800
My heart was cold, so my body was cold too.

513
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,820
Then is Jae Ha a fireplace?

514
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,460
You're cold because you walk around half naked.

515
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:24,770
Anyway, the Miss must not have an appetite these days. She's not eating well.

516
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:29,960
Tada! Tada! Tada.

517
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,530
Yes!

518
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,620
Yes! Yes!

519
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,900
Good, good.

520
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,780
Why?

521
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,180
W-why?

522
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,810
Why?

523
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,110
What? What are you doing right now?

524
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,710
Hey. Hey, you...!

525
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,500
Hey! What... Ugh, why... Why are you  covering it?

526
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,310
Where is she?

527
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,340
Okay! Found her!

528
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,910
Found her, found her, found her.

529
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,280
Found her.

530
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,510
♬  Guess I'm loving you  ♬

531
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,100
Found her!

532
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,900
♬  When I see you, my heart hurts  ♬  

533
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:26,610
♬  What good does that do to my heart?   ♬

534
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:32,340
♬   The closer I approach, the farther away I am  ♬

535
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:40,350
♬  Seeing you is too painful for me.  ♬

536
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:50,250
♬   Saying it's okay I keep trying to comfort my heart    ♬

537
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:54,220
♬    When it's very difficult.  ♬

538
00:56:54,220 --> 00:57:01,340
♬   Every so often I used to cry silently  ♬

539
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:08,750
♬   Every so often I used to think about you  ♬

540
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:17,510
♬  On the road I walked with you like a fool  ♬

541
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:23,240
♬  I'm standing by myself  ♬

542
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,320
Oh! Jae Ha!

543
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:31,310
Are you on your break?

544
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,760
Yeah.

545
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,130
I came out to work out.

546
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:48,500
I'm sorry about not getting your call yesterday.

547
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,720
It's fine. I mean, it happens.

548
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,810
It was just so sudden.

549
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,660
What?

550
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:04,790
I mean... I debated on whether or not I should pick up, and then I just didn't pick up.

551
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,730
But my calls are hot lines, so you should have picked up.

552
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,140
Hot?

553
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:14,750
Line? Hot line.

554
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,580
Yes.

555
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,150
From now on, I'll be sure to pick up.

556
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,510
I heard you used to work in Barcelona.

557
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:30,010
Don't mention it. It was so hard.

558
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,140
Just to find her father...

559
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,450
It's fine. Her father's just her father.

560
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:39,560
Right? Right.

561
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:45,630
Yeah. I mean our employer isn't here so we can talk sh— however we want.

562
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,690
But what about her father?

563
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:52,990
Oh, her father. She kept running away saying that she would find her father.

564
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,100
So that's what happened.

565
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:14,480
But...

566
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,840
Yes?

567
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,230
Why doesn't her father come?

568
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:20,740
Her father?

569
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,860
Her father doesn't have very much interest in his daughter.

570
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,870
Ever since we were in Spain, I made so many reports

571
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:31,910
about how Anna looked for her father, but in the end there wasn't any response.

572
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:37,560
When he came to Madrid on a business trip, I thought maybe he would visit, but of course he didn't.

573
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:43,290
But she doesn't know anything and keeps saying she'll meet her father and keeps running away,

574
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:46,980
and then we keep going out to look for her...

575
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,660
How pitiful.

576
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:54,250
Right? If you think about it, I really am a pitiful girl.

577
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,390
At this age, cleaning up after a little girl. This is how I live.

578
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,750
Yes! This is J4.

579
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,820
There is no problem here.

580
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,410
Yes!

581
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,930
What?

582
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,420
Uh...

583
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,090
I understand.

584
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,490
What?

585
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:20,260
It's headquarters. They said you are off duty today.

586
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,870
They told me to be the emergency back up.

587
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:30,140
Yes, Manager. Yes, right now?

588
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,180
Yes. Got it. Yes, floor 9.

589
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,620
Okay.

590
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,050
Did they ask you to come to the office?

591
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,580
- Yes.
 - To the ninth floor?

592
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,990
Yes.

593
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:42,710
- Oh my God!
 - Why?

594
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:48,700
Awesome! Jae Ha, you just got called in to Cloud Nine. Oh my God!

595
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,890
What is that?

596
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:53,500
You, Jae Ha, you...

597
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:56,640
I came to pick you up. This way, please.

598
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,270
Hey! I'm going to change clothes real quick.

599
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:01,030
Yes, sir.

600
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,660
Wow, even a chauffeur?

601
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,120
He totally... he totally made it!

602
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,880
Oh my gosh!

603
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:15,390
Alright.

604
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:17,850
- Please be seated in the back. 
 - What?

605
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:19,590
You can sit in the back.

606
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:22,360
You're kidding, right? Let's go.

607
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,710
We'll be on our way.

608
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,420
 Please scan your badge. 

609
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,090
 Kim Jae Ha 

610
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,040
 Thank you. 

611
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,650

 The K2 

623
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:34,170
 What do you really want to hear from me?  

624
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:38,760
 Everything. We'll now start hunting. Is this reason enough? 

625
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,490
 Dad, you're not that type of person. 

626
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,540
 It's because Choi Yoo Jin is next to you. 

627
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:48,150
  Choi Yoo Jin found out everything. She's going to kill you and Anna! 

628
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:52,030
  Dad, I might have lost my way. 

629
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,770
 Dad, come and get me. 

630
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,620
 No! 

631
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,240
 Anna, no! 

632
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,040
♬   I can't stop myself  ♬
