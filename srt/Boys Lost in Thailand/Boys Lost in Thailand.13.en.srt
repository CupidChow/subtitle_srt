1
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,960
The program has a proposal for you all
to create a memory book together.

2
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,250
The rule is to pair up and create one page per pair.

3
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,840
The missing jigsaw piece is actually
hidden somewhere inside this house.

4
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,270
Everyone, please help search in each room,

5
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,220
and then put it together to complete.

6
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,600
But getting the jigsaw piece won’t be as easy as you think,

7
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,200
because the Boys Lost participants
must first clear some tough missions.

8
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,650
Dokyun: Did you guys find it?

9
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,810
Junsu: So is it in the north or the south?

10
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,260
Junsu: South, south, south!
It’s in southern Thailand.
Jawoon: Southern Thailand.

11
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,840
Third: I feel like I’ve never seen this place before.

12
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,160
Third: And I think it’s such an interesting place in Thailand.

13
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,890
A bright morning for the Boys Lost
on their final day in this house.

14
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,970
All ten boys wake up early, excited

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,080
to travel to the place shown in the jigsaw.

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,320
Before heading out for the adventure, they need to recharge with breakfast.

17
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
(So playful)
Before heading out for the adventure, they need to recharge with breakfast.

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,640
Before heading out for the adventure, they need to recharge with breakfast.

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,880
Zhuojie: Good morning.
Junsu: Hi, hi, hi.

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,150
Everyone: Good morning, good morning!

21
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,840
Junsu: What’s everyone doing?

22
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,640
Talay: Eating before going out.

23
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,480
Zhuojie: I’m starving.

24
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,960
Junsu: I want ramyeon.
Junlan: I want ramyeon.

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,340
Intouch: You make omelet.

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,040
Zhuojie: Anyone want whey protein?
Talay: Whey protein?

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,520
(Please, just once)

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,040
(Please, just once)
Zhuojie: What are you doing?

29
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,920
Zhuojie: What are you doing?

30
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,230
Talay: Can’t see.

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,790
(Complain)

32
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,570
(Complain)
Zhuojie: Junsu.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,560
(Junsu is not a good guy)
Zhuojie: Not a good guy.

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,040
Zhuojie: Tie your pants tighter.

35
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,540
Junlan: No boiling ramyeon.

36
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,390
Junsu: Why?

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,740
Junlan: Haven’t cooked in a long time.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,720
(Jawoon)
Zhuojie: Jawoon.

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,080
(Jawoon)
Zhuojie: Jawoon.

40
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
(Quietly)

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,080
Talay: Intouch, what kind of scrambled eggs is that?
That’s a fusion sunny-side up.

42
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,400
Zhuojie: Jawoon.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,040
(Jawoon)
Porsche: You’re hungry now, right?

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,880
(Oops! Too loud)

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,170
Zhuojie: Jawoon, I need help.

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,920
(Jawoon, where are you?)
Zhuojie: Jawoon, I need help.

47
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,570
Zhuojie: What are you doing?

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
(Keep it quiet)
Zhuojie: Jawoon.

49
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,000
Zhuojie: I need help.

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,730
(Found it)

51
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,800
(Found it)
Zhuojie: Come here quick, friend.
Talay: He needs help from you.

52
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,930
Zhuojie: What are you doing?

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,520
(Pretend not to hear)
Jawoon: Why, why, why?
Zhuojie: What are you doing?

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,740
Zhuojie: Just help me a little bit.

55
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,240
Junlan: So cold.

56
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,160
Junlan: The weather is so nice today.

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,640
Junsu: The weather is so nice today, right.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,280
Junlan: The weather is so nice today.

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,680
Junsu: The weather is so nice today.

60
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,800
Junlan: Don’t you feel touched
seeing this view on the last day?

61
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,200
Junsu: A little bit.

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,920
Junlan: I... I think I’ll miss this place.

63
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,050
Junsu: Me too.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,840
Junlan: Miss it.

65
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,490
Junlan: Miss it.

66
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,360
Junsu: Me too.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
Junlan: Miss it.

68
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,800
Junlan: No, no, no.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,590
Junlan: Right?

70
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,530
Junsu: Just a little.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
Junsu: Do I have to make omelet like this?

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,960
Junlan: Scrambled eggs?
Junsu: Yes.

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,880
Junlan: Why?

74
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,880
Junlan: Why though?
Junsu: Make it however you want.

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,830
Junsu: This way is tastier.

76
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,880
Junlan: Why?

77
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,040
Junsu: Look, what’s that?

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,880
Junlan: No, no, no.

79
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,810
Junsu: Okay, okay, no problem.

80
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,320
Junlan: No, no way.
Junsu: It’s fine, it’s fine.

81
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,690
Junlan: Calm down.

82
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,720
Junsu: Looks delicious, right?

83
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,160
Junlan: Calm down.

84
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,420
Junsu: Looks yummy, huh?

85
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,540
Junlan: Nooo.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,090
Junlan: Doesn’t look like a heart.
Junsu: You have to wait.

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,320
Junlan: Doesn’t look like it.
Junsu: Wait, wait.

88
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,740
Junsu: Because the middle isn’t cooked.

89
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,130
Junsu: Try it this way first.

90
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,510
Junlan: Just shut up.

91
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
Junsu: Special dish.

92
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,650
Talay: What are you doing with the egg?

93
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,400
Talay: You make pancakes here too?

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,600
Junlan: Yeah.
Junsu: Yes, of course.

95
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,160
Junlan: This side isn’t hot.

96
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,660
Talay: Not hot?
Junlan: Yeah, only this side is hot.

97
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,330
Junlan: Just this side.
Junsu: Give me five minutes.

98
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,220
Junsu: Heart.

99
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,930
(What shape is that?)

100
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,840
(What shape is that?)
Junsu: Heart, like this.
Junlan: No, no.

101
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,270
Junlan: Are you dumb?

102
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,400
Junsu: Look, I did it.

103
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,880
Junlan: That’s not a heart.
Junsu: It is a heart.

104
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,400
(So much feels)
Junlan: Not a heart.
Junsu: Definitely a heart.

105
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,010
Junlan: Not a heart.
Junsu: Definitely a heart.

106
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,560
Junlan: Three, four.

107
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,400
Junsu: One, two...
Junlan: Three.

108
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,610
Junsu: Okay.

109
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,570
Junsu: Careful, careful.

110
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,280
(Calm down)
Junlan: Calm down.

111
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,480
(Calm down)

112
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,800
Junlan: Is that really a heart?

113
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,360
Junsu: Great job.

114
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,260
Junlan: Ketchup.

115
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,080
Junsu: Just a little, just a little.

116
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,420
(Decorating first)

117
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,480
(Decorating first)
Junsu: Junlan.

118
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,570
Junsu: We can do this.

119
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,400
Junlan: Heart.

120
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,750
Junsu: Great job.

121
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,160
Junlan: Don’t have to tell me.

122
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,980
Junlan: I already know.

123
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,530
Junlan: I already know.

124
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,970
Junlan: Want to taste?

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,240
Junsu: It’s hot, careful.

126
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,840
Junlan: How is it?

127
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,510
Junlan: No sauce.
Junsu: No sauce?

128
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,920
Junsu: Salt, salt.

129
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,670
Junsu: Make it, make it.

130
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,200
(The sweetest omelet)

131
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,350
Talay: Scrambled eggs.

132
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,340
(What dish over here?)
Jawoon: I’m hungry.

133
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,830
(What dish over here?)
F4: Bring in a lot of it.

134
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
(Mr. Intouch’s omelet)
F4: Mr. Intouch’s lava egg.

135
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,650
(Can it be as sweet as outside?)
Jawoon: Mr. Intouch.

136
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,680
(Can it be as sweet as outside?)
Third: Oh, they’ve got tricks up their sleeve.

137
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,280
Zhuojie: Mr. Intouch.

138
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,920
Zhuojie: I Touchy.

139
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,720
Zhuojie: You Touchy.

140
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,000
Zhuojie: F4 F2 F3 F4.

Zhuojie: Lamborghini.

143
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,480
(Energy never drops)

144
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,800
Junsu: Add it now?

145
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:00,980
Junsu: What are you doing?

146
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,670
Junlan: Is this a heart?

147
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
Junlan: Heart.

148
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,510
(Telephone noodles)

149
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,920
(Telephone noodles)
Junlan: Hello, hello.
Junsu: Hello.

150
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,230
Junlan: Hello.

151
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,430
(Munch!!)

152
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,240
(Munch!!)
Junsu: Do you like it?

153
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,670
Junlan: No.

154
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,310
Junsu: Delicious.

155
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,850
Talay: Nothing, nothing.

156
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,060
(Is the pan hot yet?)

157
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,840
(Is the pan hot yet?)
Jawoon: Let’s eat.

158
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,320
Intouch: Who can beat my fried egg?

159
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,970
F4: The pancakes are so tasty.

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
(Too hungry to wait)
F4: I want to eat already.

161
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,520
F4: Wait, wait, it’s almost ready.

162
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,480
(Snack first)
F4: Almost ready.

163
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,120
(Hotter than the pan)
Third: What’s this for?

164
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,800
(Hotter than the pan)
(It’s the chef’s passion)
F4: Feeling pressured.

165
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,160
(Try sifting)
Porsche: F4, try sifting it.

166
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,290
Intouch: Not that kind of sift.

167
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,240
(Is this how you sift?)
Intouch: Not that kind of sift.

168
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,700
(Do you mean sift the pan?)

169
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,080
(Do you mean sift the pan?)
F4: Porsche, you try sifting it.

170
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,350
F4: Porsche, you try sifting it.

171
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,240
(Jawoon, sift it)
F4 & Porsche: Jawoon, sift it, sift it.

188
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,640

193
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,280
(Huh?)

194
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,850
Junlan: Wait a moment.

195
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,290

Junlan: We brought all the eggs.

207
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,970
Junlan: No eggs left, really none.

208
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360

209
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,960

Junsu: It’s bland.
Jawoon: Bland, right.

230
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,590
Zhuojie: Junsu, I just drank corn soup.

231
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,080

But it’s not enough.

270
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,970

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,030

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,000
Talay: We can go by plane,
but we’ll have to vote someone out.

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,400
(If go by plane must vote someone out)
Talay: We can go by plane,
but we’ll have to vote someone out.

279
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,760

287
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,300
F4: Transfer by car?
Intouch: Yes, transfer by car.

288
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,890

then continuing by car to Phang Nga.

322
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,170
Just thinking about it is exciting.

323
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,740
Dokyun: I’m not really the scared type, but...

324
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,290
Dokyun: I prefer exciting things more.

325
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,440

326
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,640

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,640
Third: I’ll take green.

512
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,800
Intouch: I want to collect lots of travel memories with my friends.

513
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,360
Intouch: I feel like I want to express myself even more.

514
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,000
(18:52 Hua Hin Railway Station)

515
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,800
Vendor: Grilled chicken? Grilled chicken.

516
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Vendor: Grilled chicken?

517
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,880
(Gout wants chicken)
Talay: I totally forgot I used to have gout.

518
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840

530
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,170
Everyone: Thank you.

531
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,680
(Handsome, kind, generous rich guy)
F4: Handsome, kind, generous rich guy.

532
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,870
Junlan: Is it tasty?

533
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,920
(Going south means showing shadow play)

534
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,880
(Going south means showing shadow play)
F4: Shadow play.

535
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,920
(Going south means showing shadow play)

536
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,880
(The wire’s going to poke Junsu’s mouth)

537
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,520
Talay: Porsche is awake.

538
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,040
Talay: Slept for so long.

539
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,580
F4: How much money do we have?

540
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,680
Intouch: Money? 23,000.

541
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,880
Talay: We spent a lot today.

542
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,760
Intouch: We spent 1 today.

543
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,500
Talay: Two meals?
Intouch: Now we have 2,000 left.

544
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,960
(From 20,000, now left with 2,000 baht)

545
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,930
Junlan: What do we do?

546
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,230
(Rubber bands are the number one enemy)
Junlan: Hard to open.

547
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,040
(Rubber bands are the number one enemy)

548
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,430
Junlan: Right now, you’re the best person in the world.

549
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,520
Junlan: At this moment.

550
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,480
Junlan: Yes.

551
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,760
Junlan: Because you helped me.

552
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,320
Junlan: Right now, you’re the best.

553
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,880
Zhuojie: Junsu.

554
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,600
Zhuojie: Junsu.

555
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,960
Zhuojie: Are you full?

556
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,080
Junsu: I’m full.

557
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,490
Zhuojie: If not full, then eat my fist.

558
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,720
Junsu: What the heck?

559
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,540
Zhuojie: Just kidding, eat my fist.

560
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,050
Junsu: Zhuojieee.

561
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,250
Zhuojie: What?
Junsu: Come here.

562
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,090
Talay: Rice on your mouth.
Junsu: Come here, come here.

563
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,820
Third: Is it tasty?

564
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,330
Junsu: Come here, come here.
Zhuojie: Why?

565
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,300
Intouch: Jeremy.

566
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,790
Intouch: Jeremy.

567
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,090
Intouch: Is it tasty?

568
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,440
Zhuojie: Very tasty.

569
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,520
Junsu: Sit, sit, sit.

570
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,820
Zhuojie: Why?
Junsu: Please help me.

571
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,720
Porsche: Me.

572
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,040
Junsu: Can you do it?

573
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,310
Junlan: And now, Porsche is the best.

574
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,220
Porsche: What’s he doing?

575
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:25,000
(Porsche saves the day)

576
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,840
Junlan: You’re the best in the world.

577
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,960
Porsche: Wait, wait, wait.

578
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,590
Porsche: There’s a wire here, take it out first.

579
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,880
(Wire again)
Junlan: Oh my god.

580
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,960
Junlan: I had no idea.

581
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,550
Junlan: Is this Thai culture?

582
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,990
(Junlan has just discovered Thai signature styles)
Junlan: Is this Thai culture?

583
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,160
(Junlan has just discovered Thai signature styles)
Porsche: Yes, it is...

584
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,740
Porsche: Yes, it is...

585
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,850
Porsche: It’s Thai, something like that.

586
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,440
(You could die from it)
Junlan: I almost ate it.

587
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,170
Junlan: Oh my god.

588
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,960
Porsche: Just a little more.

589
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,760
(Next station, go to hospital)
Porsche: Next station, go to hospital.

590
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,120
(Next station, go to hospital)

591
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
(Next station, go to hospital)
Junlan: I almost died.

592
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,850
Porsche: You almost got off the train.

593
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,460
Junlan: Yes, almost.

594
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,810
Junlan: Thank you.

595
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,910
Junlan: Cheers, cheers.

596
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,640
Porsche: The chicken’s too dry. In the end, everyone just ate sticky rice.

597
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,040
(Can I have cola~~)
Dokyun: I need cola.

598
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,920
(Can I have cola~~)

599
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,470
Dokyun: Ah, seriously.

600
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,640
Zhuojie: No, no, look.

601
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,320
(Not only didn’t eat, but also spilled)
Jawoon: That’s you.

602
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,180
Zhuojie: Look, look.

603
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,720
Zhuojie: Who.

604
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,680
Zhuojie: Did it.

605
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,640
Zhuojie: Who.

606
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,240
Zhuojie: Not me, see for yourself.

607
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,270
Jawoon: Zhuojie.

608
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,060
Talay: I ran out of tissues.

609
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,200
Talay: No tissues left.

610
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,330
Zhuojie: I swear, I swear.

611
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,370
Zhuojie: If I did it, may I never earn money.

612
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,240
(Swearing he didn’t do it)
Zhuojie: If I did it, may I never earn money.

613
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,680
(Swearing he didn’t do it)

614
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,410
Jawoon: What’s wrong?

615
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,440
(Got evidence, right?)

616
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,520
(Framed as the scapegoat)
Zhuojie: What are you doing, Lee Jawoon?

617
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,320
(Framed as the scapegoat)
Zhuojie: What are you doing?

618
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,310
Zhuojie: My leg.

619
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,990
(Not learned from spilling drinks yet)
Zhuojie: Drink soda too.

620
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,090
(Not learned from spilling drinks yet)
Zhuojie: It’s Jawoon’s fault.

621
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,440
Jawoon: Yes.

622
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,800
Dokyun: Just kidding.

623
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,490
The game Zhuojie and Dokyun are playing is called “Black Magic.”

624
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,310
Dokyun: Oh, what did you choose?

625
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,190
It’s a guessing game where one person closes their eyes.

626
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,840
Meanwhile, the others pick an item in the area.

627
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,720
(Abdul exists in every country)
Meanwhile, the others pick an item in the area.

628
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,160
(Abdul exists in every country)

629
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,990
Black Magic has a secret signal.

630
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Zhuojie: Magic power.

631
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,440
But will Talay and Porsche catch the trick?

632
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,480
Talay: I think I know.
Zhuojie: Really?

633
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,960
F4: What are you playing?

634
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,430
F4: UNO.
Intouch: UNO...

635
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,080
(This gang has been playing UNO since day one until now)

636
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,040
(The youngest can’t keep up)

637
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,430
Dokyun: Okay, Talay.

638
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,170
Talay: Okay already?

639
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,950
Zhuojie: Come, come, come.

640
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,280
Zhuojie: This one?
Talay: No.

641
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,380
Zhuojie: This one?
Talay: No.

642
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,430
Zhuojie: How about this one?
Talay: No.

643
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,760
(Talay guessed wrong = still doesn’t know the secret of Black Magic)

644
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:46,550
Junsu: He writes about young people who couldn’t communicate

645
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,240
Junlan: I don’t believe it.

646
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,610
Junsu: They don’t have a way to communicate

647
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,730
Junlan: They do

648
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,610
Junsu: They don’t. He said that...
Junlan: They do

649
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,560
Junsu: They do, but...
Junlan: They do. He has, he has!

650
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,680
Junsu: He doesn’t have a phone

651
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,850
Zhuojie: Jawoon asked what that is
Jawoon: What is that?

652
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,070
Dokyun: Junsu

653
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,230
Junsu:
Dokyun: Junsu

654
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,000
Junsu: Yes

655
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,930
Dokyun: Come here a bit

656
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,480
(Finding more friends to play with)
Dokyun: We’re playing a guessing game.

657
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,880
(Finding more friends to play with)
(Friends = victims)

658
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,580
(Finding more friends to play with)
Junsu: Catching butterflies?

659
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,820
Zhuojie: No, it’s the Black Magic game

660
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,580
Talay: He said it’s Chinese magic

661
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,840
Zhuojie: The three of them played until they got dizzy

662
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,760
(Let’s trick others)

663
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,230
Talay: Chinese magic

664
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,200
Junsu: I don’t like it

665
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,920
(Don’t want to be a scammer)
Junsu: I don’t know how to play

666
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,390
Junlan: I want to keep reading this

667
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,840
Talay: I was trying to think if the wording is different, but it’s not

668
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,610
Porsche: Probably not, I think it’s the face

669
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,590
Jawoon: So tasty, Dokyun

670
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,110
Junsu: So...
Zhuojie: This one

671
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,960
(Acting also matters)

672
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,950
(The inner feeling must be right)
(Acting also matters)
Zhuojie: This one

673
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,880
(The inner feeling must be right)
(Acting also matters)

674
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,080
Porsche: Not giving signals?

675
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,360
(Consulting the cameraman even)
Porsche: Is it about the way you look?

676
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,920
(Consulting the cameraman even)

677
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,040
(Consulting the cameraman even)
Porsche: Looking at the face?

678
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,960
(Consulting the cameraman even)

679
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,160
(Consulting the cameraman even)
Porsche: Looking at the face?

680
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Talay: I think I know

Talay: He knows, he knows

686
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,920
(When the cameraman wants to join)

00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,680
Cameraman: Guess

688
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,880
Talay: So this is guessing?
Cameraman: Yes

689
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,240
Talay: Then you should turn away first

690
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,960
Cameraman: Yes

691
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:14,940

Zhuojie: You choose. Don’t...

694
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,640

695
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,440

696
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,530

700
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,080
Zhuojie: How about this one?

701
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,760
Zhuojie: This one

702
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,520

(Cameraman round 2)

708
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,320
Zhuojie: He already knows

709
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,100

Talay: Porsche, you won’t be able to sleep tonight

713
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,320
Porsche: No, you play. I’ll just stand and watch

714
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
(Porsche wants to catch slips up close)

715
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,230
Porsche: I’m confused now

716
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,160
Talay: Going over there?

717
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,190
Porsche: No, I’ll just watch from here

718
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,500
Zhuojie & Dokyun: Okay, okay

719
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,450
Talay: The theme of the game

720
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,160
(Zhuojie hinting at the trick like crazy)
Talay: It’s Black Magic

721
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,160

00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,200
Zhuojie: Talay wins

740
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,320
Porsche: I didn’t see anything

741
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,640

Zhuojie: Porsche, in his dreams

746
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
Zhuojie: What’s this

747
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,080
Zhuojie: What

748
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,590
Zhuojie: What

749
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,160

750
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,320
Talay: This one, this one

751
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:22,890

752
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,400

(Suspicious face)

757
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,960
(Suspicious face)
Junsu: What are you doing?

758
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,120
(19:53 Prachuap Khiri Khan Railway Station)

759
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,040
Talay: Let’s play a game

760
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,620
Talay: Okay, let’s go

761
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,200
Talay: It’s the game ‘If you don’t do it, you drink’

762
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,530
Junlan & Junsu: The game ‘If you don’t do it, you drink’

763
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,270
Talay: That’s right. It’s the game ‘If you don’t do it, you drink’

764
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,520
(Underage)
Junlan: I’m not even 18 yet

765
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Talay: No way

766
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,930
Rules of DRINKING GAME

Porsche: Pick one card

768
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,750
(Draw a card, do it, or drink)
Porsche: If you want to do it, do it

769
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,640
Porsche: If you don’t, then drink

770
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,170
Talay: Dokyun

771
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,150

Junlan: Dokyun

773
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,220

774
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,150
Porsche: Okay, like this then

775
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,960
(Tell your friend what you like about them)
Porsche: Tell your friend what you like most about them

776
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,920
Porsche: Tell one person...

777
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,870
Porsche: What do we like most about them?
Jawoon: Tell a friend...

778
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,590

779
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,480
(Likes F4)
Dokyun: F4
Talay: He always chooses...

780
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,390
Dokyun: Because F4 dances K-pop every day

781
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,820
(Likes F4 for his moves)

782
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,570

788
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,780

792
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,920

793
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,280
Zhuojie: Of course.

794
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,440

805
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,060

Porsche: Easy choice
Intouch: F4, F4

807
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,740
(F4 says “Only me”)
Talay: He’ll guess which artist you like

808
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,710
Talay: Say it, then he’ll guess

809
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,170
(Intouch can’t listen)
Porsche: No, no, cover your ears first

810
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,110

Junlan: Too easy

815
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,630

816
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,780

828
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,000
(Whoever wants to speak, raise your hand first)
Jawoon: Raise your hand first, then speak

829
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,650
Jawoon: Because it’s too loud, I can’t hear anything

830
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,910
Talay: I want to speak, like this?

831
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,870
Jawoon: Like, I have a question

832
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,580
