1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,610
Yesterday you failed the mission,

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,970
so you didn’t receive money or puzzle pieces.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,120
Third: Was the mission failed because of me?

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,730
(Yesterday)
Third: That caused my friends to fail the mission.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,760
(Yesterday)
Third: I feel like in all 4 bases everyone did really well.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,780
(Yesterday)
Third: And in the end I think it was probably because of me.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,810
(Yesterday)
Third: So I felt a bit bad.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,610
(Yesterday)
Third: And my friends told me it’s okay, it’s okay.

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,610
(Yesterday)
Third: Both Porsche, F4, or Intouch
who were there said it’s okay.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,890
Third: They told me it’s okay.
You don’t have to be good at everything.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,890
Third: So it made me feel a bit encouraged.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,800
Therefore, the show offers you to work together to make a Memory Book.

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,560
The rule is to pair up and each pair creates 1 page,

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,840
choosing from places you’ve been to, one each,

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,850
and design the cover together as a group.

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,390
(Meeting before making Memory Book)

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,210
Junsu: Porsche, do you have a plan?

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,450
Junsu: And you guys?

19
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,380
Porsche: I think we should each do one day.

20
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,080
Porsche: But we’ll do the farm first.

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,420
Jawoon: Farm? Okay, farm.

22
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,060
Jawoon: Farm?
Porsche: Yes.

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,250
Jawoon: Draw anything.

24
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,710
Jawoon: Break the rules, just draw what you think.
Porsche: Okay.

25
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,490
F4: We have to show art.

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,140
Porsche: Let’s start.

27
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,770
(Cute~~)

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,130
Bonus time.

29
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,130
Junlan: Where’s the mission?

30
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,870
But getting the jigsaw wasn’t as easy as they thought

31
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,960
Because the Boys Lost
must first pass the ultimate challenge mission

32
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,430
Junsu: Okay
Intouch: They started

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,700
Talay: Are we taking this one?

34
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,120
F4: Rock, paper, scissors?
Talay: Sure

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,910
Junsu: What are you doing?

36
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,830
(About to fall back!!)
Junsu: What are you doing?

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,800
Junsu: Are you coming up?

38
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,190
Junlan: Hurry!
Junsu: Come up!

39
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,760
Junlan: One

40
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,780
Junsu: Slowly

41
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,950
Talay: One, two, three

42
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,600
(Shouting gives strength)

43
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,560
Talay: Four

44
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,520
Talay: Five

45
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,180
(Giving it all)

46
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,260
Dokyun: No way

47
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,580
Zhuojie: What are you doing?

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,470
Dokyun: Okay

49
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,430
(What?)

50
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,950
(It fell out already)

51
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,180
Dokyun: You have to take it out

52
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,870
Dokyun: Okay, continue, continue!

53
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,990
Dokyun: Don’t eat it!

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,320
Dokyun: Don’t eat it!

55
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,860
Dokyun: Don’t eat it!

56
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,000
Dokyun: Hurry up!

57
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,600
Junsu: We got a card.

58
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,640
Junsu: We also got a jigsaw.

59
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,460
Dokyun: You guys found it?
Junsu: Found it, found it

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,360
Junlan: Where is it?

61
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,050
Third: Where is it?

62
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,810
Zhuojie: I know, I know!

63
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,110
Junsu: Where?

64
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,750
Talay: Where?
Junlan: China

65
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,260
Zhuojie: Thailand

00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,540
Zhuojie: Nangshi
Dokyun: Do you know it?

67
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,830
Talay: I don’t know.

68
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,760
Dokyun: In Korea? No, not here

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,380
Jawoon: No, no, no
Junlan: Zhuojie

70
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,530
Junlan: Zhuojie, this should be Chinese

71
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,570
Zhuojie: “Nangshi”?

72
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,550
Junsu: Where is Nangshi?

73
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,890
Zhuojie: Nangshi
Junsu: Nangshi

74
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,700
Junlan: Or is it...

75
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,740
Zhuojie: Nangshi in Thailand

76
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,290
F4: Thailand
Junlan: A lake in Hubei?

77
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,900
Jawoon: No, no, this comes from my heart

78
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,600
=Boys Lost in Thailand=
(Every Friday at 7:00 PM, only on WeTV.)

79
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,400
=Boys Lost in Thailand=
