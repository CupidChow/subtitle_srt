Intouch: I feel like I can surf and really enjoy it

176
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,760
Intouch: And I like it a lot

177
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,600
Intouch: After this show, I’ll probably go surfing for real

178
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,800
Intouch: It’s so much fun

179
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,880
Zhuojie: Junsu number one

180
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,450
Zhuojie: Junsu

181
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,330
Zhuojie: Because he told me

182
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,680
Zhuojie: He’s afraid of the sea

183
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,730
Zhuojie: Uh… but still

184
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,880
Zhuojie: He succeeded on the very first try

185
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,210
Zhuojie: So I think he’s amazing
Junsu: Thank you

186
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,210
Talay: Junlan

187
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,020
Junlan: I choose Junsu

188
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,100
Junlan: He had a trauma

189
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,560
Junlan: But he overcame this obstacle

190
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,370
Junlan: Yeah, and I think that he…

191
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,320
Junlan: I was really impressed that he…

192
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,900
(So touched I could cry)

193
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
(So touched I could cry)
Junlan: …that he was so supportive with everything

194
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,340
Junlan: he was so supportive with everything

195
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,600
Junlan: So I think he’s the best surfer

196
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,810
(About to cry)
Junlan: So I think he’s the best surfer

197
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,360
(About to cry)
Junsu: I’m going to cry

198
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,880
Junsu: I’m going to cry

199
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,940
Talay: Not now.

200
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,190
Jawoon: I also pick Junsu.

201
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,550
Jawoon: Even though he can’t swim,

202
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,880
Jawoon: He tried to get through the situation
or this pressure

203
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:55,900
Jawoon: And he really practiced hard before going into the ocean

204
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,930
Jawoon: And he…

205
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,170
Jawoon: Even when I was just having fun

206
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,540
Jawoon: Junsu was still working hard

207
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,950
Jawoon: Also

208
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,570
Jawoon: Even under pressure
he still took care of others

209
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,190
Jawoon: Like Junlan, Dokyun, and the other people too

210
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,060
Junlan: Exactly

211
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,890
Jawoon: I think Junsu is the best

212
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,960
Talay: Very impressive

213
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,250
Junsu: First of all, it feels really good
to be acknowledged by someone

214
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,780
Junsu: That’s a very good thing

215
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,910
Junsu: But even so, apart from me

216
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,180
Junsu: F4 and Intouch also did really well

217
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,930
Junsu: Maybe it’s because they knew
that I have trauma with water

218
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,880
Junsu: So they gave more credit
for me overcoming that fear?

219
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,270
Junsu: So maybe that’s why I was rated higher?

220
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,950
Talay: Cheers for Junsu!
Junsu: Cheers, cheers!

221
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,540
Talay: Careful, careful!

222
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,210
Junlan: You can’t, no, don’t

223
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,450
Zhuojie: Be careful, be careful

224
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,800
Talay: Just playing in water isn’t fun, better to play a game.

225
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,540
(Rules: Split into 2 teams, 11 items are thrown underwater)
Talay: Okay guys, attention!

226
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,040
(Whichever team collects more wins)
Talay: I’ll throw these into the water

227
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,190
(Whichever team collects more wins)
Zhuojie: The water is so salty

228
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,360
(Losing team must follow one order from winners)
Talay: We’ll split into two teams

229
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,480
(Losing team must follow one order from winners)
Talay: The team that collects six pieces first

230
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,220
Talay: will be the winning team, okay?

231
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,610
Everyone: Okay.

232
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,070

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,680

Jawoon: Okay

235
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,640
Junlan: Ready?
Dokyun: How do we split teams?

236
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,150
Junsu: International team and…

237
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,080
(Split into Thai team vs International team)
Talay: Thai team versus foreign team?

238
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,160
(Split into Thai team vs International team)
Junsu: Are you sure?
Porsche: Okay

239

241
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,600

Zhuojie: Hurry

253
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,590
Zhuojie: What is this?

254
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,870
Junsu: Junlan, Junlan!

255
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,400
Junlan: I’m pregnant!

256
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,620
Porsche: It’s placed there, grab it

257
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,350

(Foreign team 1 – 0 Thai team)

261
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,140
Junsu: Look at his pants, his pants…

262
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,370
Jawoon: Why does this happen every time

263
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,800
(Jawoon, be careful!!)
Zhuojie: Hey! Be careful, be careful!

264
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,040
Zhuojie: Look this way

265
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,200
Zhuojie: No, no, be careful

266
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,640
Zhuojie: I saw it

267
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,810
Talay: Careful

268
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,200
(Jawoon isn’t wearing swim underwear)

269
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,370
Zhuojie: No, no

270
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,320

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,480
(This swimming trunk…)
Jawoon: Director Pep, you chose this swimming trunk

276
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,880
(Director Pepsi chose it)
Jawoon: Director chose for me

277
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,710
Junlan: Guys!

278
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,010
Talay: Bring it here

279
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,930
Zhuojie: What are you doing?

280
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,840
(Porsche gets ganged up on!!)
Zhuojie: What are you doing?

281
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,030

417
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,800
(Do you like watching food programs?)
Jawoon: Do you like cooking programs?

418
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,320
Junlan: Yes.
F4: What?

419
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,720
Talay: Do you like watching food shows?

420
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,600
Jawoon: I also like watching cooking shows.

421
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,680
Jawoon: In Korean cooking shows, judges do it like this.

422
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,290

423
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,760

426
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,920
Jawoon: I think this is ketchup.

427
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,080
(Trying to be a food critic)
Jawoon: I think, uh, this is...

428
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,360
Jawoon: Uh, mayonnaise.

429
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,480
Jawoon: I think this is...

430
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,920
Jawoon: Really delicious.

431
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,040
Jawoon: A little bit, a little bit of sugar.

432
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,020
Talay: Jawoon, Jawoon

433
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,800
Junlan: Hey, bro!

434
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,870
Junlan: Try this one.

435
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,950
Talay: Kid your tongue

436
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,450
Dokyun: What is it? What is it?
Junlan: Kid your tongue

437
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,400
Jawoon: Wait, wait, wait.

438
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,770
(Think first)
Jawoon: Wait, wait.

439
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,200
(Think first)
Jawoon: This taste, I know it well.

440
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,660
Jawoon: This taste, I’m familiar with it.

441
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,790
Talay: What did you taste?
Junlan: What does your tongue say?

442
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,360
Zhuojie: Jawoon.

443
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,450
Zhuojie: It’s Dokyun’s leg.

444
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,720
Junlan: No.

445
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,460
Porsche: Okay, see you all tomorrow.

446
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,550
Junsu: See you everyone.

447
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,360
Porsche: 6:30
Junlan: 6:30.

448
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,840
Talay: 6:30.

449
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Porsche: 6:30, see you tomorrow.

450
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,690
Junlan: See you then.

451
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,290
Jawoon: Wait, 6:30?

452
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,190
Porsche: Yes.
Dokyun: Let’s go.

453
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,280
Junsu: Let’s go.

454
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,400
Intouch: Compact size, very easy to carry.

455
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,240
This is not just a normal alms-giving,

456
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,080
but Sky Alms-giving with a million-dollar view.

457
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,160
A highlight activity only found here.

458
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,500
Crew: One, two, three.

459
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,480
The picture in the jigsaw has become a beautiful reality before us.

460
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,840
So everyone took photos to capture this special moment.

461
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,630
And the memories that will stay in their hearts forever.

462
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,520
The boys went for a walk on the Beyond Sky-Walk,

463
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,900
a skywalk viewing point at Samet Nangshe,

464
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,920
the longest and highest one closest to the horizon in Phang Nga.

465
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,430
Anyone who comes here will be enchanted

466
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,450
by the beauty of the Andaman Sea

467
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,400
and the Samet Nangshe mountains as beautiful as a painting.

468
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,900
Talay: Fold it up…

469
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
Talay: Not something I wrote myself.

470
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,080
Porsche: What are you doing?

471
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,360
Talay: You’ll end up like Zhuojie.

472
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,480
Porsche: I can handle it.

473
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,600
Talay: You wrote it, right?

474
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,400
Talay: Why did you write in English?

475
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,920
Porsche: I don’t know.

476
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,290
Talay: You planned to play a game,
wanting me to guess it was someone else, right?

477
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,240
Porsche: Who did you think at first?

478
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,400
Talay: At first I thought it was Junsu or Junlan.

479
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,610
Talay: One of them.

480
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,190
Talay: Then I saw the last sentence.

481
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
Talay: Thank you for being an older brother.

482
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,420
Talay: And always giving me advice.

483
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,480
Talay: Must be you… bedtime talk.

484
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,840
Talay: I can’t translate, try to translate for me.

485
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,080
Porsche: Why? What’s hard about it?

486
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,960
Porsche: Well...

487
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,760
Porsche: Thank you for being a good brother since day one.

488
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,280
Porsche: I feel comfortable with you.

489
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,600
Porsche: And being with you, I don’t need to try too hard.

490
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,010
Porsche: And thank you...

491
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,520
Porsche: For your advice.

492
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,100
Talay: Thank you.

493
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,510
Porsche: And you wrote so long.

494
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,940
Porsche: But really, it’s kind of the same.

495
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,400
Talay: Let me see, I can’t remember.

496
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,630
Talay: Always listening to nonsense rambling.

497
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,000
Talay: Actually, I’m okay with everyone here.

498
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,240
Talay: But you are the one I can talk openly with the most.

499
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,880
Talay: You used “you” and “me” here.

500
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,960
Talay: I’m afraid people might figure out who it is.

501
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,000
Porsche: No way, bro.

502
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,030
Talay: Even though we’ve really known each other less than a month,

503
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,680
Talay: It feels like we’ve been close for a long time.

504
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,160
Talay: Thank you for always helping.

505
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,710
Talay: Driving, translating,

506
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,910
Talay: or even trying to bring people closer together.

507
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,260
Talay: Also cooking.

508
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,510
Talay: Don’t know what else to say since we’ve talked a lot.

509
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,760
Talay: Anyway...

510
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,180
Talay: I’m glad we met and got to know each other.

511
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,120
Talay: And for the people we’ve become close to,

512
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,520
Talay: I hope it stays like this forever,

513
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,240
Talay: even after this project ends.

514
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,120
Porsche: I think the show is ending.

515
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,720
Porsche: Right? Not sure.

516
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,570
Porsche: But I want...

517
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,910
Porsche: To know you more after this show ends.

518
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,920
Porsche: Thank you so much for
taking care of me during this program.

519
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,240
Porsche: I’m really happy
we made so many fun memories together here.

520
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,600
Porsche: Let’s go to Korea together.
I’ll take care of you, promise.

521
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,640
Porsche: From now on, I’ll take even better care of you.

522
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,550
Porsche: Let’s make happy experiences
in our lives together.

523
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,310
Porsche: I’m really grateful you are with me.

524
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,020
Porsche: And that you became my friend.

525
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,030
Porsche: I like you so much.

526
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,200
Jawoon: Oh, Little Che.

527
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,610
Porsche: Yeah!

528
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,920
Porsche: What are you doing?

529
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,880
Jawoon: Are these swim trunks?

530
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,760
Porsche: No.

531
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,360
Porsche: No, no, no.

532
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,670
Porsche: I got your letter.

533
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,640
Jawoon: This is my letter?
Porsche: Yeah.

534
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,480
Porsche: Do you remember what you wrote?

535
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,720
Jawoon: I remember.

536
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,320
Porsche: Actually my English writing...

537
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,980
Jawoon: It’s like...

538
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:07,880
Porsche: It’s okay.

539
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,080
Jawoon: Hard to read, right?

540
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,050
Porsche: No, it’s fine.

541
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,350
Jawoon: You understood what I wrote, right?
Porsche: Yes.

542
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,750
Porsche: We’ve known each other about two weeks.

543
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,870
Jawoon: No, no, no.

544
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,240
Porsche: Here you wrote “don’t believe,” right?

545
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,080
Jawoon: Don’t believe, don’t believe.
Porsche: Okay.

546
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,400
Porsche: I was trying to read that word.

547
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,880
Jawoon: The first time you saw this word you didn’t get it?

548
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,320
Porsche: No.

549
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,840
Jawoon: Did you get it?
Porsche: No.

550
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,320
Jawoon: You didn’t get it?
Porsche: Didn’t get it.

551
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,920
Porsche: Wait, wait, wait. Why?

552
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,410
Porsche: What?

553
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,440
Jawoon: Nothing. Uh… how do you feel?

554
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,880
Porsche: Feels good.

555
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,040
Jawoon: Say something, make it a sentence.

556
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:53,000
Porsche: What?
Jawoon: Not just words, make it a sentence.

557
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,560
Jawoon: Three sentences. Go.

558
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,620
Porsche: I feel the same thing.

559
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,480
Porsche: You know, we’re close.

560
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,590
Porsche: And I feel that you’re a really nice person.

561
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,670
Porsche: And also…

562
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Porsche: I mean like…

563
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,810
Porsche: We talk a lot.

564
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:09,520
Porsche: I feel like
we’ve known each other for a long time.

565
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,760
Porsche: From now on, we should hang out more.

566
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,550
Jawoon: Right.

567
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,800
Jawoon: Actually, I think…

568
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,480
Jawoon: I want to take care of you, but…

569
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,850
Jawoon: I don’t know how.

570
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,160
Jawoon: Because you’re perfect.

571
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,850
Jawoon: I always think about it.

572
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,390
Jawoon: Like how..

573
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,910
Jawoon: How can I be helpful to you?

574
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,360
Jawoon: You’re always caring to me and…

575
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,320
Jawoon: Sometimes you even cook for me.

576
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,560
Jawoon: Then next time, you cook for me.

577
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,320
Jawoon: Are you sure?
Porsche: Yes.

578
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,690
Porsche: Any Korean dish will do.

579
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,680
Jawoon: Korean food?
Porsche: Yes.

580
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,000
Jawoon: Bulgogi?

581
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,350
Porsche: Bulgogi?
Jawoon: Bulgogi.

582
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,400
Porsche: Okay.
Jawoon: Bulgogi.

583
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,840
Jawoon: I’ll make it for you next time.

584
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,630
Porsche: Sure. Promise?
Jawoon: Of course.

585
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,200
Porsche: I feel like he’s such a lovely person.

586
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,880
Porsche: And after being together, it feels like we’re really close.

587
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,880
Dokyun: Nice to meet you.

588
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,680
Dokyun: I’m really glad to meet you.

589
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,080
Dokyun: Nice to meet you.

590
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,640
Dokyun: Who’s this?

591
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,280
Dokyun: Who wrote it? Who?

592
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,920
Dokyun: Who is it?

593
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,460
Dokyun: Someone instantly came to my mind.

594
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,460
Dokyun: Is it Jeremy?

595
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,150
Dokyun: Really? Right?

596
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,590
Dokyun: No one else
only Jeremy would write something this simple.

597
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,520
Dokyun: Nothing.

598
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,400
Dokyun: No, there is. There is!

599
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,750
Dokyun: But…

600
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,840
(Nice to meet you.)
Dokyun: Nice to meet you.

601
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,770
Dokyun: Nice to meet you.

602
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,840
Dokyun: Zhuojie, this is…

603
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,840
Dokyun: Jeremy.

604
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,880
Zhuojie: Yes.

605
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,740
Dokyun: Why is your letter so short?

606
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,470
Dokyun: You wrote so short.

607
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,640
Dokyun: Is this all?

608
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,190
Zhuojie: It’s not that.

609
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,800
Dokyun: Say it.
Zhuojie: Well…

610
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:14,150
Zhuojie: I hope the hardships
you face in the future

611
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,840
Zhuojie: will be as little as this message.

612
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,120
Dokyun: Really?

613
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,930
Dokyun: But I was touched by your letter.

614
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,960
Dokyun: Really? Can you even read it?

615
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,530
Zhuojie: Of course.

616
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,000
Zhuojie: One, two, three.

617
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,510
Dokyun: Touched?

618
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,590
Zhuojie: Very touched.

619
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,670
Zhuojie: This…

620
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:36,320
Zhuojie: is something really meaningful.

621
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,560
Zhuojie: And… why did I write so little?

622
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,450
Zhuojie: Because this is my most genuine feeling.

623
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,240
Zhuojie: I’m really happy to have met you.

624
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,310
Zhuojie: Normally, whatever you do, you’re always so careful.

625
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,160
Zhuojie: And you’ve looked after me in so many ways.

626
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,610
Zhuojie: Because since I was young…

627
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,190
Zhuojie: It’s usually me who takes care of others.

628
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,190
Zhuojie: And you made me feel that…

629
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,540
Zhuojie: you really take good care of me.

630
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,380
Zhuojie: And you’re skilled in so many areas.

631
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,470
Zhuojie: Both as an actor, plus with other experiences.

632
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,010
Zhuojie: I’ve learned a lot from you.

633
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:13,920
Zhuojie: So…

634
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,950
Zhuojie: This is my truest feeling I want to tell you.

635
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,380
Dokyun: When I read this earlier…

636
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,880
Dokyun: I didn’t understand, but…

637
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,360
Dokyun: now I do.

638
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:30,080
Dokyun: After the show ends, what will you do?

639
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,890
Zhuojie: Don’t know.

640
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,720
Zhuojie: Nothing yet.

641
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,880
Dokyun: Let’s go eat together.

642
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:37,750
Zhuojie: Sure.

643
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,360
Dokyun: I’ll cook for you.

644
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,710
Zhuojie: You won’t poison me, right?

645
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,560
Zhuojie: Okay, okay. Your food is really delicious.

646
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,930
Dokyun: Fine.
Zhuojie: Really.

647
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:50,760
Zhuojie: You cook well, look handsome, perfect.

648
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,080
Dokyun: Oh really?

649
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,280
Zhuojie: No, not really.

650
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,980
F4: Have you read the letter yet?

651
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,720
Third: I have. At first, I thought you’d write to someone else.

652
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,600
F4: I wrote to Intouch.

653
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,160
F4: Back then, we were fighting, weren’t we?

654
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,720
F4: We fought often around the time of writing the letter.

655
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,240
F4: I didn’t think you’d write to me.

656
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,200
F4: I was nervous, but when I read it…

657
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,480
F4: Oh, it’s for me.

658
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,200
Third: At first, I hesitated on who to write to.

659
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,120
Third: Because I was afraid the other would feel bad.

660
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,240
Third: You understand, right?

661
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,410
Third: So in the letter…

662
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,600
Third: it’s what I wanted to say.

663
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,560
Third: Do you remember?

664
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,000
F4: Yeah, I just read it.

665
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,160
Third: My handwriting is bad.

666
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,920
F4: Not bad. Look.

667
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,280
F4: You’re such a kind person.

668
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,920
F4: Always helping and looking after others.

669
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,240
F4: I still remember the first day we met.

670
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,720
Third: I still really remember. Even today.

671
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
F4: I remember too.

672
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,360
Third: Yes. I feel…

673
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,510
Third: you’re probably the first one…

674
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,560
Third: Yeah, the first one
that I really talked to and got to know.

675
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,480
Third: Yes, so I want to thank you.

676
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,290
F4: What I wrote was…

677
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,120
F4: I wanted to thank you for knowing you and say I’m glad.

678
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,670
F4: And sorry for what I did.

679
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,640
F4: Sometimes I might’ve been moody with you.

680
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,800
F4: And I don’t even know why
I only get moody with you.

681
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,080
F4: Maybe because I feel comfortable enough
to show that side.

682
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,360
F4: Sometimes I got scolded.

683
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,920
Third: Not scolded, it’s guidance.

684
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,200
Third: If I didn’t care, I wouldn’t say anything.

685
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,480
Third: You get it, right?

686
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,140
Third: But I’m glad that…

687
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,200
Third: when F4 sulks at me like that…

688
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,880
Third: it means you’re really comfortable with me.

689
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,880
Third: Comfortable enough to sulk. You understand?

690
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,040
F4: Right..

691
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,500
Third: But I feel every time we fight…

692
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,880
Third: it makes us closer.

693
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,680
Third: And understand each other more.

694
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,520
Third: So every problem…

695
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,480
Third: we find a way through.

696
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,240
F4: Yes.

697
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,800
Third: So it feels like…

698
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,380
Third: we really got to know each other.

699
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,000
Third: From not understanding, then trying to.

700
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,240
Third: That’s a good thing.

701
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,160
F4: Look, there’s one more thing I didn’t write.

702
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,720
Third: What?

703
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,640
F4: Well, this extrovert here…

704
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,320
F4: will make you, the introvert, brighter.

705
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,720
F4: Promise.

706
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,120
Third: Okay.

707
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,920
Junlan: What are you doing?

708
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,260
Junsu: Don’t know.

709
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,480
Junlan: Why do you write so well?

710
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,280
Junsu: You write well too.

711
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,880
Junsu: It’s just…

712
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,360
Junlan: Actually, what I didn’t expect is…

713
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,240
Junlan: I’m really important to you.

714
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,820
Junsu: I truly think so.

715
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,150
Junlan: Actually, some words…

716
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Junlan: when face to face…

717
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,080
Junlan: I can’t say them, I can’t express them.

718
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,280
Junlan: I thought if it’s in writing…

719
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,150
Junlan: but I still couldn’t read it.

720
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,550
Junlan: Actually, what I wrote…

721
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,390
Junlan: are things I sometimes want to say
to you but it’s hard to say.

722
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,720
Junsu: Why?

723
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,350
Junlan: Because I don’t like it

724
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,320
Junlan: I can’t…

725
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
Junlan: I feel that some things…

726
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,930
Junlan: I can’t express when face to face.

727
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,570
Junsu: Yes.

728
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,090
Junsu: Yes, yes.

729
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,500
Junsu: But you think my personality is weird, right?

730
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,560
Junsu: You still think that?

731
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,590
Junlan: Because when we first met…

732
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,840
Junsu: Why say that?
Junlan: Our MBTI types are complete opposites.

733
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,240
Junsu: Yes, yes.
Junlan: So…

734
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,680
Junlan: When we first met,
our personalities didn’t match at all.

735
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,440
Junlan: But once I got to know you…

736
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,850
Junlan: I felt…

737
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,040
Junlan: Thank you for taking care of me.

738
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,920
Junlan: I gradually felt that…

739
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,120
Junlan: everyone has different personalities.

740
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,350
Junsu: But now you know, right?
Junlan: Yes.

741
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,970
Junlan: I feel you’re someone I can trust.

742
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,560
Junlan: Like I can trust.

743
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,640
Junlan: And when I read your letter

744
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,310
Junlan: It was just...

745
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,710
Junlan: I felt that

746
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,440
Junlan: I never imagined that

747
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,560
Junlan: I would be this important to you

748
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,560
Junsu: I also feel so honored
to have met you in this program..

749
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,680
Junsu: and I’m really very thankful

750
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,840
Junsu: To have gotten to know Junlan through this show

751
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,600
Junsu: Like...

752
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,860
Junsu: I’m not just saying it casually

753
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,190
Junsu: After the show ends, if we can...

754
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,480
Junsu: Travel together for real, that would be nice

755
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,120
Junsu: Like me going to Beijing

756
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,270
Junsu: Or Junlan coming to Seoul

757
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,620
Junsu: Or coming to where I live in Hong Kong

758
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Junsu: We once talked about that

759
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,960
Junsu: So in the end, this turned out pretty good, right?

760
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,600
Junsu: I can say that I’ve found someone I can trust

761
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:46,230
Junlan: If today Third goes to meet F4

762
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:49,040
Junlan: Let’s go stargazing together

763
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,670
Junlan: Answer me, answer me
Junsu: Maybe, maybe

764
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,010
Zhuojie: Intouch, he makes me feel...

765
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,980
Zhuojie: Like he’s a really thoughtful person

766
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,860
Zhuojie: And normally he’s not someone who talks a lot

767
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,070
Zhuojie: But in some of his actions

768
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,640
Zhuojie: And certain abilities of his
are truly amazing

769
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,040
Zhuojie: And he’s also very charming

770
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,670
Zhuojie: And this time, the thing is...

771
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,590
Zhuojie: You can only write one letter

772
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,830
Zhuojie: But actually, you also have things
you’d like to say to everyone, too

773
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,870
Zhuojie: It suddenly came to me

774
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,760
Zhuojie: This is one of...

775
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Zhuojie: The most beautiful memories in my life

776
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,520
Junlan: Between Jeremy, Seven, Zhuojie

777
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,720
Junlan: Which name do you like more?

778
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,450
Zhuojie: Okay

779
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,840
Zhuojie: I am Li Zai En

780
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,160
Talay: What?

781
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,230
Talay: What does that mean?

782
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,100
Jawoon: I am Li Zai En

783
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,230
Talay: I am Li Zai En

784
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,130
Jawoon: My Chinese name

785
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,780
Junlan: Porsche

786
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:03,920
Junlan: Do you have a Chinese name?

787
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:04,780
Porsche: Qiu Yang

788
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,000
Porsche: Qiu Yang

789
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,010
Junlan: Qiu Yang

790
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,240
Talay: Kim Porsche

791
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,450
Third: Everyone

792
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,760
Dokyun: What is it?

793
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,800
Talay: Another mission again?

794
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,400
Third: It’s a camping topic

795
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,310
Third: Yes, and also...

796
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,080
Third: It’s a question card

797
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,280
Talay: A question isn’t a mission

798
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,920
Talay: What is a camping topic?

799
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,140
Zhuojie: Read it out loud

800
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,280
Junlan: I want the golden card

801
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,720
Talay: Read it out loud

802
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,570
Third: It says each person draws one question

803
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:31,000
Third: And for each question
everyone must take turns answering until all finish

804
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,840
Talay: So every question must be answered by everyone

805
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,200
Third: Yes

806
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,850
Junlan: This way, let Jawoon start first

807
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,660
Talay: Go ahead, Jawoon

808
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,530
Jawoon: Lee Ja-woon

809
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,460
Talay: Lee Ja-woon

810
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,780
Zhuojie: Li Zai En

811
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,080
Zhuojie: Li Zai En

812
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,000
Dokyun: I’m the last one then

813
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,520
Zhuojie: Everyone has to draw one each
There are ten questions in total

814
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,360
Junsu: Thai first, Thai first

815
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,400
(Q: What did a friend do that made you feel sad or uncomfortable?)
Porsche: What did a friend do that made you feel sad or uncomfortable?

816
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,000
Porsche: What did a friend do
that made you feel sad or uncomfortable?

817
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:58,480
Talay: Sad?

818
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,700
Talay: Everyone’s going to take about three hours

819
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,620
Porsche: There was a time when you did like this
and you pushed me into the water

820
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:23,940
Jawoon: Sorry..

821
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,610
Porsche: It’s okay

822
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,420
F4: Mine? Well...

823
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,740
F4: There was one day, right,
when we went boxing together

824
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,620
F4: We were eating on the floor

825
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,540
(Jawoon) (F4)
F4: And there was rice placed there,
and I was sitting next to Jawoon

826
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,960
F4: And I didn’t know if Jawoon was hungry or what

827
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,840
F4: He lifted his leg, eating while we were talking

828
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,520
F4: Couldn’t tell which was rice and which was his foot

829
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,310
F4: I almost...

830
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,380
F4: Almost scooped his foot instead of rice to eat

831
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,200
Junsu: Translate it, translate it

832
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,760
Junsu: Translate it

833
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,430
Junsu: Just tell us

834
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,390
Porsche: It was the day we went boxing

835
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,330
Jawoon: When we were eating, right?
Porsche: When we were eating

836
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,270
Porsche: He sat next to Jawoon, and Jawoon did this

837
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,250
Porsche: Then eating, eating, eating

838
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,820
Porsche: While he was talking

839
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:04,970
Porsche: He didn’t notice

840
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,880
Porsche: And he almost scooped Jawoon’s foot with a spoon
Talay: The spoon, the spoon

841
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,540
Porsche: He didn’t know which was what,

842
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,930
Porsche: He wasn’t paying attention..

843
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:18,590
Porsche: and he almost scoop Jawoon’s foot with the spoon.

844
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,590
Jawoon: But I didn’t notice, right?

845
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,160
Porsche: He was fine with it

846
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,320
Talay: We didn’t remember anything
except the food in front of us

847
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,760
F4: But it’s fine because...

848
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,200
(Not hurt)
F4: It’s not hurtful

849
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,180
(Just not pleasant to the eyes)
F4: Just unpleasant to the eyes

850
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,540
Talay: It’s fine, it’s fine.

851
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,200
F4: Okay, it’s fine

852
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,050
Third: Mine

853
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,760
Third: Mine is about writing letters to friends

854
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,360
Third: Because I’m close to both of them,
like three, four, five, right?

855
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,360
Third: And I had to choose one, so I felt like

856
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,560
Third: If I chose one person, would the other feel hurt?

857
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,360
Third: Or if I chose one,
would the other feel hurt? Something like that

858
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,960
Third: So I felt a bit uncomfortable about that

859
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,160
Junlan: It seems not a love triangle, is it?

860
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,200
Junlan: Kidding..

861
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:08,440
(Q: Was there a moment you felt like we were getting close?)
Dokyun: Was there a moment you felt like,
hey, we’re really getting close?

862
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,960
Intouch: Was there a moment you felt like,
hey, we’re really getting close?

863
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,640
Dokyun: Probably when I casually
took off my shirt in front of friends

864
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,070
Dokyun: Okay, your turn

865
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,270
Jawoon: If you say it like that, then from the first day

866
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,390
Intouch: The moment I felt close was probably

867
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,560
Intouch: When we did the mango farm activity

868
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,120
Intouch: Where we had to work together, like...

869
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,400
Intouch: One person had to split tasks, do this and do that

870
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,360
Intouch: So at that time I felt we got closer
and more like a team

871
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,240
Intouch: Because we talked
and shared the pressure together

872
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,100
Intouch: Like we had to succeed, that kind of thing
and it was like...

873
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,080
Intouch: It was such a strong sense of teamwork

874
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,120
Intouch: And I felt I got to talk more with everyone

875
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,700
Intouch: So I felt closer

876
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:45,600
Junsu: Next

877
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,420
F4: And then...

878
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,340
Junlan: For me, it’s the journey from when we went from the mountain to the sea

879
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,250
Junlan: I felt like we were traveling together
like a family

880
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:02,260
Junlan: And we ate together every meal

881
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,540
Junlan: it was like a family trip for me..

882
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:09,640
Junlan: because we spent time together
almost 24 hours a day

883
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,380
Junsu: Next, next

884
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,550
Junsu: Talay, Talay

885
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,500
Talay: The moment I felt we got close

886
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,200
Talay: First of all, I’ll say...

887
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,080
Junlan: We slept together

888
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,360
Talay: Oh right

889
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,720
Talay: The moment I felt we got close,
I think it was when...

890
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,160
Talay: When we came here to Phang Nga
because I thought there wouldn’t be any more missions

891
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,660
Talay: There wasn’t anything like...

892
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,460
Junsu: There wasn’t any pressure anymore
Talay: Yes, no pressure at all anymore

893
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,620
Talay: So we could just be ourselves

894
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,020
Talay: I think it allowed me to let go
and allowed all of us to let go a lot

895
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,160
Talay: Okay, Thai

896
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:45,920
Jawoon: He said that...

897
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,610
Junlan: I’m so excited to hear something from you

898
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,930
Junsu & Junlan: Porsche, Porsche, Porsche

899
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,050
Porsche: I think in the first fews days because...

900
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,840
Porsche: I had to translate for everyone
and everyone had to talk to me

901
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:00,090
Porsche: So I felt like everyone was like...

902
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:02,050
Junlan: You were the message center

903
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:06,070
Junlan: You knew everything
You knew about Korea, knew about China

904
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,030
Junlan: And of course
you knew about Thailand too

905
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,130
Porsche: Because I had to translate everything

906
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,280
Junsu: Porsche
Jawoon: Me?

907
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,910
(Q: At first, what did you think joining the show would be like, and was it as expected?)
Porsche: Before joining the show,
what were your expectations for this experience?

908
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:18,290
Talay: Nothing.

909
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:21,550
Porsche: Did the reality match your expectation?

910
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,730
Talay: You, you, yes, yes
Jawoon: Me?

911
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,980
Jawoon: I...

912
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,240
Jawoon: I always thought that...

913
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,600
Jawoon: No expectations, no disappointments

914
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,780
Jawoon: So before I came here

915
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,250
Jawoon: I didn’t expect anything

916
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,150
Jawoon: Just let it be natural

917
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,950
Jawoon: And wanted to meet new friends

918
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,390
Jawoon: Friends from other countries

919
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,710
Jawoon: And I did it, so I feel really good

920
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,040
F4: At first I thought it would all be hard like...

921
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,230
F4: Would there be walls between us, things like that

922
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:56,440
F4: But once I got here
I felt like everyone was really friendly

923
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,680
F4: I got the experience

924
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,840
F4: Got friends you can’t buy in the market

925
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,440
(Got friends you can’t just buy anywhere?)
F4: I got experience and good friends
Junsu: Cry, cry

926
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,120
Junlan: We love you because you...

927
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,330
Junsu: Crying, crying, you have to cry now

928
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,910
Junlan: Because you’re kind
Talay: Don’t cry, don’t cry

929
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,640
Junsu: Crying, crying

930
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,920
F4: I don't cry

931
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,310
Jawoon & Junsu: Next question

932
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,720
(Q: What habit of a friend did you not understand at first, but now you do?)
Intouch: What habits or behaviors of each other...

933
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,280
Intouch: At first I didn’t understand, but now I’m starting to get it.

934
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,130
Junsu: Okay.

935
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,310
Junsu: For me...

936
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,760
Junsu: When I first met Junlan,

937
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,940
Junsu: he was quite...

938
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,830
Junsu: like, whenever he wanted to go out,

939
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,410
Junsu: he always wanted someone to go with him.

940
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:41,320
Junsu: But as for me, I’m really an independent person

941
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,640
Junsu: So it was hard to understand him,

942
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:46,930
Junsu: at the first meeting.

943
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:52,780
Junsu: But once we got closer
I understood him more.

944
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,420
Jawoon: Okay, next person.

945
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,050
Talay: At first I didn’t understand, but now I do.

946
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,220
Jawoon: Nu Lay Lay
Talay: What?

947
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,270
Talay: I remember now!

948
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:03,950
Jawoon: Say it quickly.

949
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,240
Talay: Makeup.

950
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,500
Talay: Some people have to wake up...

951
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,080
Talay: Many wake up really early,

952
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,820
Talay: just to do makeup for hours.

953
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,480
Talay: I didn’t understand what they were doing, felt like...

954
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,040
Jawoon: That’s why I wake up late.

955
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,160
Talay: How long do you take to put on makeup?
Jawoon: That’s the reason...

956
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:23,570
Jawoon: Just 15 minutes, 10 minutes, or 20 minutes.

957
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,680
Jawoon: Right?

958
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,700
Jawoon: That’s why we wake up late.

959
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,740
Talay: Yesterday Porsche only took 5 minutes.

960
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,100
Jawoon: Five minutes?

961
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,680
(Porsche is really good!)
Jawoon: So good.

962
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,960
Junsu: Next, next.

963
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:35,580
Junsu: Porsche.

964
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,120
Porsche: Something I already said before is...
why...

965
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,280
Porsche: Jawoon likes changing clothes without closing the door.

966
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,150
Jawoon: I’m just like you guys who...

967
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:55,020
Jawoon: are sensitive about makeup.

968
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,520
Jawoon: Like, when Junlan finished his makeup,

969
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:57,600
Jawoon: he came to me.

970
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,830
Jawoon: But at that time I was busy.

971
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,680
Junlan: But you always look good, like
straight out of a magazine.

972
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,360
Jawoon: And then Junlan would ask about 5 times.

973
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:05,990
(Hyung)
Jawoon: Hyung.

974
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:06,940
(Hyung)
Jawoon: Hyung.

975
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,640
(Is it okay?)
Jawoon: Is it okay?

976
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,230
(Pretty?)
Jawoon: Pretty?

977
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,750
Jawoon: Pretty? Pretty?

978
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,720
(Pretty?)
Jawoon: Pretty? Pretty? Pretty?

979
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,510
Jawoon: It was so strange, because I didn’t...

980
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:16,320
(Pretty?) Junsu: Pretty? Pretty? Pretty?

981
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,800
Junlan: Stop talking.

982
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,590
Junsu: Last question.

983
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,660
Junlan: Last question, Intouch.

984
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,830
Everyone: Intouch.

985
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,080
Junlan: Intouch.

986
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,200
(Q: If you had another chance, which friend would you choose to travel with?)
Intouch: If you had another chance, which friend would you choose to travel with?

987
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,620
Zhuojie: Just one person?

988
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,840
Dokyun: You first.

989
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:36,120
Zhuojie: I’d choose Junlan
because he’s really good with languages.

990
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,460
Zhuojie: He helped me a lot.

991
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,360
Junsu: He chose Junlan
because Junlan can speak English.

992
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,150
Junlan: It’s a joke.

993
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,580
Zhuojie: Just kidding.

994
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,820
Zhuojie: If I had to choose, I’d pick Dokyun.

995
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,530
Zhuojie: Yes, yes.

996
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,160
Jawoon: Do you guys know Tom and Jerry?

997
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,400
Jawoon: Tom and Jerry.

998
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,000
Jawoon: I feel just like Tom and Jerry.

999
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,120
Jawoon: You can only pick one, tell us.

1000
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,100
Dokyun: Honestly, I’d pick Jeremy.

1001
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,240
Zhuojie: I don’t want to, I don’t want to.

1002
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:07,160
Zhuojie: Okay, thank you very much.

1003
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,660
Dokyun: Because...

1004
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,830
Dokyun: Like I said in the interview,

1005
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,740
Dokyun: the person I most want to travel with
is the funniest person.

1006
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,980
Dokyun: And Jeremy...

1007
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:20,820
Dokyun: really makes me laugh a lot.
So next time I want to travel with Jeremy again.

1008
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,810
Dokyun: Right, Zhuojie?

1009
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,000
Junsu: For me...

1010
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,820
Junsu: Of course I’d choose Junlan, 100 percent.

1011
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,440
Zhuojie: Because I love him.

1012
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,530
Junsu: Because we don’t have language barriers.

1013
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,270
Junsu: Why are you guys laughing?

1014
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,490
Talay: Because the heart says so.

1015
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:45,610
Junsu: No, no, no.

1016
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,470
Junsu: Translate, translate.

1017
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,900
Talay: You want me to translate?

1018
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:49,630
F4: Fine.

1019
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:55,690
Talay: Junsu chose Junlan
because his heart called for it.

1020
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,940
Talay: That’s all.

1021
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,320
Junlan: Okay.
Junsu: Next, next.

1022
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,880
Junlan: I choose him because he chose me.

1023
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,560
Jawoon: Liar.

1024
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,960
Junlan: That’s not a reason..

1025
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:10,150
Junlan: So.. I feel like

1026
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,550
Junlan: I kinda trust him about 95 percent right now

1027
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,740
Junsu: 95?

1028
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,180
Junlan: Right now it’s 95 percent
that I’ll choose him.

1029
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:21,480
Junlan: But after the travels,
it could be 100 percent.

1030
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,980
Junsu: Then I’ll give you 99.

1031
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,360
Junlan: If now it’s 95 percent.

1032
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,080
Junsu: I’ll give 99.

1033
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,670
Junlan: After the trip maybe it’ll be 96.

1034
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,420
Junsu: Like it has to slowly increase...

1035
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,670
Junlan: Yes, I feel like...

1036
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,520
Junlan: I’m going to definitely pick him.

1037
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,360
Jawoon: Next.
Talay: Next, Porsche.

1038
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,870
Junlan: I’m really curious.

1039
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,750
Junlan: Who will you choose?
Junsu: Who will you choose?

1040
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,940
Porsche: No, not yet..

1041
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,960
Porsche: For me,

1042
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,230
Porsche: I’ll choose...

1043
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,250
Porsche: I’ll choose Jawoon, because...

1044
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,430
Porsche: I don’t think I’ll get to see him much when he goes,

1045
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,680
Porsche: Like he has to...

1046
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,630
Porsche: go back and forth, Thailand-Korea.

1047
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:57,100
Porsche: So if we go on a trip,

1048
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,920
Porsche: I’ll choose him.

1049
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,410
Porsche: Like...

1050
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,340
Porsche: If it’s with Thai friends, it’s like…

1051
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,870
Porsche: we could see each other easily.

1052
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,880
Jawoon: Where are my artificial tears?
I want to cry.

1053
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,200
Junsu: Next.
Jawoon: For me...

1054
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,720
Jawoon: I choose Porsche too, 100 percent.

1055
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:27,340
Jawoon: Next time I really want to go camping with Porsche.

1056
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:33,030
Jawoon: Because I promised
next time I’ll cook for him.

1057
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,590
Jawoon: Of course I’m not good at cooking, but...

1058
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,410
Jawoon: This is 2025,
and ChatGPT will help me.

1059
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,800
Talay: F4, what were you about to say?

1060
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,640
F4: Just thank you to all the hyungs.

1061
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,600
F4: As the youngest one, things like that...

1062
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,120
F4: I’m really thankful for everyone’s support.

1063
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:58,960
F4: For always checking on me, guiding me, teaching me,
like “you should do this.”

1064
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,010
F4: Always encouraging me with positivity.

1065
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:05,160
F4: And thank you to the producers.

1066
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,680
F4: Thank you to the show for choosing this kid,
giving this kid a chance.

1067
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,440
F4: To come and experience life like this.

1068
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:15,680
F4: It’s another side of life I got to try.

1069
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,820
F4: I never thought in this life I would...
Junsu: He’s crying.

1070
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,590
F4: ...have this many foreign friends.

1071
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:24,040
F4: And I never thought I
could speak English this much.

1072
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,680
F4: It’s been a period of learning languages.

1073
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,360
F4: Everything happened so fast.

1074
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,330
F4: But I also want to thank myself for being brave,

1075
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:38,080
F4: for being hardworking, always seeking knowledge,
to connect with others.

1076
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,590
F4: So thank you everyone so much.

1077
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,080
Talay: Well done, little brother.

1078
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,280
Jawoon: I really don’t understand, what happened?

1079
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,710
Junsu: Why are you crying...?

1080
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,120
Talay: I don’t understand but I can feel it.

1081
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,280
Zhuojie: Really impressive.

1082
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,400
Zhuojie: Let’s hug F4.

1083
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,160
Junsu & Junlan: Hug, hug.

1084
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,890
Zhuojie: Everyone, Boys Lost in Thailand!

1085
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:59,880
Zhuojie: One, two, three!
Everyone: Energy!

1086
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,160
When ten boys from three countries

1087
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,440
had to get to know each other.

1088
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,300
Third: First, second, third.

1089
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,420
Dokyun: Third?

1090
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,720
Third: No, no, no.
Dokyun: Ohh, not that, not that.

1091
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,520
Junlan: Where are the eggs?

1092
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,480
Porsche: Should we get two, just in case?

1093
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,760
Talay: Oh, I also bought eggs.

1094
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,580
Junlan: Egg party!

1095
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,860
Jawoon: You get it?
Third: Tom Yum, Shrimp Tom Yum.

1096
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,800
Through completing many missions,

1097
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,280
Everyone: Junlan, Junlan, Junlan!

1098
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,000
Sometimes they might fail,

1099
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,760
but along the way they learned about each other.

1100
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,120
Porsche: I pick Jawoon.

1101
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,320
They opened up to one another.

1102
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,370
Junsu: I’m ESTJ.

1103
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:05,110
Junlan: The worst MBTI.

1104
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,100
Junlan: Back then there were moments when...

1105
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,920
Junlan: But today, after talking with him,

1106
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,920
Junlan: he’s actually really important for me.

1107
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,480
Talay: Now I try to talk with him more.

1108
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,380
Talay: So he talks with me more too.

1109
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,040
Intouch: In the later episodes I felt I improved.

1110
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,520
Intouch: And I felt
more confident in doing things.

1111
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,400
And they became a part of each other.

1112
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,620
Dokyun: Today, even though I got the gold card for the shared bedroom,

1113
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,450
Dokyun: I won’t take it
and will go take care of Zhuojie in the living room.

1114
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,780
Junlan: Today we made
a memory journal together.

1115
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:43,530
Junlan: Remembering both past moments and life in this house.

1116
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:47,000
Maybe the true goal

1117
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,305
wasn’t just completing missions,

1118
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:50,640
Junsu: Let’s say goodbye to this house.
Jawoon: Bye-bye.

1119
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,760
Junsu: What’s up, everyone?
Everyone: Goodbye.

1120
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,880
However, to grow together..

1121
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:17,810
Staff: The seaside fine dining meal booked
for ten guests is ready.

1122
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:20,120
Talay: F4’s treat!

1123
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,640
Dokyun: The thing I feel most grateful for?

1124
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,400
Dokyun: Actually I’m thankful for every moment.

1125
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,690
Dokyun: But just being in such a beautiful place

1126
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,650
Dokyun: already feels like a huge memory.

1127
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,640
Everyone: Boys Lost in Thailand!

1128
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,720
Junsu: Bottoms up, bottoms up!

1129
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,030
Jawoon: I want to keep looking after Porsche.

1130
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,370
Jawoon: Porsche has no flaws at all.

1131
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,110
Jawoon: Like, he always does everything perfectly.

1132
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,140
Jawoon: He can do everything on his own really well.

1133
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:04,160
Jawoon: So I’ll keep watching,
to see where I can take care of him.

1134
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,800
Porsche: Thank you for being a good bro since day one.

1135
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,720
Porsche: I feel comfortable being with you.

1136
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,200
Porsche: I feel like when I’m with you,
I don’t have to try too hard.

1137
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,080
Porsche: Thank you for giving me advice.

1138
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,230
Talay: I want to thank Junlan
for opening up to me.

1139
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,280
Talay: And for handling things together with me.

1140
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,800
F4: Normally I hug my stuffed dog.

1141
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,850
F4: But when Third came,

1142
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,450
F4: I didn’t need my stuffed dog anymore when playing.

1143
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,190
Junsu: I got so much bright energy from F4.

1144
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:39,950
Junsu: Can I say that...
he’s someone who gives laughter to others?

1145
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,680
Junlan: I think...

1146
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,930
Junlan: I think all of our experiences
have been recorded.

1147
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,940
Junlan: So I feel really happy.

1148
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,600
Junlan: But the thing that made me happiest

1149
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,350
Junlan: about joining this show,

1150
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,680
Junlan: was meeting you.

1151
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,360
Third: Intouch is also a comfort zone for me.

1152
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,280
Third: Because our personalities are very similar.

1153
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,440
Third: Someone I can really talk about anything with.

1154
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,440
Intouch: Coming to the sea,
I feel I got close with Jeremy.

1155
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,480
Intouch: And we can talk all the time.

1156
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,800
Intouch: I feel we can stay close in the future.

1157
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,400
Intouch: Like we can talk about everything.

1158
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,730
Dokyun: And for Jawoon, I...

1159
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:23,940
Dokyun: Because we’re close, sometimes I curse.

1160
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,080
Dokyun: And sometimes I scold him.

1161
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,220
Dokyun: But I do thank him so much
for always listening well.

1162
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,920
Zhuojie: The letter I wrote to Dokyun said...

1163
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:35,060
Zhuojie: Nice to meet you.

1164
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,050
Zhuojie: And I want to write to everyone too.

1165
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,290
Zhuojie: I’m really happy to have met you all.

1166
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,430
Zhuojie: Nice to meet you, everyone.

1167
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,760
Everyone : Boys Lost in Thailand!
