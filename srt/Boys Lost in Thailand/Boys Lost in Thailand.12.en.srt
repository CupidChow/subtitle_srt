40
00:01:17,563 --> 00:01:18,969

56
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,838
Intouch: Right now we have about 23,000.
But it’s not enough.

57
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:52,935
Intouch: Not enough to go there.

58
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,983
(Beyond Skywalk Nanshi, Phang Nga province)
Intouch: Let’s discuss together first.

59
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:57,255
(Beyond Skywalk Nanshi, Phang Nga province)
Intouch: How can we get there?

60
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,240
Talay: We can go by plane,
but we’ll have to vote someone out.

61
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,640
(If go by plane must vote someone out)

00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:09,600
Talay: I once went south of Thailand by car.

66
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,600
Talay: Took about ten hours.

67
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,752
Junsu: Train takes about ten hours?
Talay: Yes, yes.

68
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,360
F4: But train only goes as far as Surat Thani.

69
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,880

70
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,535

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,560

then continuing by car to Phang Nga.

79
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,760
Just thinking about it is exciting.

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,759

Junsu: Please

100
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,104
The game Zhuojie and Dokyun are playing is called “Black Magic.”

101
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:25,680
Dokyun: Oh, what did you choose?

102
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,600
It’s a guessing game where one person closes their eyes.

103
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,400
Meanwhile, the others pick an item in the area.

104

107
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Zhuojie: Magic power.

108
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,920
But will Talay and Porsche catch the trick?

109
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,720
Talay: I think I know.
Zhuojie: Really?

110
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,120
F4: What are you playing?

111
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:55,696
F4: UNO.
Intouch: UNO...

112
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,640
(This gang has been playing UNO since day one until now)

113
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,600
(The youngest can’t stand it)

114
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,889
Dokyun: Okay, Talay.

115
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:07,734

Talay: No.

119
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,800
Zhuojie: How about this one?
Talay: No.

120
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,320
(Talay guessed wrong = still doesn’t know the secret of Black Magic)

121
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Junsu: He writes about young people who couldn’t communicate

122
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:26,335
Jawoon: Very tired, very sleepy

123
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,520

Zhuojie: Sawadee ka

132
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:53,694
