1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,040
This is not just a normal alms-giving,

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,840
but Sky Alms-giving with a million-dollar view.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,920
A highlight activity only found here.

4
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,120
Zhuojie: This one is really spicy.

5
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,479
Talay: Eat... eat a lot.

6
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,200
Junlan: Eat a lot.

7
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:11,360
Talay: Eat a little.

8
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,560
Junlan: Eat a little.

9
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,640
Intouch: Eat a lot

10
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:24,152
Jawoon: Hey guys!

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,080
Jawoon: Attention, look at this.

12
00:01:43,926 --> 00:01:46,606
Talay: I can’t translate, try to translate for me.

13
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:51,652
Porsche: Thank you for being a good brother since day one.

14
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,013
Porsche: I feel comfortable with you.

15
00:01:55,826 --> 00:01:58,870
Porsche: And being with you, I don’t need to try too hard.

16
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:02,114
Porsche: And thank you for your advice.

17
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:04,793
Talay: Thank you.

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,520
Jawoon: I want to take care of you, but...

19
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,890
Jawoon: I don’t know how.

20
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,200
Jawoon: Because you’re perfect.

21
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:12,909
Jawoon: I always think about it.

22
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,430
Jawoon: Like how...

23
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,950
Jawoon: How can I be helpful to you?

24
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,400
Jawoon: You’re always caring to me and...

25
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:23,406
Jawoon: Sometimes you even cook for me.

26
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:25,679
Jawoon: Then next time, you cook for me.

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,360
Jawoon: Are you sure?
Porsche: Yes.

28
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,185
Porsche: Sure. Promise?
Jawoon: Of course.

29
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,286
Dokyun: Touched?

30
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:36,367
Zhuojie: Very touched.

31
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:37,438
Zhuojie: This...

32
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,089
Zhuojie: is something really meaningful.

33
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,320
Zhuojie: And... why did I write so little?

34
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:47,211
Zhuojie: Because this is my most genuine feeling.

35
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:50,002
Zhuojie: I’m really happy to have met you.

36
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,066
Zhuojie: Normally, whatever you do, you’re always so careful.

37
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:55,917
Zhuojie: And you’ve looked after me in so many ways.

38
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:58,368
Zhuojie: Because since I was young...

39
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:01,993
Zhuojie: It’s usually me who takes care of others.

40
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,020
Zhuojie: And you made me feel that...

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,370
Zhuojie: you really take good care of me.

42
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,210
Zhuojie: And you’re skilled in so many areas.

43
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,300
Zhuojie: Both as an actor, plus with other experiences.

44
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:16,864
Zhuojie: I’ve learned a lot from you.

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,750
Zhuojie: So...

46
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,620
Zhuojie: This is my truest feeling I want to tell you.

47
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,220
Third: At first, who did you think I was writing this for?

48
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,720
F4: I thought you wrote it for Intouch.

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,180
F4: Back then, we were fighting, weren’t we?

50
00:03:29,181 --> 00:03:31,741
F4: We fought often around the time of writing the letter.

51
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:34,293
F4: I didn’t think you’d write to me.

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,320
F4: I was nervous, but when I read it...

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,600
F4: Oh, it’s for me.

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,274
Third: At first, I hesitated on who to write to.

55
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,195
Third: Because I was afraid the other would feel bad.

56
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,360
Third: You understand, right?

57
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,530
Third: So in the letter...

58
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:48,686
Third: it’s what I wanted to say.

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,680
Third: Do you remember?

60
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
F4: Yeah, I just read it.

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
Third: My handwriting is bad.

62
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:58,486
Junlan: If today Third goes to meet F4

63
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:01,297
Junlan: Let’s go stargazing together

64
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,004
Junlan: Answer me, answer me
Junsu: Maybe, maybe

65
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:14,601
Zhuojie: The thing is...

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,466
Zhuojie: We can only write one letter

67
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:21,697
Zhuojie: But actually, you also have things
you’d like to say to everyone, too

68
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:23,721
Zhuojie: It suddenly came to me

69
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,602
Zhuojie: This is one of...

70
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,950
Zhuojie: The most beautiful memories in my life

71
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:36,399
F4: I’m really thankful for everyone’s support.

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,510
F4: For always checking on me,

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,640
F4: guiding me, teaching me,

74
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:43,171
F4: like “you should do this.”

75
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:43,825
F4: Always encouraging me.

76
00:04:44,032 --> 00:04:46,879
F4: I never thought in this life I would...
Junsu: He’s crying.

77
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,511
F4: ...have this many foreign friends.

78
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:51,910
F4: And I never thought I
could speak English this much.

79
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,641
F4: It’s been a period of learning languages.

80
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,230
F4: Everything happened so fast.

81
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,200
F4: But I also want to thank myself for being brave,

82
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,950
F4: for being hardworking, always seeking knowledge,
to connect with others.

83
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,749
F4: So thank you everyone so much.

84
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,950
Talay: Well done, little brother.

85
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:12,281
Jawoon: I really don’t understand, what happened?

86
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,050
Junsu: Why are you crying...?
Talay: You don’t understand but you can feel it.

87
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,150
Zhuojie: Really impressive.

88
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,270
Zhuojie: Let’s hug F4.

89
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,030
Junsu & Junlan: Hug, hug.

90
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,791
Zhuojie: Everyone, Boys Lost in Thailand!

91
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,032
