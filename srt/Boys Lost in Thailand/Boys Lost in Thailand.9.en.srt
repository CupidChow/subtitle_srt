1
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,800
Third: Today,
both of us and our eight friends

2
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,120
Third: are doing a fashion show with mud-dyed tie-dye fabric.

3
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,600
Talay: Let’s go!
Junlan: Let’s go.

4
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,960
F4: I saw others dressing minimally,
simple and casual.

5
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,680
F4: We went the opposite.
We wore black, leather jackets, and sequins.

6
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,050
Junlan: When you see the other groups,

7
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,330
Junlan: even if they look classy, it doesn’t look expensive.

8
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,120
After the show, post the finished look on Instagram
and tag each other as collaborators.

9
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,400
We have a special reward for whoever gets the most likes
within 15 minutes

10
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,880
And the ones who got the most likes are Talay and Junlan

11
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,400
(Talay is awake.)

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,760
(Intouch is still asleep.)

13
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,880
(F4 is awake.)

14
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,080
(Dokyun and Junlan are exercising.)

15
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,120
(Third blow-drying his hair.)

16
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:13,040
(Zhuojie cooking)

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,240
(Huh?)

18
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,080
(Smells like delicious food)

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,080
(So tasty...)

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,880
(Dreaming of eating food)

21
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,400
F4: Today, I’ll be doing makeup for Third

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,010
F4: Using foundation
and Chat brand cosmetics

23
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,680
Third: That’s right.

24
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,440
F4: First, use foundation, shade 1.5 Vanilla

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,360
(Foundation first)
F4: First, use foundation, shade 1.5 Vanilla

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,240
(Shade 1.5 Vanilla)
F4: First, use foundation, shade 1.5 Vanilla

27
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,010
Third: Vanilla, yes

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,600
F4: Just squeeze a little bit
and use Chat’s brush too

29
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,360
F4: Dab and press lightly around your face

30
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,280
F4: Let the brush press the foundation in like this

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,040
F4: Then dab it right on the face like this

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,480
F4: This foundation can be used by Thais.

33
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,280
(Usable for Thais)
F4: This foundation can be used by Thais.

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,800
(Usable for Thais)
Third: Yes.

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Third: Because it matches Thai skin tones.

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,120
(Suitable for Asians)
Third: And also for Asians.
F4: That’s right.

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,920
F4: Lightweight but with strong coverage
just a little goes a long way, and the price is affordable too

38
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,160
F4: Next, we’ll use blush stick
from Chat as well.

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,560
(Cream blush stick)
F4: Next, we’ll use blush stick
from Chat as well.

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
F4: The color is beautiful, shade Sweet Melon

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,720
F4: Here, look at the color

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,080
(Pretty sweet color)

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,800
F4: And the technique is to blend
for a natural flush as usual.

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,880
F4: Use the same brush and dab around

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,200
F4: After that, smile

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,520
F4: And the color is set nicely on the face.

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
F4: That’s it, just brush a little on the nose.

48
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,040
Third: But if you don’t have a brush, the other end has a built-in one.

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,600
F4: Yes, exactly
Third: That lets you blend it in.

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,600
F4: Very easy to use.

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,240
F4: That’s it for this simple makeup look.

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,000
F4: Using Chat’s foundation and blush stick

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,880
F4: You can buy them at leading stores nationwide.

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,320
(Go grab one!)
F4: You can buy them at leading stores nationwide.

55
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,080
(Go grab one!)
F4: You can buy them at leading stores nationwide.
Third: That’s right.

56
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,550
Junsu: What’s today’s mission?

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,260
(Morning in Zhuojie’s style)
Junsu: What’s today’s mission?

58
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,030
Zhuojie: Good morning, F4. Good morning, Third
Junsu: Good morning

59
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,130
Junsu: Good morning, good morning everyone
Porsche: Good morning

60
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,040
Junsu: Good morning everyone

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,080
Dokyun: Hello

62
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,920
(Ready for a high-five)

63
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,760
(Jawoon pretends not to see.)

64
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,880
(Pretends to walk away)

65
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,040
(I’ll clap my own hand then.)

66
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,120
(Today you’re done for, Jawoon!!!)

67
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,160
Talay: Hello

68
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,280
Talay: Hello everyone
Junlan: Hello everyone

69
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,000
Talay: Hello, you lowlifes

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,920
(Lowlifes!!)

71
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,760
(So harsh!!)

72
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,640
(So you guys are second-class, huh)

73
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,320
(So you guys are second-class, huh)
Talay: I slept so well, I don’t want to touch you anymore.

74
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,880
Talay: I slept so well, I don’t want to touch you anymore.

75
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,160
(Story from yesterday)
Last night, Talay and Junlan

76
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,400
(Story from yesterday)
completed the mission with the most likes,
so they received the special twin bed room.

77
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,730
(Story from yesterday)

78
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,600
(Story from yesterday)
Junlan: This is my dream bed!

79
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,560
(Story from yesterday)
Junlan: Oh my god

80
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,690
(Story from yesterday)
Junlan: Guys, that's for girls...

81
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,120
(How was last night?)
Junsu: How was last night?

82
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,290
(Junsu cares about last night.)
Junlan: Why?
Junsu: How was last night?

83
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,290
(Junsu cares about last night.)
Talay: I slept soundly.

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,400
Junsu: Slept soundly?
Talay: No one walked around my bed.

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,320
(Too straightforward)
Junsu: Because of him?

86
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,440
Talay: No, nothing

87
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,300
Junlan: There’s even a bathtub upstairs
Junsu: A bathtub?

88
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,970
Junlan: Yes.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,850
Junlan: And we took a hot bath.
Jawoon: A hot bath?

90
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,930
Jawoon: You guys...
Dokyun: Really?

91
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,320
(Took a bath together??)
Jawoon: Did you guys bathe together?

92
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,480
Junlan: No, no, no!
Talay: No, no, no!

93
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,830
Junlan: No, no

94
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,840
Zhuojie: Jawoon, you must sleep together, bathe together

95
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,200
Zhuojie: Do everything together, everything

96
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,190
Junlan: It was very good, everything was nice.

97
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,100
Junlan: Don’t be jealous

98
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
Hello everyone

99
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,920
Let’s recap, so you don’t forget the mission:

100
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,200
You must gather money to reach the goal

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,160
to go on a journey together and see the beauty of Thailand.

102
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,760
As of today, how much money do you have left?

103
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,000
Intouch: Right now we have 13,000 baht left.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,440
(Remaining balance: 13,000 baht)
Intouch: Right now we have 13,000 baht left.

105
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,120
(Remaining balance: 13,000 baht)
Intouch: Because we spent almost 2,000 baht yesterday.

106
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,800
Intouch: Because we spent almost 2,000 baht yesterday.

107
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,560
Today all 10 of you must go complete a mission.

108
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,280
Please draw lots to choose the location
for today’s mission.

109

111
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,840

112
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,840

Porsche: Napak Muaythai Gym

117
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,000
Dokyun: Muay Thai?
Junsu: Muay Thai

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,240
Zhuojie: Let me tell you, even if three came
none would dare fight me.

119
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,840
Talay: No wonder you did cardio this morning.

120
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,040
Porsche: I think the one most suited is Zhuojie.

121
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,960
Junlan: I soaked yesterday.

122
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,000
Dokyun: There’s also one upstairs?

123
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,680
Zhuojie: Me alone, versus Junlan

124
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
(Ready to fight!)
Zhuojie: I just want to fight Junlan.

125
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,680
Junlan: Jeremy

126
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,600
Zhuojie: Like this—translate for me

127
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,840
(Huh? Translate what??)
Even five Junlans wouldn’t dare fight me.

128
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,360
Junsu: He said even if there were five like Junlan, they wouldn’t beat him.

129
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,840
(“Even five Junlans can’t beat Zhuojie.”)
Junsu: He said even if there were five like Junlan, they wouldn’t beat him.

130
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,320
(Show-off battle)

131
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,180
Today everyone must do the mission at the Muay Thai gym.

132
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,910
If you’re ready, go get prepared.

133
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,210
Talay: So it'll be done as a team.

134
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Looks like everyone knows Muay Thai
and is especially excited for this mission.

135
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,720
Not sure if the Muay Thai they’ll face today
will be like the Muay Thai they know.

136
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,920
(Travel time: 1 hour)
Junlan: 1 hour?
Talay & Intouch: Yes, 1 hour.

137
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,490
(Travel time: 1 hour)
Talay: You can sleep first, I’ll sleep too.

138
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,440
(The driver can’t sleep though.)
(Travel time: 1 hour)
Junlan: I'm not going to sleep, I already drank too much coffee.

139
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,280
(Travel time: 1 hour)
Junlan: I drank too much coffee, I can’t sleep

(Shocked in the morning)
Jawoon: Shocked already

143
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,000
Jawoon: Shocked every day

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,960
(Shocked every day)
Jawoon: Shocked every day

145
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,560

147
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,100

148
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,890
Porsche: Yes, it’s great cardio.

149
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,110
(Muay Thai = exercise)
Porsche: Yes, it’s great cardio.
Jawoon: Yes.

150
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,370
(Muay Thai = exercise)
Jawoon: Helps me eat more

151
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,720
(Muay Thai = food)
(Muay Thai = exercise)
Jawoon: Helps me eat more

152
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,370
(Not even training yet, already talking food)
Porsche: Basically, you just want to eat more.

153
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,920
(Not even training yet, already talking food)
Jawoon: Yes.

154
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,440
Jawoon: Eat big, big, big, big

155
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,160
Jawoon: Okay, okay, okay

156
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,480
(Sounds weird)

157
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,640
Jawoon: Muay Thai, eat big big, yes yes

158
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,960
(Thais confused #2)
Jawoon: Muay Thai, eat big big, yes yes

159
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,840
Jawoon: No Muay Thai, eat...

160
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,080
Jawoon: Eat small small small small

161
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,040
(Means just a little??)
Porsche: A little bit

162
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Jawoon: A little bit

163
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,720
(If not confused, you’d be more confused.)

164
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,480
The 10 guys arrived at today’s mission site.

165
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,200
(Mission site: Napak Muaythai Gym)

166
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,520

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,240

A fighter hailed as a genius boxer of this era

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,320
(Thanks to One Championship for the photo)
Prajanchai gained worldwide fame by defeating the ONE world champion.

173
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,110
(Thanks to One Championship for the photo)
He has faced legendary fighters.

174
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,560
(Thanks to One Championship for the photo)
Will the Boys Lost guys be able to handle it?

175
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,600
Talay: Hello

176
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,640
Porsche: Hello

177
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,080
Everyone: Hello

178
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,420
Coach: Hello

179
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,920
Coach: Let me introduce myself.
I’m Prajanchai P.K. Saenchai Muay Thai Gym.

180
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,960
Coach: Today, I’d like to welcome
all of the Boys Lost in Thailand cast.

181
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,680
Coach: Are you all ready to train with me today?

182
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,280
Talay: Are we ready?
Everyone: Ready!

183
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,600
Everyone’s spirits are sky-high

184
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,720
The first thing you need for training like a Muay Thai fighter is shorts

185
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,380
With nametags for everyone as well

186
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,640
Coach: Go change into your outfits
Talay: Go, let’s go!

187
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,720
Talay: Change outfits!

188
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,680
Coach: Today I’ll teach you that
for Muay Thai fighting.

189
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,080
Coach: Everyone must have a master,
so you need to perform the Wai Khru ritual.

190
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
Coach: Today I’ll first teach you
the Wai Khru Muay Thai.

191
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,320
Coach: I need one person who thinks he can be the leader.
Step forward.

192
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,240
Talay: That team over there

193
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,880
(The PE teacher has to lead, right?)
Porsche: Go ahead, you Zhuojie

194
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,560
Talay: Seven
Porsche: Stand in front

195
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,240
(Shouldn’t you ask first?)
Porsche: Go in front
Talay: Come forward, come forward

196
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,610
Coach: Okay

197
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,920
(First time for the boys to practice Wai Khru Muay Thai.)

198
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,260
Wai Khru Muay Thai
is an important and sacred ritual of Muay Thai.

199
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,680
It shows respect to teachers and masters,

200
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,180
and brings blessings and encouragement before stepping into the ring.

201
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
The dance is also a warm-up and a way to stretch.

202
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,320
(Oh, not yet?!?)
The dance is also a warm-up and a way to stretch.

203
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
(Oh, not yet?!?)
And prepares the muscles before the fight.

204
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
And prepares the muscles before the fight.

205
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,620
It’s a unique identity of Muay Thai,

206
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,920
unlike any other martial art.

207
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,030
Coach: Okay.

208
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,230
Coach: Next, stretch your legs.

209
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,440
At first it may look easy.

210
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,220
Coach: Lean forward.

211
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,750
But good Wai Khru Muay Thai

212
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,440
is not just about correct movements, but also grace.

213
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,360
And at the same time, it must be strong,

214
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,500
able to intimidate the opponent.

215
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,170
And this is probably the boys’ first time

216
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,360
learning Wai Khru from a real fighter.

217
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,800
Coach: Okay.

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,360
Coach: Bring your guard up, everyone, and sway forward.

219
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,990
Coach: Sway forward, then sway back.

220
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,600
(Can’t understand. Just watch.)

221
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
(Can’t understand. Just watch.)
Coach: Raise it up, sway forward again, and reset stance.

222
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,810
Coach: To the left.

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,220
Coach: Okay.

224
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,080
Coach: Bring up your guard and sway forward.

225
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,440
(Looking good in stance)
Coach: Bring up your guard and sway forward.

226
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,640
(Looking good in stance)
Coach: One.

227
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,600
Coach: Sway back again. One, two, reset stance.

228
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,740
Coach: Sweep your hands forward.

229
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,720
Coach: One, two, three, and return to guard.

230
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,080
(Dokyun loves this.)
Coach: And then sway back.

231
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,960
Coach: Okay, everyone.

232
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,150
Dokyun: Yes, because Jawoon already likes Muay Thai.

233
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,240
Dokyun: When he came to Bangkok,
he even signed up for Muay Thai classes.

234
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,760
Dokyun: He’s good with punches, but Wai Khru... not at all.

235
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,120
Dokyun: But I did it nicely, right?

236
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,270
Dokyun: Because my hands are pretty.

237
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,720
Coach: No need to rush. One, two, three, four.

238
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,100
Coach: Left hand up, spin.

239
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,680
Coach: One, two, three, four, guard.

240
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,480
Coach: Sway back.

241
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,950
Coach: Reset stance.

242
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,930
Coach: Turn that way, everyone. How do you turn?

243
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,090
Coach: Okay.

244
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,680
Coach: And roll up.

245
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,670
Zhuojie: Yes, this is my first time practicing Muay Thai.

246
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,140
Zhuojie: But before, I saw it on TV sometimes,

247
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,490
and also saw matches between
Chinese fighters and Thai fighters.

248
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,990
Zhuojie: So I had some understanding.

249
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,600
Zhuojie: And I’ve always wanted to try Muay Thai myself.

250
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:25,290
Zhuojie: After trying today, I realized
it’s really different from what I saw on TV.

251
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,250
Zhuojie: As an athlete,
I already care about competition.

252
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,440
Zhuojie: And this time, it’s not just about experiencing another culture.

253
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,290
Zhuojie: Muay Thai is another unique part
of Thai culture.

254
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,610
Zhuojie: I also want to learn it properly.

255
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,680
Zhuojie: But from the beginning, during Wai Khru,

256
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,070
Zhuojie: because of communication issues,

257
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,110
Zhuojie: there were many things I didn’t understand or couldn’t remember.

258
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,560
Zhuojie: It made me feel frustrated with myself.

259
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,760
Coach: Very good, boys. Very good.

260
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,350
Coach: And next, this is today’s mission.

261
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,030
Junsu: Thank you.
Everyone: Thank you.

262
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,130
Live like a boxer.

263
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,840
If you succeed, you’ll receive 4 money

264
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,420
and four puzzle pieces.

265
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,690
Station 1: jump rope.

266
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,910
Everyone must take turns jump roping
for a total of 1,000.

267
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
Coach: Okay boys, everyone.

268
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Coach: This is station one,
or the first mission.

269
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,790
Coach: I’ll give you one rope.

270
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,900
Coach: Everyone takes turns, one at a time.

271
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,310
Coach: Total of 1,000 times.

272
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,400
Coach: But with a time limit of 10 minutes.

273
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,220
Coach: If within 10 minutes,

274
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,120
Coach: everyone alternates until reaching 1,000...

275
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,520
Station one: jump rope.
Total 1,000.

276
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,920
Ready? Let’s go!

277
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,560
(Player 1: Junsu)

278
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,750
Jawoon: Fighting, fighting, fighting!

279
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,870
(“Oh, awesome!”)
Jawoon: Oh, Junsu, Junsu!

280
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,400
(50 times)

281
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,000
Junsu passes 50 jumps easily,

282
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,720
leaving the team speechless.

283
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
(What is this?!)
leaving the team speechless.

284
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,110
Zhuojie: Another 30 seconds, Junsu!

285
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,700
Zhuojie: 30 more seconds!

286
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,920
(Amazing)

287
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,840
(100 times)

288
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,200
(Super fit, Junsu)

289
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,520
(Go for a thousand!)

290
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,120
(Warming up already)

291
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,800
(150 times)

292
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,520
(150 times)
Passed 150 already.

293
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,680
Passed 150 already.

294
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,400
Talay shouts wow — Junsu, you’re amazing!

295
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,520
Zhuojie: How many?

296
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,590
Zhuojie: How many now?

297
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,200
(So serious)

298
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,520
Zhuojie: How many already?

299
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,800
(Getting tired)

300
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,240
(200 times)

301
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,600
(Junsu finished with 216 times.)

302
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,370
(Player 2: Zhuojie)

303
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,000
Junsu: But the rope is really heavy.

304
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,040
(What’s so funny, bro?)

305
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,000
(250 times)

306
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,150
Dokyun: That’s really good.

307
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,080
Zhuojie: Don’t laugh at me.

308
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,840
(Jump! Don’t stop!!)

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,070
Zhuojie: Don’t laugh, okay?

310
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,760
Junsu: How many now?

311
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,360
(300 times)

312
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,000
(Slowing down)
Junsu: 30 seconds, 30 seconds, okay?

313
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,840
(Zhuojie finished with 126 times.)

314
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,960
(342 times)
Coach: 342.

315
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,800
(342 times)

316
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,560
(Player 3: Dokyun)

317
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,640
(Player 3: Dokyun)
Junsu: 340.

318
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,120
(Player 3: Dokyun)

319
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,040
Zhuojie: Whoever jumps fast, go first.

320
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,400
(400 times)
Junsu: 10 seconds, 10 seconds!

321
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,470
(Dokyun finished with 86 times.)
Only three minutes passed,

322
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,900
(Dokyun finished with 86 times.)
but the boys already reached

323
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,350
(Dokyun finished with 86 times.)
428 jumps — nearly halfway.

324
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,160
(428 times)
428 jumps — nearly halfway.

325
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,760
(Player 4: Junlan)
Six boys haven’t jumped yet.

326
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,480
(Player 4: Junlan)
This mission seems doable.

327
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,480
This mission seems doable.

328
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,910
Junsu still holds first place

329
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,880
with 216 jumps.

330
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,400
Zhuojie is second with 126.

331
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,920
Dokyun is third with 86.

332
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,360
Let’s see how many Junlan can add.

333
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,570
Junsu: 10 seconds!

334
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,230

337
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,840

(Concentrating)

342
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,800
(Mind ready)

343
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,840
(Body not ready)

344
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
(Jumping rope or teasing friends?)

345
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,600
Coach: 22 times already, faster, more!

346
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,590
Junsu: Talay, Talay!

347
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,160
(Doing difficult tricks too)

348
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,600
(540 times)
(Talay finished with 40 times.)
Coach: I know who already jumped.

349
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,200
(540 times)
(Talay finished with 40 times.)

350
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,760
(Player 6: Porsche)

351
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,720
(Player 6: Porsche)
Looks like Porsche isn’t good at jump rope at all.

352
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,600
Looks like Porsche isn’t good at jump rope at all.

353
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,480
Zhuojie: It’s okay, it’s okay. No worries.

354
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,720
(Supportive teammate)
Zhuojie keeps encouraging him nonstop.

355
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,080

357
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,400

(Player 7: F4)

359
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600

360
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400

361
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,960
(606 times)
(F4 finished with 28 times.)

362
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,720
(Player 8: Third)

363
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,440
(617 times)
(Third finished with 11 times.)

364
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,530
(Isn’t it too fast, Third?)

365
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,200
(Isn’t it too fast, Third?)
Dokyun: Intouch

366
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,990
Dokyun: Go for it

367
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,280
Talay: Intouch
Dokyun: Go for it

368
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,800
(Player 9: Intouch)

369
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,480
(Great form)

370
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,720
(639 times)
(Intouch did 22 times.)

371
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,440
(Huh??)
Great form but Intouch could only do 22 times.

372
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,920
Great form but Intouch could only do 22 times.

373
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,920
(Player 10: Jawoon)
Let’s see how much the 10th person, Jawoon, can do.

374
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,120
(Player 10: Jawoon)

375
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,920

376
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,850

377
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,840
(“Faster, faster, faster”)

378
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,080
(“Go, go, go”)
Dokyun: Go, go, go

379
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,520
(“Faster, faster, faster”)

380
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,200
(Cheering or pressuring??)

381
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,920
(“Faster, faster, faster”)
(Cheering or pressuring??)

382
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,030
(“Faster, faster, faster”)
Coach: 700 already

383
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,220
(700 times)

384
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,960
Dokyun: 700 now, just a little more

385
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,900
Zhuojie: Tell him if he’s tired, just rest. No need to rush

386
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,320
(Encouragement overflowing)

387
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,980
Dokyun: If you’re tired, you can switch with someone else.

388
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,640
Zhuojie: Faster, faster, faster

389
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,550
Jawoon: Be quiet, damn it

390
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,740
(Be quiet~)
(Jawoon is focusing.)

391
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,640
Junsu: He said keep it down.

392
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,680
(779 times)
(Jawoon did 140 times.)

393
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,040
(779 times)

394
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,740
(779 times)
Everyone’s jumped already,
but we haven’t gotten that far.

395
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,790
Everyone’s jumped already,
but we haven’t gotten that far.

396
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,540
The next person needs to speed up to catch up with time

397
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,040
Junsu: Today, right?

398
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,280
Junsu: Today feels good

399
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,860
Junsu: Maybe because I got to use my body a lot,

400
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,050
Junsu: so I think this mission

401
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,600
Junsu: might suit me the most.

402
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,850
(877 times)
(Junsu did 87 times.)

403
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,130
Dokyun: Go, go, go

404
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
(Zhuojie’s about to fly.)

405
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,920
(893 times)

406
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,480
(893 times)
(Zhuojie did 16 times.)

407
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,730
Porsche: How many left?

408
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,870
Dokyun: Out of all the filming we’ve done, I like today the most.

409
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,560
Dokyun: Because I really like moving my body.

410
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,820
Dokyun: And today we got to do an activity
that let me move like this for the first time.

411
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,000
Dokyun: I’m really okay with it, because just having fun is enough.

412
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,520
Dokyun: Happiness is enough.

413
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,520
(965 times)
(Dokyun did 72 times.)

414
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,360
With just 35 times remaining,
will they have the strength to keep going?

415
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,600
(1,000 times completed)

416
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,610
Coach: If it's 8 minutes, it’s really close.

417
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,640
Coach: Today, everyone has completed Station 1.

418
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,580
This mission started with Junsu.

419
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,600
His strength, jumping in place of others

420
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,120
(Junsu opened with 216 times)
Got up to 216 times.

421
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,160
Followed by Zhuojie, who kept up the great form

422
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,610
(Zhuojie followed up, total reached 342 times in the first 2 minutes)
Followed by Zhuojie, who kept up the great form

423
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,070
(Zhuojie followed up, total reached 342 times in the first 2 minutes)
342 times without even looking tired.

424
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,280
342 times without even looking tired.

425
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,360
But the other eight friends could only jump a little each.

426
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,640
So in the last three minutes they had to speed up.

427
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,880
And they finally completed the mission.

428
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,270
Next Station, Station 2

429
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,300
The ten boys must take turns dragging the tire back and forth

430
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,180
Ten rounds, within five minutes

431
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,880
Coach: Okay kids, right now

432
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,200
Coach: We’re at Station 2

433
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,470
Coach: Or mission two that we must do

434
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,360
Coach: This Station is called “Tire Drag 5 Minutes”

435
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,160
Coach: But what makes it harder is

436
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,830
Coach: Nong Tiger will be sitting on the tire

437
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,760
(Tiger Roiliem Phra Ajarn Chai Napak Muaythai Gym)

438
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,640
Coach: It’s not an easy task

439
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,530
Coach: And if everyone finishes within five minutes

440
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,280
Coach: That means the mission is a success

441
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,920
Coach: Can you all do it?

442
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,880
Everyone: Yes!

443
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,360
Coach: Over there, two pairs. This side, three pairs

444
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,570
Coach: This one’s three pairs

445
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,680
Coach: This is the first pair

446
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Coach: One, two, let’s go, go

447
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,450

Talay: Reach this line

458
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,480
(Round 3 success!!)
Talay: Spin spin spin

459
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,520
Coach: Then the mission will be complete, hurry

460
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,400

466
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,720
Coach: Not yet, not yet

467
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,680
(Waiting for Tiger too)

468
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,320
Coach: Last round now, quick

469
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:31,440
(Round 5: Junlan - Junsu)

470
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,800
(Round 5 success!!)

471
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,680
Halfway done, they made good time.

472
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,160
Second half starting, but Zhuojie doesn’t look too good.

473
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,690
Zhuojie: Actually, the amount of exercise
wasn’t as tiring as regular training.

474
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,240
Zhuojie: But since it was my first time doing this.

475
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,750
Zhuojie: And I really gave it my all.

476
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,240
Zhuojie: That’s why I’m so tired.

477
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,480
Coach: For tire dragging, I think it’s heavy.

478
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,230
Coach: Because, first,

479
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,680
Coach: Even boxers who drag tires

480
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,790
Coach: Without anyone sitting

481
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,480
(Round 6: Zhuojie - Dokyun)
Coach: Without anyone sitting

482
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,730
(Round 6: Zhuojie - Dokyun)
Coach: If we run with just the tire

483
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,110
(Round 6: Zhuojie - Dokyun)
Coach: It’s already exhausting and tiring.

484
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,640
(Round 6: Zhuojie - Dokyun)
Coach: But here, there’s also someone sitting.

485
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,160
Coach: The rider already weighs 60 kilos.

486
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,600
Coach: And with the tire too
I think it’s really heavy for normal people

487
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,000
(Round 6 success!!)
Dokyun: Go, go, go

488
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,790

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,920

They are using the wrong way to kick the punching bag.

Until the soles of their feet were scraped raw.

631
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,610

632

633
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,960

Trying something new.

636

is not your ability.

644
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,200
Zhuojie: But your attitude towards what you do.

645
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,070
Zhuojie: Every activity, I put in serious effort

646
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,150
Zhuojie: Challenging my own ultimate limits

647
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,210
Zhuojie: Even if it costs sweat or blood

648
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,900
Zhuojie: I will still try to succeed

649
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,510
Zhuojie: And make it the best I can

650
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,130

700
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,240

being recognized

739
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,290
Junsu: It feels really good

740
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,650
Junsu: Especially in exercise
where I don’t want to lose

741
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,460
Junsu: Because I’m very confident in this

742
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,550
Junsu: I thought I must win

743
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,480
Junsu: When the results came out good

744
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,580

745
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,120

747
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,080

755
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,410

756
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,720

757

00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,780
Porsche: There’ll be a surprise at home

761
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,530
Porsche: For the 5
Talay: For us 5

762
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,250
Junsu: Yes, today I didn’t feel like it was filming

763
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,410
Junsu: Honestly, it felt more like playing

764
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,780
Dokyun: Normally when I exercise
I go to the gym alone

765
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,790
Dokyun: But doing activities with friends like this

766
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,660
Dokyun: Makes exercise feel better

767
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,040
Junsu: First of all

768
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,100
Junsu: Because I did what I’m most confident in

769
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,520
Junsu: I felt no pressure

770
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,520
Junsu: And then...

771
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,650
Junsu: Actually, it’s not just today

772
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,280
Junsu: Every time I finish a mission and go home

773
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,030
Junsu: What I feel is

774
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,180
Junsu: Like memories I’ll never forget

775
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,720
Junsu: All of it

776
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,380
Junsu: Not just today

777
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,300
Junsu: Because from the journey, from the start until now

778
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,110
Junsu: It feels like a trip

779
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,840
Junsu: Like I’ll never forget in my life

780
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,960
Junsu: Especially today, I’ll never forget it

781
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,200
Junsu: Feels like I can’t forget it, today

782
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,180
Zhuojie: Actually, the person who impressed me the most was Intouch

783
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,750
Zhuojie: Even though in the end he didn’t go to the spa

784
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,910
Zhuojie: But everyone saw...

785
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,960
Zhuojie: Whether it was his physique

786
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,950
Zhuojie: When he was kicking the punching bag

787
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,220
Zhuojie: And when he was skipping rope

788
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,200
Zhuojie: Normally, he’s very gentle and doesn’t talk much

789
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,700
Zhuojie: He’s very introverted

790
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,920
Zhuojie: But when he was on the field
he really shocked me

791
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,880
Zhuojie: I never said it before
but he really made me feel such a difference

792
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,880
Everyone: Muay Thai! Yay yay

793
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,860
Junsu: What do you say everyone, what do you say

794
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,580
Talay: What is it

795
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,820
Talay: It’s the letter “B”

796
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,930
Junsu: The letter “B”

797
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,200
Junsu: How many, two two two

798
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,520
F4: And ta-daaa

799
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,380
Dokyun: How many left
Junlan: Four

800
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,240
Junsu: Either three or four

801
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,960
Talay: Where is it

802
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,830
Porsche: It’s like a skywalk

803
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,890
Zhuojie: I know this place!

804
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:20,900
Talay: Where

805
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,180
Zhuojie: Jawoon, I’ll tell you

806
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,200
Junsu: Zhangjiajie, Zhangjiajie

807
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,970
Junlan: It’s not Zhangjiajie anymore

808
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,220
Junlan: There’s a “B” in front

809
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,910
Junsu: Isn’t it?

810
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,620
Talay: Bali?

811
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,280
Junlan: Zhangjiajie is the letter “J”

812
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:44,240
Zhuojie: At first, because I didn’t pick Dokyun

813
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,890
Zhuojie: This thought came up

814
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,290
Zhuojie: Because whatever he did today, he did it well

815
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:55,160
Zhuojie: But maybe the coach’s memory isn’t great

816
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,410
Zhuojie: So maybe he chose wrong

817
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,850
Zhuojie: I feel like he did well in every aspect

818
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:03,550
Zhuojie: And the key point is

819
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,120
Zhuojie: I feel really happy being with him

820
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Zhuojie: And he even spent his own money
just to buy me a blanket

821
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,710
Zhuojie: That really touched me, I’ll never forget it

822
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,390
Zhuojie: From now on, if there’s something good, I’ll think of him first

823
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,370
Zhuojie: I feel like he’s been so good to me

824
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,390
Zhuojie: I can feel his sincerity

825
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,330
Zhuojie: And I’ll be sincere with him too

826
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,760
Even though no one knows what tonight’s special prize is

827
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,240
Zhuojie already decided to give it to Dokyun

828
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,520
So he asked Jawoon to help translate into Korean

829
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,520
But it seemed Jawoon wasn’t too cooperative

830
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,900
Junlan: I think this is the name of a place

831
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,340
Junlan: The name of somewhere

832
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,850
Porsche: Maybe it’s the name of a place

833
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,450
Zhuojie: Boys Lost in Thailand

834
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,860
Zhuojie: It’s the “Boys Lost in Thailand” logo
