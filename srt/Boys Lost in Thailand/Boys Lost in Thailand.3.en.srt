340
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,160
and collect puzzle pieces to bring back.

351
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,690
you’ll need to divide responsibilities:

While the Boys Lost members are competing
in games for the chance to choose their beds...

607
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,000
...and placed them on the beds they selected.

608
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,270

609
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,380

He found the gold card and then he said it himself.
