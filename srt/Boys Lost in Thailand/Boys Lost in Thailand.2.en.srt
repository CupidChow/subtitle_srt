1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,440
How did you prepare before filming the show?

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,600
There were two main preparations: language learning and personality workshops.

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,760
30 Days Before Filming

4
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,600
First of all, I studied Thai very hard before joining this show.

5
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,960
Then, since there are Chinese friends, I also wanted to be able to communicate with them.

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,760
So I also studied Chinese as well.

15 Days Before Filming

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,520
Hello, my name is Junsu.

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,840
I'm from Korea.

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,320
I'm 24 years old.

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,040
I'm an actor.

12
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,160
I like reading books.

13
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,800
And I also study Chinese and English.

14
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,200
Director: When you secretly overhear them speaking Chinese, do you understand?

15
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,830
I understand some words.

16
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,400
Today we’re going to drink coffee.

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,480
Great! Today we’re going to drink coffee.

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,560
Go. Go where?

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,280
It’s very hot today.

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,400
Six, seven, eight.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,200
‘I'm sorry' equals ‘It's okay.'

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,640
What do you think makes you charming?

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,570
People who don’t know me usually say...

24
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,590
Because normally I wear my hair down but like to sweep it back.

25
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,510
And people tend to like it when I sweep it back.

26
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,870
That’s what people say, but...

27
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,360
Personally, I think it’s either my eyes or my lips.

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,160
Probably my smile.

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,880
Now that I said it, I feel kinda shy.

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,120
What kind of relationship do you think you’ll gain from this show?

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,680
That’s such a strange question.

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,810
Because it’s something you really can’t predict.

33
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,890
What kind of relationship will I walk away with from the show?

34
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,070
Besides friendship… I really don’t know.

35
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,840
To me, it’s quite a strange question.

36
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,380
What other kind of relationship could it possibly be?

37
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,360
I think it’ll be a really good friendship.

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Because we don’t know what the reality show ahead will be like.

39
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,150
What activities we’ll face, what ups and downs we’ll go through together...

40
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,590
That might lead to genuine friendship forming.

41
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,040
Like brothers… or something else, I don’t know.

42
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,680
