13
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,260
F4: Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,280
Junlan: Do you speak Chinese?

15
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,600
Intouch: Just a little.

16
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,800
F4: Just a bit.

17
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,680
Junlan: That’s great!

18
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:25,960
F4: Thank you.

19
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,640
Junlan: Very good.

20
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,160
Junlan: Really good.

21
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:28,700
F4: Very good.

22
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,720
(It’s turning into a language school now...)
Junlan: I’ll teach you Chinese.

23
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,480
(It’s turning into a language school now...)
Junlan: And you guys teach me Thai, okay?

24
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,520
Intouch: Okay.

25
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,440
Junlan: Awesome.

26
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,200
Junlan: Hello.

27
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,800
Dokyun: Hello.

28
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,040
F4: Hello.

29
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,240
Junlan: I’m feeling shy now.

30
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,880
F4: Where are you from?

31
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,640
Dokyun: Korea.

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
F4 & Intouch: Korea!

33
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,040
Intouch: What’s your name?

34
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,920
Dokyun: My name is Dokyun

35
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,600

36
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,040
F4: F4

37
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,640
Dokyun: F4?

38
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,560
F4: Intouch.

39
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,320
Dokyun: Touch?

40
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,160
Intouch: Intouch.

41
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,760

42
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,040
Intouch: Yes, yes.

43
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,800
Junlan: Intouch.

44
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,000
Junlan: F4.

45
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,760
Junlan: Junlan.

46
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,560
F4: Junlan.

47
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,930
Dokyun: Dokyun.

48
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,740
(Thai-Chinese-Korean)
Junsu: Should we switch seats?

49
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,970
(Thai-Chinese-Korean)
Junsu: Should we switch seats?

50
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,130
(The last member arrives)
Dokyun: Someone else is here.

51
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,070
(The last member arrives)
Jawoon: Hello

52
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,440
(The last member arrives)
Everyone: Hello!

53
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,460
Junsu: Introduce yourself.

54
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,840
Jawoon: Hi everyone, my name is Jawoon.

55
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,560
Junsu: Well done! Very good!

56
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,400
Dokyun: Come on in.

57
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,560
(All 10 members are now here.)

58
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,160
(All 10 members are now here.)
Dokyun: So then...

59
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,560
F4: One, two, three.

60
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,920
Junlan: This side is all the foreigners.

61
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,530
F4: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

62
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,130
Zhuojie: Okay?

63
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,610
F4: All here.

64
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,640
Talay: Should we sit down?

65
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,120
Everyone: Sure.

66
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,680
For the next three weeks, your mission is:

67
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,720
Make your foreign friends fall in love with Thailand.

68
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,520
You’ll have to work together as a team
to complete missions and earn enough money

69
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
to win a trip and experience the beauty of Thailand together.

70
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,520
At the start of the show, each person receives 1,000 baht

71
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,580
for living together over the three weeks.

72
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,480
(1,000 baht per person for 3 weeks)
Rules for choosing beds:

73
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
Rules for choosing beds:

74
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,480
Junlan: Are we picking randomly?

75
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,440
Junsu: Yep.

76
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,840
Pair up and tie one of your legs together

77
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,200
to help each other find and eliminate suspicious items around the house.

78
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,240
Talay: Suspicious items… in the house?

79
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,960
You’ll have fifteen minutes.

80
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,240
If the rope comes off during the task,

81
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,200
your pair will lose and be the last to choose beds.

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,200
Jawoon: Are we looking for something on the second floor?

83
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,470
Porsche: Nope.

84
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,680
Talay: Just this floor.

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,000
Jawoon: This one, the ground floor?

86
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,980
Talay: Down here... first floor and the pool area.

87
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,950
Jawoon: Are we looking for a treasure box?

88
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,510
Talay & Porsche: Just anything unusual.

89
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,900
Jawoon: Something weird, huh?

90
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,950
If you're ready, the 15-minute countdown will begin.

91
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,960
(Team pairing starts)
If you're ready, the 15-minute countdown will begin.

92
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,080
Jawoon: I don’t want to do this anymore.

93
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,960
Porsche: Has it started already?

94
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,040
(No warning at all.)

95
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,870
Zhuojie: Where do you want to sleep?

96
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,810
Junlan: Even if they seem similar...

97
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,640
F4: This is tiring. Will it even be here?

98
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,080
Intouch: It must be here somewhere.

99
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,690
F4: What makes it suspicious anyway?

100
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,600
Talay & Porsche: Side, middle, side.. stop first!

101
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,560
Talay: Yeah, this is obviously fake.

102
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,680
Intouch: Fridge! Careful.. don’t let your guard down.

103
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,960
Intouch: We found one first!

104
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,960
Jawoon: Is this correct?
Third: Is this correct?

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,320
Junsu: This one looks like it.
Dokyun: This one?

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,070
Zhuojie: Here it is!

107
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,240
Junlan: Here.

108
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,240
Junlan: You’re awesome.

109
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,440
The production team randomly placed
survival kits on the beds the members chose.

110
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,520
Each kit contains over 20 different items

111
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,640
to help make the three weeks more manageable.

112
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,400
But for some, picking the wrong kit might change everything.

113
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,270
(This bed’s better)
Porsche: That bed is better!

114
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,320
Porsche: But you can use that pillow.

115
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,390
What you see on the bed is your survival kit.

116
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,840
Each kit contains different items.

117
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:34,080
You can trade items with others if they agree.

118
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,960
Feel free to explore what’s inside!

119
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,080
Junsu: What’s this?
Junlan: What is this stuff?

120
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,900
Zhuojie: Pork... it’s pork.

121
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,490
Junlan: What?

122
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,960
Junsu: Pork meat.

123
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,160
Talay: Crispy pork.

124
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
Zhuojie: Anyone want it?

125
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,360
(Doesn’t eat pork)
Junlan: I don’t eat pork.

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,280
Zhuojie: I can trade.

127
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,880
(Trading)
Zhuojie: I can trade with you.

128
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,600
Talay: Oh, we’re trading.

129
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,400
Dokyun: Hot pot.

130
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,090
F4: Learning languages now.

131
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,060
Zhuojie: It’s all recipes!

132
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,460
(No pork!)
Junlan: No pork, no pork!

133
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,110
Talay: Really?

134
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,680
Porsche: Want this instead?

135
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,120
Dokyun: Thank you.

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
Talay: He brought his own stuff.
Porsche: Yep.

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,240
