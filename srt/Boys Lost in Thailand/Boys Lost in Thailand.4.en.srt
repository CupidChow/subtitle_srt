1
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,520
Everyone must go to the market to buy ingredients

2
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,240
for their own national dishes

3
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,240
creating two dishes per country.

4
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,350
Jawoon: Even Chinese people can't cook it.

5
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,310
Jawoon: How are people from other countries going to...

6
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,080
Third: But do we have a cookbook?

7
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,720
Talay: Should we pool the money?

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,800
Zhuojie: One, two, three!

9
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,880
Everyone: Power! Okay, okay!

10
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,400
Junsu: Can you lower the price?

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,960
Talay: Thank you.

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,840
Junlan: Thank you.

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,360
Talay: I bought eggs too.

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,440
Third: I bought 2 trays.

15
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,720
Talay: That’s 45 eggs.

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,490
(Only one 100-baht note left)
Intouch: Only one 100-baht note left.

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,330
(Only one 100-baht note left)
Porsche: Really?

18
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,410
Porsche: How much did we spend? 1,000 baht?

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,120
Intouch: Almost 1 (thousand).

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,760
Intouch: Already spent 900.

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,280
If we don’t have it today,

22
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,120
we won't be able to successfully buy anything.

23
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,840
Talay: It’s totally fine, friend.
Dokyun: Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,480
(It’s salty! It’s salty!)
Zhuojie: It’s salty, it’s salty!

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,830
Junsu: It’s salty, it’s salty!

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,120
Talay: 10 more minutes till food is served.

27
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,680
(Ramyeon is ready.)

28
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,400
Jawoon: What is that?

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,520
Dokyun: Hey, everyone come here.

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,520
(07:00 AM)

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,120
(Little Jawoon is still sleeping.)

32
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,730
(08:00 AM)

33
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,490
(08:00 AM)
F4: Good morning!

34
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,800
Zhuojie: Hope you have a good day.

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,560

Talay: Good morning.

42
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,080
Zhuojie: What’s up, friend?

43
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,770
Junsu: What’s that?

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,160
Zhuojie: Energy.

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,520
(How is it living together for 2 days?)

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,160
Everyone: It’s fun.

47
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,880
(We need more sleep.)
Junlan: We want to sleep more.

48
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,830
Junsu: Got a little sleep.

49
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,410
Talay: Got a little sleep.

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,310
Junsu: And really tired.

51
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,560
(Really tired~)
Junsu: And really tired.

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,320
To reach your goal,

53
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,720
you must report your remaining balance every morning.

54
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,590
What is your remaining balance?

55
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,990
F4: We have 8,040 left.

56
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,160
(Remaining balance: 8040)
F4: We have 8,040 left.

57
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,120
(The savings goal is...)
From now on, the amount you must save up is...

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,130
The total of 30,000 Baht.

59
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
(30,000 Baht)
Everyone: Whoa!

60
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,760
Everyone: Whoa!

61
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,110
Zhuojie: Earning money is so easy!

62
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,360
(Easy Money!)
Zhuojie: Earning money is so easy!

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,480
Junlan: He said it's easy—it's not.
Junsu: It’s not easy.

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
Junsu: He said... yeah.
Junlan: Very easy!

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,440
(Complain! Complain! Complain!)
Junlan: He said it’s very easy.

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,880
(Just sell all our stuff)
Zhuojie: Let’s just sell everything we have, problem solved, right?

67
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,160
Everyone: What?

68
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,540
Junlan: Sell clothes, sell bags.

69
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,200
(Sell our clothes and bags)
Junlan: Sell clothes, sell bags.

70
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,050
Junlan: Sell him.

71
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,000
Talay: Sell yourself?

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,360
(Junlan has a lot of stuff, so let's just sell his)
Zhuojie: Junlan has so much stuff, just sell his.

73
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,760
Porsche: I don’t understand, but I get what it means.

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,720
(Just teasing)
Zhuojie: Just kidding.

75
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,440
(You need to go out, work, make money, and bring back puzzle pieces.)

76
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,600
(But not everyone will go out and work.)

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,640
We’ll draw lots to choose 4 people who will go to work.

78
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,800
And today’s workplace is...

79
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,000
F4: Blue.

80
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,800

Dokyun: Junlan.

93
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,670
(Talay, Jawoon, Junlan)

94
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,930
(Talay, Jawoon, Junlan)
Dokyun: Junlan.

95
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,130
(Talay, Jawoon, Junlan)

96
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,350
F4: And the last one...

97
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,960
(Talay, Jawoon, Junlan, Porsche)
F4: Porsche.

98
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,010
(Talay, Jawoon, Junlan, Porsche)
Everyone: Porsche!

99
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,040

103
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,100
F4: Good luck! Fighting!

104
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,490
Junlan: Bye, everyone!

105
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,560
Talay: See you soon!

106
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,670

107
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,830
Zhuojie: Let’s go!

Zhuojie: One, two, three, let’s go!

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
Dokyun: Got it, got it.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Zhuojie: I believe in you.

112
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,320
Zhuojie: You go work, I’ll nap.

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,990
Junlan: Let’s huddle up!

114
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,480
(Let’s huddle up!)
Junlan: Let’s huddle up!

115
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,200
(Let’s huddle up!)
Talay: You’re going to nap?

116
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,950
(Let’s huddle up!)
Junsu: Group huddle!
Junlan: Group huddle!

117
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,010

Jawoon: Not driving, then.

140
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,720
Porsche: You’re not driving?

141
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,640
Jawoon: Music is my life.

142
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Talay: Turn on the light.

143
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,540
(Need a confidence boost.)

144
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,520

148
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,680
(Let's get going.)

149
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,480
(Safe travels, everyone.)

150
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,510
(Safe travels, everyone.)
(What are they planning over here?)

151
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,890
(What are they planning over here?)

152
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,400
Junsu: So what should we do?

153
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,720
(Sleep~)

156
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,480

(Go swimming!)

158
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,440
Zhuojie: Go swimming.

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,080
Junsu: I don’t want to swim.

160
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,960
Zhuojie: Is that okay?

161
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,520
Everyone: Okay.

162
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Jawoon: Looking at maps all day.

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,440
Porsche: Yeah, you're the guide again.

164
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Jawoon: I'm the guide again. Jawoon's map.

165
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
(Jawoon's map.)
Jawoon: Jawoon's map.

166
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,640
(Go straight.)
Jawoon: Go straight.

167
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,960
Porsche: I think you’ve got it flipped.

168
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,440
Jawoon: Our house is here, right?

169
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,000
Porsche: Yeah.

170
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,600
Jawoon: You can look at it this way.

171
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,000
Porsche: The right way is like this.

172
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,840
Jawoon: This is the house?
Porsche: Yeah, the house we left from.

173
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,680
Junlan: So...

174
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,760
Talay: So...

175
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,440
Junlan: From the house at The Horizon Khaoyai...

176
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,720
Junlan: You’ll pass a gas station first, then a school.

177
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,920
(Classroom)
Junlan: Classroom.

178
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,960
Talay: School, school.

179
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,720
(School)
Junlan: School.

180
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,040
Talay: Right.

181
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,160
Talay: “Hong Rian” means “classroom.”

182
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,450
Junlan: Right.

183
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:05,750
Junlan: School.

184
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,340
(Teacher Talay and student Junlan)
Junlan: School, school.
Talay: “Rong Rian” means “school.”

185
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,450
Junlan: Rong Rian.

186
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,080
(From The Horizon Khaoyai to Khaoyai Farm Village)

187
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,540
Jawoon: Boys Lost in Thailand.

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,560
(Question Card)

189
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,890
Get closer by asking & answering.

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,440
Each person picks a question from the jar,
then take turns answering to grow closer.

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,560
Jawoon: Why do I feel so nervous?

192
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,760
Porsche: Don’t be nervous.

193
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,480
Jawoon: Okay, okay.

194
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,760
Jawoon: First one.

195
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,920
Jawoon: If you had to compare the other person to a color...

196
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,680
Jawoon: What color would they be, and why?

197
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,800
Jawoon: What color are you... let me think.

198
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,480
(What color should I pick?)

199
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,440
Porsche: Is it hard?

200
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,880
(Yellow)
Jawoon: Yellow.

201
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,000
Porsche: Yellow?
Jawoon: Yeah, yellow.

202
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,120
Porsche: Why?
Jawoon: Because I like yellow.

203
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,440
Jawoon: And you’re...

204
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,130
Jawoon: Bright.

205
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,260
Jawoon: Warm, kind.

206
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,880
Jawoon: You connect everything, like these flowers.

207
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,120
Porsche: Sunflowers.

208
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,600
Jawoon: Yeah, sunflowers.
Porsche: I see.

209
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,480
(Jawoon compares Porsche to a sunflower.)

210
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,030
(Ha ha ha)

211
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,720
Porsche: Okay, my turn.

212
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,240
Porsche: Okay, this one.
Jawoon: This one.

213
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,280
Jawoon: If you had to give the other person a nickname or special title...

214
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,840
Jawoon: What would it be?

215
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,680
Porsche: What’s “funny” in Korean?
Jawoon: Funny.

216
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,920
Porsche: Okay, then your name is “Funny.”

217
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,600
Jawoon: Do you think I’m funny?
Porsche: Yes.

218
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,810
Jawoon: Okay, okay.

219
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,480
Porsche: You have a serious face but you’re funny.

220
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,680
Porsche: You always make that same face.

221
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,280
Jawoon: Yes.
Porsche: But you’re funny.

222
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,050
Porsche: Deadpan funny.

223
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
(Deadpan funny)
Porsche: Deadpan funny.

224
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
Jawoon: My name is “Funny.”

225
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,880
Porsche: Funny, yes.

226
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,120
Jawoon: Funny.
Porsche: Funny.

227
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,760
Jawoon: Okay, next question.

228
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,960
Junlan: I’ll pick one.

229
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,720
Junlan: Hope it’s a good one.

230
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,240
Talay: Hope it’s a good one.
Junlan: Hope it’s a good one.

231
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
(We are lucky today?)
Talay: Will we be lucky today?

232
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,320
Junlan: I don’t think we’re lucky today.

233
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,740
Junlan: Because I wanted to stay home. I like swimming.

234
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,280
Talay: They swam today.

235
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,400
Junlan: Yeah, I wanted to swim.

236
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,360
(Wanted to swim)
Junlan: Yeah.

237
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,240
Zhuojie: Let’s go swim, swim, swim!

238
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,080
Zhuojie: Let’s go! Let’s swim!

239
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,320
All: Today we’re going to play a game.

240
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,840
Intouch: The rule is...

241
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,080
Junsu: Rock, paper, scissors—okay?
Intouch: Okay.

242
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,640
All: One, two, three!

243
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,810
Dokyun: No, that’s wrong.

244
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,330
(Maybe they forgot rock-paper-scissors is different in every country)
Dokyun: No, that’s wrong.

245
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,210
(Maybe they forgot rock-paper-scissors is different in every country)
Junsu: Oh, right.

246
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,760
(Maybe they forgot rock-paper-scissors is different in every country)

247
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,880
Third: The loser goes out first.
F4: Loser out first.

248
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,010
F4: Who’s number one?

249
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,080
Junsu: These three right here.

250
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,200
F4: You?

251
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,920
F4: Everyone!
Zhuojie: Let’s take a photo.

252
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,720
(One, two, three!)
F4: One, two, three!

253
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,680
Dokyun: Is it hot?

254
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,560
Junsu: Is it hot?

255
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
Zhuojie: One, two, three.

256
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,400
Dokyun: Three.

257
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,120
Junlan: I’ve got a feeling the questions are going to be weird.

258
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,200
Talay: Weird questions.

259
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,560
Junlan: Hope not.

260
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,650
Junlan: What about the other person makes you
want to get to know them better?

261
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,840
Talay: I like that you always try new things.

262
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,600
Talay: Do you understand what I’m saying?
Junlan: I understand.

263
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,840
Junlan: Learning new things.
Talay: Learning new things you’ve never tried.

264
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,800
Junlan: Yeah, yeah.

265
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Talay: Trying food. Like when you tried my coffee this morning.

266
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,800
Junlan: Yeah, I liked that you made coffee for me today.

267
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,700
Junlan: And about...
Talay: Junlan.

268
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,000
Talay: Can you check if we passed the gas station?

269
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,680
(Did we pass the gas station?)
Junlan: Okay.

270
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,640
(Did we pass the gas station?)
Junlan: One sec.

271
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,840
Junlan: Where are we right now?

272
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,880
Talay: Yeah, where are we now?

273
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,000
Talay: Did we drive past it?

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,920
Junlan: Looks familiar.

275
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,400
Junlan: I think we’re... we’re at...

276
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,400
Talay: Are we lost?

277
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,280
(Are we lost?)
Junlan: We’re not lost.

278
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,400
(Are we lost?)
Junlan: I hope we’re not lost.

279
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,960
Dokyun: You have to take your hat off for this game.

280
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,480
F4: Three, two, one... go!

281
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Junsu: Be careful.

282
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,990
Zhuojie: Straight, straight.

283
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,450
Junsu: Straight, straight.

284
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,250
Zhuojie: Go straight.

285
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,760
Zhuojie: Great job!

286
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,520
F4: Ride it now?
Third: Yeah, ride it now.

287
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,360
F4: Are you okay?

288
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,280
Junsu: I feel like it’s kind of dangerous.

289
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,270
Dokyun: What should we do?

290
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,280
Zhuojie: As long as you’re happy.

291
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
All: One, two, three!

292
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
Jawoon: Next one.

293
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,000
Jawoon: If you had to describe the other person in three words,
what would you choose?

294
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,400
Jawoon: Three words?

295
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,680
Jawoon: Three words.

296
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,520
Jawoon: Startled.

297
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,040
(Startled)
Porsche: Startled.

298
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,280
(Startled)
Jawoon: Yes, startled.

299
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,600
Porsche: Why? Why startled?

300
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Jawoon: Because sometimes you speak loudly and startle me.

301
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,040
Jawoon: Kind.

302
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,920
(Kind)

303
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960
(Kind)
Jawoon: And then...

304
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,960
Jawoon: Happy.

305
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,280
(Startled, Kind, Happy) Porsche: Happy.
Jawoon: Yes, happy.

306
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,200
(Startled, Kind, Happy)

307
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,720
Porsche: Happy.
Jawoon: Yes, happy.

308
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,880
Junlan: What makes you feel at ease
when you’re with the other person?

309
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,320
Talay: I can’t say alcohol, right?

310
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,280
Junlan: You can’t say alcohol.
Talay: No, no.

311
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,400
Talay: Cut that out, please.
Junlan: Yes.

312
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,240
Talay: You go first.
Junlan: Okay, I’ll go first then.

313
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,840
Junlan: You know, I’m someone who lacks self-confidence.

314
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,480
Junlan: Because when I was growing up, my family wasn’t with me.

315
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Talay: Where did you grow up?

316
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,400
Junlan: In Beijing.
Talay: Beijing.

317
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,500
Junlan: But my family wasn’t living there.

318
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,830
Junlan: Because my parents had to work.

319
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,400
Junlan: And they didn’t work in Beijing.

320
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,240
Junlan: So growing up without my family...

321
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,080
Junlan: I always thought about it.

322
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Junlan: It made me feel insecure.

323
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,320
Junlan: Having friends who feel like a safe space

324
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,800
Junlan: ..and gives me comfort.

325
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,920
Talay: Are you someone who gets along with people easily?

326
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,480
Junlan: Not exactly.
Talay: Not exactly.

327
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,330
Junlan: Because I always have my own boundaries.

328
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,200
Junlan: Socializing is difficult for me.

329
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,810
(MBTI: INFP = Introvert - Intuitive - Feeling - Perceiving)
Junlan: Socializing is difficult for me.

330
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,960
(MBTI: INFP = Introvert - Intuitive - Feeling - Perceiving)
Junlan: Especially for foreigners like us.

331
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,800
Talay: I think it gets easier when we’re together.
Junlan: Yes, exactly.

332
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,840
Junlan: It’s very interesting how everyone has different personalities.

333
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,120
Junlan: Some are shy, some are like Zhuojie.

334
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,240
Talay: Some are shy, some are like Zhuojie.
Junlan: Yeah, yeah.

335
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,160
Junlan: Zhuojie always says things positively.

336
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Junlan: And he’s very peculiar—very odd.

337
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,550
Junlan: You know, one director once asked me,

338
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,000
Junlan: and I told him:
Talay tries to talk with the foreign members.

339
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,560
Junlan: Even if we foreigners sit together all the time,

340
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,720
Junlan: you still try to come up with topics to talk to us about.

341
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,210
(What impressed me about Talay)
Junlan: You still try to come up with topics to talk to us about.

342
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,080
(What impressed me about Talay)
Junlan: I remember.

343
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,400
Junlan: You were so kind to all of us.

344
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,760
Talay: I have to tell you, I’m not really
the kind of person you think I am.

345
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
(I’m not who you think I am!)
Talay: I have to tell you, I’m not really the kind of person you think I am.

346
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,840
Talay: I’m not comfortable with just anyone.

347
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,400
(I’m not comfortable with everyone)
Talay: I’m not comfortable with just anyone.

348
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,480
Talay: I feel at ease
with people who respond when I talk.

349
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,440
Talay: Not just give a one-word answer.

350
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,470
Junlan: Because some people, if you ask, “Do you like coffee?”

351
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,040
Junlan: They’ll just say, “Yes.”
Talay: Yes.

352
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,320
Junlan: And that’s it.
Talay: I don’t know what to do next.

353
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,480
Junlan: Exactly, exactly.

354
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,800
Talay: One person in this project who’s like that is Intouch.

355
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,640
(Dokyun, Intouch)

356
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,680
(Intouch)

357
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,040

358
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,240
(Looks like they’re getting much closer now.)
Dokyun: That’s awesome.

359
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,560
(Looks like they’re getting much closer now.)
Zhuojie: That was fast.

360
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,680
(Looks like they’re getting much closer now.)

361
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,680
Porsche: Okay, this one
Jawoon: Okay, this one.

362
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,200
Porsche: If you were a character in a movie or series,
who would you want to star with?

363
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,880
Jawoon: What?

364
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,990
Porsche: Let me repeat the question in Thai.

365
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,520
Porsche: For me...

366
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,320
Porsche: Maybe it’d be you.

367
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,160
(Didn’t expect that answer. Totally stunned.)

368
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,360

Talay: I think they look similar.

374
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,960
Junlan: Cowboy.

375
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,880
Talay: Porsche’s dressed like a cowboy already.

376
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,070
Junlan: Exactly.

377
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,120
Porsche: Sheep.

378
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,720

Porsche: Yeah.

385

Talay: I think we have to work with some animals.

386
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,890
Talay: Sheep, cows...
Junlan: Animals?

387
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,560

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,640
Third: One, two, three.

846
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,440
(Welcome home.)

847
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,800
Talay: Listen to me, listen.

848
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,040
(It’s been a long day.)
Talay: It’s been a long day.

849
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,280
(Without you, my friend.)
Jawoon: Without you, my friends.

850
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,440
(And I’ll tell you all about it.)
Porsche: And I’ll tell you all about it.

851
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,560
(When I see you again.)
Junlan: When I see you again.

852
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,240
Zhuojie: I’m so tired today.

853
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,760
Talay: Really? What did you do?

854
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,660
Junsu: We cleaned and earned some money too.

855
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,460
Porsche: Money? You got paid too?

856
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,280
Junsu: We made money.

857
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,840
Junsu: One hundred baht.
Third: One thousand.

858
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,480
Porsche: One thousand?

859
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,640
Junsu: Is this from the farm?

860
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,230
Jawoon: Everything came from the farm.

861
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,080
Junsu: That’s so cool.

862
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,200
Jawoon: We also got a jigsaw puzzle today.

863
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,960
Talay: That one.

864
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,980
Junlan: We got four pieces. Let’s take a look.

865
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,120
Porsche: Let’s put them together.

866
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,760
Talay: The sky.
Dokyun: Looks like it.

867
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,020
Zhuojie: This is...

868
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,080
Talay: Where is this place?

869
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,980
Junsu: Can I see all the ingredients?

870
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:01,590
Junsu: Could you introduce all the ingredients to me?

871
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,920
Talay: We got the recipes already.
Junsu: You got the recipes?

872
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,880
Talay: For six dishes.

873
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,440
(Have to make 6 dishes.)
Talay: Six dishes.
Porsche: Six dishes.

874
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,960
(Have to make 6 dishes.)
Talay: That we have to cook today.

875
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,760
Junlan: We’ll need to split into two groups.

876
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,600
(Split into 2 groups.)
Junlan: We’ll need to split into two groups.

877
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,240
(Split into 2 groups.)
Junlan: One group outside.

878
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,920
Junlan: One group inside.

879
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Talay: Two groups.
Junlan: Right.

880
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,520
(Green curry / Sour curry with acacia shrimp)
Porsche: We have two curry dishes.

881
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,520
(Green curry / Sour curry with acacia shrimp)
(Pad Kra Pao / Stir-fried morning glory)
Porsche: Two stir-fry dishes.

882
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,440
(Green curry / Sour curry with acacia shrimp)
(Pad Kra Pao / Stir-fried morning glory)
(Fried egg / Omelette)
Porsche: And two egg dishes.

883
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,200
Talay: I need another Thai person who can cook, I can’t.

884
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,280
Porsche: I can cook the stir-fry dishes.

885
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,520
Talay: Porsche and F4 can cook Thai food.

886
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,200
Talay: Can these two cook?

887
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,360
F4: I can.
Third: I can.

888
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,960
Intouch: Sure.
Third: I’ll help chop, help prep.

889
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,360
Talay: Let’s split — curry or stir-fry?

890
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,320
Talay: Take that one outside.

891
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,450
Junsu: What should I do, Chef?

892
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,020
Porsche: Head Chef.
Junsu: Head Chef.

893
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,710
Talay: I don’t know what to do.

894
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,430
Junlan: What should we do next?

895
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,600
Porsche: He knows what to do.

896
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,990
Porsche: Stir-fry. Stir-fried veggies.
Talay: Stir-fried morning glory.

897
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,560
Intouch: Stir-fry is fine.
Talay: Just stir-fry.

898
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,520
Talay: This is called "morning glory."

899
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,320
F4: Two stations for sour curry with acacia.

900
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,280
F4: And green curry.

901
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,920
F4: Today we’ll make sour curry and green curry.

902
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,160
F4: I moved out and lived in a dorm since grade 10.

903
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,600
F4: So I started cooking for myself during COVID.

904
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,800
F4: I’ve been practicing, learning recipes.

905
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,000
F4: Now I can just cook naturally.

906
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,720
F4: Thai cuisine in the kitchen with me, Four, today.

907
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,280
F4: A trick to keep eggplants from turning black.

908
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,640
F4: You have to add salt.

909
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,410
F4: After cutting, soak them in salt water.

910
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,360
F4: That way they won’t turn black. Hands are washed.

911
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,880
Talay: We need to cut it into 3 or 4 pieces.

912
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:40,700
Jawoon: I’m so hungry today.

913
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,900
(I’m so hungry today.)
Jawoon: I’m so hungry today.

914
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,050
F4: Do we need to wash acacia?

915
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,070
Third: No need to wash.

916
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,920
(I was so hungry yesterday.)
Jawoon: I was so hungry yesterday.

917
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,520
F4: Hungry today?

918
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,400
(I’ll be super hungry tomorrow.)
Jawoon: Super hungry tomorrow.

919
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:50,520
Jawoon: I’m hungry every day.

920
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,160
(I’m hungry every day.)
Jawoon: I’m hungry every day.

921
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,760
(= Hungry every day.)
Jawoon: So, so hungry.

922
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,730
Talay: Oh, they’re wearing shoes? I should wear mine too.
Porsche: I’m not wearing any.

923
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,800
TaLay: I’m not wearing them either.
Porsche: Forget it.

924
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,200
Porsche: We’ll clean it all at once later.

925
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,280
TaLay: I’ll just go soak my feet down below.

926
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,080
(Quiet...)

927
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,400
TaLay: I don’t feel comfortable with everyone.

928
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,320
TaLay: I only feel comfortable with people who respond when I talk—

929
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,400
TaLay: —not just say one word back.

930
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,280
TaLay: I don’t know what to do next.
Junlan: Exactly.

931
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,160
TaLay: One person in the project who’s like that is Intouch.
Junlan: Yeah, Intouch.

932
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,480
TaLay: But right now, I’m trying to talk to him more.

933
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,120
TaLay: So he’ll talk more with me.

934
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,920
Junlan: I feel like he’s closing himself off.

935
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,840
TaLay: I think he just needs more time. He’s a typical Thai guy.

936
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,880
TaLay: Garlic—what kind are we using?

937
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,320
Porsche: We already used some last night.

938
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,720
TaLay: So we’re not using these little ones?

939
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,440
Porsche: No need. Just one type is enough.

940
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,760
TaLay: How do you chop garlic?

941
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,060
TaLay: Intouch.

942
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,160
Porsche: Can you help me pluck these?

943
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,560
TaLay: Wait, I’ll wash my hands first.

944
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,560
Junlan: Do you want some help?

945
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,360
TaLay: So you swept and mopped the whole house?
Junlan: You can teach me, and you can do the important stuff.

946
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,320
Junlan: I’ll do the simple, unimportant parts.

947
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,690
Porsche: Just pluck them.
TaLay: I can do it for you.

948
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:27,530
Junlan: Okay.
Porsche: Let’s go.

949
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,920
TaLay: Intouch, so what are you guys doing today?

950
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,280
TaLay: Sweeping, mopping?

951
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,080
Intouch: What? Us?
TaLay: Yeah.

952
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,760
TaLay: The floor is smooth though.

953
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,360
Junsu: We have to study Thai food.

954
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,680
(MBTI: ISTJ = Introvert - Sensing - Thinking - Judging)

955
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,920
(MBTI: ISTJ = Introvert - Sensing - Thinking - Judging)
(Intouch still doesn’t open up easily.)

956
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,160
Zhuojie: F4.

957
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,360
F4: What?

958
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,320
Zhuojie: Do you want my help?

959
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,640
(MBTI: ENFJ = Extrovert - Intuitive - Feeling - Judging)
Zhuojie: Do you want my help?

960
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,280
(MBTI: ENFJ = Extrovert - Intuitive - Feeling - Judging)
Zhuojie: I can do anything, anywhere.

961
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,880
(MBTI: ENFJ = Extrovert - Intuitive - Feeling - Judging)
Zhuojie: Anything, anywhere, anytime.

962
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,640
Jawoon: Can’t I just tear it like this?
F4: This one, and this one.

963
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,520
Zhuojie: Anything, anywhere—
if you need me, I can do it all.

964
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,830
F4: Okay.

965
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:09,960
(MBTI: INFJ = Introvert - Intuitive - Feeling - Judging)
Third: First of all, I think it’s a bit chaotic.

966
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,680
(MBTI: INFJ = Introvert - Intuitive - Feeling - Judging)
Third: Chaotic because if you're doing it alone—

967
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,760
(MBTI: INFJ = Introvert - Intuitive - Feeling - Judging)
Third: —you know what to do next.

968
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,560
Third: But with many people—

969
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,320
Third: You really have to divide up the roles.

970
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,120
Third: Everyone takes responsibility for their part.

971
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,760
Third: It ends up feeling cramped. Something like that.

972
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Third: And yeah, it really feels chaotic.

973
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,520
Junlan: Intouch.

974
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,250
Junlan: You’re here.

975
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,540
Junlan: We’re confused and worried about how they’ll communicate.
Junsu: Worried about what?

976
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,730
Junsu: Within the team?
Junlan: Within the team.

977
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,520
TaLay: So what happened?

978
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,560
Junlan: Today.

979
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,160
TaLay: Yeah, here?
Junlan: It was fun.

980
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:05,130
TaLay: Not us, them.
Junlan: No, they told me it was really fun.

981
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,150
Junlan: It was fun, right?
Intouch: Yeah.

982
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,840
Junsu: We swam.
Intouch: Played ball.

983
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,970
Junsu: Yeah, volleyball.

984
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:18,890
Junsu: Then we cleaned and searched for things.

985
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,200
Junlan: We’re confused and worried.

986
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,480
Intouch: If we could get paid for cleaning, that’d be great.

987
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,260
TaLay: That’s a lot—4,000 baht.

988
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,080
TaLay: Got it cleaned, and even got paid.

989
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:35,680
(It’s a good start, Intouch~)
TaLay: Got it cleaned, and even got paid.

990
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,360
(It’s a good start, Intouch~)
Intouch: Got one thousand baht.

991
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,770
(It’s a good start, Intouch~)

992
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,560
F4: And then we added the fish.

993
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,160
F4: Pro tip—if you want gaeng som (sour curry) to be richer—

994
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,800
F4: Or more intense—

995
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,920
F4: Add canned fish or tuna.

996
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,100
F4: I usually use tuna.

997
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:54,210
F4: But in the survival kit, they gave us canned fish.

998
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,720
F4: So I used that.

999
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,240
F4: For flavor. For richness.

1000
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,540
Zhuojie: No, Chef.

1001
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,930
F4: Here, it’s done.

1002
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,600
Zhuojie: Because I...

1003
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,440
F4: Now we’ll toss in the veggies.

1004
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,560
Jawoon: Can I taste it?

1005
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,840

1007
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,640
(Tom Yum Kung?)
Dokyun: Is this Tom Yum Kung?

1008
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,240

1009
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,580

1010
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,530

F4: Okay, Thai food—

1019
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,920
F4: Is done!

1020
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,000
F4: Cover it with a lid or plate.

1021
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,840

1022
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,840

1027
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,960
(Just a bit)

1028
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,840

1059
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,960

1060
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:59,440
Jawoon: With tears in my eyes... she doesn’t love me anymore.

1061
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,880

1062
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,950
Jawoon: Your heart is sinful. Even if I bow to the ground, you’ll still leave.

1063
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,440
Jawoon: I’m done with wicked women.

1064
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,560

1071
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,240

1072
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,160

1073
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,600
