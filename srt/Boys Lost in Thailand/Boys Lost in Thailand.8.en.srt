His English is really good.

235
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,280

236
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,320

237
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,800
Jawoon: “Jawoon, are you hungry?”

238
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,000

Nan: You can gently hold the mango

298
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,240
Nan: Because it’s a fruit with very thin skin

299
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,720
Porsche: You have to be gentle

300
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,440
Nan: This is how you harvest them

301
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,040
Nan: You can cut right at the mango’s stem like this

302
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,160
Nan: Cut it a bit longer like this

303
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,920

374
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960

384
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,640

00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,000

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Nan: Then next—

402
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,360
Third: Why can’t we just use frozen mangoes directly?

403
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,640
Nan: If we only use room-temperature mangoes

404
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,720
Nan: It’ll get too watery when blended with ice

405
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,920
Nan: This frozen one helps it thicken
Junsu: Do we add sugar?

406
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,360
Jawoon: Do we add syrup?
Junsu: Do we add sugar?

407

408
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,130
Nan: Okay, okay

409
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,880
Nan: You don’t need to heap the ice so high

410
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,600
Third: Like this?
Nan: That’s about right

411
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,920
F4: Is it good?

412
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,040

Junlan: No

422
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,840
Junlan: Sweet thief

423
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,760
Junlan: Not a sweet thief

424
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,600
Junlan: So good

425
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760

431
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,320
(4 puzzle pieces)

432
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,250
Porsche: Okay.

433
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,960
Porsche: Anyone want to go somewhere?

434
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,800
Nan: If everyone understands, please put on your baking gloves.

435
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,960

482
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,240

488
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200

496
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
(30 minutes left)

497
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,280
Intouch: Everyone’s rushing a lot.

498
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,480
Intouch: Because customers came in really fast.

499
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,960
Intouch: So we had to help each other and move fast.

500
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,740
Intouch: Making smoothies requires—

501
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,200
Intouch: If we do one cup at a time,

502
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,520
Intouch: It won’t be fast enough.

503
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,320
Intouch: So we had to put in four at once.

504
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,280
(Mango x4)
Intouch: So we had to put in four at once.

505
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,560
(Mango x4)
Intouch: Which made the smoothie a bit too sweet for me.

506
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,040
(Sweet x4)
Intouch: Which made the smoothie a bit too sweet for me.

507
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,280
Intouch: It turned out a bit too sweet for me.

508
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
Intouch: Because I tasted it.

509
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,920
Intouch: At first, I wondered if
customers would feel that way.

510
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,810
Intouch: But after tasting it at the end,

511
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,080
Intouch: It really was too sweet.

512
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,310
Talay: More customers coming in!

513
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,240

515
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,350
Zhuojie: Why’s it broken?

516
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,550

642

Zhuojie: Only food was allowed

643
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,630

644
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,920

Intouch: I think he’s really sweet

649
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,440
Intouch: Because I honestly didn’t expect him to do this

650
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,680
Intouch: At first I thought he might ask for a big blanket

651
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,640
Intouch: Or something personal for himself

652
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,150
Intouch: But in the end, he asked for something for everyone

653
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,520
Intouch: It was really touching

654
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:46,820
Zhuojie: Two days ago I worked during the day
then practiced at night

655
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,930
Zhuojie: so I felt so exhausted

656
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,450
Zhuojie: I just wanted something high-energy

657
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,990
Zhuojie: But I thought—we’re a team

658
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,650
Zhuojie: If I get something, I want them to get it too

659
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:02,060
Zhuojie: I hope we all enjoyed that moment together

660
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,550
Zhuojie: Whether I could get one thing or ten

661
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,820
Zhuojie: I just wanted everyone to eat together and spend time

662
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,030
Zhuojie: That first night, Talay

663
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,390
Zhuojie: said he wanted cola

664
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,020
Zhuojie: but had to buy it himself

665
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,240
Zhuojie: I remembered, so I asked for it for him

666
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,730
Zhuojie: I hope it made him happy

667
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,490

00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,090

669
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,520

Zhuojie: Honestly, it wasn’t tiring

672
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,330
Zhuojie: What made me happy

673
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,880
Zhuojie: wasn’t the sacrifice itself

674
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,570
Zhuojie: but seeing that when I took care of them, they were happy

675
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,760
Zhuojie: Seeing them happy made me feel at peace

676
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,960

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,280
Talay: That’s bad!

692
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,450
Zhuojie: Bad boy!

693
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,040
Junlan: Can I explain myself?

694
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,940
Junlan: Because Junsu stole the mangoes from me

695
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,060
Junsu: What??

696
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,560
Junlan: I didn’t start it—he did!

697
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,990
Junlan: Thief!

698
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,630
Talay: Thief! Thief!

699
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,320
Junsu: He was the thief first!

700
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,500
Dokyun: First of all—

701
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,380
Dokyun: We have different nationalities and languages

702
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,180
Dokyun: But today, we united and worked as one

703
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,950
Dokyun: that was really touching for me

704
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,660
Junsu: Even though we speak different languages and come from different countries—

705
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,320
Junsu: We worked together so well

706
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,930
Junsu: He was impressed by that

707
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,270
Talay: You moved to the smoothie station, right?

708
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,020
Dokyun: That’s right

709
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Junsu: He helped me a lot today

710
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,200
Talay: I’m impressed by Junsu today

711
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,600
Talay: Because when Junlan was stealing a lot of mangoes—

712
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,990
Porsche: He stole mangoes

713
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,560
Talay: He stole a bunch, and then Junsu started too

714
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,440
Talay: But once we told Junsu that Junlan already took a lot—

715
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,720
Talay: Junsu gave them back and even gave us more!

716
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,730
Porsche: He gave us extra!

717
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,680
Junsu: Yeah, yeah!

718
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,360
Talay: I told everyone you stole a lot of our mangoes.

719
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,260
Junlan: Me? No, I didn’t.
Talay: Yes, you did.

720
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,310
Talay: Then Junsu came and stole some too.

721
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:00,110
Talay: But I told him Junlan already took a bunch.

722
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,920
Junlan: Don’t you want to hear my explanation?

723
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,450
Junlan: He stole from me.
Junsu: No, I—

724
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,000
Junsu: But I gave it back, didn’t I?

725
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,160
Talay: Yes, and he even returned more than he took.

726
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,450
Junlan: Talay, yesterday we had trust.

727
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,760
Talay: Yeah, but you broke it.

728
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,930
Talay: You stole my mangoes.

729
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,480
Junlan: Because you picked the wrong teammate.

730
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,230
Talay: Really? Why?
Junlan: Yess

731
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,220
Junlan: Because he stole my mangoes!

732
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,310
Talay: No, he’s my teammate.

733
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,440
(This guy right here!)

734
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,960
Junsu: “Because you chose the wrong friend...”

735
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,240
Porsche: I’m thankful to everyone
for working together as a team at the café.

736
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,360
Porsche: Even though it was tough,

737
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,690
Porsche: Even though it was exhausting, we did well.

738
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,240
Porsche: So thank you so much, everyone.

739
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,980
Junlan: I feel like it was a learning opportunity.

740
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,850
Junsu: Learning how to steal?

741
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,130
Junsu: We need to protect our stuff.

742
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:10,640
Junlan: If everyone calls me a thief
for stealing from all of you...

743
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,160
Junlan: You trust me, right?

744
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,350
F4: I do.

745
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,080
Junlan: I have someone who trust me, so it’s fine.

746
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,080
Porsche: So you two are the thieves, right?

747
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,900
Junsu: Thieves, yeah, yeah.

748
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,170
Junlan: No, no, no!

749
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,770
Junlan: I actually really enjoyed working with F4.

750
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,080
Junlan: It’s the first time
we’ve been teammates, right?

751
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,740
F4: That’s right.
Junlan: We picked mangoes together.

752
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,370
Junlan: And tried to protect our mangoes from everyone else.

753
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,000
Junlan: It was really hard.

754
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,790
Junsu: Why’d you do that?

755
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,180
Junlan: Because I had to protect the mangoes.

756
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,580
Junlan: And he had to pick mangoes.

757
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,250
Junlan: So we did great.

758
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,900
Talay: I saw him sitting there with the basket.

759
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,830
Junlan: Because you guys were trying to steal mangoes from me.

760
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,390
Talay: No!
Junlan: All of you!

761
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,530
Zhuojie: I can only speak Chinese.

762
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,060
Zhuojie: I can only speak Chinese, sorry.

763
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:04,160
Zhuojie: Today, let’s not talk about mangoes.

764
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,190
Junlan: Not going to talk about mangoes.

765
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,180
Zhuojie: What I remember most is when we were inside.

766
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,910
Zhuojie: There were lots of people, and we had to finish the job.

767
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,720
Junlan: What impressed me most
was that we got through that mission together.

768
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,120
Zhuojie: We divided the work for a common goal.

769
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Junlan: Each person had different responsibilities.

770
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,160
Junlan: But all for the same mission.

771
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,160
Zhuojie: It reminded me of a day

772
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,900
Zhuojie: when everyone practiced and did stuff together.

773
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,730
Zhuojie: All for the sake of winning first place.

774
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:42,960
Junlan: It reminded him of training for a basketball competition at university.

775
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,750
Junlan: And everyone on the team gave their all
for the same goal.

776
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,730
Talay: Teamwork!
Junlan: Yeah, teamwork.

777
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,960
Zhuojie: When you reach your goal, you feel complete.

778
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,940
Junlan: When we completed the mission,
it felt like winning a basketball game.

779
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,680
Zhuojie: Just telling the story for fun.

780
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,800
Junlan: Just sharing for fun.

781
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,450
Zhuojie: I feel like F4...

782
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,800
Zhuojie: There were so many people, and F4 was like...

783
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,250
Zhuojie: And then you were like..

784
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,080
Zhuojie: And then...

785
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,990
Zhuojie: Junsu was like...

786
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,690
Intouch: Actually, today I liked it the most.

787
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:33,160
Intouch: It was seeing everyone slowly break down their walls.

788
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,680
Intouch: Everyone started talking more and becoming much closer.

789
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,970
Jawoon: Compared to before,

790
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,590
Jawoon: I was always with Porsche.

791
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,760
Jawoon: But today was my first time riding in a different van.

792
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,630
Jawoon: It felt a bit weird, to be honest.

793
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,030
Jawoon: F4 told me so many things.

794
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,670
Jawoon: F4, it’s like when I—

795
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,280
Jawoon: stay like this, he’d say “Jawoon, Jawoon!”

796
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,850
Jawoon: So I wanted to talk more.

797
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,210
Jawoon: Before bed, he recommended music to me.

798
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,960
Jawoon: Like, right before sleep, he’d share songs.

799
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,140
Jawoon: And tell funny stories.

800
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,290
Jawoon: Even though I sing Thai songs really weirdly,

801
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,540
Jawoon: he’d still instantly know which song it was.

802
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,390
Dokyun: Intouch.

803
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,240
Junlan: Grab him! Grab him!

804
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,570
Intouch: I just want everyone to get closer and be able to talk about anything.

805
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,200
Intouch: Because I think we’ll be together for a long time.

806
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,040
Jawoon: Sorry for barging in like a meringkingkong

807
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,920
Jawoon: saranongkongkeng, manongmanangmub,

808
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,280
Jawoon: palongpongpang, nongnangnongnang in your life...

809
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,930
Match the look and walk the runway

810
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,040
with tie-dye made from natural clay dyes.

811
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,440
Third: It’s not very fashionable to be honest.

812
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,840
Intouch: Totally overdressed.

813
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,910
Junlan: Looks classy, but definitely not expensive.

814
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,400
Junsu: Junlan’s at this level, and we’re up here.

815
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,560
Zhuojie: Calm down.
Junsu: Calm down.

816
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,480
Zhuojie: No need to be scared.

817
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,780
We have a special prize for the person with the most likes.

818
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,480
The prize is a luxury shared bedroom.

819
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,880
Jawoon: Happiness isn’t far away.

820
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,880
(Don’t leave yet, there’s a post-credit scene!)

821
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,470
Dir: What is it?

822
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,520
Staff: He wants to talk to you.

823
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,620
Dokyun: I have something to propose.

824
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,360
Dokyun: Right now I have 500 baht.

825
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,520
Dokyun: And I want to use it.

826
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,200
Staff: He has a proposal. He has 500 baht.

827
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,040
Staff: He feels like he wants to use this money.

828
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,000
Dir: What does he want to do with it?

829
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,910
Staff: What do you want to use it for?

830
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,660
Dokyun: I want to buy a blanket.

831
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,220
Staff: He wants to buy a blanket.

832
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,100
Dokyun: Because my Chinese friend Jeremy

833
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,530
Dokyun: is cold all night long.

834
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,600
Dokyun: So I want to use my money to buy him a blanket.

835
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,480
Dokyun: Please help ask if it’s okay.

836
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,830
Staff: His Chinese friend said

837
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,130
Staff: he’s cold every night.

838
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,800
Staff: He feels like he wants to use his money
to buy that friend a blanket.

839
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,220
Staff: So he wants to ask if that’s possible.

840
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,420
Dir: Zhuojie?

841
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,000
Staff: Zhuojie, right?

842
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Dokyun: Yes, yes! Zhuojie!

843
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:28,680
Dir: But this is a game, right?
He didn’t choose the bed with stuff in the first place.

844
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,330
Staff: This is part of the game, right?

845
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:37,170
Staff: Because he didn’t pick the bed with the blanket.

846
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,470
Dokyun: So I can’t even buy it with my own money?

847
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,190
Dokyun: Even if I pay myself?

848
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,820
Staff: Even with his own money, can’t he buy it?

849
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,280
Dir: It has to be bought. I’ll check the price with the team.

850
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,720
Staff: He can buy it.

851
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,780
Staff: But we need to check with the crew first.

852
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,720
Staff: So...

853
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,210
Dokyun: Is it expensive? How much is it?

854
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,430
Staff: Is it expensive? How much?

855
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,920
Dir: P’Berm, can you hear me?

856
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:06,280
Dir: An actor wants to buy a blanket for his friend.

857
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,520
Dir: If he has to buy it, how much should it cost?

858
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,800
