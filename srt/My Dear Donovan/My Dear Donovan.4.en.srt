1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,410
What's wrong with you? Why were you standing in the middle of the road?

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,410
You almost got hit.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,410
I thought she was someone I knew.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,060
It's all right, Mr. Aood.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,440
I can go home by myself.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,130
Call me when you get home. Okay?

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,480
Dude, look at her.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,860
She's carrying heavy stuff.

9
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,160
- I should go help her.
- Let go!

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,440
- Hey!
- Watch out!

11
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:37,690
I noticed that his hands kept shaking.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,720
I don't know what the cause was,

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,923
but I could sense that what had just shocked him must have been a big deal in his life.

14
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,706
Are you all right?

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,280
I am.

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,059
I was just afraid that you would get hurt.

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,520
Are you really all right?

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,417
I'm really all right.

19
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,710
Thank you so much for helping me.

20
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,590
Your stuff.

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,000
It's all right. Just leave them there.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,175
I'll only grab some that I can carry home.

23
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,840
Give it to me.

24
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,087
Come. I'll walk you home.

25
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,420
Take care of it for me.

26
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,020
I'm leaving. Fix it for me.

27
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,170
Catch up with her.

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,625
Damn it. How do I fix it?

29
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,179
It may turn worse.

30
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,840
People say that sometimes fate is all about timing.

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,980
If that day, Mr. Aood's motorbike could have been started right away,

32
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,633
this story would have turned out differently.

33
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,860
I came to see you because I wanted to get my necklace.

34
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,428
Necklace?

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,370
Yeah.

36
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,972
That necklace I asked you to keep during my photoshoot.

37
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:13,640
I see.

38
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,900
Your necklace.

39
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't you need to take it off?

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,140
Let's keep it like this so you won't lose it.

41
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,530
Did you lose my necklace?

42
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,171
Nope. I didn't.

43
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:27,195
I remember putting it in this pocket.

44
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,890
It's 120,000 THB in total.

45
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,810
But because you're adorable, I'm offering you a discount.

46
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,640
It's 427 THB.

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,141
Mr. Aood.

48
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:44,160
Please check first.

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,060
All right.

50
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,890
I recall it now.

51
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,680
I think I dropped it when I was buying stuff at the minimart.

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,340
You wait here.

53
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,840
I'll be right back. It won't take long.

54
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,540
I'll go with you.

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,315
Are you looking for this?

56
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,700
Nicky found it on the floor in front of the cashier counter.

57
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,970
Oh, yes. I was looking for it.

58
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,470
Hey!

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
That's Pam's.

60
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,180
It's mine.

61
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:29,570
Yes. It's his.

62
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,641
He asked me to keep it for him, but I forgot to return it.

63
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,800
Is this the person you're working with, Miss Pam?

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,100
Yes.

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,440
I guess it must be so important to you.

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,100
That's why you came here yourself to take it.

67
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,420
Since you got it back now, just leave.

68
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,800
I'm going back.

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
See you tomorrow.

70
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,231
If it hurts or causes sores, take some pills.

71
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,554
I'm talking about your feet, too.

72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,820
Your bag was ripped and dropped in the middle of the alley.

73
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,120
Did something happen?

74
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,410
While I was walking home,

75
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,900
I met those drunkards sitting there drinking at alley 11.

76
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,060
They bad-mouthed me a bit.

77
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,980
Seriously?

78
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,940
Are you all right?

79
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,290
Why are your feet hurt?

80
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm all right, Mr. Aood.

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm all right.

82
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,740
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,540
If my motorbike hadn't broken down, I could have sent you home.

84
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,570
How awful I am.

85
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,560
Hey, it's all right, Mr. Aood. Don't overthink.

86
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,711
I'm all right.

87
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,760
Let me bring these things to Grandma.

88
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,460
I'm going in.

89
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,087
Good night, Miss Pam.

90
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,560
Yeah.

91
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,210
Grandma, you just arrived?

92
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,690
Yes. Heavy traffic.

93
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,093
Whose shoes are these?

94
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,690
I wore them home.

95
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,680
What? Whose shoes did you wear?

96
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,690
They belong to a guy.

97
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,900
He let me borrow his.

98
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,230
Oh my gosh.

99
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,880
What a confident granddaughter.

100
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,960
It's just that I had shoe blisters.

101
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,590
He let me borrow his and wear them home.

102
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,627
Are you talking about Dino?

103
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,760
Who else could it be?

104
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,140
Sa, can I pinch your lips?

105
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,610
If you don't allow me, it's fine.

106
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,490
Stop.

107
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,440
I'll hit you to death. I just got mouth fillers. They could migrate.

108
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,400
Do you think he...

109
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,580
Hey, nope.

110
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,140
He doesn't have feelings for you.

111
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,410
He probably just pities you.

112
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,580
Don't be overconfident, my dearest granddaughter.

113
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,660
Hey, what's with you?

114
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,640
I didn't ask you anything.

115
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,400
I knew what you would say right after you opened your mouth.

116
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,520
- What?
- Take your stuff. They're inside.

117
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,660
Fine. Thanks.

118
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,170
Wait.

119
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,540
This is not a bag, but a shirt sleeve?

120
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,830
This is a shirt, isn't it?

121
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,040
It is. Whose shirt is this?

122
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,690
It's not yours.

123
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,960
It's not a shirt. It's a new design of an eco-friendly tote bag.

124
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,100
Sa, you're not trendy, are you?

125
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,440
It doesn't make sense.

126
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,480
Stop it already. This is a shirt.

127
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,680
Tell me now whom it belongs to.

128
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,640
Whose is this? Whose?

129
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,904
I'm so exhausted today. Let me go to bed.

130
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,460
I'm sleepy for real.

131
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,570
It's bleeding.

132
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,060
I guess it must be so important to you.

133
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,314
That's why you came here yourself to take it.

134
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,730
It seems like an important item he needs to keep with him all the time.

135
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,640
Your necklace is so pretty.

136
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,050
Did my teacher buy it for you?

137
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,600
If it doesn't belong to his lover, then whom can it belong to?

138
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
Hey!

139
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,890
Maria!

140
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,690
Maria!

141
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,889
Maria?

142
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,080
It took you ages.

143
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,890
Come on. I have a date like others do.

144
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,000
What happened?

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,540
Why did you call me at this late hour?

146
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,740
[I already took the photo, Miss May.]

147
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,250
Shit.

148
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,440
What's this?

149
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,140
I think that toxic May's crew did it.

150
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,090
They released the photo and made up a story to make people chew us out.

151
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,429
What do they want, huh?! They're playing damn dirty.

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,750
You shouldn't have insulted her that much though.

153
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,380
All right. I'll call and talk to her.

154
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,290
Hello?

155
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,900
Who's that? You're calling at this late hour.

156
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,280
Hello.

157
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,480
I'm Pete Pisit from Parie Modeling.

158
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,960
Hello, Miss May.

159
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,680
I see.

160
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,703
It's the modeling agency that badmouthed and flaked out on the job without taking responsibility.

161
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,717
Who wouldn't remember such a company?

162
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,100
Let's talk nicely, please. Miss May, please calm down.

163
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,970
We saw the photo and posts about us flaking out on the job.

164
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,560
That looks kind of bad, Miss May.

165
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,640
I'm not sure if...

166
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,020
About the photo?

167
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,024
I guess someone at the filming set took it.

168
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,570
Or do you think it's my doing?

169
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,260
If you think that I did it, then show your evidence.

170
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,160
You can't just randomly accuse me like this.

171
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,560
Well, Miss May, I'm not accusing you,

172
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,060
but I'm begging for your kindness.

173
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,104
Can you please delete the photo and address that news for us?

174
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:51,440
Now, we're all in trouble because of it.

175
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,810
Or should we talk about compensation for you?

176
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,480
Compensation for what?

177
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,854
My product is crappy. Keep that in mind.

178
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:00,850
Your agency is well-known.

179
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:07,300
Wouldn't it be more fun if I can totally bash and ruin your reputation?

180
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,170
Delete the photo already.

181
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,700
Playing dirty like this is disgusting!

182
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,220
You're still loud, aren't you?

183
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,680
I'll keep playing until your agency becomes a piece of crap

184
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,597
and until your models can't appear in the media anymore.

185
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:25,040
Don't hang up on me!

186
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,000
You rude!

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,585
You scumbag! Disgusting!

188
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,530
Bring it down a notch. She already hung up.

189
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,181
My ears are hurting.

190
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:34,540
What did you just do?

191
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,866
I was trying to compromise.

192
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,250
[Pam]

193
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,200
Hello?

194
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,880
Hey, are you up?

195
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,890
I'm going to pick you up.

196
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,920
I'm up already.

197
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,523
All right. See you.

198
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,983
Hey.

199
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:22,863
I'm here.

200
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,020
I'm returning your shoes.

201
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,620
Hey?

202
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,661
I'll just put them here.

203
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,840
What?

204
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,120
Hey.

205
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,040
What?!

206
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
What are you doing?

207
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,520
Wait.

208
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,180
What are you doing to me?

209
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,760
I've been waiting a long time for a chance to sleep with you.

210
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,470
Don't.

211
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,786
Stop!

212
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,820
Nanomite Bed!

213
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,216
Big, spring with quiet thrill.

214
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,550
Wait.

215
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:10,007
What is a "quiet thrill"?

216
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,540
Here.

217
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,939
I have to get cast for this role.

218
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,736
It says a quiet sound, not quiet thrill.

219
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,560
Goodness. You shocked me.

220
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,640
You were just memorizing your script.

221
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,490
Let me tell you this.

222
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,880
You pronounced it unclearly. It's for sure going to be misleading.

223
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,220
Which part?

224
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,040
What? You don't know?

225
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,110
Well, feeling thrilled is like...

226
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,460
It's when you feel like...

227
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,456
Something like that.

228
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,153
Why?

229
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:10,988
Why are you smiling?

230
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,610
Actually, I know what it means.

231
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,550
But I just wanted to see how you would explain it to me.

232
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,069
You looked adorable when you were thrilled.

233
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,960
Hey, we have to go to the casting today.

234
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,320
Hurry up and take a shower now.

235
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,841
Hurry up.

236
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,206
You're so adorable.

237
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:04,360
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

238
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:11,190
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫

239
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,700
What is this?

240
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,530
I'm giving warmth to a warm guy.

241
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,535
You're quick-witted though, Aood. You're so good at it.

242
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,540
What are you talking about?

243
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,500
You're good at adapting things.

244
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,720
You turned this shirt into a tote bag, so Pam could put her stuff in.

245
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,900
We indeed have to help reduce global warming problems these days.

246
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,266
You did such a great job.

247
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:45,210
Two thumbs up for you.

248
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,406
But this is not mine.

249
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,180
Well, I'm here to let you know that

250
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,960
Grandpa will be discharged from the hospital within a few days.

251
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,823
I don't know if Pam will be available on that day,

252
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:06,227
and I may have to ask you to accompany me.

253
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:08,140
Sure.

254
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,920
Actually, I was right at first.

255
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,305
This shirt is so dirty, so I thought it couldn't belong to you.

256
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:15,720
Right?

257
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,340
I'm leaving.

258
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,530
- Bye.
- Sure.

259
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,330
Keep going.

260
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,020
Go for it.

261
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,615
At least someone is rooting for me.

262
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,400
[My Dear Donovan]

263
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:07,490
♫ Baby, it's you~ ♫

264
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:18,040
♫ Baby, it's you~ ♫

265
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,020
♫ You, you~ ♫

266
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,110
♫ Walk out that door, oh yeah ♫

267
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,640
The necklace he's so possessive about is right in front of me now.

268
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,170
Nosiness has always lived within women.

269
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,259
If any woman can stop herself from that, I'm happy for her.

270
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,920
Maria.

271
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,420
Her name is Maria for real.

272
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:09,008
I think Maria might be his lover.

273
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,636
Let me have a look, so I can stop being curious.

274
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,200
But it's kind of rude to look at his stuff secretly, isn't it?

275
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Should I maintain my manners, or should I resolve my doubt?

276
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,320
Hey, what's wrong with me?

277
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,006
Why do I want to know if he has a girlfriend or not?

278
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,100
What are you doing?

279
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,880
Nothing.

280
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,530
Well, I thought I saw something going inside the bag.

281
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,430
Did you find it?

282
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,050
Nope.

283
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,150
It's not in there.

284
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,920
I must be right.

285
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,080
That must be the gift he has prepared for Maria.

286
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,201
She must be his woman.

287
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,780
Ready now?

288
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,350
Hang on.

289
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,500
Here you are.

290
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,822
I bought them for you.

291
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,570
For me?

292
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,640
Uh-huh.

293
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,948
Open it. I think they'll suit you.

294
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:26,088
Try them on.

295
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:30,223
I guessed your size on my own, but I think they will fit you all right.

296
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,990
Hey, why are they so expensive?

297
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,280
I can't take them.

298
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,113
Why do you care about that?

299
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:54,180
I bought them for you.

300
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,372
Try them on. Now.

301
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,732
- Nope.
- Pam.

302
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,960
Wait.

303
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,420
Wait.

304
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,800
What are you doing?

305
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,740
You're stubborn,

306
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,820
so I'm putting them on for you.

307
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,583
Hey.

308
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,083
Hey.

309
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:25,128
I can do it myself.

310
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,630
Nice.

311
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,415
I like them.

312
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,664
♫ So please please don’t judge me,
just don't believe anyone that I'm bad ♫

313
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:02,919
A welcome gift for my manager.

314
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,090
Yesterday wasn't a pretty good start,

315
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:12,060
but for me, today seems like a good day.

316
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,030
Thank you.

317
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:18,980
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

318
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:26,200

319
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,680
Yes, Mom? What's up?

320
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,840
Come see me now, Pam. Right now.

321
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,450
Don't I have to take Donovan to join the casting?

322
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,440
No.

323
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,420
Everything got canceled already.

324
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,690
Is that so?

325
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,960
Why, Mom?

326
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,233
Pam, come see me now.

327
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,610
Mom?

328
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,270
What's wrong?

329
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,306
I don't know either.

330
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:11,476
Mom said you don't need to join the casting today

331
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,813
and asked me to hurry to the office to see her.

332
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,680
I think something happened for sure.

333
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,400
- Hey.
- What?

334
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,090
You don't need to go inside.

335
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,840
I'll talk to her.

336
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,240
Okay.

337
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,446
Explain this photo.

338
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,650
Which photo?

339
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,400
You're still making that innocent face?

340
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,000
Look.

341
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,020
What's this?

342
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,026
Wait. What's this hashtag, Mom?

343
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,180
"She's using her manager position as a front."

344
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,520
"I think she wants to 'eat' an imported product."

345
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,370
"Were her legs that fatigued?"

346
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,940
"They did that in broad daylight. Disgusting!"

347
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,820
"She seduced him to carry her. What a wicked girl."

348
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,050
"She's the daughter of that agency's owner, isn't she?"

349
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,060
"That mom probably wants her daughter to eat something imported just like she herself did."

350
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,500
"She has an innocent face but a slutty mind."

351
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,010
"What a damn hooker!"

352
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:39,947
Oh, gosh.

353
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:44,453
When I read social media bashings done toward others, I already felt terrible.

354
00:26:44,453 --> 00:26:46,226
But now that they did it to me directly,

355
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:48,600
I realized what it was like to feel frozen from head to toe.

356
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,930
I thought it was going to be a good day for me,

357
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,820
but it looks like my thought was wrong now.

358
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,640
What happened, Mom?

359
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,760
Why did they curse you and me and bash our agency this much?

360
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,160
You still ask me?

361
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,890
You were so careless that they secretly took inappropriate photos of you.

362
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,140
All of our confirmed jobs already got canceled!

363
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,106
But I didn't do anything.

364
00:27:08,106 --> 00:27:11,384
Donovan suddenly ran outside, so I ran after him.

365
00:27:11,384 --> 00:27:13,360
But I hurt my leg that day.

366
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,290
Donovan just helped carry me.

367
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,020
I'll explain that to them myself.

368
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,680
Who will believe such an excuse?

369
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,320
But that's a fact, Mom.

370
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,280
Then what? It's also a fact I already got chewed out!

371
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,540
What do you want me to do then?

372
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,490
Nothing. You don't need to say anything.

373
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,189
I asked you here so that I can scold you, not to listen to your excuses.

374
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,713
Why do I have to clean up the mess I didn't make?!

375
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,230
Pam, wait.

376
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,630
Pam.

377
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,840
Pam, talk to me.

378
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,998
What did your mom say?

379
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,940
Pam.

380
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,660
Why is she crying?

381
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,440
Do you know that such a big problem just occurred?

382
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,800
Pete told him about Mom exploding her anger onto me.

383
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,740
I think Pete just wanted to vent it out, but that made Donovan so mad at Mom.

384
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,780
Why did you blame Pam like that?

385
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,960
If you promise that you can handle that for me, let's do as you said.

386
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,240
I'll talk to Dino now.

387
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,150
Who just called?

388
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,480
Miss Da.

389
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,240
She knows that we got bashed on social media.

390
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,770
Did she add insult to our injury?

391
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,720
Listen first. At first, I blamed her like that, but she said she wanted to help us.

392
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,103
She said she could make all the news vanish at once as if nothing had happened.

393
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:06,080
She can do so? How?

394
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,600
She said that woman is her former employee.

395
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,170
Her hospital is one of the sponsors.

396
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,972
To put it simply, it's like she owes her something.

397
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:16,540
She said it's not difficult to negotiate, but she's asking for something in return.

398
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,986
What is it?

399
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,573
Dino must have dinner with her.

400
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,020
[My Dear Donovan]

401
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,320
Miss Da.

402
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,100
She knows that we got bashed on social media.

403
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:44,047
She said she could make all the news vanish at once as if nothing had happened.

404
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:45,850
But she's asking for something in return.

405
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,150
What is it?

406
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,475
Dino must have dinner with her.

407
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,680
Dinner?

408
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,060
Just dinner?

409
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,933
Yes.

410
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,620
I already gave her your number.

411
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,240
Hey, I'm not going.

412
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,400
How can you not go?

413
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,500
I'm not stupid.

414
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,060
It won't end at dinner.

415
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,533
Exactly. I agree with him.

416
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,420
Don't imagine things.

417
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,361
I already confirmed it with her, so you must go no matter what.

418
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,193
If she wants to have dinner that much, you just go eat with her.

419
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,300
You're the cause of this whole problem.

420
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,770
You should solve it yourself.

421
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,752
On the second day of my job, I cried.

422
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:57,240
That's awful.

423
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,940
It's my mom who made me cry.

424
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,400
I have always doubted if Mom loved me or not.

425
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,686
Does Mom love me?

426
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,160
Pam.

427
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,090
Why are you sitting here? It's hot.

428
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,420
Let's go inside. Okay?

429
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,626
Grandma, where is Mom?

430
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:24,613
When is she coming back?

431
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,613
Grandma, where is Mom?

432
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,980
There are only a few memories between Mom and me,

433
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,713
so I can't judge if she loves me or not.

434
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,480
Knock, knock!

435
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,060
Is anyone in there?

436

Hey, I bought a new movie DVD today.

438

I guess it's entertaining.

Of course, you did.

00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,960
He makes me laugh.

500
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,200
And that's right.

501
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,240
It makes me forget about the bad day even if it's just for a while.

502
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,372
Harder.

503
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,290
- Does it hurt?
- My wrist.

504
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,142
Is it broken?

505
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:18,980
What are you pranking? I was worried.

506
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,930
Hey.

507
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,900
Go.

508
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,960
Five, four, three, two, one.

509
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,357
How are the shoes? Did they give you shoe blisters?

510
00:38:53,357 --> 00:38:54,660
Nope.

511
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,300
They're very comfy.

512
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,860
Only the wearer knows where the shoe bites.

513
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,861
Do you know this idiom?

514
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,570
Only the person who is directly hurt can truly experience that pain or sadness.

515
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,208
Others can only sympathize.

516
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,579
I do sympathize and worry about you.

517
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,080
It's hot.

518
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,769
I'll make it for you.

519
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,353
Blow it first. It's hot.

520
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,240
You're enjoying yourself.

521
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,283
When I was young, I only had dolls as my toys.

522
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:02,456
I never got to play any of these things.

523
00:40:02,456 --> 00:40:04,549
My grandpa didn't allow me to.

524
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,600
Rollerblades, yoyo, and spinning tops.

525
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,130
I never played with those toys.

526
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,920
Back then, I thought Grandpa didn't allow me to play

527
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,580
because he was afraid they would hurt me.

528
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,370
He's afraid I would get a wound.

529
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,119
But as I grew up,

530
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,860
I have come to realize that he didn't allow me to play them

531
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,810
not only because he was afraid I would get hurt,

532
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:32,840
but it's because he didn't like to see me hurt.

533
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,180
He would feel awful.

534
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:40,436
He would feel that he couldn't protect me.

535
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,000
When adults warn us,

536
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,550
their words might imply something more complicated...

537
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,280
than they actually sound.

538
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,210
That's why Grandpa doesn't want me to meet Mom.

539
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:57,969
He knows that my mom, who has hurt him before, will also hurt me.

540
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,460
I knew this long ago, but I just pretended I didn't.

541
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,952
Mom never loved me.

542
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:13,983
She just feels guilty that she has never taken care of me all this time.

543
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,766
She allows me to work with her...

544
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:28,313
probably because she just wants to make up for that guilt.

545
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:40,200
I don't know if I have made a right or wrong decision to work with her.

546
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,664
Thank you for listening to me.

547
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,733
Don't say that.

548
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,410
Thanks for opening up your mind and telling me about it.

549
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,400
Do you know that...

550
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,180
if you didn't work with your mom, you wouldn't have met me.

551
00:42:13,424 --> 00:42:18,240
I don't know if it's because of me trusting him or me having feelings for him

552
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,283
that makes me dare open up, talking about the thing I have hidden deep inside of me.

553
00:42:22,283 --> 00:42:24,813
But I hope it's just because of trust,

554
00:42:24,813 --> 00:42:28,608
because I shouldn't fall for someone who is already taken.

555
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,890
Hello?

556
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,920
I've arrived.

557
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,600
You could just text me.

558
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,760
I know that your hand is hurt.

559
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,680
It may be difficult for you to type and reply, so I'm calling.

560
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,400
It doesn't hurt much.

561
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,615
Just a slight bruise.

562
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,120
I worked with you for only two days, but now my feet and hand hurt.

563
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,600
Will I survive?

564
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,400
You will.

565
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,370
You're with me now.

566
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,584
I won't let you get hurt anymore.

567
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,937
Are you going to bed now?

568
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:30,120
Not very soon.

569
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,010
My brain is still awake now since I had been playing a lot.

570
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,440
What's the matter?

571
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,540
Then talk to me.

572
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,720
Since you're now my manager and work like this,

573
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,260
what about your job at school?

574
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,700
It's still a long time before the next semester begins.

575
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,813
I think I'll do this job until then.

576
00:43:51,813 --> 00:43:57,440
But to be honest, I'm not quite good at doing this job.

577
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,040
But as you already know, my grandpa is sick.

578
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,456
Sometimes, we must agree to do some things we don't like for the ones we love.

579
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,000
Nice.

580
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,860
You're doing it for the person you love.

581
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,520
I'm doing that, too.

582
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,680
What am I feeling now?

583
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,978
Is that because I already have feelings for him?

584
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:24,439
The ring on the necklace I wear is the only thing...

585
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:33,480
that makes me feel she's still here.

586
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,840
She's the reason I agreed to become a model.

587
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,600
I want to be famous.

588
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,690
I want to meet her.

589
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:43,824
She moved to Thailand before I did.

590
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,520
If I can become very famous, and she knows that I'm here,

591
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,623
she can come to see me.

592
00:44:50,623 --> 00:44:52,809
We can meet each other again.

593
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,890
It seems you really love this woman.

594
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,320
I hope you can get famous real soon,

595
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:13,400
so you will meet her soon, and no longer have to tolerate doing things you don't like.

596
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,918
To be honest, I've started to like this job...

597
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,800
because I have you taking care of me.

598
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,990
Wait.

599
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:33,880
Since you're talking with me this way, your woman would chew me out.

600
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,680
My woman?

601
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,630
Who?

602
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,130
Maria.

603
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,460
Maria,

604
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,280
my older sister, won't blame me for this.

605
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,880
Wait.

606
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,220
Your older sister?

607
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,830
Yes. My older sister.

608
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,136
Why?

609
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:55,387
Did you think Maria was my girlfriend?

610
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,021
That's not what I'm thinking.

611
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,970
Your voice shows you're happy that I'm single.

612
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,233
Nonsense.

613
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:12,600
I know you must be smiling now.

614
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,680
Are you a know-it-all? I'll punch you.

615
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,320
Look at me. I'm now like a silly person.

616
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,140
I'm sad, and then I smile.

617
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,710
The only thing that moves our moods like what a roller coaster does,

618
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:34,623
can't be anything but the feelings called 'love'.

619
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:44,540
Hey, what's your favorite color?

620
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,072
Yellow.

621
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:47,960
Yellow.

622
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,860
Why do you like stupid meatballs?

623
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,620
It's not that I like them.

624
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,920
It's just that I have to eat them.

625
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,060
Sing me a kindergarten teacher song.

626
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:10,200
Hey. I won't.

627
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,570
It's already late.

628
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,000
My voice is not good now.

629
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,800

Pam?

636
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,799
You've already fallen asleep?

637
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:05,050
[I'll have dinner with you as invited.]

638
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,066
[See you.]

639
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:18,410
This is my older sister.

640
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:21,730
Why did she come to Thailand?

641
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:22,770
There's no need to know.

642
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:25,120
You're meeting up with her for dinner?

643
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,170
About work.

644
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:29,080
Work? Why didn't I know about it?

645
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,780
I'm your manager.
[Imagine how gorgeous you're in these. See you tonight.]

646
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,646
This family doesn't want anyone to get close to Pam,

647
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,520
except for me.

648
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,530
I'm so excited.

649
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,050
I almost can't wait for tomorrow.

650
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,521
I've also prepared something for you.

651

♫ Who said that I'm so hot? ♫

♫ Sorry, if my hair looks too hot ♫
