1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,930
My stuff got lost.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,040
Here it is.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,340
I didn't steal it.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,240
This is bullying.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,300
What the hell is wrong with you?

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,430
Let's break up.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,930
No.

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,141
He said he was tired.

9
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:20,220
He said he and I were not meant for each other.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,860
I would like you to review this student.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,030
The story about Miss Da has finally faded away as time passed.

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,150
- Look at my hands. I'm holding nothing.
- There is nothing.

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,750
Look there.

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,290
Hey.

15
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,340
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,560
Happy New Year.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,510
Miss Pam?

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,661
You got a new haircut. You look adorable.

19
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,660
Thank you.

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,580
I'm still not used to it. Does it look okay?

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,490
I guess so.

22
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,840
I mean it looks okay. It does.

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,560
Well, I'm here to return your Behavior Report Book.

24
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,230
I got 10 points for being attentive,

25
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,520
10 for punctuality,

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,487
and 10 for honesty.

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,220
It turns out that our relationship line that Mr. Aood once tried to cross is still here.

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,760
It's still lying long and straight, emphasizing our same relationship status.

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,380
And I don't want him to waste his time any longer.

30
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,900
You got a full score in all criteria.

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,051
There's no score deduction needed.

32
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:20,723
Also, you're labeled the Best Student.

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,720
But...

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,940
you're probably not suitable for this school.

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,110
I feel safe and at ease every time I'm with you, Mr. Aood.

36
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,700
But I don't want you to feel disappointed or waste your time on me.

37
00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:00,360
If I were a school, you would be a minimart,

38
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,550
always providing my family and me with what we need.

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,945
ut sometimes,

40
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,340
a minimart doesn't have everything.

41
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,060
You're right.

42
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,310
That's right.

43
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,500
Thank you for reviewing and grading me.

44
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,220
I'm sorry...

45
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,716
for having spent so long before returning this to you.

46
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,390
It's all right.

47
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,790
But I'll manage to find what you've been looking for, Miss Pam.

48
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,170
Please excuse me.

49
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,280
Sure, Miss Pam.

50
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,908
Mr. Pete told me you were here.

51
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,740
I already confessed to Miss Pam.

52
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,540
Why did you tell me?

53
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,512
Pam and I are no longer in a relationship.

54
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:49,353
You're such a loser, avoiding Miss Pam like this.

55
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,590
Be frank with me. Why did you break up with her?

56
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,390
Please tell me.

57
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,680
It's not your business.

58
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,280
Please leave.

59
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,305
I'll do my boxing training.

60
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:13,700
Fine. I'll do that with you.

61
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,540
Why did you ask for a breakup and are avoiding seeing Miss Pam?

62
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,900
I know you still love her.

63
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,830
Let's put it this way.

64
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,790
If I can hit your face within 3 minutes,

65
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,560
you must tell me the truth. Deal?

66
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,160
I don't want to fight with you.

67
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,868
You don't dare, do you?

68
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,682
Why do I have to agree?

69
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,100
What did Miss Pam do wrong?

70
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,069
Why did you dump her?

71
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,210
Hey. Say it.

72
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,240
Tell me.

73
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,021
Tell me already. Tell me.

74
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:16,360
Say it.

75
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,650
You can't punch me.

76
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,665
Stop trying already.

77
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,400
Are you all right?

78
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,650
I hit your face already.

79
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,370
You even have to use this trick?

80
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,100
I know it sucks. I admit that.

81
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,410
Now, can you tell me the truth?

82
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,480
I... promised Jessica.

83
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,820
Jessica?

84
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,320
The model who did photoshoots with you often?

85
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,436
Jessica told me she would help free Pam from that charge...

86
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,427
in exchange for one thing.

87
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,311
I must stop being involved with Pam.

88
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,630
And you agreed to do so?

89
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,300
I don't want to break my word.

90
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,925
I really don't understand. Why does Miss Pam choose someone like this?

91
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,290
I know. I know full well that this is awful.

92
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,060
It's not only awful, but also very stupid.

93
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,540
I'm willing to be stupid then because I always keep my word.

94
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,220
Keeping your word doesn't work with every situation, you know?

95
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,700
If keeping your word means you can't keep the person you love,

96
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,800
then what's the point?

97
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,550
Also, you said you always keep your word. Right?

98
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,960
Didn't you say you would love Miss Pam and be by her side?

99
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,015
Did you already forget that?

100
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,380
Keeping our word is a good thing we should do,

101
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:50,540
but is doing something good but then regretting it later a good thing, really?

102
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,200
For whom is it good?

103
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,400
Is it good for ourselves?

104
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,620
Or doesn't it do any good to anyone?

105
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,300
Are you really not going to come out and talk to me?

106
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,160
Are you really not going to explain anything?

107
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,840
Dino doesn't want to be a loser.

108
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,360
He is as hurt as I am.

109
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,600
But what should he do?

110
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,370
After getting rid of Miss Da,

111
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,060
Jessica makes a fab return.

112
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,020
She's even more famous now.

113
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,020
How lucky she is.

114
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,520
All right. Turn back and then face the camera.

115
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,500
Nice. Beautiful. Sexy.

116
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,710
All right. This set is now done.

117
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,470
We have one more set left. Are you still all right?

118
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,030
I am, but I won't continue.

119
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,120
It's already 15 minutes late.

120
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,011
It's really our last set. We'll finish it very soon.

121
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,980
It won't take longer than 15 minutes.

122
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,440
We agreed to finish at 8:00 p.m. It's already 8.15 p.m.

123
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,240
You still want me to continue for another 15 minutes?

124
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,620
Yes, please. It's really one last set.

125
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,480
Mai, can I borrow your scissors, please?

126
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,140
Don't!

127
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,900
My costume is torn now. I can't continue.

128
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,820
Oops, sorry.

129
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,190
Guys, let's go home.

130
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,370
Don't work overtime. Don't let anyone take advantage of you.

131
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,690
Goodnight!

132
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:51,283
Where are you guys going tonight?

133
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:08,437
Fuck!

134
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:13,945
Donovan?

135
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,940
I want to cancel what we previously agreed on.

136
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,602
About Pam.

137
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,620
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

138
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,220
I'll do it.

139
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,950
Anything?

140
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,700
Anything.

141
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,290
Lift up your shirt.

142
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,638
You still got it, babe.

143
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,168
What's next?

144
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,930
What if I were to tell you that...

145
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,350
I already feel bad for not being able to see Pam.

146
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,900
If I also have to sleep with you because of this,

147
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,550
I will feel even more ashamed towards her throughout my entire life,

148
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:24,040
so please don't do this.

149
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,587
Please don't.

150
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:33,807
I was just kidding. Okay?

151
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,040
You don't have to do anything.

152
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,493
Just cancel it if you want.

153
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:42,858
Are you serious?

154
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:46,100
Yeah, I'm serious.

155
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,070
I don't want you anymore. Okay?

156
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,000
Since you're no longer a model, you're nobody.

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,640
If you want to get back with that junk food, then just go ahead.

158
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,180
Let's say this is my New Year's gift for you.

159
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,991
I don't want you anymore, and now you're hugging me.

160
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:19,672
Thank you.

161
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:22,217
Thank you.

162
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,856
Jessica.

163
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:38,840
Do I know you?

164
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,269
I'm Aood, Miss Pam's friend.

165
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,610
Then what?

166
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,030
Why did you force Donovan to stop getting involved with Miss Pam?

167
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,206
That's because it satisfies me.

168
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,920
That's it?

169
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,660
If I don't get what I want, then nobody will.

170
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,900
Have you ever fallen in love or truly loved someone?

171
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,170
Many.

172
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,120
Every day.

173
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,860
I'm talking about love, not sex.

174
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,620
If you truly love someone,

175
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,560
you will be willing to do anything for him.

176
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,030
No matter how much it hurts you,

177
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,390
or no matter how wrong he was,

178
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,400
you will still love and care about him...

179
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,820
even if he never appreciates it at all.

180
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,941
You don't even know me. How could you know if I haven't fallen in love?

181
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:35,400
That's why you should understand this more than anyone else does.

182
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,240
I don't understand.

183
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,750
I have been trying to do everything for him, but what I get in return is ignorance.

184
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,291
He never values our love. Why should I stupidly continue doing that?

185
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,120
That's why you want to beat him?

186
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,740
All you said shows that you don't love him at all,

187
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,160
but you just love yourself.

188
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,620
You try to keep him with you, not allowing him to be with the person he loves.

189
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,972
This is so selfish. Don't you know?

190
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,690
What I'm trying to tell you is that...

191
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,971
if you have truly loved someone before, you wouldn't have done this.

192
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,960
Love is each person's own matter, isn't it?

193
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,630
Why do I have to listen to what you're saying?

194
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:28,320
Admit already that you have been doing this because you just want Donovan to love you.

195
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,037
But do you know that you're such a loser for doing this?

196
00:15:33,037 --> 00:15:35,727
Though they broke up for real,

197
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,660
Donovan won't love you anyway.

198
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,900
If you love him, you should let go of him.

199
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,090
I love Miss Pam a lot too,

200
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,670
but I still give way to Donovan because I want her to be happy.

201
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,830
If you're not the right one,

202
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,850
no matter what you do,

203
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,073
you still can't be the right one.

204
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,961
What's good about that junk food?

205
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,500
This is so annoying.

206
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,101
Thank you very much.

207
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:22,310
Happy New Year.

208
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,110
I'll tidy up the rest of the things myself.

209
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,940
The past year gradually passed, and the start of this new year has arrived.

210
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,350
One, two, three.

211
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,040
My name is Donovan.

212
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,480
I'm looking for my older sister.

213
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,970
Her name is Maria.

214
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,910
I haven't seen her for a very long time.

215
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:58,490
I'm also trying to become a new version of myself.

216
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,840
All this time, I've missed his thick hands,

217
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,890
his roman nose, the look in his eyes,

218
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:29,700
his eyebrows and his body's warm breeze that is different from others.

219
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,140
I want to talk to you.

220
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,405
What do you want to talk about now?

221
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,714
I called, but you didn't pick up.

222
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,860
You moved out but didn't tell me.

223
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,740
It's my fault.

224
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,320
You can scold me as much as you want,

225
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,130
but can you please hear me out first?

226
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,370
Though my thoughts keeps telling me not to listen to him

227
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,480
and to just chase him away,

228
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:13,080
my body just stays still, waiting for his explanation.

229
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,160
Let's sit first.

230
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,320
As they say, there is usually no reason when it comes to love.

231
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,070
That's why I asked for a breakup.

232
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,760
He tells me why he had to break up with me.

233
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,540
I only stay calm and let him finish it.

234
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,000
Is getting over me that easy for you?

235
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,940
Not at all, Pam.

236
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,580
I wasn't happy at all.

237
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,940
I've missed you all this time.

238
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,050
I've missed your face...

239
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,440
and everything about you.

240
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,690
There's no single day I didn't miss you.

241
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,200
But today you came back to me.

242
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,228
I came to see you because I feel...

243
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,990
you're the person I should say goodbye to the most.

244
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,253
Say goodbye?

245
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,180
I'm returning to the USA.

246
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,790
Do you want me to go or stay here with you?

247
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:14,080
New York in the USA is such a far place that goes beyond what I could expect.

248
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,290
If he really has to go back,

249
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,620
though technology can enable us to see each other's faces,

250
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:28,310
it can't give the warmth from touching, hugging, and kissing.

251
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,570
He probably wants to go back because there's nothing here for him to do anymore.

252
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:40,560
I'm with my grandparents every New Year's Day.

253
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,180
But last year, I felt kind of glad,

254
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,680
looking forward to celebrating this new year with you, whom I love.

255
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,050
But it didn't happen.

256
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,820
But I still had to celebrate it with my grandparents.

257
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,450
I thought it would be so miserable for me,

258
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,920
but it turned out I went through it without feeling bad.

259
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:34,934
Without you, I still have grandparents who love me.

260
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,977
I tried to figure out the reason.

261
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,880
Was that because I already got over you?

262
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,564
Or was it because of any other reason?

263
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,059
I came to realize I already got through it.

264
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,296
I did change into a new version of myself.

265
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,271
But when you came back,

266
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,060
being right here in front of me,

267
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,205
no matter how much I want to get mad at you,

268
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,010
after hearing you out, I can't get mad at you.

269
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,240
But today, you told me you're leaving me again.

270
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,800
What's wrong with you?

271
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,231
You come on and off. Are you out of your mind?

272
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,152
I won't let you run away from me anymore.

273
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,480
Please stay.

274
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,800
Don't go anywhere anymore.

275
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,880
I'm already tired.

I never loved anyone like I love you, Pam.

281
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,870
But I'm afraid I will make you unhappy.

282
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,614
I'm worried I will make you cry again.

283
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,280
It's all in my head that if I just ended this whole thing now,

284
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,574
you wouldn't be in sorrow for too long.

I'm sorry.

286
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,550
I looked down on your feelings.

No, Dino.

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,180
Don't think like that.

290
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,913
I want to say sorry about one more thing.

291
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,380
I lied to you that...

292
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,936
it would be our last hug that day.

293
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,210
Please stay here and hug me forever.

294
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,648
I thought I could already move on with my life,

but, in fact, I have been standing here all this time, waiting for him.

296
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:11,080
Today, January 2nd, is not New Year's Day,

297
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,770
and there's nothing special about it.

298
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,090
It's actually just another typical day,

299
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,560
and I'm also just another ordinary woman.

300
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:27,680
But I feel that today is such a special day...

301
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,920
when he, whom I love and is so special to me,

302
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,633
is back here right in front of me again.

303
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,120
He feels the same,

304
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,340
but it's just that he has never seen me as an ordinary woman.

305
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,690

Hey? Miss Pam.

315
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,060
Why are you here? What are you buying?

316
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,060
Nothing.

Your minimart really has everything, Mr. Aood.

You talked to him already, right?

321

Mr. Aood, thank you so much...

for always treating me so well.

323
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,650
It's all right.

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,160
Do you need any help?

328
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,570
I'm sorry. I wanted to take only one glass.

329
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,910
It's all right.

330
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,460
Aood?

331
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,160
You're Aood, right?

332
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,560
Hey, it's really you.

333
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,078
Sai?

334
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,190
Why are you here?

335
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,770
I just moved here a couple of days ago.

336
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,190
- How have you been?
- I'm fine.

337
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,710
What did you do to yourself? Look at how you are dressed and look.

338
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,920
You're more handsome now.

339
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,210
Am I?

340
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,211
- Can I hit on you?
- Are you serious?

341
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:04,951
If you allow me to, I will.

342
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,390
Have you been waiting long?

343
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,990
Nope.

344
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,909
Why do you look so handsome today?

345
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,610
You dressed up so well.

346
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,100
Where are you taking me?

347
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,531
Right.

348
00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:25,053
I'm taking you to your house.

349
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,794
My house?

350
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,502
Why?

351
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:33,127
There's a mission I haven't completed.

352
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,500
A mission?

353
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,220
That's right.

354
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:43,070
I want to make your grandpa accept me.

355
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,400
I want to confess to him about us.

356
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,650
Hey, are we going today?

357
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,950
Pam, we have been putting it off for so long.

358
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,541
He's right. I've been putting it off for too long.

359
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,460
Okay.

360
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,050
Don't worry.

361
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,200
Grandpa, what are you doing?

362
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,580
I'm cleaning the plants.

363
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,280
How is it going?

364
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,080
You're learning how to make luk chup dessert.

365
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,530
- It's not fun at all.
- Really?

366
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,890
You need to practice. All right?

367
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,880
You need to continue learning, so you can do it. You have to be tolerant even if it's not fun.

368
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,330
Pam.

369
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,079
- Hey.
- It's all right, Pam.

370
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,420
I'm with you here. Don't be afraid.

371
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,600
Get back to it. Go learn with your grandma.

372
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,120
Come here, Luke.

373
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,230
Pam!

374
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,710
Grandpa.

375
00:30:29,497 --> 00:30:30,640
We...

376
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,950
He's Aood's foreigner friend, isn't he?

377
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,350
Pam.

378
00:30:39,018 --> 00:30:41,088
What is this?

379
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,510
Well, I...

380
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,637
I'm Donovan McDaniel.

381
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,240
I love Pam.

382
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,610
He's confessing it to my grandpa in a serious manner, filled with sincerity.

383
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,800
After hearing it, instead of exploding with anger like I was afraid he would,

384
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Grandpa went silent.

385
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,620
He's so silent that I don't know what's on his mind now.

386
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,400
Hey, let's go home for now.

387
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,145
It's all right, Pam.

388
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,130
Grandpa!

389
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,180
Grandpa, what are you doing?

390
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,230
Pam, you know very well why.

391
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,900
Your mom hurt me to death once.

392
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,940
Now, you're doing what she did.

393
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,980
Do you want others to criticize me

394
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,729
that my daughter and granddaughter are both rented wives?

395
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,380
- Dad!
- You too!

396
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,310
You abandoned Pam and moved abroad.

397
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,400
Now what?

398
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,630
In the end, that foreigner jerk left the kid here for you to raise.

399
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,590
I truly love Pam.

400
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,120
I promise I won't hurt her.

401
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,430
Leave, or I'll shoot you.

402
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,500
Luke, don't!

403
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,360
No!

404
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,290
It's dangerous!

405
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,510
Luke, listen to me.

406
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,600
Let go!

407
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,010
Luke, let go of it!

408
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,380
- Let go of me!
- Luke, let go of it!

409
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,280
Luke, listen to me. Luke, let go of it!

410
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,080
- Luke.
- Let go of me!

411
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,590
The bullet did its job.

412
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:48,580
But the person who got shot was neither him nor me.

413
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,180
But it was...

414
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,230
Pa!

415
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,334
Mom!

416
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,160
Mom!

417
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,360
Mom!

418
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,690
Pa!

419
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,820
Grandpa, what did you do?!

420
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,530
I don't love you anymore.

421
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,800
Hey, call an ambulance now.

422
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,787
Hurry up, please!

423
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,330
[Operating Room]

424
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,620
Is Mommy hurt a lot, Grandma?

425
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,090
Will she die?

426
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,950
No.

427
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,040
No, she won't. She will be all right.

428
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,200
Grandpa, you're so mean.

429
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,780
Why did you hurt Mom?

430
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,740
You're right.

431
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,770
I didn't expect him to be this mean.

432
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,780
Words from the person who has been living with him for years hit him hard,

433
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,360
and it hurt even more than a bullet did.

434
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,020
He kept thinking that what Grandma said was right.

435
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,530
Everything happened because of him alone.

436
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,940
- You're Miss Parichat's relatives, right?
- Yes.

437
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,999
She is safe now.

438
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:16,200
Luckily, the bullet didn't hit any major organ.

439
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,340
I'll have the patient stay here to have her condition observed for two nights.

440
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,430
If there are no further complications or an infection, she can be discharged.

441
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:29,550
Luckily, the bullet didn't hit any major part.

442
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,360
My mom is still alive.

443
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,046
It's all right now.

444
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,930
- Ouch.
- Mom!

445
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,804
- Let's use this.
- Thanks.

446
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,520
Are you okay?

447
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,798
You do not feel hurt anymore. Right?

448
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,168
It just feels a bit tight.

449
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,770
Because of me,

450
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,830
you got hurt like this.

451
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:39,630
Pam, why did you say that?

452
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,270
I'm your mom.

453
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,250
I see the look in her eyes which reflects all her feelings.

454
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,940
It's the warmth I have never felt before.

455
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,729
Now, it's coming straight to my heart and embracing me for the first time.

456
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:04,380
Mom, I'm sorry.

457
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,930
About what?

458
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,499
That I...

459
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,862
I used to feel bad about you.

460
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,180
I used to have doubts about you.

461
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,913
I thought you didn't love me.

462
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,120
Pam.

463
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,870
You don't need to say sorry.

464
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,013
I feel guilty, Pam.

465
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,276
How should I say it?

466
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,896
I don't know how to explain it.

467
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,200
It's not that I don't love you.

468
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,000
I know already that you love me,

469
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,727
and I love you a lot too, Mom.

470
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,160
Why are you crying?

471
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,090
Others would think I scolded you.

472
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:30,590
The bad thing that comes with an unexpected situation also has a good thing hidden beneath it.

473
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:35,350
Mom and I have finally unlocked ourselves and talked with understanding again.

474
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,560
This makes me realize that

475
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,090
the way Mom expresses her love might be different from that of other moms,

476
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,048
but she loves me in the way she does.

477
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,400
Mommy, you're not feeling hurt anymore. Right?

478
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,730
You're not dying. Right?

479
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,610
I'm not dying, Luke.

480
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,130
Grandpa is mean.

481
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,770
I'm mad at him.

482
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,690
Luke, your mom is all right now. She will recover soon.

483
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,090
All right?

484
00:38:29,378 --> 00:38:32,979
Luke, let's go grab some snacks, shall we?

485
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:34,920
She will recover soon.

486
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,260
So she will recover fast.

487
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,281
Come with Grandma and me. Okay?

488
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,940
All right.

489
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,250
I'll buy a lot of snacks for you.

490
00:38:47,607 --> 00:38:49,527
Let's buy a lot.

491
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,930
Now, there're only Mom and Grandpa.

492
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,140
It's time for them to finally clear things up.

493
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,426
Does it hurt a lot?

494
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,230
You didn't intend to, Dad.

495
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,070
I'm sorry.

496
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,741
It's all right, Dad.

497
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,771
If it's all right, then why are you crying?

498
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,010
As Mom gets hurt this time,

499
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,560
the pain caused by others' harsh words

500
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,640
that Grandpa has been suffering from all his life has also been compensated.

501
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,858
How's your mom, Pam?

502
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,580
She is feeling better now,

503
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:26,310
but she has to rest here for a few more days.

504
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,300
Grandpa must feel so guilty.

505
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,330
Mom is his daughter anyway.

506
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,210
Pam, I'm sorry.

507
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,000
This is really my fault.

508
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,460
Hey, it's not your fault at all.

509
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,361
This thing shouldn't have happened in the first place.

510
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,120
We must get through this together.

511
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,180
Pam.

512
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,860
What?

513
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,880
Go.

514
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,180
Hurry.

515
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,370
This guy treats you well. Right?

516
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,600
He won't hurt you. Right?

517
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,635
Are you sure, Pam?

518
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,790
Yes.

519
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,510
If that's so,

520
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:35,360
I will no longer stop you from doing this,

521
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,380
but just don't leave me...

522
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,270
like your mom did.

523
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,000
I don't want to lose you, Pam.

524
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,230
I won't leave you, Grandpa.

525
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,530
In the end, everything unfolded in a good direction.

526
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,160
If my life was a movie,

527
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,480
then everyone would now be ready to leave the cinema.

528
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,420
But this movie hasn't ended yet.

529
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,897
It comes with end credits.

530
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:32,038
Do you remember what happened when we came to the seaside last time?

531
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:39,190
Of course. A crazy guy climbed the balcony to my room.

532
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,880
Do you remember what you did?

533
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,420
Wait.

534
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,920
I didn't do anything.

535
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,900
You did.

536
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,840
That was the first time you made my heart flutter.

537
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:01,820
Then, you made me feel so good.

538
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,711
Pam, I wanted to get to know you more...

539
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,490
that I almost couldn't control myself.

540
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,700
Wait.

541
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,577
That much?

542
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,174
Hey, wait.

543
00:44:26,174 --> 00:44:28,670
Are you crazy? It's still morning.

544
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,340
Pam...

545
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,450
Please take care of it.

546
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,890
Oh, isn't this your sister's ring?

547
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,890
Didn't you return it to Maria?

548
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:49,260
If you ask me to keep it, I might lose it again.

549
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,430
Are you sure you'll lose it?

550
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:55,640
I'm now asking you to take care of my life.

551

559
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:39,960
♫ It would be nice if you could choose to remember what you regret ♫

560
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:52,620
♫ Why do you only remember the good things that ended? ♫

561
00:45:54,930 --> 00:46:01,290
♫ How much have we loved? ♫

562
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:07,580
♫ I can never delete, even though I want to forget how much ♫

563
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:15,979
♫ The words of love that I still can't forget ♫

564
00:46:15,979 --> 00:46:17,495
Pam...

565
00:46:19,932 --> 00:46:21,804
will you marry me?

566
00:46:27,945 --> 00:46:29,798
Yes, I do.

567
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,620
He and I are both like indented jigsaw pieces.

568
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:42,110
We both had a heartbreaking past and then we met each other.

569
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,820
We complete each other.

570
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,130
There's this saying,

571
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:53,760
"Every day is a new day, and you'll never be able to find happiness if you don't move on."

572
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,810
Every day is a new day.

573
00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:01,115
If we don't let go of the past and move on, there's no way we can find happiness.

574
00:47:04,452 --> 00:47:06,500
Hey, Dino!

575
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,800
It's the end of this movie.

576
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,496
Time to leave the cinema and find yourself a movie with you as the main character.

577
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:20,460
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

578
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,030
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

579
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:31,140
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

580

♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫
