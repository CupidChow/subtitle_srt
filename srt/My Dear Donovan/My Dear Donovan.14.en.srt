1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,000
Why did you cancel all my jobs?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,880
When your partner falls, it's only natural that you fall too.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,540
I was arrested by the police, but not for a murder charge.

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,880
Maria lives there?

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,340
Go check. I hope you find your sister soon.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,230
Who are you here to see?

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,980
Is Maria here?

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,500
I knew her.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,880
We used to date.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,030
She told us that Maria and she were in love with each other.

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,000
Maria was the first person who didn't make her feel empty

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,832
ever since she came to study in New York.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,901
She didn't know what to do until Maria stepped in to help.

14
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,542
Are you okay?

15
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:06,102
Are you hurt?

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,338
Let me see.

17
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,123
God...

18
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:12,922
Does that hurt?

19
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:14,586
A bit...

20
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,621
Maria walked into her life at such the right time.

21
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,145
That was how they first met.

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,106
She came to study acting to pursue her dream, hoping that one day she could get to Broadway.

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,684
Let's go home.

24
00:01:41,387 --> 00:01:42,960
Can we just go watch a movie?

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,830
Okay, sure. Let's do it.

26
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,051
That day, she had already decided

27
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:51,445
that Maria was the most important person in her life.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,964
Thank you.

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,000
But happiness didn't last long.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,920
Anya's family wanted her to go back to Thailand because her dad passed away.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,700
And that was the worst day of her life.

32
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,505
Stop!

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,240
Seeing Maria this time almost tore her heart apart.

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,705
It was the time Maria faced the thing that was too harsh to bear.

35
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:49,174
I have to go. I have to see him.

36
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:51,539
It's my fault that he's in there.

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,964
Maria kept blaming herself that because of her, her brother was put in jail.

38
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,400
After that, Anya was forced to return to Thailand and get married.

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,332
She then lost contact with Maria.

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,393
Anya, marry me.

41
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,154
She never revealed that Maria and she used to date.

42
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,040
Maria followed her here.

43
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,835
She came to work as a model, as Jessica said.

44
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,094
Who's that?

45
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,566
My friend.

46
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:32,667
Who's that?

47
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,587
My husband.

48
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,243
Maria was so hurt, knowing what happened.

49
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:40,240
I'm so sorry.

50
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,080
Maria was sad and thought that she dumped her.

51
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,377
She felt as if she was alone in this world.

52
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,870
Her message said,

53
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,560
"I'm sorry for making this whole thing turn out this way.

54
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,040
It's my fault.

55
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,700
For this whole thing, it's my fault alone.

56
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:11,600
Those I love keep disappearing from me one by one, including my brother and you.

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,590
It's all because of me.

58
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,280
I don't deserve to live anymore.

59
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you for everything, Anya.

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,880
Love. Maria"

61
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:30,679
This last letter from Maria made Anya realize that it was already too late to get her back.

62
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,860
I felt guilty,

63
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,318
so I sent money to you in the USA.

64
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,925
Maria was very worried about you.

65
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,968
She loved you the most.

66
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,671
I didn't want you to feel disappointed.

67
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,538
I'm sorry for not telling you earlier.

68
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,020
Though the answer about what happened to Maria has ended in sorrow,

69
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,080
it's better than keeping aimlessly searching for hope

70
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,770
because that will be endless torture.

71
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:16,174
Finally, the search for his sister has ended.

72
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,731
Towards the change from rainy season to winter,

73
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:02,540
he has been through the saddest moment of his life.

74
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,680
But I want Dino to know that I'm still here with him.

75
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,110
Hey, did I keep you waiting for long? Am I late?

76
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,408
I stopped by to buy some flowers for your sister.

77
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,511
I'm ready to compensate and stay by his side

78
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:36,958
like he has always done for me.

79
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,160
Come.

80
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,480
Let me see.

81
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,529
Are you ready?

82
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,669
Let's go.

83
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,870
Let's go.

84
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,368
I let him spend his time with Maria alone.

85
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:39,802
This journey of 13,923 km. From New York to Bangkok has ended with a failing success.

86
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,360
The feelings of being stranded,

87
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,990
lost and empty hit him right away.

88
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,663
How should he live his life from now?

89
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,691
This item he always had with him should be returned to its owner.

90
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,395
If Maria was still here, what would she say to him?

91
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,010
[Maria Jones McDaniel: August 6, 1992 - July 12, 2020]

92
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,030
He's looking up in the sky to find her last message.

93
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,240
If the mountain was the life goal,

94
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,820
this mountain must have already been reached.

95
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,520
But we can't forget that life still has to cross many other mountains.

96
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,752
Or is this the last message from Maria?

97
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,635
I'm back.

98
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,710
Did you get what you wanted to eat?

99
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,101
These are all I could get.

100
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:07,399
Hotdogs and water.

101
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,680
Should we just stand and eat?

102
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,150
What?

103
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,190
I told the shop to make one without pickles,

104
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,670
and I remember holding it with my left hand.

105
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,350
But now I'm not sure which one is left or right because they look the same.

106
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,320
What should I do?

107
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,366
Should we unwrap them?

108
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,853
It's fine.

109
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,030
Let's just eat them at the same time.

110
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,240
Just enjoy it. Don't take it seriously.

111
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,400
All right. Sure.

112
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,680
Mine doesn't have pickles.

113
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,592
What about yours?

114
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,350
It does.

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,481
We can swap.

116
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:17,103
It's all right.

117
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,964
I can eat pickles now.

118
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,480
No steak today, only vege.

119
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,843
That's all right. No pickles?

120
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:42,528
I hope one day that you'd learn to appreciate the taste of pickles.

121
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:44,991
You know, like our life.

122
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,790
Salty and sour.

123
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,458
How is it?

124
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,216
It's okay.

125
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,480
I started to feel that some tastes must rely on life experiences,

126
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,878
so we can eat them more deliciously.

127
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,580
What's on your mind now, Dino?

128
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,897
I feel that life is so uncertain.

129
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,530
In the past, I felt nothing much about death.

130
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,835
I thought it was something that was really at a distance,

131
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,391
though, in fact, my parents both passed away.

132
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:45,583
But it's probably because they passed away when I was still very young.

133
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,896
That's why I didn't feel bonded...

134
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,288
until it happened to the person I love the most and feel the strongest bond with.

135
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,620
Pam.

136
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,243
Do you want to move in with me?

137
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,655
Do you mean living together permanently?

138
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,730
Or is it just me going back and forth?

139
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,516
I'm talking about living together.

140
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,920
I think I still can't do that.

141
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,300
There's no way my grandpa will allow me to.

142
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,960
Well, the nature of Thais and foreigners is different.

143
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,230
When can we spend our lives together then?

144
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,674
We're doing that now, aren't we?

145
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,308
It's different, Pam.

146
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,491
We'll fall asleep together,

147
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,952
and I'll see you by my side every day and every time.

148
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,644
That's the life I want to spend with you.

149
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,370
Saying 'I love you' without saying it makes me feel overwhelmed with happiness.

150
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,690
Everything is more beautiful than I expected,

151
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,130
but still, there's a problem with my grandpa.

152
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,500
That beautiful picture has gradually turned hazy

153
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,525
because I'm not sure if my conservative grandpa will open up his mind and accept him.

154
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,157
How can I explain it to you?

155
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,820
My grandpa is such a conservative person.

156
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,860
I mean he's conservative in a Thai style.

157
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,060
If a Thai woman moves in with a man before getting married,

158
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,178
others will call her in Thai...

159
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:35,280
"Rad."

160
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,853
Rad.

161
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,949
Which means Rhino in English?

162
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:42,219
Yes.

163
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,080
- Rhino is strong, tolerant, and...
- Nope.

164
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,617
It's a Thai slang word, meaning slutty.

165
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,295
My grandpa won't stand hearing anyone call me like that.

166
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:06,488
But I already talked to him. I told him nobody has that mindset now,

167
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,753
but I think that thing about Mom still haunts him.

168
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,525
There's no way Grandpa will let that happen to me.

169
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,560
Don't you want our relationship to move forward?

170
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,019
I want to,

171
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,930
but I don't agree with your idea.

172
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,410
But that doesn't mean I don't love you.

173
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:43,322
Your family members are shocked probably because they haven't gotten to know me yet.

174
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,830
That's also right.

175
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,130
That's part of it.

176
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,372
I think...

177
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,250
I should start by getting to know your family members, shouldn't I?

178
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,933
Let's do it step by step,

179
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,549
or else we can never be together.

180
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,990
Right?

181
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,120
I never doubt the love Dino has for me.

182
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,100
But my big problem is about Grandpa.

183
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,920
Can someone who has been living for more than 70 years accept this?

184
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,910
What? What are you negotiating?

185
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,230
I saw Grandpa over there.

186
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,390
Will I hurt him like my mom already did?

187
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,260
I'm dating a foreigner, and he hates this kind.

188
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,830
But Dino is the person I really want to spend my life with.

189
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,120
- I have been thinking it over all the way,
- Dad!

190
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,630
And finally, I have the answer.

191
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,580
Grandpa!

192
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,020
Let's go to my house after this.

193
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,291
But before we head there,

194
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,380
let's stop somewhere, so I can prepare myself for it.

195
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,369
Stop somewhere to prepare?

196
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,490
Hey, I'm back.

197
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,760
What did you buy?

198
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,364
Soju.

199
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,940
You want to drink?

200
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,320
To make me feel drunk.

201
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,300
If I'm drunk, I can become braver.

202
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,270
I don't need to drink. I'm already brave.

203
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,600
But I'm not.

204
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,640
Don't smile.

205
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,420
You will drink now?

206
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,633
I'll just give it a try.

207
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,511
I'll open it for you.

208
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,375
Let's get braver.

209
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,287
Aood, have you finished it?

210
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,510
Yes.

211
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,120
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

212
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,440
It's all right.

213
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
Mr. Aood, you're also here?

214
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,567
It doesn't look like the right time to talk to Grandpa.

215
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,742
Please excuse me, Grandpa.

216
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,874
The situation gets better now.

217
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,760
Grandpa, I have something to talk to you about.

218
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,680
What is it?

219
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,438
Just say it.

220
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,217
Grandpa, I have a boyfriend.

221
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,560
Are you all right, Grandpa?

222
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,937
- Grandpa.
- I'm all right.

223
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,890
Do you already have a boyfriend?

224
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,090
Well, let's not call him my boyfriend yet.

225
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,513
We're just seeing each other, and I'm getting to know him more.

226
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:49,720
I'm telling you because I'm worried that if I go out and don't tell you,

227
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,550
you will be worried about me.

228
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,851
Who is that guy?

229
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,285
You don't know him, Grandpa.

230
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,100
Well, today, I just wanted you to have a clue about it. It's nothing much.

231
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,560
That's it.

232
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,999
That's all I wanted to say.

233
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,149
Please excuse me. I'm going upstairs.

234
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,940
Wait, Dino.

235
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,840
Wait.

236
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,735
- What's wrong?
- Well...

237
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,860
I changed my mind already.

238
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,681
If you're not ready today, then when will you be?

239
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:03,260
It's not that I won't talk to him.

240
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,800
I will,

241
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,130
but I just want to talk to him myself.

242
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,480
Please.

243
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,203
Please, Dino.

244
00:22:12,203 --> 00:22:15,400
Please.

245
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,379
Can I do that? Please.

246
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,600
Please go back for now. Please.

247
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,170
Okay.

248
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,302
I'll just wait here.

249
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,779
Whoa.

250
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,310
Who says drinking makes us braver?

251
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,055
That's nonsense.

252
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,735
How should I reply?

253
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,488
Let's pretend I didn't see the message.

254
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,643
Aood said he changed the lightbulb already, didn't he?

255
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
Today, you're doing a photoshoot for print ads. It's jewelry.

256
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,630
According to the client's brief, they want to emphasize elegance, luxury, and sparkling.

257
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,680
Nothing adventurous. A simple job.

258
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,960
From now, if you're not free, I can come to work on my own.

259
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,238
I don't want a new manager anymore.

260
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,980
Why?

261
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,320
I can take care of myself. I don't want anyone.

262
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm shocked.

263
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,960
Though you want one, I can't find anyone for you anyway.

264
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:08,300
But I'm happy you've overcome those terrible things.

265
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,040
People forgave you.

266
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,429
You're getting new jobs on your own. We don't have to sell you in pairs.

267
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,680
You're happy, aren't you?

268
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,080
You don't have to see Jessica.

269
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,110
I won't see her for ages.

270
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,050
She was just being dramatic. Others know that.

271
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,040
She is fake.

272
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,320
Our clients canceled several of her jobs.

273
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,300
Shame on her.

274
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,481
We'll finish soon.

275
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,810
Do you want some coffee? It's early in the morning.

276
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,973
Yes, please. That would help.

277
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,640
Hello, Mr. Pete and Donovan.

278
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,340
Hi.

279
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,130
It's not this set, is it? I don't think this is the right one.

280
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,790
This is the right place, Mr. Donovan.

281
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,390
Really?

282
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,260
Please take Donovan to the dressing room.

283
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,140
I'll talk to the client.

284
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:07,128
Sure. This way, please.

285
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,280
Bye.

286
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,070
Goodbye. Thank you.

287
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,710
Remember to recite your vocabulary.

288
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,752
Good job.

289
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,840
[Knock Knock... where have you been?]

290
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,200
[You haven't replied since yesterday. Are you in class?]

291
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,500
Hello.

292
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,080
Where have you been?

293
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,821
I'm so busy today.

294
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,563
I've just finished sending students off.

295
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,480
You talked to your grandpa about us. How was it?

296
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:08,560
Did you talk to him?

297
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,280
I did.

298
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,130
How was it?

299
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,320
I'm waiting. You haven't told me about it.

300
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,560
All right then.

301
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,750
I'll go to see you, so I can clearly tell you about it.

302
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,040
Are you free now?

303
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,820
I'll finish my work soon.

304
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,480
Okay, fine.

305
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,520
I'll send you the location.

306
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,622
Okay. See you soon.

307
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,570
I talked to the client.

308
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,700
It's me who misunderstood the concept of this photoshoot.

309
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,680
But please let me finish first.

310
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,480
It's not as bad as you think.

311
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,150
The concept may look a bit weird,

312
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,290
but they want to present who you are.

313
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,803
You did underground boxing before. Right? They adapted it to boxing in a cage.

314
00:27:03,803 --> 00:27:06,254
They focus on rawness and an underground vibe of gems

315
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:08,105
that are fascinating and attractive.

316
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:09,597
This is just like gems in the cage.

317
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:13,571
Though they are put in the cage, they still shine beautifully.

318
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:18,461
I think this concept is nice.

319
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,160
Do you have any problem with that?

320
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,440
Is there anything that makes you feel uncomfortable? I can negotiate with the client.

321
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,670
No. Just do it like that.

322
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,320
I thought there would be a problem.

323
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,604
Mr. Donovan, please get changed.

324
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,340
Don't get angry yet.

325
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,550
I think this has gone too far.

326
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,120
I'll talk to the client.

327
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,808
You don't need to.

328
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,398
Work is work.

329
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,311
At first, Dino wasn't sure

330
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:06,410
if it's the staff's intention to add insult to injury or if it was just a coincidence.

331
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:11,629
He's trying to think that it's the latter, but then his thoughts changed when...

332
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,390
Nice.

333
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,152
Donovan, please look at the camera.

334
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,181
Let's take a break first.

335
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:30,529
Please prepare for the next set.

336
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,341
How have you been? We haven't met for ages.

337
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,970
What?

338
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:48,821
We only meet once in a while. Can't you just pretend to smile at me?

339
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:56,820
I'm here to congratulate you for having settled those complicated issues in your life.

340
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,043
Plus, you're even more famous now.

341
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,725
By the way,

342
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,546
this costume suits you well.

343
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,000
What? Why are you making that upset face at me?

344
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,888
Did I just rub it in somehow?

345
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,540
You planned this, right?

346
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,370
I'm really sad.

347
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:30,200
I thought you would complain that you had to wear this costume.

348
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,400
But it turned out you didn't.

349
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,165
What should I do...

350
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:40,443
to make you blow a fuse?!

351
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:43,285
Stop. Enough already.

352
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,251
All right. Get ready for the next set.

353
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,720
Please prepare the second set of jewelry, Pop.

354
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,849
Wear it for him.

355
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,280
Dino!

356
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,520
What are you playing? You scared me.

357
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,120
There're many people in the studio. I wanted to have private time with you.

358
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,130
Wait.

359
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,170
Others could see us.

360
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,090
Don't. Stop.

361
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,210
Hey.

362
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,020
Don't you want to know what I talked to Grandpa about?

363
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,280
I want to.

364
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,948
If I didn't, I wouldn't have asked you to come here.

365
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,954
Wait.

366
00:31:04,954 --> 00:31:07,720
What are you wearing?

367
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,931
Oops.

368
00:31:08,931 --> 00:31:11,411
Why are you guys like that?

369
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,774
Why? You guys can't hold it any longer, so you're 'doing' it up here?

370
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:20,280
You're a lot hotter than I thought.

371
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,827
You dare to do this in this kind of place.

372
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,960
I followed you here.

373
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,370
I thought you were going to do this thing.

374
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,000
I don't want to see you happy, so I interrupted.

375
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,810
Are you used to doing this hole-and-corner?

376
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,430
Hey. What do you want?

377
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:44,181
What? Don't you know this is my project?

378
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:48,910
You still agreed to work for her?

379
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,350
At first, I didn't know it was her project.

380
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,770
I just knew it not long before you did.

381
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,760
I guess Pete didn't know it either.

382
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,730
If he did, he wouldn't accepted this job.

383
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,080
Oh, this really breaks my heart.

384
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,170
Why? You don't even want to see my face?

385
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,840
But if you're still in this industry,

386
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,970
you can never run away from me.

387
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,185
I still have a lot more fun to play with you.

388
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,040
It's good you're here,

389
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,287
so I can have more fun.

390
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,540
All right.

391
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,280
Hold your lust back for now because you have to work.

392
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,840
I'll take your partner to take a break and let him calm himself down a bit.

393
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,020
Go sit somewhere cool and comfy.

394
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,320
Pam.

395
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,719
You can go wait somewhere else.

396
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,360
You don't want to stay in a comfy place?

397
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,800
Why? Are you scared?

398
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,080
I know she's trying to provoke my anger.

399
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,970
She must be so angry that she still couldn't destroy Dino.

400
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:09,350
Hurting me, and making me feel like a loser and run away could make her feel happier.

401
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:13,080
I'm sorry, but you can't just trick me easily.

402
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,320
You lead. Which way do I go?

403
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,680
Don't you have anything to do?

404
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,860
That's why you're monitoring me.

405
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,520
Hey. The owner doesn't have to do anything.

406
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,200
I just spend money and assign others to do the job.

407
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,147
I guess you don't know that.

408
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,185
Hey. Let me ask you.

409
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,046
Do you love him that much?

410
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,350
Yes. We love each other a lot.

411
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:03,010
Oops. That sounds so confident.

412
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,000
Hearing this, I can't help feeling happy for you.

413
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,791
It's your true and only love, isn't it?

414
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,700
I feel like crying hearing what you said.

415
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,120
I see that you guys love each other this much,

416
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,782
so I think I should just give up.

417
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,980
Well, then.

418
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,119
Let's bury the hatchet.

419
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,340
Let's shake hands to make a promise that we won't go against each other anymore.

420
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,350
Let's have no more conflicts.

421
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,970
I feel forewarned. There's something fishy about her.

422
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,560
But I still can't figure out what she's planning to do.

423
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,200
But for sure, I won't show that I'm scared,

424
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,352
and I won't allow myself to become her underdog.

425
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,680
I wish you two love each other a lot and make your love last long.

426
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,380
Every time I see you,

427
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,960
you use that old, shabby bag.

428
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,610
Don't you want to change it?

429
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,711
Should I buy you a new one?

430
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,960
That's not what I mean.

431
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:23,190
If you love each other that much, then just hug it tightly.

432
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,108
Is she insane?

433
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,580
Let's start shooting the second set. You can pose now.

434
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,160
Same vibe, please.

435
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,340
That's right.

436
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,694
Move a bit forward.

437
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,200
Great.

438
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,000
Hold onto the cage.

439
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,010
Wait.

440
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,490
I want this pose.

441
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,680
You don't know how to do it?

442
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,260
Doesn't it look familiar?

443
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,400
Like this.

444
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,100
- Nice. This pose works.
- Right.

445
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,001
Yeah. Make it look real.

446
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:17,474
Higher, please, so we can see it clearly.

447
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,050
Aood, Pam told me yesterday that she already has a boyfriend.

448
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,260
Who is he?

449
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,369
Is he a teacher at school?

450
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,220
I don't know either, Grandpa.

451
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,800
Pam is close with you.

452
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,017
Please keep an eye on her for me.

453
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,230
If you know who he is, please let me know right away.

454
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,370
I'm curious.

455
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,560
Hey, it's already wet.

456
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,200
I'm sorry.

457
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,600
What's wrong with you recently?

458
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,450
It seems you're zoning out.

459
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:19,386
Oh, I'm fine. I just didn't get enough sleep.

460
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,910
Though that woman said we've already buried the hatchet,

461
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,920
I still don't feel at ease.

462
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,220
My instinct is telling me someone like her won't end it that easily.

463
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,160
[Come inside the studio. I already told Pete.]
[So you can watch me work.]

464
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,780
I think I'd better stay close to him.

465
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,267
If that woman does anything to him, I can handle it in time.

466
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,409
Okay.

467
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:25,730
Great. Keep your hands from blocking the necklace. Move down a bit.

468
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,920
Hello, Pete.

469
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,220
What are you doing here?

470
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,290
I'm dropping by to see Dino work.

471
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,980
All right. You can change your pose.

472
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,257
Okay.

473
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,636
Nice. Keep your hands from blocking the necklace. Move them a bit lower.

474
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,230
Great.

475
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,150
All right.

476
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,660
It's a wrap for today.

477
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,120
Please get the jewelry back, Pop.

478
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,360
Staff, let's pack up and go home.

479
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,394
Let's go.

480
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,937
How was it?

481
00:39:01,937 --> 00:39:05,270
You're super handsome. You're the most handsome.

482
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,850
Give me a prize.

483
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,250
Hey, wait. Calm down.

484
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,280
Go get changed first. Staffs are waiting.

485
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,270
He's right. Go get changed now.

486
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,330
I'm sorry. You can't go anywhere now.

487
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,840
My stuff got lost.

488
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,320
Lost?

489
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,620
Where? How did you lose it?

490
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,710
I went to wash my hands in the restroom and left my ring in the room.

491
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,680
When I went back, it was gone.

492
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,730
It's expensive.

493
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,010
Relax, Miss Da. There are only a few staff here.

494
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,360
If we help you search for it, I think we'll find it soon.

495
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,640
How can I relax?

496
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,530
I have worked for so long, and this kind of thing never happened to me.

497
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,040
Is there a thief here, Miss Da?

498
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't know if there is a thief or not.

499
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,880
I'll let everyone here get frisked for my own peace of mind.

500
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,906
Frisk me first. I want to hurry and leave.

501
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,010
Search all the women's bags, too.

502
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,760
Female staff, please help frisk her.

503
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,679
It's not in here.

504
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,272
Please excuse me.

505
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,184
It's here.

506
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,287
Here it is.

507
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,630
Are you a thief?

508
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,440
I didn't steal it.

509
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,610
It's already obvious enough. You're still lying.

510
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,400
It's you who slandered me.

511
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,270
Why did you put your ring in my bag?

512
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,480
You're mad that you couldn't destroy Dino,

513
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,040
so you're targeting me now. Right?

514
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,100
Are you mental? Who would do such things?

515
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,500
Someone like you would.

516
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,761
You have been doing that all this time.

517
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:49,922
Everyone knows what kind of person you are.

518
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,500
Why? What did I do?

519
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,590
You have money and power to manage everything,

520
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,820
but you never properly use them even once.

521
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,120
You just use them to fulfill your desires all the time.

522
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,480
You drugged Dino because you wanted him,

523
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,940
but when you failed, you leaked terrible news to hurt him.

524
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,600
But you failed again.

525
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,502
Now, I'm your target. Right?

526
00:41:17,502 --> 00:41:20,510
Are you using me to satisfy your stupid need?!

527
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:24,434
Are you so happy destroying others' lives like this?

528
00:41:24,434 --> 00:41:28,180
Why are you this depraved and dirty?!

529
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,337
Why did you hurt Pam?!

530
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:32,385
Why? She bad-mouthed me.

531
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,920
Will you call the police?

532
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,011
It just costs 500 THB for that.

533
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:39,400
I'll pay 5,000 THB.

534
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,000
I'll slap her again!

535
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,056
Miss Dararai, stop already.

536
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,859
You won't call?

537
00:41:50,805 --> 00:41:52,697
I will.

538
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,853
Pam, it's all right.

539
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,980
This way, please.

540
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,900
I didn't do anything wrong. Seriously.

541
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,790
I understand. But let's discuss it at the police station.

542
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,920
- But...
- Please.

543
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,046
Get in the car, please.

544
00:42:29,371 --> 00:42:30,810
Please get in.

545
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,890
Pam!

546
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,468
Pam!

547
00:42:41,468 --> 00:42:43,217
Dino.

548
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:45,102
Officer, what did she do wrong?

549
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:48,120
Let's talk at the police station.

550
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,742
Dino, I'm scared.

551
00:42:52,974 --> 00:42:54,374
Pam.

552
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,685
Don't be scared.

553
00:42:56,685 --> 00:42:59,084
I'll help you no matter what.

554
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:03,397
Enough, please.

555
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,859
Dino.

556
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,677
Enough, please.

557
00:43:09,677 --> 00:43:11,277
Dino.

558
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,795
We can go now.

559
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,680
The police arrested her.

560
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,729
I feel safer now.

561
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,991
You wanted a relationship,

562
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:38,370
but then you chose a thief as your girlfriend.

563
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:40,451
What poor taste you have.

564
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,270
Oh, nope.

565
00:43:43,485 --> 00:43:47,568
A former prisoner and a thief make a good match.

566
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:49,620
You couldn't destroy me,

567
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,360
so you hurt Pam instead!

568
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,871
Why? Your face and your hands keep shaking.

569
00:43:54,871 --> 00:43:56,525
Do you love her that much?

570
00:43:56,525 --> 00:43:58,370
Yes.

571
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,640
I love Pam a lot.

572
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,220
That's nice.

573
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,420
Since I can't destroy you, I'm doing this to your loved one instead.

574
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,762
Don't think I'm doing this because I'm interested in you.

575
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:17,637
You're not worthy enough for that.

576
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:21,133
Don't.

577
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,942
If something happens to Pam,

578
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:25,776
there'll be hell to pay.

579
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,250
Dino.

580
00:44:29,222 --> 00:44:30,280
Calm down.

581
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,591
Come here, Dino.

582
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,900
Listen to me.

583
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,519
Don't.

584
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,159
What the hell is wrong with you?!

585
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:46,240
Let's break up.

586
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,794
No.

587
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:49,051
He said he's tired.

588
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:51,630
He said he and I were not meant for each other.

589
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:57,860
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

590
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,400
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

591
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,500
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

592
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:15,790
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫

593
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:40,430
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

594
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:44,990
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

595
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:50,350
