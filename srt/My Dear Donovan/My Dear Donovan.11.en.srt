If you're free, bring him here again.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,232
I miss him.

3
00:00:03,232 --> 00:00:04,952
You keep spoiling her like this.

4
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:07,248
That's why she dares burden us.

5
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:09,914
I don't want you to date Dino.

6
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:12,620
I'm ready to face him,

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,752
telling him I'm sincere with you.

8
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,612
I've grown up already.

9
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:20,220
Does that mean you've already figured out how to tell your grandpa?

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,100
You'll surely be done for, Donovan.

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,929
I thought he said he wasn't going with her.

12
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:26,721
Don't play hard to get.

13
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:30,812
Your thing is wanting me.

Hi. Mr. Aood is away?

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,780
Yes, he's away.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,723
That will be 31 baht, please.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,480
Wait, Pam.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,036
Have you talked to Mr. Aood lately?

20
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:07,796
Not really.

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,437
Wait, Pam.

22
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:15,548
It seems like lately there's been something on Mr. Aood's mind.

23
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:18,317
Do you know what it is?

24
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:22,660
I'll ask him when I see him.

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,480
Pam.

26
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,844
Are you still in a relationship? Or did you guys already break up?

27
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:33,412
Well.

28
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:38,026
Wait.

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,680
How did you know I was in a relationship?

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,568
It's just a random guess.

31
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:49,415
Did I guess right?

32
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,496
I have to go.

33
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:56,188
Okay. Bye.

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,048
Pam is gone.

35
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,420
Are you okay?

36
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:13,500
I asked you to tell her I'm away, not ask so many questions.

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,400
Come on.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,372
I was just making conversations as usual.

39
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:23,956
If it wasn't for me, would you have found out they were having problems?

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,584
Not even a thank you?

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,656
Fine. Thanks.

42
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:33,360
No problem.

43
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,870
You won't end this for real, right?

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,698
How can it end? I haven't started.

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,820
If we do this,

46
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,384
this whole thing will end. Okay?

47
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:00,864
It will. Right?

48
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:03,180
Yeah, it will.

He doesn't want to do this at all.

Would you like some sausages? It's buy I get 1 free.

All right, you can get them for free. What do you say?

73
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,175
Mickey said you were away.

74
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:33,000
I was going to pretend I was away,

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,378
but on second thought, I changed my mind.

76
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,480
I asked Mickey to tell you that.

77
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,540
I was afraid that if I saw you, I wouldn't be able to stop flirting.

78
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
No, it's not that.

79

I just didn't know what to do with my face if I saw you,

What do you think about this?

96
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,989
To be fair,

97
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,325
it's just a normal photo.

98
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,804
Really?

99
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:46,090
This is normal?

100
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:54,984
I don't think it's normal because when I asked him if she was going,

101
00:07:54,984 --> 00:07:57,800
he said no.

102
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,020
Oh.

103
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,768
That's suspicious then.

104
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:07,084
What should I do?

105
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:09,776
Ask. You should ask him about it.

106
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:13,680
I'm not trying to turn you against him,

107
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:18,420
but they're very close in that photo.

108
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,844
Yeah, you're not trying to turn me against him at all.

109
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,719
Just kidding.

110
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,502
Let me be serious.

111
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,420
Now that you know he didn't tell you everything,

112
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,228
I guess you can't ignore it.

113
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,619
That's what you're thinking. Right?

114
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,665
Mr. Aood's answer shows that he knows me more than I know myself.

115
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,610
What do you want to talk about?

116
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,246
100,000.

117
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:05,748
My new nose cost me 100,000 baht.

118
00:09:05,748 --> 00:09:09,324
So you want me to pay you?

119
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,328
I could care less about money.

120
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:18,648
It's my feelings that have been hurt.

121
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:23,491
I want you to kneel down and apologize to me right here, right now.

122
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,470
No.

123
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,760
No?

124
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,520
I didn't do anything wrong.

125
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,960
I have nothing to apologize for.

126
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,320
Don't you feel anything at all about what you did to me?

127
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,720
I do.

128
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,508
But I didn't start all that.

129
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,010
You did.

130
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:53,149
Does that mean you won't apologize?

131
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:56,284
Fine.

132
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,630
At least I've given you a chance.

133
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,828
What chance?

134
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,280
No one knows what she's planning to do.

135
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,063
But it will surely be something even worse than before.

136
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:15,915
Hey, Miss Da.

137
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,308
Can I have the mic?

138
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:25,800
It's me, Da.

139
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,393
I'm here tonight because I know Mike.

140
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:31,240
Hi, Mike.

141
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,666
I also came because I want to congratulate Donovan...

142
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,790
and Jessica.

143
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:49,344
As you all know, ever since my ad launched, both of them have shined even brighter.

144
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,046
Do you all agree with me?

145
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:52,800
Absolutely, yes.

146
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,025
Yes.

147
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:57,457
Does everyone else agree with me?

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,640
Since we all agree, let's make a toast to celebrate them.

149
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,980
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

150
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,680
The cheering from the whole party should make Dino happy,

151
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,253
but somehow it creeps him out.

152
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,966
Why are you trying to seek attention here?

153
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,232
Unlike you, I don't need to seek attention.

154
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:37,228
You don't understand what I'm doing, right?

155
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,420
Of course, someone with a little brain like you wouldn't understand.

156
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,839
Oh, your stupid face is hilarious.

157
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,573
What are you trying to do?

158
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,086
Why are you doing this?

159
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,673
You want to know?

160
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,189
All right, I'll tell you.

161
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,003
I'm doing this for my happiness.

162
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:11,192
Fly high.

163
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:13,540
Fly the highest.

164
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,510
Because I think it's fun to be on top.

165
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:46,030
Thank you so much for your advice

166

and for driving me home.

167
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,760
No worries.

168
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,236
I know you're stressed, so I wanted you to be comfortable.

169
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:15,794
You got cool AC, good music,

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,600
and a guy who may not be the one in your heart,

171
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,648
but cares about you with his whole heart.

172
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:37,116
I'm just saying, not hoping for anything.

173
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,564
I don't want you to be stressed.

174
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,800
Right.

175
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,000
Thank you.

176
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,165
I should go.

177
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:07,800
Should I call and talk it out with him?

178
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:21,531
You're still up. Right?

179
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:24,470
I was about to go to sleep.

180
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,259
I was waiting to see if someone would call.

181
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,117
I'm about to go home.

182
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,320
Was the party fun?

183
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,180
It's just the same old thing.

184
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,830
Dino.

185
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,526
You didn't tell me Jessica was going to be there.

186
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:50,540
I saw the Instagram post she tagged you.

187
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,476
Her body almost became one with you.

188
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,784
You said she wasn't going, did you not?

189
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:56,584
Okay.

190
00:14:56,584 --> 00:15:00,578
I admit it was wrong of me to lie,

191
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,709
but I just didn't want you to worry.

192
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:07,059
There's nothing between her and me.

193
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,960
Pam.

194
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,370
Trust me.

195
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,742
I'm telling the truth.

196
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,700
I should be a good girlfriend. He's admitted his mistake.

197
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,281
I should give him a chance.

198
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:46,297
I have one and a half hours.

199
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:05,606
Suddenly, I wonder what will happen if I try to be like the other hot girls?

200
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,550
And I got my answer that I shouldn't bother trying.

201
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,612
I guess some people are meant for certain things.

202
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,560
Hello?

203
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,020
Hey, junk food. Is my babe home yet?

204
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,810
What do you want? Why did you call me?

205
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,357
Are you deaf?

206
00:16:44,357 --> 00:16:48,077
I'm asking if my babe is already home.

207
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,254
Not yet.

208
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,840
But he left right after he dropped me off.

209
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,820
Did he stop at a car wash?

210
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,848
I mean his car got dirty last night.

211
00:17:00,848 --> 00:17:03,273
What are you talking about?

212
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,128
You've never done it in a car, so you don't know.

213
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:08,072
I recommend it.

214
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:12,232
Doing it in a cramped space that's difficult to move around feels great.

215
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:17,983
Hoping the people who walk past don't notice you is so arousing.

216
00:17:17,983 --> 00:17:20,834
So exciting.

217
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:27,272
Look! If you're trying to mess with my head, it's not working.

218
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:35,116
I'm not like those girls who'd be like, "Really? I'm so hurt and shocked."

219
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:36,740
I don't believe you.

220
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,360
I know you're good at acting, but please stop already.

221
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,240
Believe what you will.

222
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,304
Just don't search his car.

223
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:48,156
Bye.

224
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,305
The nerve of this woman. She keeps provoking me.

225
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:58,634
Who would believe her?

226
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,829
I don't believe her,

227
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:11,142
but it doesn't hurt to prove she's lying, does it?

228
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:13,222
Wow, you opened the door for me.

229
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:16,510
My senses start working right away.

230
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,310
Smell. Sight.

231
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,864
I don't see anything.

232
00:18:20,864 --> 00:18:23,848
Touch. I can't find anything.

233
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,644
You missed me that much?

234
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:31,356
I came down to help carry your stuff.

235
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:34,000
Where's my souvenir?

236
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,988
My bag is in the trunk.

237
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:37,997
I'll carry it myself.

238
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:49,872
Pam?

239
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:51,740
Is something wrong?

240
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,200
Something got stuck in my teeth.

241
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,465
Am I thinking too much?

242
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:03,570
What were you doing in my room?

243
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,354
Cleaning.

244
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,644
You're so adorable.

245
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:11,440
Oh, Dino.

246
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,136
I couldn't find my lipstick the other day.

247
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:16,050
I must have dropped it in your car.

248
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,629
Oh, then I'll go find it.

249
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:18,828
It's okay.

250
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:20,364
I can find it myself.

251
00:19:20,364 --> 00:19:23,030
Come on. Give me the key.

252
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:30,920
Do you want me to wait for you?

253
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,370
You can go in and rest.

254
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,584
Take a break.

255
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:43,541
Take a break.

256
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,745
That woman is really messing with my head.

257
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:20,861
Why?

258
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,658
Couble slippers.

259
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:24,556
What's wrong, Pam?

260
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,328
Dino,

261
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,745
did you lie about anything else?

262
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,812
What?

263
00:21:41,388 --> 00:21:43,409
About Jessica.

264
00:21:45,424 --> 00:21:48,486
What's the meaning of this? It's in your car.

265
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,680
Pam, I don't know how this condom got in my car.

266
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,892
I'm not lying to you.

267
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:01,720
Then I'll tell you how it got there.

268
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,570
That psycho just called me out of the blue

269
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,060
and said your car must be so dirty

270
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,400
because it was a rough night for you guys and stuff.

271
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,412
She also said I should try it in the car because it's exciting.

272
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:22,830
I know she's trying to provoke me and I should trust you,

273
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:28,909
but I wanted to know if any of what she said was true and there it is, Dino.

274
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:33,540
Other than work, is there something else going on between you?

275
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,073
Why does Jessica keep trying to get with you all the time?

276
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:40,548
Is there anything else I should know?

277
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,236
You two used to date, didn't you?

278
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,720
Yes.

279
00:22:56,692 --> 00:23:04,486
Even though I guessed it, I admit finding out that it was true shocked me.

280
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,940
Pam.

281
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,143
Why didn't you tell me about this?

282
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:24,394
It's in the past. I didn't think it was important.

283
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,336
But everything about you is important to me.

284
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:32,944
Back then, I was really new to this place.

285
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,380
I had no friends. I hardly knew anyone.

286
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,591
I came here knowing nothing, then I met Jessica.

287
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,390
We only dated for a while because I didn't like the things she did.

288
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,990
I didn't want to get involved with her again.

289
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,361
But she clearly still has feelings for you because she still won't stop bothering you.

290
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:51,124
Just ignore her. I don't care.

291
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:53,460
I chose you now...

292
00:23:58,216 --> 00:24:01,696
and I don't care about anyone else.

293
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:09,494
Words may lie, but his eyes are full of sincerity.

294
00:24:23,136 --> 00:24:28,618
Other than this, is there anything else you haven't told me about?

295
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,285
No.

296
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:41,096
Okay.

297
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,960
From now on, if we're not comfortable with something, we must talk.

298
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,750
Deal?

299
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,450
Deal.

300
00:24:54,856 --> 00:24:57,486
Tomorrow, I have to work with Jessica.

301
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,848
Again?

302
00:25:00,848 --> 00:25:04,908
If you're worried, come with me.

303
00:25:04,908 --> 00:25:09,569
No, I don't want to bother you while you work.

304
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,205
I will try to trust you.

305
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,772
I'm so worried about his past relationship

306
00:25:25,772 --> 00:25:33,663
that I don't even suspect he's keeping other dark secrets.

307
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,090
In order to find out if Jessica is still bothering him,

308
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,872
is it rude to show up without telling him?

309
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:53,196
But I can't stop worrying, so I'm going to spy on them for my peace of mind.

310
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:19,149
You must be secretly thinking I shouldn't have come if I couldn't accept it.

311
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,224
Help clean her up, Dino.

312
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:54,576
Hold that pose!

313
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,641
Keep clicking!

314
00:27:59,016 --> 00:28:00,872
Sorry!

315
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:04,667
Help me pick these up.

316
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:10,400
Pam.

317
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,925
I thought you said you wouldn't come.

318
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,349
I'm sorry.

319
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,299
I'm silly.

320
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,780
I shouldn't have followed you here.

321
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,378
Feel free to scold me if you want.

322
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,849
Pam, I know how you feel,

323
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:33,740
but I will never cheat on you.

324
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,590
Look at me.

325
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,090
Pam.

326
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,272
Trust me.

327
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,522
Do you trust me now?

328
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,597
That's it?

329
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:04,984
D-Dino...

330
00:29:04,984 --> 00:29:06,390
Dino! Stop!

331
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,893
I trust you now.

332
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:10,572
Aren't you afraid I'd lose my breath?

333
00:29:10,572 --> 00:29:15,286
I will keep kissing you until you trust me.

334
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,180
Do you trust me now?

335
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,044
Look at his face and the way his eyes are looking at me.

336
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:26,960
He didn't do anything wrong. I shouldn't have gotten mad at him.

337
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,772
I shouldn't have fallen for Jessica's manipulation.

338
00:29:30,772 --> 00:29:33,300
Go back to work.

339
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,040
I'm done.

340
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,890
I just have to change my clothes back.

341
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,360
Want to help me?

342
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,188
I don't think that's necessary.

343
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:45,291
Hurry up and change.

344
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:48,322
I'm going to the restroom.

345
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:50,880
See you later. Dino!

346
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,767
Hey, what are you doing?

347
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,920
You really came.

348
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,242
You were hiding yourself in a smelly corner.

349
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:19,460
On first look, I thought you were a ghost haunting this studio,

350
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,264
looking so pale and boring.

351
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:24,349
Then I realized it was you.

352
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:26,900
Did you secretly come to monitor him?

353
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:32,880
Did what you see hit you so hard that you had to come and cry in the toilet?

354
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,074
Do I look like I just finished crying?

355
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,620
You look sick.

356
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,510
And pale.

357
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,417
I think you're the one who's sick in the head.

358
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:51,720
You're jealous.

359
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,828
You keep bothering other people.

360
00:30:53,828 --> 00:30:56,360
You keep coming up with lies.

361
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,672
Did he tell you what he and I were to each other?

362
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:03,560
Yes.

363
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,520
I know you used to date him.

364
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,576
That's why I understand that you're probably doing all this

365
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:14,344
because you regret losing him, you're being a dog in the manger or whatever,

366
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:15,580
but please listen.

367
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,810
Dino and I are together now.

368
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:22,000
So please stop what you're doing already.

369
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,404
What if I don't stop?

370
00:31:25,672 --> 00:31:27,632
What will you do to me?

371
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,416
Do you even dare?

372
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:33,150
I will slap you,

373
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,140
pull your hair, drag your head on the toilet floor,

374
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:41,267
and take a video to tell the world that you're stealing someone else's boyfriend!

375
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,984
But I was just saying that.

376
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:47,020
I won't do it.

377
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,649
Why would I do it? Why would I hurt myself or lose my mind?

378
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:54,210
I'm sane enough to stop myself from doing things like that.

379
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,920
Besides, I trust Dino.

380
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,928
I know what he's doing with you is just work.

381
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:03,632
You're the only one who's trying here.

382
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:05,630
You're trying to get him interested in you again.

383
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,530
If he ever does something with you again,

384
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,608
let me tell you that it's not love, it's lust.

385
00:32:11,608 --> 00:32:13,730
Everyone can get horny.

386
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,400
It's not hard to get someone in the mood.

387
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,617
But if you're looking for love, let me tell you that you will never get it.

388
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:20,600
I'm not looking down on you,

389
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,224
but it's unlikely that anyone will want to give you love.

390
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:25,570
Get it together.

391
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,861
Please know that what you're doing is completely useless.

392
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,600
Useless?

393
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,844
Think what you will to make yourself feel better,

394
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,940
but old habits die hard.

395
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,810
It's not impossible for me to get him back.

396
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,076
Just wait and see.

397
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,700
What should I do with that crazy bitch?

398
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,472
Should I slap her?

399
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:58,208
How do I even fight against her?

400
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:08,727
What took you so long?

401
00:33:08,727 --> 00:33:10,580
I saw Jessica.

402
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,681
- Jessica?
- Yeah.

403
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:13,720
Did she hurt you?

404
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,560
No, she wouldn't dare.

405
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,400
We were just talking it over.

406
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,368
About what?

407
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,440
I scolded her about the condom.

408
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,680
I told her I don't care if she had been with you before,

409
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,650
but you and I are together now. She has to stop causing trouble.

410
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,285
You're so mature.

411
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:40,468
Respect.

412
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:42,788
Really?

413
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,460
I've seen many people who've been through this.

414
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,670
They would resort to violence.

415
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,832
But you're so tough.

416
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,951
I'm really proud of you.

417
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:05,080
I lost it once when I secretly followed you here this morning.

418
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,730
I need to be more sensible.

419
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,920
I will not disappoint you.

420
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:17,276
Promise?

421
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,120
Promise.

422
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,280
Okay.

423
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,456
Then let's go get something delicious to eat.

424
00:34:25,456 --> 00:34:28,084
I want to spend quality time with you already.

425
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:30,430
Okay. Let's go.

426
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,960
Excuse me, Mr. Donovan. Can we talk with you for a minute?

427
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,300
An agency wants you for a fashion show in Singapore.

428
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,043
- A fashion show in Singapore?
- Yes.

429
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,200
Go.

430
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,240
Now is your chance to go international.

431
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:52,312
If one has patience and believes their chance will come one day, it will.

432
00:34:52,312 --> 00:34:57,256
Other than fame, this will also bring Dino to his sister,

433
00:34:57,256 --> 00:34:59,629
who he's been searching for.

434
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,443
Why are you here?

435
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,804
I thought you were no longer his manager. Why do you still come?

436
00:35:24,804 --> 00:35:27,640
Or are you here to watch him?

437
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,630
What a popular guy.

438
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,000
Just last night, he was making out with a low-class model.

439
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,450
Today, you're here to watch him.

440
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,528
If he's that easy, he shouldn't play hard to get with me.

441
00:35:39,528 --> 00:35:42,257
I should be the one asking why you are here.

442
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:44,610
Look! I came with the agency.

443
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,324
I'm here for work.

444
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:48,920
- I have many connections.
- I mean, it's blue.

445
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,612
Don't think I'm giving you a lecture here, but you might want to be careful.

446
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:55,939
He might not be as nice as you think.

447
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:58,730
Yeah. I know that.

448
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,600
You do?

449
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,326
What do you know?

450
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,240
About Jessica.

451
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,848
He talked it over with me.

452
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,403
Really?

453
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:11,424
He's a bigger loser than I thought.

454
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,720
What do you mean?

455
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,510
Those innocent eyes of yours are telling me you didn't talk everything over.

456
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,613
What should I do? I really want to tell you.

457
00:36:24,613 --> 00:36:26,220
What are you talking about?

458
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,398
I feel bad for you, so I want to warn you.

459
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,180
Be careful.

460
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:37,714
This guy is probably not warm and nice like you thought.

461
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,456
I'm not saying he's all nice,

462
00:36:41,456 --> 00:36:43,380
but if I had to choose,

463
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,356
I would always believe Dino's words over yours.

464
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:48,523
Good.

465
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:50,560
Trust him a lot.

466
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,688
Love him a lot.

467
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:58,340
So when you get lied to, you will feel deeply hurt.

468
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:06,536
Let's just say there are still many things you don't know about your Dino.

469
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,160
I'm trying to tell myself not to listen to that woman,

470
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,590
but deep down my heart is telling me to worry.

471
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,640
I've only known him for a few months.

472
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,036
There may be things I really don't know about him.

473
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,631
Is everything okay?

474
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,513
Did Miss Dararai bring that agency?

475
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:52,128
Yes, their companies made a deal about this gig I'm going to do in Singapore.

476
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,781
While I was waiting for you today, she came to talk to me.

477
00:38:01,204 --> 00:38:03,158
About what?

478
00:38:05,103 --> 00:38:09,616
There are still many things you don't know about your Dino.

479
00:38:09,616 --> 00:38:12,215
I remember how confident she was

480
00:38:12,215 --> 00:38:15,276
when she said there are still many things I don't know about him.

481
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:17,920
Her actions left me wondering.

482
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,280
Oh, she was just saying hi.

483
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,668
But I didn't tell him about it

484
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:28,704
because we promised to trust each other.

485
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:38,068
I'm surprised she gave me the job when we have personal issues.

486
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:41,760
Should I say no to it?

487
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,012
Hey.

488
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:48,152
I think she's professional enough.

489
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:53,202
Someone like her wouldn't risk her reputation just to bully you.

490
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,650
Besides, this is an international gig.

491
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,965
I think it will make you become even more famous.

492
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:04,985
Don't you want to find your sister?

493
00:39:04,985 --> 00:39:07,905
This is a very important opportunity for you.

[Singapore]

495
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,804
Not long after, his popularity grew exponentially

496
00:39:18,804 --> 00:39:21,820
followed by, unavoidably, Jessica's.

497
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,946
We're in Singapore. Follow me.

498
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:25,712
I'm so excited to be here.

499
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:27,200
Are you excited, baby?

500
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,380
The more famous he gets, the less time he has to be with me.

501
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,812
Oh, my god! What happened to a hug?

502
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,510
But I understand.

503
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:40,035
I prefer supporting and taking care of him from afar.

504
00:39:49,288 --> 00:39:53,271
What's Dino's secret that Miss Da mentioned to me?

505
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,817
Maria!

506
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,282
Maria...

507
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:07,813
Are you okay?

508
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,530
Stop fucking haunting me!

509
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,020
Dino!

510
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,120
I'm going to walk in Milan Fashion Week.

511
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:27,220
I'm so happy for you!

512
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,552
I gave you a chance, but you threw it away.

513
00:41:31,552 --> 00:41:35,236
Now everyone knows.

♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

515
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,440
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

516
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,740
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

517
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:06,620
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫
