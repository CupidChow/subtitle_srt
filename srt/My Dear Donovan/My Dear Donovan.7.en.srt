1
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:04,600
What?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,120
You thought I was trying to make you drunk?

3
00:00:12,744 --> 00:00:14,532
Hello?

4
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:16,472
Hey. Help me.

5
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:18,072
What's wrong?

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,816
I have been drugged.

7
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:21,659
What?

8
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:24,023
Are you in this room?

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,744
Did you see anything?

10
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:40,880
Sa! Why do you keep showing up so quietly?

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,120
You scared me.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,240
Tell me. I want to know.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,280
What are you talking about? I don't see anything.

14
00:00:51,832 --> 00:00:54,640
Tell me the story.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Well,

16
00:00:57,347 --> 00:00:58,800
Dino is at Mr. Aood's house now.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,348
Really?

18
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:03,268
How come?

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,760
He was drugged and he couldn't go home because someone is waiting for him there.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,791
We had to bring him here to hide.

21
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:14,198
Who did that to my Dino?

22
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:16,907
Miss Da, the big mama of the industry.

23
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:17,840
Oh.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Who is she?

25
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:22,910
All you need to know is that she's big.

26
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,280
You wouldn't know who she is if I explained more.

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,328
Standing watch like this means you're worried about him.

28
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:29,657
If you're worried about him this much,

29
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:32,370
why didn't you bring him here and ask me to take care of him?

30
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:38,384
I'm starting to wonder what kind of person you were as a young woman.

31
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,200
I'm just worried...

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,120
that those two will start a fight.

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,634
It seems they don't really like each other.

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,880
I guess they're doing fine.

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,950
If they were fighting, we should have heard something. Right?

36
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,768
Wait. When you said you're worried, who are you worried about?

37
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:05,576
Dino or Mr. Aood?

38
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,620
Don't give me a funny answer or I'll poke your eyes out.

39
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,485
Answer me.

40
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:17,809
I'm worried about them both.

41
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,416
Both?

42
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,328
That's not true.

43
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:23,496
You must worry about one more than the other.

44
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:25,400
Why do you say that?

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,080
Because you're a woman.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,510
You can't worry about them equally. You must choose someone.

47
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,153
Both of them are my friends. Okay?

48
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:46,120
I don't worry about one more than the other.

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,400
It's fine if you don't know whom you worry about more yet,

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,168
but one day you must figure it out. Okay?

51
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,880
At that time, I really didn't have a clear answer,

52
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,318
but I knew that someday the right answer would be just one person.

53
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:28,048
As soon as I woke up, I couldn't help worrying about them both.

54
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:31,152
Are they awake yet? Are they fighting to the death?

55
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:34,800
Has the medicine worn off yet?

56
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,180
You're awake.

57
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,096
We've been waiting for you. Your grandpa is starving.

58
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:46,608
You shouldn't have waited.

59
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:49,060
You should've started eating without me.

60
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,388
I'm going out to buy soy milk. I'm craving it.

61
00:03:57,296 --> 00:04:00,050
Okay. Hurry then.

62
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,224
Wait, Pam.

63
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:05,256
Did you go out again last night?

64
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,776
I went to get something to eat at Mr. Aood's shop.

65
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:12,387
You weren't going out to eat.

66
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:16,391
I saw you drive off late at night.

67
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:21,080
Wait! How did you know that?

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,400
I couldn't sleep.

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,160
I could tell when I heard the door opening.

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,120
Oh no. I have to come up with a lie again.

71
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,189
Let me just signal my helper first.

72
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,264
Grandma.

73
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,488
My helper is ignoring me.

74
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,456
I'll just make something up then.

75
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,360
Oh, I remember now.

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,808
Last night, I forgot some stuff at the office, so I asked Mr. Aood to go there with me.

77
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:00,590
Right!

78
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,216
Yes.

79
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:05,552
Pam already told me that. I must have forgotten to tell you.

80
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,729
That's why you kept sighing last night.

81
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,968
You should've told me what was bothering you.

82
00:05:18,232 --> 00:05:21,243
I'm glad it's nothing serious.

83
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:26,420
Before you go out, come check this out.

84
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,320
I have something to show you.

85
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Come. Hurry.

86
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:34,392
Grandma, that was close.

87
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:37,440
You've survived. Now go. Just go with the flow.

88
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,848
- Go.
- That was close.

89
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:44,389
Do you want to know what will happen after you press this?

90
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,010
Try it then.

91
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:13,967
Now what?

92
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:15,960
Just wait and see.

93
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,352
You're playing nonsense.

94
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,368
Grandpa! Grandma!

95
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:25,524
Grandpa! Grandma!

96
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:27,220
Grandpa! Grandma!

97
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,823
I thought something happened.

98
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,912
I made Pam try the button.

99
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:44,480
She wanted to know what would happen after pressing it.

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,120
You're being childish, old man.

101
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,450
Look at how messy Mr. Aood looks.

102
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,424
Excuse me. What does this button do?

103
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:57,740
I made it for Grandpa and Grandma.

104
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,840
I figured that since you've been busy with work and they're home alone,

105
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,218
they could press the button to call me over in case of emergency.

106
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,300
Oh, Mr. Aood.

107
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,732
Why are you so cute?'

108
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,352
Thank you so much.

109
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:23,560
The button is not just for us, Pam.

110
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,952
You can call Mr. Aood over, too.

111
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:29,500
Let's say, when you have to go somewhere alone,

112
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,120
like going to eat, going shopping, or going to the movies,

113
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,180
when you have no one to help you carry things, you can just call Mr. Aood over.

114
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,880
Okay?

115
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,120
♪ I will come over right away ♪

116
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,980
♪ I will stand beside you ♪

117
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,664
♪ I will stay and take care of you to make you feel comfortable ♪

118
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:51,930
Easy, Mr. Aood.

119
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,984
Sorry.

120
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:58,196
You haven't brushed your teeth. Don't speak too much.

121
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,208
Anyway, I'm sorry for pressing the button and calling you over.

122
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,920
It's all right.

123
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,752
You can call me over anytime. I'm always ready to come to you.

124
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,180
I should go brush my teeth.

125
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,760
Okay. Go.

126
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,008
Thank you.

127
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,908
Bye, Miss Pam.

128
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,255
I'm awake.

129
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,490
What's up?

130
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,392
You were lying still all night.

131
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:04,139
I thought you were dead.

132
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Now that you're awake, go take a shower.

133
00:09:10,944 --> 00:09:12,444
Wait.

134
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,050
Thank you.

135
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,843
Slow down, Pam, or you're going to choke to death.

136
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:49,370
Here.

137
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,470
Slow down.

138
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:53,220
Swallow first.

139
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,020
Drink some water.

140
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,329
It's okay. Leave it there. I'll take care of it.

141
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:01,640
Just go.

142
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm going then.

143
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,310
Urgent work again?

144
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,008
Are you replacing someone on short notice again?

145
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:11,119
I hope it's not taking care of some foreign models again,

146
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,129
because I won't allow it.

147
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,120
Of course not. I have to go.

148
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,918
I have to go, Grandma.

149
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:21,160
I don't want you to do this job anymore.

150
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,280
What kind of job is it that you have to get home late at night?

151
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,320
It keeps me from sleeping.

152
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,570
I'm worried about you.

153
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,280
This job doesn't suit someone like you, Pam.

154
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,701
It's a waste of your effort.

155
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,726
Someone like me?

156
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,125
What's wrong with someone like me?

157
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,060
You can't even take care of yourself properly.

158
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:58,760
You forget your stuff at work often.

159
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,150
How are you going to take care of and manage anyone?

160
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,420
It's not fun and games.

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,580
I'm not doing this for fun, Grandpa.

162
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,528
I'm not good at this job and I don't want to do it,

163
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:17,628
but I have to do it because I have to earn some money for...

164
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,580
For me, right?

165
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,936
Of course, I'm your burden.

166
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,720
If that's what you think, you don't have to do any job.

167
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,320
Sometimes when my emotions get the best of me, I can't stop my mouth

168
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,460
and things get out of hand.

169
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,320
In times like this, it's most important to pull myself together.

170
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,176
Pam, you should hurry up and go.

171
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:47,160
Just hurry up and go. Drive safe.

172
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,988
I'm a burden being alive, I'd rather die.

173
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:57,759
Things have really gotten out of hand.

174
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,560
My grandpa has a sharp tongue by nature. I fight with him often.

175
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,379
I used to run away from the house when I was a kid because of him.

176
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,696
I told you it's not a toy.

177
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:38,120
You don't really listen to what I say.

178
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,720
Why are you so stubborn?

179
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,150
Get lost!

180
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,280
I was so hurt at that time.

181
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,216
I kept thinking Grandpa didn't love me because he scolded me every day.

182
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:53,760
I believed no one loved me. I sat there until evening.

183
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,848
I really thought no one would come and find me,

184
00:12:56,848 --> 00:13:00,880
- but what I saw changed my mind.
- Pam, why are you here?

185
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,780
You're wet all over.

186
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,970
Grandpa was half wet from his shoulders down to his pants.

187
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,988
His knees were scraped.

188
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:14,024
That's the first time I saw him like that.

189
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:17,404
How will I live if something happens to you?

190
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,360
That made me realize that even though he's sharp-tongued,

191
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,980
he loves and cares for me very much.

192
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,540
Anyway, he wouldn't listen to me if I apologized to him now.

193
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,812
I'll just wait for a while. I still have time.

194
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,446
- You ordered congee, right?
- Yes.

195
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:39,820
How much is it again?

196
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,728
120 baht.

197
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:46,082
Hey, Miss Pam.

198
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:52,300
Mr. Aood, I bought some congee for you.

199
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,000
Thank you.

200
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,320
I actually bought two for both of you.

201
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,780
I see.

202
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,330
How was last night?

203
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,430
Last night? Last night was fine.

204
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,656
Wait! Did he...

205
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,996
do that?

206
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,825
No. Nothing happened. Things were normal.

207
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,600
How's he doing?

208
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,992
He's still sleeping.

209
00:14:30,992 --> 00:14:33,404
How did you guys sleep last night?

210
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,160
I slept in my room. He slept on the sofa.

211
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,820
Would you mind if I wait inside your house?

212
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,800
I think he's still sleeping.

213
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,668
I need to talk to him.

214
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,210
Okay. I won't take the trash out anymore.

215
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,920
You can go inside, Miss Pam.

216
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,460
Great.

217
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,594
You're so fit.

218
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,936
I thought you were still sleeping.

219
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,903
Good morning.

220
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,320
How are you feeling?

221
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,564
Are you okay?

222
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:53,170
Are you still dizzy?

223
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm okay now.

224
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,060
Seeing your face cures everything.

225
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,283
Why didn't you fold the blanket?

226
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,460
You came to see me early.

227
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,253
Did you miss me?

228
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,170
I didn't.

229
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,860
I need to talk to you about something.

230
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,020
Okay. Come closer and talk to me.

231
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,420
Come.

232
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,272
Go take a shower before you talk to her.

233
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:36,972
You smell.

234
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,160
This is the first time in my life guys are fighting over me.

235
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,536
Your beauty is powerful, Pemanee.

236
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:51,552
Here you go.

237
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,080
Thank you.

238
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,180
Here.

239
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,680
This is yours.

240
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,750
What do you want to talk to me about, babe?

241
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,688
I'm not your babe.

242
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:09,136
Stop joking.

243
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,132
Come.

244
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,640
Come.

245
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:25,144
Come. Come sit with me.

246
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,040
You don't have to touch me.

247
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,584
So what happened last night?

248
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:35,792
I thought it was just dinner.

249
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:39,040
What did you do to get yourself drugged?

250
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,720
I didn't know she'd go that far.

251
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,676
You trusted her?

252
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,916
I went because it was necessary.

253
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,640
How?

254
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,860
Do you remember the news on social media?

255
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,660
Of course. I will never forget it.

256
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,804
What news, Miss Pam?

257
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:11,550
Miss Da made a deal with your mom

258
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,341
that if I agreed to have dinner with her, she'd help kill the story.

259
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,749
Oh, so that's why the news stopped.

260
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,640
Wait! But normally you would never agree to something like that.

261
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,596
You told me sometimes we must do something we don't like for someone else, remember?

262
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,790
Sometimes we must agree to do something we don't like for the one we love.

263
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,210
Nice.

264
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,112
You're doing it for the person you love.

265
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,976
For someone else?

266
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
Who?

267
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,760
You, Pam.

268
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,838
He gave me such a straight answer that I don't know what to feel.

269
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,890
You remember I don't like livers.

270
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,690
You know me so well.

271
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,313
Well, the store told me they ran out of livers.

272
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,398
You're imagining things.

273
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:41,897
By the way, won't you get in trouble for making her bleed?

274
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:44,040
I think it was an accident.

275
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,015
What will you do if she wants you to pay for it?

276
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:50,160
I don't know.

277
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,776
Oh my god.

278
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,160
We'll all be in trouble.

279
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,160
She looks like someone of influence.

280
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,913
You'll die. I'll die. We'll all die.

281
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,648
Don't touch me.

282
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:07,432
Don't worry, Miss Pam.

283
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:11,430
Don't forget that we have the video clip.

284
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:14,620
You're right.

285
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,520
I made the right decision to bring you along.

286
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,433
You're the most sensible person.

287
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,724
What's the relationship between you two?

288
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,610
Are you dating?

289
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,290
No, that's nonsense.

290
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,704
Mr. Aood is renting my grandpa's house, that's all.

291
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:39,128
He's been here for several years, so we became close.

292
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:43,640
But last night, he told me he knows you best.

293
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,400
What are you talking about?

294
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,720
Miss Pam,

295
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,940
I said that because he was saying there's something between you two

296
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,100
and I didn't believe him, so I...

297
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,107
Listen.

298
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:08,400
Whenever something in my house breaks down, Mr. Aood is able to come and fix it right away.

299
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,298
That's why he naturally became close to my grandpa and grandma.

300
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,845
When he said he knows me best, he means he knows everyone in my family well.

301
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,840
He knows what we do or don't like.

302
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,660
Okay.

303
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,291
I think I get it now.

304
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,488
Thanks for dropping me off.

305
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,032
Safe drive back.

306
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,690
I'm not leaving yet.

307
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,650
I'm going up to your room with you.

308
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,600
You're going up to my room? Why?

309
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,160
Don't tell me you...

310
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,080
Stop.

311
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,840
Stop whatever you're thinking about.

312
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
What do you think I'm thinking about?

313
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,679
Well...

314
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,704
Forget it.

315
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,480
You said Miss Da would follow you here. Right?

316
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,424
What if she's in your room?

317
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:15,293
What are you going to do?

318
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,440
I don't think she has the password to my room.

319
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:25,680
If she's able to close the whole floor, she doesn't need a password.

320
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,312
I think right now she's more worried about her nose.

321
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:32,170
She probably doesn't want to bother with me anymore.

322
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:37,977
I'm afraid what you did will make her even more angry.

323
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,016
This won't end easily.

324
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:43,019
Wait here first.

325
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,859
I'll text you if it's safe. Okay?

326
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,560
I think I'm used to seeing him wearing very little clothing,

327
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:03,520
but I don't know why his eyes are so attractive right now.

328
00:24:10,088 --> 00:24:11,983
Do you like it?

329
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,770
I dropped the magazine!

330
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,306
Hey! You startled me.

331
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,503
Why did you come up?

332
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,897
I told you to wait for my text.

333
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,844
I knew nothing was going to happen.

334
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:36,160
Luckily, I came just in time to catch someone looking at my photos.

335
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:43,075
I just saw the magazine there, so I picked it up and took a look.

336
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,480
If you want it, you can take it. It's yours.

337
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,792
You can look at it when you think of me.

338
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,342
No.

339
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,850
Well, I'm glad nothing happened and you're safe.

340
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,292
I'm leaving then.

341
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:12,295
What's wrong?

342
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:16,408
My head suddenly hurts where it got hit by the bottle.

343
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:17,480
Really?

344
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,890
Let me see if pieces of glasses are stuck in your head,

345
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,283
but as far as I can see, there's nothing.

346
00:25:27,283 --> 00:25:30,519
I think it's bruised from the hit.

347
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,575
Do you want to go see a doctor just to make sure?

348
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,344
It doesn't hurt anymore.

349
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,822
I'd rather do something else.

350
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,383
What?

351
00:25:53,992 --> 00:25:58,002
His eyes are clearly telling me what he wants.

352
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,400
My brain is telling me to run away...

353
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,173
but my legs won't move.

354
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,090
Luckily, the phone ringing saved me.

355
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:15,280
But does getting closer like that mean we already have feelings for each other?

356
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,856
Or did we just get carried away by the situation?

357
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,763
What did you do last night?

358
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:27,460
How did you break Miss Da's nose?

359
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,540
Has she called you already?

360
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,048
Of course, she has.

361
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,600
She said she's going to sue you.

362
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,525
You have to come see me right now.

363
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,730
Your mom just called.

364
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,395
She said Miss Da is going to sue me.

365
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,648
How could you do that to her?

366
00:26:57,648 --> 00:26:59,490
She's our big deal.

367
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,007
If she sues us, we'll go bankrupt.

368
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:03,423
We will have to leave the industry and find a new job.

369
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,016
Why are you just standing quietly?

370
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,156
Why aren't you answering me?

371
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,380
Dino was a little too drunk.

372
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,920
Drunk?

373
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,360
That's even worse.

374
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,700
You were so drunk that you broke a woman's nose?

375
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,370
We're screwed.

376
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,500
You were drunk and you attacked her.

377
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,356
Did you want to destroy your future in the industry?

378
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:36,880
You're welcome to destroy yours. Why did you have to drag us all down with you?

379
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,640
Am I representing a model or a thug?

380
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,960
Mom, aren't you being too harsh on him?

381
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,320
Stay out of it.

382
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,960
I'm talking to my model.

383
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,850
I went to see her just for dinner, but she wouldn't let the night end at dinner.

384
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,048
She was harassing me and I couldn't let her have her way.

385
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:56,660
You should have given in to her small demands!

386
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,584
You should have controlled your emotions.

387
00:27:58,584 --> 00:28:01,250
You keep making trouble.

388
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,633
It's so damn annoying.

389
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:06,404
But I was drugged.

390
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,760
If Pam hadn't saved me, I could have overdosed.

391
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,920
That woman drugged you?

392
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,260
She's playing quite dirty.

393
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,080
Now do you understand?

394
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,728
You said he should've given in to her.

395
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:25,276
How could you say that?

396
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:27,096
Do you see him as a product?

397
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:29,660
He's a human.

398
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,717
You're so worried about him, Pam.

399
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,512
You know what! If you and Dino hadn't caused trouble before,

400
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:40,160
Dino wouldn't have had to risk himself.

401
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,888
Things turned out like this because I had to keep cleaning up your mess.

402
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:48,680
Ever since you started working here, you've been giving me a headache every day.

403
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,460
Even though I know how Mom is,

404
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,840
every word that comes out of her mouth is harsher than I could imagine.

405
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:04,294
You know that I'm doing this job because I have no choice.

406
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,160
Really?

407
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,141
You don't want to do it?

408
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:13,492
Dino's and your actions say otherwise.

409
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,720
I'm older than you, Pam.

410
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,500
I know what you're thinking.

411
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,490
Mom.

412
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,160
You kept saying you didn't want to do this job, but you tried to get close to him!

413
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,250
You went beyond your responsibility. That's why things have gone too far up to now!

414
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,928
You don't understand me at all.

415
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,781
Not at all.

416
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,200
You know that I'm doing this to get money for Grandpa's surgery.

417
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,030
Grandpa has heart disease because of you. Do you even know that?

418
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,860
Pam, I'm your mother.

419
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,800
You ran abroad to save yourself and left me to be raised by him.

420
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,400
You never did your duty as a daughter.

421
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,960
And when you came back, you started a new family.

422
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,488
You don't even know what criticisms Grandpa had to endure about your bad actions.

423
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,364
I'm still your mother no matter what.

424
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,120
Watch what you say about me.

425
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,032
You have never been my mother.

426
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,830
How dare you call yourself a mother?

427
00:30:34,552 --> 00:30:36,768
Fine, I'm not.

428
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,360
I don't even want to be your mother that much.

429
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,960
Calm down.

430
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,068
Calm down.

431
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,560
Pam.

432
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,555
Don't blame yourself.

433
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:01,492
It's not our fault.

434
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,467
Your mom started all of it.

435
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,828
It all started with me.

436
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:14,496
It's like Mom said.

437
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:17,596
I've been causing trouble ever since I started working here.

438
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,800
Blaming yourself won't make things better.

439
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:31,622
Let's accept the reality and find a way to fix the problem.

440
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,000
You can say that because you didn't start this.

441
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,137
Every problem is easily fixed when you're not the cause of it.

442
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,168
You're making it too difficult.

443
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:48,723
You're smart.

444
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:52,250
You're all smart.

445
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,160
Why do I suck at everything?

446
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,960
Why am I always wrong?

447
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,209
I'm a troublemaker.

448
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:59,392
I shouldn't have been born.

449
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:01,640
Don't think like that.

450
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,969
You're speaking nonsense right now.

451
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:06,240
Yes. I'm full of nonsense. So what?

452
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,030
Scold me and let it end with me.

453
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,997
When you're in the middle of a storm, you can't see things clearly.

454
00:32:13,997 --> 00:32:16,740
I didn't know I was being foolish.

455
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:22,594
I was just hurting and looking for someone to listen to me without judgment.

456
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,376
That's all I wanted.

457
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:28,142
I'm sorry.

458
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,900
Pam.

459
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,020
Pam.

460
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,800
Take this.

461
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,250
What is it?

462
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,328
The rest of your pay.

463
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,670
Why are you giving it to me?

464
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,959
You don't want to do this job, so take it and be done with it.

465
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:12,419
Take it and don't come to work again.

466
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:16,266
I'm tired as well.

467
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,453
I'm seeing your face again?

468
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,800
Unexpected things always happen on a seemingly ordinary day.

469
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,024
Mr. Aood!

470
00:34:14,024 --> 00:34:15,250
Mr. Aood!

471
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,520
Hurry up, Mr. Aood!

472
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,648
- Grandma!
- Mr. Aood!

473
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:21,048
Hurry up!

474
00:34:21,048 --> 00:34:22,543
- Mr. Aood!
- Grandma!

475
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:24,840
Hurry! Help me!

476
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,750
- Coming! What's wrong?
- It's Grandpa.

477
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,840
- Grandpa!
- I went up to take a shower.

478
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,288
When I came down, I saw him like this.

479
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:35,680
I called Pam but she rejected my calls. I don't know what to do.

480
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,360
Hurry!

481
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,860
Grandpa!

482
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,064
Grandpa! Hang in there!

483
00:34:42,064 --> 00:34:43,640
Hang in there!

484
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,620
I'll open the door.

485
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,440
Hurry.

486
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,180
Grandpa! Grandpa! Hang in there!

487
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,960
- Sit next to him.
- Okay.

488
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,096
Hey.

489
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:57,380
Don't do anything crazy. You have to stay with me.

490
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,588
Hurry up, Mr. Aood! Hurry up!

491
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,240
Hey.

492
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,340
Why is there so much traffic, Mr. Aood?

493
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,169
Just do something to get us moving.

494
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:25,912
Honk the horn.

495
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:32,912
How are you? Can you hear me?

496
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,390
[K.Pam]

497
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,160
Hello.

498
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,190
If it's not urgent...

499
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,000
Grandpa has collapsed. We're on our way to the hospital.

500
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,584
My heart and hands began to shake.

501
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:55,440
I'm seeing all the bad things in my head.

502
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,600
Grandpa must be all right.

503
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,940
I need to pull myself together and go to him as soon as possible.

504
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,193
Hang in there!

505
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:06,328
Breathe!

506
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:08,720
Don't leave me!

507
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,761
Grandpa! I'm here! Can you hear me?

508
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:12,736
You only have a short time to say goodbye.

509
00:36:12,736 --> 00:36:16,904
I may not have the time I thought I had.

510
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,070
Reality is so much more cruel than you think.

511
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,766
So hurry up and do whatever you want before it's too late.

512
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,830
Some people part on understanding terms.

513
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,489
Some part while they're still on bad terms.

514
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,504
We won't know about the person who leaves,

515
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:50,510
but the one who stays will carry the guilt for the rest of their lives.

516
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,368
If there is still any remaining goodness from the things I have done,

517
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:58,128
can someone please have mercy and give me a chance?

518
00:36:58,128 --> 00:37:01,096
Please give me back Grandpa's life.

519
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,300
Why was Grandpa suddenly in that state?

520
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,944
Has he been taking his medicine regularly?

521
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:11,512
What happened?

522
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:14,112
He has. I always remind him to.

523
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,088
Then why was he like that?

524
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:21,920
You know he's not very well

525
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,236
and he had something on his mind.

526
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,396
Why didn't you tell me?

527
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:34,306
I didn't want to trouble you. I thought it was nothing serious.

528
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,350
Why?

529
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,352
What happened? Tell me.

530
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:46,280
Well, he's been unable to sleep because he's worried about your job.

531
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:52,484
Grandma said Grandpa is worried when it's late and I haven't returned from work.

532
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,677
Is Pam not coming?

533
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,134
She isn't. She's at work.

534
00:38:06,128 --> 00:38:09,920
Why is she still working so late?

535
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,503
What kind of job is that?

536
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,560
Last night was another night he couldn't sleep because of me.

537
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,586
He also had chest pain but didn't tell me.

538
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,160
What's wrong?

539
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,830
You keep rolling back and forth.

540
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,248
I'm having chest pain.

541
00:38:27,248 --> 00:38:28,928
Really?

542
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:30,848
Do you want to go to the hospital?

543
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:34,139
I just got back. Do you want me to go there again?

544
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,724
I don't think I have any goodness left for him to give me another chance.

545
00:38:40,724 --> 00:38:41,950
Pam.

546
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,500
I'm such a bad person, Grandma.

547
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,003
- It's my fault.
- That's not true.

548
00:38:48,003 --> 00:38:49,560
Pam, that's not true.

549
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,540
- It's my fault that Grandpa is like this.
- No, no, no.

550
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,695
Pam, calm down.

551
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:02,440
It's all right.

552
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,604
Believe me.

553
00:39:16,464 --> 00:39:21,584
While you're waiting for a miracle, it feels like time is going slower than usual.

554
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:23,661
It's an uncomfortable situation.

555
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:38,208
Grandma's cold hands remind me that I have to become strong again.

556
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,573
I can take it.

557
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,660
Thank you.

558
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,088
I think it's going to be a long night.

559
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,720
I'll go home to get our stuff.

560
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,747
Do you want anything?

561
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,728
I don't know. What do we need?

562
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:29,230
I'll take a look and bring only what's necessary.

563
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,756
I'll be right back.

564
00:40:31,756 --> 00:40:33,280
Go.

565
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,503
If there's anything urgent, call me immediately.

566
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,390
I'll go with Miss Pam.

567
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,890
Thanks.

568
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,039
I have to be strong.

569
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,225
I have to be strong.

570
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,859
I have to be strong.

571
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,550
I have to be strong.

572
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,070
I have to be strong.

573
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,809
I have to be strong.

574
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,230
But what happened today was too much.

575
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:27,508
It was almost too much for me to bear.

576
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,594
Are you all right?

577
00:41:42,248 --> 00:41:45,988
If you're not all right, don't keep it to yourself.

578
00:41:54,624 --> 00:41:57,531
I don't want anyone to see me cry.

579
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,192
I've cried a lot today.

580
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:11,819
Now I feel that I can't control anything.

581
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,375
I feel really bad...

582
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,296
and I really pity myself.

583
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,820
Feel free to cry, Miss Pam.

584
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,007
No one can see you now.

585
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,381
You don't have to be strong for others all the time.

586
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,484
Be vulnerable for yourself sometimes.

587
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:21,316
I will always be here for you.

588
00:43:21,316 --> 00:43:26,490
Weakness. Hopelessness. Fear.

589
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:30,870
Everything I'm feeling today has been released through my tears.

590
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:37,132
Sometimes having someone listen to you quietly can make you feel better.

591
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:43,507
I had no idea that someone else was also watching quietly.

592
00:43:56,944 --> 00:43:59,350
Thank you, Mr. Aood.

593
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,730
Miss Pam, can I pay one year's rent in advance?

594
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:16,422
You can use the money to pay for Grandpa's treatment.

595
00:44:17,427 --> 00:44:19,717
No, Mr. Aood.

596
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,792
I'm not going anywhere.

597
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:32,432
I'll be staying here for a long time.

598
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,346
Next to you.

599
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,080
You can give me a promotion.

600
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,160
Stay one year, get one month free.

601
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,160
Okay?

602
00:44:51,752 --> 00:44:54,760
That's a clever offer,

603
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,768
but I can't accept it.

604
00:44:59,768 --> 00:45:02,315
I think you understand.

605
00:45:07,296 --> 00:45:09,261
All right.

606
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,800
But you can change your mind anytime.

607
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,324
This promotion doesn't expire.

608
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,160
Thank you.

609
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:27,020
Yeah.

610
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,640
I should hurry and get my stuff.

618
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:20,760
I'm such a bad person, Grandma.

619
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,670
It's my fault that Grandpa is like this.

620
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,400
She blames herself for what happened.

621
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,392
That's why she's going to quit.

622
00:46:27,392 --> 00:46:30,020
I want to see the old Miss Pam.

The one who used to be happy.
