1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,730
I bought some congee for you.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,120
I actually bought two for both of you.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,443
You remember I don't like livers.

4
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:10,923
Well, the store told me they ran out of livers.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,040
You kept saying you didn't want to do this job,

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,770
but you tried to get close to him!

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,890
You went beyond your responsibility. That's why things have gone too far up to now!

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,320
Take it and don't come to work again.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,980
I really pity myself.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,315
Feel free to cry, Miss Pam. No one can see you now.

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,750
- Well...
- Yes. I'm coming.

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,340
Mom.

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,720
How is Dad?

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,160
Did anyone give you an update on his condition yet?

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,250
Not yet.

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,680
He has been in there since this afternoon.

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,490
It's nearly 8:00 p.m. now.

18
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,008
He hasn't had the operation yet.

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,720
Come on.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,940
He will recover soon.

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,319
He's bold.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,730
Where is Pam?

23
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,783
She went back home to grab some stuff. She'll be here soon.

24
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,119
Why is Dad in this condition all of a sudden?

25
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,241
He was just discharged from the hospital, wasn't he?

26
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:46,296
Earlier today, when we were having lunch, he blacked out.

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,000
I guess he's worried about Pam.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,600
She's working, so she comes home late.

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,120
Your dad is so worried about her that he couldn't sleep.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,880
But I won't blame Pam for this.

31
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,600
This is what being old is like. We get sick easily.

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,620
But Pam blames herself for what happened,

33
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,224
so she's going to quit.

34
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,249
Is that so?

35
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,490
She told you she'd quit because of this?

36
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,300
Did she talk to you about something else?

37
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,819
Nope. She only talked about Grandpa.

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,010
Miss Pam.

39
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,410
Yes?

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,970
Where did you get it?

41
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,170
He asked me to give it to you when you were in the house getting your stuff.

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,752
Why didn't you tell me he came, Mr. Aood?

43
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,535
If he wanted to see you, he wouldn't have left first.

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,060
I kind of understand why.

45
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,910
It's because we just fought earlier today.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,274
Did he see me cry?

47
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,861
I don't know either.

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,980
Are you afraid that he saw you cry

49
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,414
or that he saw you cry with me?

50
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,213
I'm just asking.

51
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,890
Right.

52
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,083
Hello, Pete.

53
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,483
Did you talk to Pam?

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,074
Not yet.

55
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:16,549
You said you'd say sorry to her, didn't you?

56
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,610
I haven't met her yet.

57
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,600
She went back home to get her stuff.

58
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,440
When you talk to her, try to calm yourself down.

59
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,460
Don't explode your anger at her again.

60
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,231
I just talked to my mom.

61
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,660
She told me Pam is going to quit.

62
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,420
That's not surprising though.

63
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,650
Pam is a kindergarten teacher.

64
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,330
She has her daily routine.

65
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,740
Being Donovan's manager is a complete contrast with that, isn't it?

66
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,810
She left in the morning and came back home another morning.

67
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,010
What's more, her own mom scolded her.

68
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,260
When she argued back, you slapped her.

69
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,013
How could she bear it? No doubt she told Grandma about that.

70
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,489
If you called to add insult to injury, just hang up.

71
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,524
I already feel bad now.

72
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,410
Pete,

73
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,769
Pam didn't tell Grandma about me scolding or slapping her at all.

74
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,102
This makes me feel even more awful now.

75
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,000
What do you think I should do?

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,500
Say sorry to her.

77
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,000
You went there to say sorry to her, didn't you?

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,253
Just tell her you're foul-mouthed,

79
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:36,950
and treated her so badly.

80
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,291
I'm back.

81
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,920
What did the doctor say?

82
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,638
He hasn't come out yet.

83
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,490
Pam.

84
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,929
Let's talk.

85
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,300
It's difficult to make eye contact with the person we're angry with.

86
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,980
I don't even want to look at her face.

87
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,923
Miss Pam can't see you now.

88
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,060
Please give her this.

89
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,660
I'll bring it to her.

90
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,560
Why did Pam cry?

91
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,170
Her grandpa has to undergo an emergency operation.

92
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,690
Is Pam all right now?

93
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,170
Miss Pam was doing okay before,

94
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,620
but ever since you stepped into her life, she's facing all these problems.

95
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,920
This was the first time she cried.

96
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,240
I think you should find a new manager.

97
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,260
I want to see the old Miss Pam.

98
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,220
The one who used to be happy.

99
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,260
I don't want to see her cry anymore.

100
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,784
Especially for someone like you.

101
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Why do I suck at everything?

102
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,520
Why am I always wrong?

103
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,850
I'm a troublemaker.

104
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,950
I shouldn't have been born.

105
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,770
Don't think like that.

106
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,120
You're speaking nonsense right now.

107
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,500
Yes.

108
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,420
I'm full of nonsense. So what?

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,700
Scold me and let it end with me.

110
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,240
But ever since you stepped into her life, she's facing all these problems.

111
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,310
I shouldn't have been born.

112
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,770
I'm a troublemaker.

113
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm a troublemaker.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,980
- I shouldn't have been born.
- She's facing all these problems.

115
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,120
This was the first time she cried.

116
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,080
"I want to see the old Miss Pam. The one who used to be happy."

117
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,800
"I don't want to see her cry anymore. Especially for someone like you."

118
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,160
Because of Mr. Aood's words, Donovan is now drowning in guilt.

119
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,978
Does it hurt?

120
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,511
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,393
It's pretty surprising to me that the first thing a person like Mom says is sorry.

122
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,020
I thought it over.

123
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,439
I spoke with and treated you too badly, Pam.

124
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,231
To be honest, we haven't lived together for 20 years.

125
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,753
Sometimes, I forget that you're my daughter.

126
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,640
She forgets that I'm her daughter?

127
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,450
This following sentence from her surprises me as well.

128
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,976
Anyway, I'm sorry.

129
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,321
I'll try to control my emotions.

130
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,251
Okay?

131
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,480
Actually, I'm all right.

132
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,690
I also want to say sorry for causing you problems all the time.

133
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,340
Just forget about it.

134
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,506
Let's start again.

135
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,960
Yes.

136
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,210
I'm returning this to you.

137
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,640
Because of this incident, family members who haven't lived together for so many years

138
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,843
have to spend several hours together.

139
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,810
Doctor.

140
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,610
Doctor!

141
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,940
How is he now?

142
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:10,696
Our wait is over now.

143
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:15,600
Perhaps it's because someone heard Grandma and me praying.

144
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,767
We feel that it has been such an eternally long time.

145
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,803
It has come to an end, finally.

146
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,401
Everything is all right now, Grandma.

147
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,880
What time is it, Pam?

148
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,800
When the thing I have focused on is over now,

149
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,868
it comes to my mind that someone might be waiting for me.

150
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,000
You're speaking nonsense right now.

151
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,330
Yes.

152
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,460
Scold me.

153
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,560
Should I contact him?

154
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,760
Perhaps, he must be sleeping already,

155
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,700
or he hasn't been waiting for me at all.

156
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,300
Miss Pam?

157
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,770
Yes.

158
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,760
What did you say?

159
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,280
It's 3.30 a.m. now.

160
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,650
I already told your mom.

161
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,160
The hospital won't allow us to see him today.

162
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,539
Let's go home for now.

163
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,680
All right.

164
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,203
I'll send you home.

165
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:29,135
It's all right, Mom.

166
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,608
I drove here.

167
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:33,920
Let's go.

168
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,698
Let's go, Mr. Aood.

169
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,527
You two are still not okay with each other?

170
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,680
- Huh?
- Your mom and you.

171
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,100
You guys haven't reconciled?

172
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,510
This is Grandma. She knows me best and reads my mind best.

173
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:56,370
Pam, I understand that this problem happened a long time ago,

174
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,980
so you guys can't settle it down right away after just a few conversations.

175
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,730
But listen to me, Pam.

176
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,000
Time can't be turned back,

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,960
and it never stops either.

178
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,570
She also likes to say things that hit me hard.

179
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,070
Let's go.

180
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,360
Grandpa is all right now.

181
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,241
Let's go back to rest.

182
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:42,490
Sa, what's wrong? Are you hurt?

183
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,921
You should have told me. I can do that for you.

184
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:48,040
I'm fine. Just tight tendons.

185
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,370
It's not because I'm old though.

186
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,671
It's because I didn't get enough rest. Got it?

187
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:53,860
Yeah.

188
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,140
I didn't say anything.

189
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,520
Go and get some rest now.

190
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,160
Pam, you must get some rest too.

191
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,560
Don't stress yourself out.

192
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,290
Grandpa is safe now.

193
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,680
Don't be stressed. Got it?

194
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,160
- Okay?
- Yes.

195
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,060
You too.

196
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,570
Let's go.

197
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,850
Wait.

198
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,820
Face me.

199
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,410
You said you wouldn't stress yourself out, didn't you?

200
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,330
But why are you frowning?

201
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,800
Botox can't even help you with that.

202
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,580
All right.

203
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,600
How is it?

204
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,000
Fab.

205
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,420
Sa, don't worry about me.

206
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,760
I can take care of myself.

207
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,970
You'd better take care of yourself.

208
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,560
Look at you now.

209
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,230
Come on. We're not different.

210
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,720
Go and take a shower now.

211
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,860
I'll turn on super cool air for you.

212
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,040
Okay. Go and get some rest.

213
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,329
Take care of yourself, too.

214
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,740
I'm going.

215
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,480
Watch your back too. Be careful when you bend down.

216
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,518
Happy now? It's straight already.

217
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,924
Since last night,

218
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,301
he had disappeared, not contacting me again.

219
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,793
I should clear things up with him now.

220
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,150
[Pam]

221
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,420
Hello?

222
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,998
Are you still on the call?

223
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,170
Yes.

224
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,577
You heard about my grandpa, right?

225
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:27,050
I did.

226
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,400
Yesterday, I was so shocked when I knew that he had to be admitted to the hospital,

227
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,580
so I had to rush to the hospital immediately.

228
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,923
Grandpa suddenly got high blood pressure.

229
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:39,503
Lucky enough, he was sent to the hospital in time.

230
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:46,315
Do you know that I waited there from the afternoon until 3.00 - 4.00 a.m?

231
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,660
And then?

232
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:54,250
His voice this time is different from usual.

233
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,204
Am I disturbing you?

234
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,050
I can talk now.

235
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,012
Just go on.

236
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,807
I'm just calling to tell you that...

237
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,620
I already quit the job.

238
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:28,307
I hoped to hear him trying to stop me from leaving him.

239
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:30,850
You heard that already, right?

240
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,973
I'm quitting.

241
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,815
Stop me.

242
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,295
Try to hold me back.

243
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,043
I wish you good luck.

244
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:49,610
♫ The memory of how much we loved each other ♫

245
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
But I'm hoping too much.

246
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,940
Our closeness all this time and everything I'm curious of...

247
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,200
were all caused by me alone.

248
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,102
It's only I who feels it, and it's all in my head.

249
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,077
I wish you good luck, too.

250
00:18:20,618 --> 00:18:23,844
From now, I won't call and bother you often.

251
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,226
Silence is also an obvious answer.

252
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,930
♫ Because it's hard to forget you ♫

253
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,450
♫ I wish I hadn't met you ♫

254
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,760
♫ If I could turn back time, I wouldn't look into your eyes ♫

255
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,280
♫ And let you give my heart butterflies ♫

256
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:23,980
♫ It'd be better if we didn't know each other... ♫

257
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,394
♫ because it's too hard to forget you ♫

258
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,387
I'm here to see Miss Dararai.

259
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,890
Did you make an appointment?

260
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,060
I didn't.

261
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,240
Without an appointment, Miss Dararai is not available to see you.

262
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,180
She's not ready to meet anyone now.

263
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,680
I guess her face still hasn't gotten back to normal.

264
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,180
Then, please tell her this.

265
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,660
Last night, she said she would sue our agency.

266
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,320
We took Donovan to the hospital for a blood test,

267
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,940
and a toxin was detected in his body.

268
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,600
If this spreads out,

269
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,660
this whole industry will know that your boss drugged our model.

270
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:33,200
If I report this to the police, your boss will surely be put in jail.

271
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,286
If she's willing to trade it for that, then try.

272
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,280
Won't you note it down?

273
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,960
Can you remember the whole thing I said?

274
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,400
It's fine if you don't note it down,

275
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,161
but remember to tell Miss Da every word and every sentence I said.

276
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,860
Is she following me?

277
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,940
Nope.

278
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,120
Hello?

279
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,860
Hello, Pete?

280
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,080
I already told her what you told me to say.

281
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,720
What did she say?

282
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,100
I didn't meet Miss Da,

283
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,973
but I asked her secretary to tell her.

284
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:15,848
At first, I was afraid she would ask for the test result.

285
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:19,250
Nope. She isn't that clever.

286
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,960
Her employees aren't either.

287
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,070
Overacting like this is just right for us.

288
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:23,960
All right.

289
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,890
See you at the office.

290
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,980
I must hurry and leave now. Or else she could catch me lying.

291
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,880
Okay.

292
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,829
His work has now been released with tons of compliments that follow.

293
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,120
He, as well as his partner, is becoming more famous.

294
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,820
I see his face everywhere,

295
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,548
and I can't help thinking of him.

296
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,960
But he behaves in contrast with his popularity.

297
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,547
He shuts himself off, not contacting anyone.

298
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,080
But I don't have time to feel surprised or focus on that

299
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,520
because I have to manage my own matters.

300
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,280
I have to reconcile with Grandpa, my family member.

301
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,670
Do we have that sausage?

302
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,100
Where can we find it?

303
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,650
What about salty meat?

304
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,060
It's tough. The old can't chew it.

305
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,840
- What about a pretty model?
- That sounds good.

306
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,520
Wait. He is my husband.

307
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,578
Well, I don't know what to bring to make up with Grandpa.

308
00:23:02,877 --> 00:23:05,660
I think you don't have to bring anything.

309
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,450
Just go in and talk nicely to him.

310
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,840
Be sincere.

311
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,760
It will turn out well. Trust me. Okay?

312
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,540
Is he still angry with me?

313
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,320
Come on. I'll help talk to him. Okay?

314
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,620
Let's go.

315
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,423
- Let's go.
- Be careful of the car.

316
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,470
Thank you.

317
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,620
Hey, Pam has something to talk to you about.

318
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,120
Let's talk.

319
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,542
Sa, wait. Stay with me first.

320
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,583
I'll buy some fruits.

321
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,276
He needs to eat them, so he will stay healthy.

322
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:56,089
I'll be right back. You guys can just talk.

323
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,050
Wait. Sa!

324
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,301
Come on. I'll be right back.

325
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:06,125
Well, sometimes, I want to pinch my grandma's back.

326
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:21,610
Grandpa, I'm bringing this for you.

327
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,923
Just put it there.

328
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,520
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

329
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,483
I shouldn't have said that to you.

330
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,600
I also spoke badly to you.

331
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,710
I said that because I was worried about you.

332
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,760
I'm just like this.

333
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,422
My words are unpleasant to you, Pam.

334
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,686
I think...

335
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:31,514
if I got hurt and then died right away,

336
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,400
I wouldn't open my eyes and see you again.

337
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,960
Grandpa.

338
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,272
If that happened to you, I couldn't live either.

339
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,625
I'm sorry for having stressed you out.

340
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,180
From now,

341
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,172
you don't have to worry about me waking up early or going to bed late anymore...

342
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:03,817
because I have already quit that job.

343
00:26:03,817 --> 00:26:05,700
Really?

344
00:26:06,472 --> 00:26:09,169
Is that okay?

345
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,980
You haven't completed the job duration as agreed.

346
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,000
It's all right. It's all right, Grandpa.

347
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,400
I talked to him already.

348
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,825
He didn't blame me at all.

349
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,890
That's good.

350
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:29,692
That job doesn't suit you.

351
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,796
But don't worry about money.

352
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,060
I will sell our gold and old votive tablets.

353
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,410
We can get quite a few hundred thousand baht.

354
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,991
No, Grandpa. Don't sell anything.

355
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,180
I already got the compensation money.

356
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,890
It's the exact amount as agreed in the beginning.

357
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,250
What?

358
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,680
Really?

359
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,641
Yes.

360
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,880
Are you lying again?

361
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,000
Before I fail and get caught lying again, I must try to get by.

362
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,920
Grandpa, apart from your glasses,

363
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,394
I have another thing for you.

364
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:15,140
Here you are.

365
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,540
I love you!

366
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,950
Stop being angry with me, Grandpa.

367
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,463
Why is it such a mess?

368
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:40,640
What's the matter?

369
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,794
You're not going to work anymore, are you?

370
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm not in the mood.

371
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,060
Hey. You have a lot of jobs.

372
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,260
You can't just ignore them like this.

373
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,561
It's not only that you will be in trouble, but our agency will also be.

374
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,479
That's your company, not mine.

375
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,610
But we still have a contract.

376
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,943
Do you want to get fined?

377
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:20,088
Just do that, Pete.

378
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:22,427
Just take whatever you want.

379
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,210
I think you should take a shower

380
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,129
and shave to refresh yourself, and we can talk then.

381
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,070
Stairs.

382
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,680
Be careful.

383
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,840
Stay right there.

384
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,810
Let me help you.

385
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,560
Wait.

386
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,810
Let's go.

387
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,543
No, you don't have to do that.

388
00:29:09,543 --> 00:29:11,660
Just take him inside to rest. I'll take care of it.

389
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,490
Come sit on the couch.

390
00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:19,367
Sit here. I'll bring you some water.

391
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:20,760
Sounds good.

392
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,315
I don't know how he is now.

393
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,935
I think he must have already moved on for awhile now.

394
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,920
It's just I who hasn't let go of him.

395
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,510
A new pair of shoes that usually takes us to places far away...

396
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:57,895
sometimes brings us back to the same place.

397
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,160
What's the matter, Mom?

398
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,420
Pam, are you busy now?

399
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,432
Please come to see me.

400
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,020
Guys, please stand in line.

401
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,587
Don't queue jumping those who came first.

402
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:50,940
Please gather here.

403
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,100
Please gather around here.

404
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,220
Okay. Thank you so much.

405
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,099
Hello.

406
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,410
Pete, you're here.

407
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,000
What's going on?

408
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,010
They're here to see Donovan.

409
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,170
I thought there was a casting today.

410
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,370
Nope. They're here just to see Donovan.

411
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,020
I'll get back to work.

412
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,215
Guys, please stand in line.

413
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,571
I told you I'm not in the mood to work.

414
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,450
It's me.

415
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,209
I have to see him again.

416
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,976
Why did you allow yourself to be like this?

417
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,554
What's the matter?

418
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,040
I have something to talk to you about.

419
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,840
Go ahead.

420
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,440
Take a shower, and then we can talk properly.

421
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,188
It's a long story.

422
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,280
I bought some food for you.

423
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,880
I'll put them on a plate.

424
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,488
Hey, don't.

425
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,500
You don't have to do anything for me anymore.

426
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,082
You're no longer my manager.

427
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,730
If your mom asked you to talk me about going back to work,

428
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,993
please don't. I'm not going.

429
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,068
I don't want to work for her anymore.

430
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,760
It's not about that.

431
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,500
What is it?

432
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,600
A lot of people sent me direct messages,

433
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,710
saying that they're your sister.

434
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,200
But from checking their faces,

435
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,920
I think none of them are.

436
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,600
Some said they saw your sister before.

437
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,570
Some said they know her and can share information with us.

438
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:16,137
But I don't know what is true and what is not.

439
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,690
I think you know it better than I do, so I want you to talk to them yourself.

440
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,260
Where do I have to go?

441
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,880
I asked them to meet at Mom's office.

442
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,270
- I'll go.
- Wait.

443
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:34,242
Are you sure you will go like this?

444
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,220
What's wrong?

445
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,578
It's hard to do it this way.

446
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,670
Which way is easier?

447
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,834
You must do it yourself.

448
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,650
I won't.

449
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,850
Then just lay down. Hurry up.

450
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,576
Don't be stubborn.

451
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,583
Are you still mad at me?

452
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:35,825
I can never get mad at you.

453
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,220
Why did you disappear like that?

454
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,300
Can you tell me?

455
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,489
It's you who told me you were quitting.

456
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,570
That's right. I quit.

457
00:37:53,570 --> 00:38:00,500
But does that mean we can't talk anymore?

458
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,780
Do you want it that way?

459
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,250
Of course, we can talk.

460
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,709
What makes you think we can't?

461
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,490
You just disappeared.

462
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,890
You didn't tell me anything.

463
00:38:17,893 --> 00:38:19,530
If you're not that stupid,

464
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,040
you should know that it was the day I needed someone to cheer me up the most.

465
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,420
But you just disappeared like that.

466
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,040
But aren't you curious?

467
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,020
While I knew it was a terrible day for you,

468
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,560
I didn't do anything?

469
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,440
We know and see each other every day.

470
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,760
Do you think I could really treat you like that?

471
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,330
Why did you disappear then?

472
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,412
Can you explain your reason?

473
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:59,373
Someone doesn't want me to see you cry anymore.

474
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,070
Who?

475
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,911
Mr. Aood?

476
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,180
It must be him.

477
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,609
What did he say to you?

478
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,170
If you don't tell me,

479
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,060
I will cut you with this razor.

480
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,050
I didn't say no.

481
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,487
You must figure it out for yourself.

482
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,280
All right.

483
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,737
I won't ask you anymore if you feel uncomfortable answering.

484
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,220
But I'm still curious anyway.

485
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,334
You disappeared like that and didn't explain anything to me

486
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:55,713
while that day we almost...

487
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,000
Almost what?

488
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,680
Why did I bring it up?

489
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,506
I accidentally said that.

490
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,626
We almost kissed?

491
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,620
What?

492
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,781
You've turned quiet now.

493
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,569
Why?

494
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,559
Your face is red.

495
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,570
Nonsense.

496
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:48,279
I put too much makeup on today.

497
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,973
Your face feels hot.

498
00:40:59,973 --> 00:41:02,475
It's not about your makeup.

499
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,567
It looks more like you're shy.

500
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,215
Pam...

501
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:25,550
thank you... for coming to see me today.

502
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:37,490
Don't talk too much.

503
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,150
Let's get you cleaned up quickly.

504
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,990
♫ Too hot ♫

505
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:46,140
♫  It's not true! (Don't believe it, don't believe what he says) ♫

506
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:52,810
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

507
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,000
Have you ever felt that

508
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,610
the wall you have tried to build closing yourself off from that someone

509
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:01,459
is destroyed in less than 5 minutes?

510
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:11,820
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes ♫

511
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,394
Donovan is here.

512
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,293
Calm down, guys.

513
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,020
Relax.

514
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,640
Don't crowd him. Stay where you are.

515
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,153
Please.

516
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,530
Who are they?

517
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,810
I just knew it, too.

518
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,940
You posted on TikTok to find your sister.

519
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,887
Look at them. They're here for that.

520
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,880
I thought it was your girlfriend's.

521
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,361
So, it belongs to your older sister?

522
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,720
Yes.

523
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,999
How can we find out who is real or fake?

524
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,420
I'll talk to all of them.

525
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,933
Nope.

526
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:10,463
You don't need to.

527
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,719
I have a way.

528
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,802
Be quiet, please.

529
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,010
Before Donovan interviews you today,

530
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,586
does anyone want to take a photo with him?

531
00:43:27,586 --> 00:43:29,747
If you're ready, raise your hand!

532
00:43:29,747 --> 00:43:31,533
Hands up.

533
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:37,300
You.

534
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,360
Three of you in the back also.

535
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,880
Please go home.

536
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,893
Please leave.

537
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,340
Thank you.

538
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,730
Next, if you have some information about Donovan's sister,

539
00:43:54,730 --> 00:44:00,130
you must know which state she lived in.

540
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,380
Go to the right if it's New York.

541
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,100
Go to the left if it's California.

542
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,040
If you're ready, stand up now.

543
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,600
Stand up, please.

544
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,050
One, two, three. Stop.

545
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,010
Do not move.

546
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:23,630
Those who choose California,

547
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,940
please go home.

548
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,170
Please go home now.

549
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,566
We now have three left.

550
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:39,323
This makes me feel tired.

551
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,454
All right. We only have three left.

552
00:44:42,454 --> 00:44:44,940
Now, it's about insight information.

553
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,571
You must choose them yourself.

554
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,210
How did you get to know my sister?

555
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:59,937
You speak Thai so clearly. You also look handsome in person.

556
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,734
I saw her lying on the side of the road after a car crash.

557
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:04,540
She was soaked in blood.

558
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:09,280
I was so shocked when I approached her, so I took her to the hospital.

559
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,280
How is she now?

560
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,120
She's recovering now.

561
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,480
She is all right.

562
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,120
But I paid all the treatment fees for her.

563
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,000
Can you take me to see her?

564
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,252
I don't know your sister.

565
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,490
Please leave.

566
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,810
No. Wait.

567
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:31,730
I can do face reading, so I want to warn you.

568
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,270
This is not a joke.

569
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:38,000
You're going to have a misfortune related to women.

570
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Pete's method in narrowing down our choices works.

571
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,580
Many of them approach him just to find benefits for themselves.

572
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,140
That doesn't mean we will find the right person.

573
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,226
We'll contact you later.

574
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,500
Please tell him that he's seriously going to face misfortune.

575
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,420
I can sense and see that coming.

576
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,730
Yes.

577
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:07,385
You too. It seems you're going to face a big problem.

578
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,280
It looks like it's related to a model.

579
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,550
That's not good.

580
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:14,563
Please leave.

581
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,776
And we have to continue searching for her.

582
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,987
I feel that this woman looks very familiar,

583
00:46:25,987 --> 00:46:29,140
but I don't know where we've met before.

584
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,988
Do you need anything?

585
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,733
I know your sister.

586
00:47:14,733 --> 00:47:16,370
I have her photo in my room.

587
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,780
You can come to take a look. I'm fine with that.

588
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,090
They look so adorable together.

589
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,840
Are they a real couple?

590
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,880
I have to find something to do to distract myself from focusing on him.

591
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,190
Whatever he does and no matter with who, what right do I have to stop him?

592
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:42,180
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

593
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,840
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

594
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:53,080
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

595
00:47:53,080 --> 00:48:00,190
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫

596
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:29,570
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

597
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:35,230
♫ Don't get me wrong, wrong, wrong  ♫
