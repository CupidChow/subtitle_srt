1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,560
I know your sister.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,200
I have photos with her in my room.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,320
Come take a look if you want, I don't mind.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,740
I don't feel the same about you anymore.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,566
I'm going to be honest with you now.

6
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:17,977
I won't run from it anymore.

7
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,880
I love you.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,170
I want you in my life.

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,280
What's going on between you and my daughter?

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,440
What do you mean?

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,267
I don't want you to date Dino.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,120
- I did it.
- Right.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,604
Three, two, one.

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,780
Pam!

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,760
You're back, Miss Pam.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,280
I'm back.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,470
How is it? That's my supercar.

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,720
I saw your car drift.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,690
Why is Luke with you now, Mr. Aood?

20
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,662
Your mom dropped him off here.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,260
Aood, here're some snacks.

22
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,660
Thank you, Grandma.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,792
Come here. Let's eat snacks.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,726
Why did you come home early today? Have you finished your work at school?

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,617
Work at school?

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,840
Oh, yes.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,683
I have already finished it.

28
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,593
Grandma...

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,840
Mom dropped Luke off here?

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,920
She asked us to take care of him because the babysitter just quit.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,570
She said she was busy with her work and whatever.

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,027
Your grandpa frowned since they were at the house door.

33
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:58,053
Lucky enough Aood was here.

34
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,208
He's helping us take care of him.

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,410
I like playing with kids.

36
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,250
When I lived in my old house, I was the leader of the kid's gang.

37
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,440
Yeah.

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,980
He's handsome,

39
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,370
kind-hearted, warm, and loves kids.

40
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,360
Those make such perfect qualifications.

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,810
What a regret. He was born too late.

42
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,100
- Or else, I would have hit on him.
- Wait.

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,720
Bring it down a notch. You're already old.

44
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,863
I don't know when the frustration built up in my mind had gradually faded away.

45
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:31,868
Is it just because I see he gets along well with my little brother?

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,440
Is he adorable?

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,330
Don't you think so?

48
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,665
What's wrong with you? You just said you would have hit on him, didn't you?

49
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:41,690
Why are you now trying to make me interested in him?

50
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,540
I'm not doing that.

51
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,460
I'll hit on him myself.

52
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,540
Right. You beautiful.

53
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,800
Mr. Poon?

54
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,112
Who's that? Let's go check.

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,200
Miss Nee?

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,080
Hello. How did you get here?

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,600
I've just heard that Mr. Poon just got an operation.

58
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,240
Yes.

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,043
I didn't visit him at the hospital.

60
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:07,978
It's all right.

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,200
This is Miss Nee, Grandpa's friend. Do you remember her?

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,793
- Say hi.
- Hello.

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,930
I haven't seen you for ages. You've grown up now.

64
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,640
Have you graduated?

65
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,362
Yes, I have.

66
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,040
Luke, come here.

67
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,570
Come. Say hi.

68
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,060
Hello.

69
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,440
Who is he?

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
Your son?

71
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,240
He looks exactly like a Westerner.

72
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,730
Is that your boyfriend, Pam?

73
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,340
That's such a nonsense guess.

74
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,200
He doesn't look like him.

75
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,126
No, I'm not.

76
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,800
That's Mr. Aood, my neighbor.

77
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,610
This is Luke, my little brother.

78
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,120
Little brother?

79
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,759
Is he your mom's son?

80
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,800
Does that mean she gave birth to him when she was in the USA?

81
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,680
She has a foreign boyfriend. Right?

82
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,637
Well, what she has just said doesn't sound quite nice.

83
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,280
Luke.

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,043
Come feed the fish with me.

85
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:17,529
Let's go.

86
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,920
Please come inside.

87
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,600
Please have a seat. I'll let Poon know you're here.

88
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,726
Let me help you.

89
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,126
Thank you.

90
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,080
He's here.

91
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,420
Hello.

92
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,053
How are you now, Mr. Poon?

93
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:43,426
I still need follow-up care.

94
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,970
The doctor told me to exercise regularly.

95
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,628
And also play with your grandson. Right?

96
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,297
Does your daughter visit you sometimes?

97
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,290
She's really busy with work.

98
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,240
I also haven't seen Parichat for ages.

99
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,860
That's since she was pregnant.

100
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,040
Now, she has another foreign son.

101
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,850
I didn't expect that though.

102
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,949
She didn't ask you guys to take care of him. Right?

103
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,129
If she did, it would be so tiring for you.

104
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,610
Here's your water.

105
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,960
Thank you.

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,130
But it's all right. I'm leaving soon.

107
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:28,960
Really?

108
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,840
I could just drop by for a while.

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,650
I have to go on my errand.

110
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,370
Let's have a meal together when you're free.

111
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,797
Sure.

112
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:45,570
I'm leaving now, so you can get some rest and play with your grandson.

113
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,820
- Goodbye.
- Safe travels.

114
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,518
Are you dating anyone now?

115
00:05:56,912 --> 00:06:01,176
Mr. Poon must be so protective of you. Right?

116
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,420
Don't think I'm educating you.

117
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,093
But when you decide to date someone, you should consider it well.

118
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,045
All right?

119
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,100
I'm leaving.

120
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,540
Goodbye.

121
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,010
She has left a few bombs here before leaving.

122
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,690
Nice.

123
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,960
Pam, don't listen to her.

124
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,160
This is what an elderly is like.

125
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,970
She talks a lot and sticks her nose into other people's business.

126
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,770
All right?

127
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,010
What's wrong?

128
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,450
My chest is a bit tight.

129
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,543
Are you sure it's just a bit? Are you all right?

130
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,330
Why did she have to bring the kid here today? It causes tongues to wag.

131
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,930
She will tell others about this.

132
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,560
I don't like her at all.

133
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,513
If she comes here again, tell her I'm not here.

134
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:54,220
What? You just agreed to have a meal with her, did you not?

135
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,800
Or do you think I should have said, "I won't go!"?

136
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,626
You were afraid to deny it, right? You didn't want to lose face, huh?

137
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:04,440
What are you saying?

138
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,314
You said that with your mouth or what?

139
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,768
What I said is right, isn't it?

140
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,600
Pam, if you date someone,

141
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,326
think it over well enough.

142
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:18,569
I don't want us to be a gossip topic once again.

143
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:21,760
Dating a foreigner is a total no!

144
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:29,140
He can't even be responsible for raising his own child and has to burden others.

145
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,186
All right. Now, he's saying he hates foreigners.

146
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,260
Hey, let me ask you something.

147
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,764
What is it?

148
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,547
Why does Grandpa hate foreigners?

149
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,130
He's not around here. Right?

150
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,620
If he's not here, I'll say it all.

151
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,392
He's not here.

152
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:04,920
It started when your mom moved to another country.

153
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,290
He was worried that your mom wouldn't survive and would have to live off a foreigner.

154
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,530
Also, others kept saying something like, "He didn't raise his daughter well."

155
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,290
"She's a spoiled child." "She became a foreigner's rented wife."

156
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,000
What? Some people still have these thoughts now?

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,720
You have to understand that some people in your society still have that outdated mindset,

158
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,060
including your grandpa.

159
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,640
Hey, it's now the modern era.

160
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,200
They're many mixed-race people out there, and they're good-looking too.

161
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,880
I know, but that's how they are.

162
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,760
They have been living with their old worldviews for more than 70 years.

163
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,130
Their past is longer than their future.

164
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,286
It's not surprising they're not opening up their minds to new changes.

165
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,683
Look at you, Mr. Aood.

166
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:07,300
Let's take a break and drink some water.

167
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,360
Thanks.

168
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,729
A superhero must eat some fruits.

169
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,830
Yummy?

170
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:23,664
Won't you feed me, too?

171
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,040
Then just don't eat it.

172
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,960
Come on. I'll eat.

173
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,020
Here you are.

174
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,860
Yummy?

175
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,650
It's so sweet.

176
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,883
It's as sweet as the person who peeled it.

177
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,063
Grandma did.

178
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,892
My flirting jokes all failed today.

179
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,380
Aood, I want to fly again.

180
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,440
Sure.

181
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,200
Wait.

182
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,720
Don't play so much that you feel drained.

183
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,373
If Luke becomes clingy to you and wants to fly all day,

184
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:07,676
you'll for sure be done for, Mr. Aood.

185
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,780
That's not a problem. I love playing with kids anyway.

186
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,050
I'm just practicing in case I want to have my own kid one day.

187
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,514
Right?

188
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,184
Dad, mom, and son.

189
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,995
Do you want some more?

190
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:41,970
Let's get your energy filled up.

191
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,168
Come here.

192
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,970
Say goodbye to your grandma.

193
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,440
Goodbye, Grandma.

194
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,850
Bye.

195
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,380
If you're free, bring him here again.

196
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,030
I miss him.

197
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,740
You keep spoiling her like this.

198
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,533
That's why she dares burden us.

199
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,320
Why did you come here? Go inside now.

200
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,533
I came to tell her this. Don't be selfish.

201
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:16,028
Don't burden others again.

202
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,200
Don't care about him. He has always been like this.

203
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,906
Aren't you used to it? He's strong-headed.

204
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:28,680
Thank you so much, Mom.

205
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,610
I'm really busy these days.

206
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,320
I'll find him a babysitter as soon as possible, so I don't have to trouble you.

207
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,820
Don't worry.

208
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,420
- Pam is not here?
- She's in the house.

209
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,330
Go talk to her. Do you want to go inside?

210
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,890
Go in.

211
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,940
I'll call and tell her to come here. I don't want to hear dad complain.

212
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,800
- Luke, go with Grandma.
- Come here.

213
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,443
Let's eat snacks while waiting for your mom.

214
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,640
Let's go.

215
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,733
I know about you and Dino.

216
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:11,290
You do?

217
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,120
What do you know?

218
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,800
I know you two are dating.

219
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,100
It feels like Mom already knows everything,

220
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,047
including my private life with him.

221
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,664
I asked Dino, and he told me everything.

222
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,360
Pam, if it's just you and me in this family,

223
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,720
I won't have a problem with it.

224
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,440
But that's not the case now.

225
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,415
I think you know that.

226
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,621
Besides, I think you're too young.

227
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,323
Mom, did you forget that I'm already 24?

228
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:13,180
I've already graduated, and I have a job now.

229
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,120
When I said you're too young,

230
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,640
it's not about your age,

231
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,920
but your life experience.

232
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,323
You haven't been through that much.

233
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,660
And do you even know Dino well enough?

234
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,493
Do you know who he really is?

235
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:30,490
Is he sincere with you?

236
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,756
Can he really take care of your whole life from now on?

237
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,450
You may think that love is the most important thing.

238
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,900
You're just like me.

239
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,660
Before I had you, your grandparents warned me but I didn't listen to them.

240
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,473
I don't want you to end up like me.

241
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,632
I don't want you to regret your actions later.

242
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:03,690
I hurt your grandpa once.

243
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,250
Think about what'll happen if he finds out about you and Dino.

244
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,560
If someone who hates Westerners to the bone like him

245
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,690
finds out that his most beloved granddaughter is dating a Westerner,

246
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,878
will he be okay with it?

247
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,866
You remember that. Right?

248
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:26,073
When he saw me with Dave, he almost didn't survive.

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,871
If it's your doing, don't you think it will be even worse?

250
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,479
I don't want you to date Dino.

251
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,493
Why have they been talking for so long?

252
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,560
They must have something to talk to each other about.

253
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,060
I don't know what it is about because I didn't secretly listen to their conversation.

254
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,740
Why is she interested in her now?

255
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,900
Back then, she left Pam here for over ten years.

256
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,280
Every time she comes, she brings a problem.

257
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,000
Hey. Luke is our grandson, isn't he?

258
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,020
Look at that.

259
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,860
What a mess.

260
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,546
He keeps causing problems. What if I slip and fall?

261
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,220
Come on. Stop being fussy, will you?

262
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,808
Be honest with me. When you were young, you never behaved like this?

263
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,660
I think you must have been stubborn and headstrong.

264
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,657
Or else, you wouldn't have grown old to be like this.

265
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,450
[Oasis Minimart]

266
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:10,685
I don't want us to be a gossip topic once again.

267
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:15,456
If you had to choose between doing things for yourself and your family,

268
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,501
which one would you choose?

269
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,167
Can't those two things go well together?

270
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,400
Let's say they can't.

271
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,609
What we want to do is what our family doesn't like.

272
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,338
They can't accept it. Something like that.

273
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:50,680
Do you know that I graduated with a first-class honors degree in engineering?

274
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,901
When I was an intern, those big companies persuaded me to work with them.

275
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,670
I'm not bragging.

276
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,601
Is that so? Then why...?

277
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,970
Why did I open this minimart?

278
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,060
That's because there're also two things I like.

279
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,093
The first one is talking to machines.

280
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:24,130
The other is talking to people.

281
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,330
When I come across something cutting-edge,

282
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,665
I want to share it with others.

283
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,102
You're confused about why I'm telling you this. Right?

284
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,410
My parents also own a minimart.

285
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,950
That's why they didn't want me to run this shop.

286
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,076
They didn't want me to struggle as they did.

287
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,133
They sent me to study engineering, so I could have a promising career like others do.

288
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,560
When they found out that I have a minimart here,

289
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,060
they scolded me to death.

290
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,880
Every time they see me, they keep telling me to stop doing it.

291
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,020
But I still fight on.

292
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,890
I've run this minimart until it has become a success now.

293
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,440
I don't have to struggle or be tired like they did.

294
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,757
In the end, they already stopped complaining about it.

295
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,320
If they're both what we love,

296
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,779
we don't want to lose any of them. Right?

297
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
You're worried. Right?

298
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,480
About Jessica and me.

299
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,490
I saw you rush back.

300
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,486
I was afraid you would feel bad.

301
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,640
I'm sorry I left in a hurry without telling you.

302
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,280
If I still stood there,

303
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,420
I would have slapped Jessica.

304
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,223
Slap? You would do so?

305
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:15,410
You're strong now, aren't you?

306
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,019
I feel mad thinking about it.

307
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,630
Should I expose her for sexual harassment?

308
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,460
Don't overthink.

309
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,200
I did that because it's my work.

310
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,920
Recently, our couple's popularity has been growing.

311
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,010
That's why I needed to do that.

312
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,217
That's not a big deal for me though. I trust you.

313
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:46,263
But there's a bigger problem now.

314
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,899
Your grandpa?

315
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,000
You don't have to worry about it.

316
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,560
I'm ready to face him,

317
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,222
telling him I'm sincere with you.

318
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,640
It's not that easy.

319
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,601
My grandpa is such a conservative type.

320
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,148
Pam...

321
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,057
what do you want me to do?

322
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,160
Can you not tell others now that we're dating?

323
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:02,380
Dino, don't make that face.

324
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,960
I just need some time.

325
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,283
My grandpa just had an operation.

326
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:11,338
I don't want him to face something that will affect his feelings too much.

327
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:21,426
Just let me know what you want me to do and when you want me to do it.

328
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,909
Thank you.

329
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,902
Say thank you here.

330
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,971
What?

331
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,496
Pam.

332
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:37,036
Say thank you.

333
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:38,561
No.

334
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,770
Though there's an obstacle, and we haven't figured out a solution yet,

335
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:08,870
I believe that love will help us get through if we love each other enough.

336
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,674
How do you like it, Miss Da?

337
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,320
Please look at this before and after photo of you.

338
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,640
Enough, Doctor. I won't look at it anymore.

339
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,240
Please leave.

340
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,900
Hello, Miss Da?

341
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,140
How is it going?

342
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,620
The thing I asked you to do.

343
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,810
I'll follow up on it for you now.

344
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,160
Don't you know I'm waiting?

345
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,660
I know.

346
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,942
I almost forgot that many other factors are still involved.

347
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,307
Our serious relationship has begun.

348
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:49,749
Hey...

349
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,020
Pam.

350
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,400
I said a lot of things to you,

351
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,947
but you didn't think them over at all?

352
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,160
I've grown up already.

353
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,647
Does that mean you've already figured out how to tell your grandpa?

354
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,793
I'll handle it myself.

355
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,126
Be careful. You may regret it later.

356
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,420
You're no longer his manager, junk food.

357
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,803
Why are you here?

358
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:51,801
Are you here to watch him?

359
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,013
Want to know something juicy?

360
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,824
I'll tell you.

361
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,523
Nope.

362
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,493
It's about Donovan.

363
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,400
You want to know, don't you?

364
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,640
Hey, what are you doing?!

365
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,517
Oh, you baby girl.

366
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,595
Oh, baby.

367
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:17,532
Oh, baby.

368
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:19,740
Yes!

369
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,157
Right there, baby.

370
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:22,142
Right there.

371
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:23,829
Yes!

372
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:25,640
Faster, baby. Faster!

373
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,730
Hey!

374
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,720
Enough already. It's disgusting.

375
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,370
Remember this voice and use it.

376
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,690
Dino likes this kind of moan.

377
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,795
A quiet and shy one can't satisfy him enough.

378
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,560
What the heck are you doing?

379
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,592
Your butt is so flat.

380
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,120
It should be like mine. He likes this type.

381
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,900
If you do it well,

382
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,450
he will growl. I remember that well.

383
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,950
Really?

384
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,156
If you're really good at it,

385
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:07,356
why doesn't he feel addicted to you?

386
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,173
Back then, he had to climb the balcony to run away from you.

387
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,283
He's willing to die rather than stay with you.

388
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:16,706
This is already obvious enough, isn't it?

389
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,733
You're good at showing off, but you're not good at using your 'mouth'.

390
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,050
I'll wait for the day he dumps you.

391
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,514
For a person like you, I guess it won't take long.

392
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,260
Keep talking.

393
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,780
I don't feel anything.

394
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:42,372
I only feel that you're disgusting.

395
00:27:44,902 --> 00:27:46,228
Oh, baby!

396
00:27:46,228 --> 00:27:49,133
Yes! Faster, baby!

397
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,200
Miss Pam.

398
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,930
You're leaving early today?

399
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,500
You woke up early too, Mr. Aood.

400
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,240
Grandpa asked me to help fix the fan.

401
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,540
It doesn't cool. I'm fixing it for him.

402
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,759
Thank you so much.

403
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:30,705
Do you know what this is called in English?

404
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,960
Fan.
[Boyfriend/girlfriend]

405
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,313
I don't know when I can use this word with someone around here.

406
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,731
Mr. Aood.

407
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,473
Well,

408
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,840
I already have a boyfriend.

409
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,340
Huh?

410
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,400
Don't tell me it's that model.

411
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,209
It's him.

412
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,610
Don't be confused.

413
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,890
That's the sound of my broken heart.

414
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,800
But don't take it seriously.

415
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,160
I hit on you myself and I'm now heartbroken,

416
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,551
so I guess I must move on by myself, too.

417
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,998
But we can still be friends. Right?

418
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,000
Sure.

419
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,551
We can still be friends.

420
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,060
But I may have to stop myself from flirting with you.

421
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,308
It might be quite difficult, but I must do it.

422
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:01,691
Thank you so much.

423
00:30:05,534 --> 00:30:09,151
Please excuse me.

424
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,914
The moment of love is so sweet and is filled with happiness.

425
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:58,415
I think it's the happiness that nothing can destroy.

426
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,504
Here's the information you asked for.

427
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,529
What would you like me to do now, Miss Da?

428
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:48,560
Do you know what makes people feel the weakest?

429
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,017
It's the feeling of not being able to protect themselves.

430
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,240
Please leave.

431
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,903
Nobody knows that she, who looks like a queen, has low self-esteem.

432
00:32:06,903 --> 00:32:09,740
She is afraid of being denied.

433
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,939
Your life will surely be done for, Donovan.

434
00:32:13,943 --> 00:32:17,000
She hides her fragility deepest inside of her,

435
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,610
and expresses it aggressively to conceal her fear.

436
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:27,352
That's why I do not forebode that before the storm arrives, the sky is always calm.

437
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,153
Pam.

438
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,480
Pam.

439
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,580
Pam.

440
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,052
Are you all right?

441
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,790
Pam.

442
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,300
Pam.

443
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,360
Wake up!

444
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,720
Pam, what's going on?

445
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,467
Who did this to you?

446
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,306
Pam, who did this to you?

447
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:17,986
Pam, wake up!

448
00:33:17,986 --> 00:33:19,029
Pam.

449
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:21,827
You think you can be happy with her?

450
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:30,168
She doesn't know who you really are.

451
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:35,011
What do you think will happen when she finds out the truth?

452
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,962
No!

453
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,810
Dino.

454
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:03,866
Dino!

455
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,880
I'm asking if you want to bring a jacket, too.

456
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,180
No, it's all right.

457
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,120
Is something wrong?

458
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,747
Nothing.

459
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:34,150
How many days are you going?

460
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,955
Two days.

461
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,010
Are you doing a photoshoot or an advertisement shoot?

462
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,135
It's a fashion show.

463
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,138
Who are you going with?

464
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,974
Many models I know are going, too.

465
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,200
Is she going?

466
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,400
She?

467
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,936
Who?

468
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,309
Jessica.

469
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,570
Why?

470
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,420
Are you jealous?

471
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,000
Nope.

472
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,077
I just feel annoyed for you.

473
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,982
That's it? Really?

474
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,110
Yeah.

475
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:43,406
I won't tell you then.

476
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,033
Wait. Why won't you tell me?

477
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,212
Just tell me first...

478
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:56,303
if you're jealous or not.

479
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,680
I don't know.

480
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,286
Tell me now. Hurry up.

481
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,137
Tell me or I won't let you kiss me.

482
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,048
She's not going.

483
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:21,292
Are you sure?

484
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,367
Yes.

485
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:29,384
Can I kiss you now?

486
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,971
You will be away for many days.

487
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,299
I'll miss you a lot for sure.

488
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,360
Wait, Dino.

489
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,370
No.

490
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,466
Not here.

491
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:17,013
We are in a relationship, seeing each other every day.

492
00:37:17,013 --> 00:37:20,780
When we have to be far apart, I can't help thinking of him.

493
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,440
I have something to tell you.

494
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,943
Today, someone hit on me.

495
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,738
Wow! Someone hit on you? Bravo!

496
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,836
Hey! Won't you be jealous a bit, Dino?

497
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,761
Okay, okay. Who hit on you?

498
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,050
A male teacher at school.

499
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,920
He asked me to have a fine dining dinner with him.

500
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,950
Are you going?

501
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,972
Yeah.

502
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,582
Really? Now why would you do that? Huh?

503
00:37:57,582 --> 00:37:59,277
Why are you going?!

504
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,571
Really? Now why would you do that? Huh?

505
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:05,121
Why are you going?!

506
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,140
You're overacting.

507
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,080
Be honest. Okay?

508
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,960
I'm not going.

509
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,843
I'm eating alone now.

510
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:17,796
I'm lonely, and I miss you.

511
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,080
I'm not going.

512
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,930
I'm eating alone now.

513
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,653
I'm lonely, and I miss you.

514
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,520
What are you doing now?

515
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,935
Why are you free to talk to me?

516
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,603
It's my break time. I'm not doing anything.

517
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,660
Hey.

518
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,480
I saw them and thought of you, so I bought them for you.

519
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,680
Your old pair is already worn out.

520
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,603
Yern?

521
00:38:52,603 --> 00:38:54,103
Yern.

522
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,690
Yern.

523
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,490
Yern.

524
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,500
It means damaged, but we just keep it short.

525
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,120
Oh, okay.

526
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,514
How do we spell it in Thai? Can you type and send it to me?

527
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,540
Are you going to sleep now?

528
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,734
What? Are you chasing me away?

529
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:16,867
I only yawned.

530
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,090
Are you going to do something?

531
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:23,600
I just saw you yawn many times.

532
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,733
I guess you're tired.

533
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:28,373
Dino, are you planning to do something bad?

534
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:29,930
Let me know first.

535
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:34,239
Okay. I'll be frank with you.

536
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:39,160
Now, everyone is waiting for me.

537
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,240
There's an after-party here.

538
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,380
That's it.

539
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,560
Are there alcoholic drinks, too?

540
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,920
Don't get too drunk.

541
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,040
I'm a heavy drinker. I don't get drunk easily.

542
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,400
I never see you get drunk.

543
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,500
What is it like when you're drunk?

544
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,530
Talking too much, and a little horny.

545
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,380
No way!

546
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,360
No! Dino!

547
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,767
Relax, Pam. I'm kidding.

548
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,690
I'll go brush my teeth now.

549
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,600
Let me know when the party is over.

550
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,140
I'll be waiting for you.

551
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,440
Bye.

552
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,840
Bye.

553
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,450
Kiss, kiss.

554
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:47,690
What's up, man? How you doing, man?

555
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,600
Hey, baby. Let's take a story.

556
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,755
This party is fucking lame.

557
00:40:51,755 --> 00:40:53,695
You're Ken to my Barbie.

558
00:40:53,695 --> 00:40:55,381
DJ Jama in da house.

559
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:58,130
Let's fucking go!

560
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,830
What?

561
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,577
I thought he said he wasn't going with her.

562
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,266
Her account's set to private.

563
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,996
My trust in him is now being tested.

564
00:41:34,104 --> 00:41:36,487
Drink!

565
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:38,357
Second round.

566
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:42,443
Not even close.

567
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm... I'm going to take a break.

568
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,037
Why don't you play for me over here?

569
00:42:07,037 --> 00:42:08,846
Thank you so much.

570
00:42:16,424 --> 00:42:18,556
Back to you, bro.

571
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,588
Are you drunk already?

572
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,018
A bit.

573
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,635
I'm drunk, too.

574
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,786
You usually can drink more, can't you?

575
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,188
I guess I'm tired today.

576
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:47,540
I'm drunk. Please take me home.

577
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,800
Don't do this.

578
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,060
Today, I'm exhausted too.

579
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,391
I just want to get some rest.

580
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,680
Just rest.

581
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,760
I'll do it for you.

582
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,711
Nobody will see us.

583
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,000
Back then, when you were drunk,

584
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,196
you were so horny.

585
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,059
And now I'm...

586
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:18,436
very, very horny.

587
00:43:19,432 --> 00:43:20,967
Stop it!

588
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:23,671
You don't understand what I said?

589
00:43:29,877 --> 00:43:31,312
Okay.

590
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,750
Sorry.

591
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,782
Hey, what's wrong?

592
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,460
Don't give me a pitying look. That makes me pity myself.

593
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,260
What's wrong with you?

594
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:52,950
I never expected that trying to approach you would make me feel this worthless.

595
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,440
Enough already. I won't dangle around anymore.

596
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,100
Just live your life in whatever way and with whoever you want.

597
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,600
Wait.

598
00:44:03,042 --> 00:44:05,149
Jess, just stop this.

599
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,989
Stop what you are doing. Stop flirting, stop bothering, stop...

600
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:14,004
Stop playing games.

601
00:44:14,004 --> 00:44:15,880
Try to be serious with them.

602
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,901
I got it, okay.

603
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:23,784
You won't forgive me for dumping you for someone else.

604
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:26,739
You want me to hurt like how I hurt you.

605
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:30,214
Well, I'm hurting. Okay?

606
00:44:30,214 --> 00:44:32,558
I'm fucking hurting.

607
00:44:32,558 --> 00:44:35,399
I never told you this before, but...

608
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:38,164
you were the first person I really cared about.

609
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,120
When I came to Thailand,

610
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,120
you showed me everything.

611
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,082
You showed me how to be,

612
00:44:47,082 --> 00:44:50,014
how to talk to people, how to be in this society.

613
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,733
That really meant something.

614
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,224
For a moment...

615
00:44:59,925 --> 00:45:02,263
For a moment, I think I loved you.

616
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,364
But you threw that away.

617
00:45:08,153 --> 00:45:10,840
So if you are hurting now, good.

618
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,722
You deserve it.

619
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,273
I was stupid.

620
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:22,162
I was a slutty teenage bitch.

621
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,839
I'm sorry, okay. I've grown up now.

622
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:34,756
Can you come back to me?

623
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,225
I want to be with you.

624
00:45:39,225 --> 00:45:42,103
You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.

625
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,148
Jess...

626
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,095
It's not going to happen.

627
00:45:59,732 --> 00:46:01,502
I'm sorry.

628
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,177
Fuck it.

629
00:46:08,285 --> 00:46:10,591
Forget everything I said.

630
00:46:13,669 --> 00:46:15,641
At least I tried.

631
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,924
If you're really going back, I'll send you.

632
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,202
This way.

633
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,638
Come.

634
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,740
Seatbelt.

635
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,913
I don't want to go back anymore.

636
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,383
Hey!

637
00:47:27,383 --> 00:47:29,680
What are you doing?

638
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,933
What the hell are you doing?

639
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:34,222
I want to be happy with you.

640
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,850
Did you just pretend to cry?

641
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,360
I didn't.

642
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,500
I'm hurt for real.

643
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,610
But when it hurts, I feel like doing something fun.

644
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,520
You're crazy,

645
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,769
and I'm stupid for trusting you.

646
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:51,733
That's why you are so adorable, baby.

647
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,650
I'm not your lust dump!

648
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,840
If you really want it, go do it with someone else.

649
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,480
I don't want anyone else.

650
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,160
I want you.

651
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,200
That junk food won't know about this if I don't tell her.

652
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,700
Don't play hard to get.

653
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,775
Your thing is wanting me.

654
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,860
You won't end this for real. Right?

655
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,270
How can it end? I haven't started.

656
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,281
If we do this,

657
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,539
this whole thing will end. Okay?

658
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,388
It will, right?

659
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,511
Yeah. It will.

660
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,572
Jessica's dirty words could never hit me hard,

661
00:49:13,413 --> 00:49:16,649
if it's not what's about to happen for real.

662
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:24,040
Are you still in a relationship? Or did you guys already break up?

663
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,920
I saw the post she tagged you.

664
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,427
You said she wasn't going, didn't you?

665
00:49:27,427 --> 00:49:30,680
Or did he get his car washed already?

666
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,400
Last night, the car was pretty dirty.

667
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,650
Be careful.

668
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:39,140
This guy is probably not warm and nice like you thought.

669
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,567
Is there anything else you haven't told me about?

670
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:49,430
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

671
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:53,980
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

672
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:00,000
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

673
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:08,410
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫
