You're meeting up with her for dinner?

00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:03,786
It's about work.

19
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:07,090
I'm your manager. I should have known about it.

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,835
Otherwise, why would you even need me here?

21
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,920
I've also prepared something for you.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,700
My surprise gift for you.

I know what you want from me.

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,840
I can't sleep with you in exchange for the job.

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,346
I'm sorry, Miss Pam.

Mickey is not here.

31
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,120
I have to take care of the store, so I can't take you to eat something delicious.

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,860
I'll cook something yummy for you, then.

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,710
You don't have to, Mr. Aood.

34
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,213
I can just eat those shumai, steamed buns, and sausages.

Anyway,

36

can you tell me already how you calmed Grandpa down?

37
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,800
Give me 200 THB, and I'll tell you.

Fine. I won't listen then.

Come on. I'm just kidding.

At first, he was angry knowing that you did that job,

but when I said this one sentence to him, everything just ended there.

I'm just kidding.

47
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,320
I told him that you just replaced someone else for that job at that time.

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,124
I also said, "Ever since I have started renting Grandpa's house

and have known Miss Pam for many years,

By the way, does he have to shoot in a swimsuit often?

Oh, nope.

00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,800
He usually wears regular clothes like we do.

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,540
Even if he wears something like that, I'm not interested at all.

It looks so yummy.

Not only does it look yummy,

69
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:12,782
but it also tastes incredible.

70
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:15,040
You will go like 'Whoa!' after eating it.

71
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,288
- Because it's hot?
- Because you forgot to blow it first.

72

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,960
what else can I do?

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,693
I can't go that way.

00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:29,580
Enough, Mr. Aood. How wicked.

Eat a lot. You can eat a lot more, Miss Pam.

It's super yummy.

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,480
Right? It comes with cheese, too.

81
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,410
Miss Pam?

82
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,660
Is it so yummy that you have gone absent-minded?

83
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:24,564
- Miss Pam!
- What? What is it?

84
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,870
Oh, yes. It's really yummy.

85
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,360
If it's yummy, then why are you making 'that' face?

86
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Huh?

87
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,346
That Pam's cutie face.

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,640
But I think you should stop that.

You're funny though.

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,767
I'm with him now, but I'm thinking of another guy.

91
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,900
This is not good at all.

92
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,040
Why am I thinking of him?

93
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,900
I guess he must be enjoying dinner now.

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,457
Miss Pam.

95
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,140
It's bleeding.

96
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,960
Do you need some ice? I'll get it for you.

97
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
It's all right.

98
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,008
It should stop bleeding soon.

99
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:18,466
Is something wrong? It looks like you're zoning out.

100
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,927
I'm all right.

101
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,115
Do you want to eat anything else? I'll make it for you.

102

- What about some buns?
- I'm good, Mr. Aood.

103
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:33,280
I can eat this. It's really fine with me.

104
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,302
Please eat a lot.

105
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:37,902
Sure.

106
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,840
What is the meaning of your name?

107
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,680
It's an Irish word, which means darkness.

108
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,080
Wow.

109
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,480
Darkness?

110
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,190
That suits me.

111
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,120
Darkness and stars make a perfect combination.

112
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,884
But if I have to pick a name for you,

113
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:37,113
I'll name you Mr. Google.

114
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,537
Google?

115
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:40,497
Why?

116
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:44,800
It's because you have every answer I'm looking for.

117
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,126
Well then, let me ask... something on Google.

118
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:14,053
What's... your... favorite... food?

119
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,173
No answer?

120
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:23,690
I'll change my question then.

121
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,726
Which... position... do you like?

122
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:52,080
Thank you so much for buying me dinner and ice cream.

123
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,520
It's all right, Miss Pam. It's not a big deal.

124
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,204
But to be honest, I want to treat you to every meal every day.

125
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:09,040
Dude, look at her.

126
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,849
She's carrying heavy stuff. I should go help her.

127
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:12,032
Hi, there.

128
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:14,320
- Can I help you?
- Let go!

129
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,904
Help! Let go!

130
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,800
Help!

131
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,170
Miss Pam?

132
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,960
Are you all right?

133
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,944
It's all right, Miss Pam. I'm already here.

134
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,708
Let's go home.

135
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:38,784
Here you are.

136
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:41,440
What?

137
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,632
You thought I was trying to make you drunk?

138
00:10:43,632 --> 00:10:45,820
I'm not that stupid.

139
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,200
He keeps worrying that she's trying to make him drunk.

140
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
You don't believe me? Let me show you.

141
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:57,607
But he doesn't know there's something else that can also make him drunk.

142
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,480
This drug makes those who inhale it feel euphoric,

143
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,200
- What's wrong?
- ...and drunk.

144
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,323
Have you got a temperature?

145
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:11,200
And arouses a strong sexual desire.

146
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,880
That's right. I said "Inhale," indeed.

147
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,641
Do you feel hot?

148
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,966
Because this woman is cleverer than we could expect.

149
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:20,218
Play in the water with me.

150
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,016
This could be the first time he has tried to take control of his body,

151
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:12,880
giving it an order, but it's not going as expected.

152
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,600
Or shouldn't he hold it back?

153
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,711
Would it be easier for him to just let it go on?

154
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,650
But no matter what, he still owns a strong survival instinct.

155
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,150
No!

156
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,630
You crazy!

157
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,736
Where are you going?

158
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:34,920
Come back here.

159
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,304
I'm telling you to come back here!

160
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,228
Come!

161
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,819
Where are you going?

162
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,230
I got this whole place closed.

163
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:15,930
[My Dear Donovan]

164
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:22,150
Mr. Aood.

165
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,040
Yes?

166
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,112
I'm all right now.

167
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,140
You thought about what happened that day. Right?

168
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,620
The day I wasn't able to help you in time.

169
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,857
I'm so sorry. I really feel bad about it.

170
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,528
It's all right, Mr. Aood.

171
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:40,268
Let bygones be bygones.

172
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,080
But actually, you should have been the one holding my hand...

173
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,686
because I can't see anything.

174
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,780
Are you going to say that love blinds people?

175
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,144
Come on.

176
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:09,664
You stole my joke.

177
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:11,939
What else can I say?

178
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,883
Is something wrong today? You look unwell.

179
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,232
Apart from knowing me well, he can also read my mind.

180
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:28,416
He's right. I miss Donovan because I know where he went,

181
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:32,284
and that makes me quite agitated.

182
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,932
Give me a second.

183
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,060
Sure.

184
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,502
Why is he calling?

185
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,608
Hello?

186
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:57,864
Hey.

187
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,240
Help.

188
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,576
Help me.

189
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:01,840
What's wrong?

190
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,992
I almost can't bear it anymore.

191
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,820
Wait.

192
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,064
What's going on?

193
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:08,440
If it wasn't such a critical situation,

194
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,600
a person like him wouldn't ask for help from others.

195
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,120
I feel something I can't explain.

196
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,002
My body feels hot.

197
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:23,699
Donovan, I'm here.

198
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,320
Hey, that's such a sweet voice. Are you calling to prank me?

199
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,824
I was worried.

200
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:34,070
Please rush here.

201
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,540
I really can't bear it any longer.

202
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,960
You're having fun discussing work with Miss Dararai, aren't you?

203
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,670
Why did you ask me to go there?

204
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,748
I have been drugged.

205
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:46,400
What?

206
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,710
Hey, get me out of here.

207
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,196
Wait. Where? Where are you now?

208
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:55,296
I'm at the hotel.

209
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:57,512
The hotel where you discussed work with Miss Da?

210
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,012
Yes.

211
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,689
I'm telling you to open the door!

212
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:04,264
Where are you? How can I get there correctly?

213
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,260
I'll send you the location.

214
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,711
Okay. Hurry here!

215
00:16:23,877 --> 00:16:24,960
Mr. Aood!

216
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,280
Please help, Mr. Aood.

217
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,290
Donovan will die for sure.

218
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,712
Calm down first, Miss Pam. What's going on?

219
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:37,030
Donovan was drugged.

220
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,472
Please accompany me, Mr. Aood.

221
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:41,300
He's sending me the location.

222
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,396
- Let's go.
- Wait, Miss Pam. How do we go?

223
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:46,240
Why don't we drive?

224
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,728
You're right. The car.

225
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,000
We must drive.

226
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,160
Should we drive my car or yours?

227
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,890
Your car. I'll drive for you.

228
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,320
All right.

229
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,064
- Let's go.
- Wait, Miss Pam.

230
00:16:56,064 --> 00:16:57,720
The car is over there.

231
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,020
Right.

232
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,636
Donovan, where are you?

233
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,729
Are you in this room?

234
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,936
You're not.

235
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,192
What about this one?

236
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:23,990
Do you want to play hide and seek?

237
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:31,868
You're not in here.

238
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:35,110
What about this one?

239
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,748
Or... this one?

240
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,140
I already know where you are.

241
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,880
Open the door for me, please.

242
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,390
You won't?

243
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,832
You're here. Right?

244
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:12,220
I see you now.

245
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,244
Open the door!

246
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,900
Open it now!

247
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,556
Open it!

248
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,580
Open it now!

249
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,080
Open it!

250
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,652
I told you to open the door.

251
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:33,970
You won't?

252
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,870
Fine.

253
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,120
I'm here.

254
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,460
Where are you going?

255
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,876
Where?

256
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:03,988
Where are you going?

257
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,288
Where are you going?

258
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:25,671
Don't stop, Mr. Aood. Go.

259
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:29,103
- We won't make it, Miss Pam.
- We will. Hurry up. Faster.

260
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,970
Mr. Aood, turn right.

261
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,807
- Here?
- Yes. Turn right.

262
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:46,050
- Go straight.
- Straight, right?

263
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,048
- Which way do we go now?
- Go straight first.

264
00:19:57,048 --> 00:19:58,665
- All right.
- Here.

265
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,143
- Turn left over there, Mr. Aood.
- Here?

266
00:20:01,143 --> 00:20:02,420
We've arrived.

267
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,700
Yes. This is the right place.

268
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,948
Stop!

269
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:14,843
He's there. Follow him!

270
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:42,192
15.

271
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,400
May I know if you have a key card, please?

272
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,430
We're here to see our friend.

273
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,832
This floor is private. You're not allowed inside if you weren't invited.

274
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:54,480
My friend, Donovan, called us.

275
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,560
He said there's something very important, so we must go to see him.

276
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,760
We'll go together.

277
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,828
- You're not allowed inside without an invitation.
- Hey. Don't you have any other words to say?

278
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,659
I have to ask both of you to leave, please.

279
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,224
Come on, bro.

280
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,928
We can just take it easy, can't we?

281
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:11,648
Also, we are not doing anything wrong.

282
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:16,940
We're just here to see our friend, who looks like a westerner.

283
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,570
He is, indeed, a westerner, though. I think you know that. Right?

284
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,910
I really can't let you in.

285
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,360
Please leave.

286
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,040
The faster I want to go, the longer it takes.

287
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,120
The more I want to help, the more problems arrive.

288
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,064
What's all this fuss about?

289
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:38,504
- What should we do?
- Yes.

290
00:21:38,504 --> 00:21:40,415
I'm coming.

291
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,140
- Miss Pam.
- Mr. Aood.

292
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:48,624
Let's go!

293
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,240
Mr. Aood, why can't I press on the floor we're going to?

294
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,867
I think it's a private floor. We need a key card.

295
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,776
Let's try this.

296
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:10,120
I'll try pressing each of them and see which floor we can access.

297
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,920
Then, we use a fire exit on that floor.

298
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,620
All right.

299
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,404
Hey, this one works.

300
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,670
[My Dear Donovan]

301
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,600
[My Dear Donovan]

302
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,049
He's trying to calm down the burning desire inside his body

303
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:48,088
by using every defensive instinct he owns.

304
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:51,071
He's changing it into his strength to survive.

305
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,344
Miss Pam, why don't we call the police?

306
00:22:57,344 --> 00:23:01,120
He's right. Usually, citizens like us can rely on the police. Right?

307
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,230
That's right. Police.

308
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,697
But I think they won't make it in time. It's faster to come and help him on our own.

309
00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:11,300
Also, we can't be sure if they will come or not.

310
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,350
We've arrived.

311
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:29,854
Miss Pam, that's a fire exit.

312
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,352
Miss Pam, I think the sound is from over there.

313
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:40,652
Right.

314
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,480
Hey, what are you doing?! Stop!

315
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,072
Pam!

316
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,040
Hey?!

317
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,670
Hey!

318
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,290
Hey!

319
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,320
Hey, are you all right?

320
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,180
Please get me out of here.

321
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,200
Mr. Aood, please help carry him.

322
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,230
Be careful.

323
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:46,080
- Are you all right?
- The elevator button, Miss Pam.

324
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,780
Okay.

325
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:52,852
Where are you guys going?!

326
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,296
Come take responsibility now!

327
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:59,210
Gosh. Speak of the devil.

328
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,880
This looks like a scene from a zombies movie.

329
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,320
Don't come close. I'm recording a video here.

330
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,146
If you step any closer, the whole world will see you like that.

331
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,436
It's arrived.

332
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:14,249
Don't come close.

333
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,920
Don't.

334
00:27:23,984 --> 00:27:25,484
Open!

335
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,090
Mr. Aood, you're so clever.

336
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,130
You recorded her video with your phone.

337
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,600
There's no way we can get CCTV footage from here.

338
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,480
It was so loud, but nobody came to see what was happening.

339
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,270
It's obvious all of them here are her men.

340
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,976
- Let's hurry out of here.
- Yes.

341
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,040
Why did you come?

342
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,840
To help you.

343
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,740
I didn't ask for your help. I asked Pam.

344
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,152
Are you saying I'm nosy?

345
00:27:59,032 --> 00:27:59,896
Yes.

346
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:01,360
Hey, wait. Stop.

347
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,843
Stop! Hey!

348
00:28:03,843 --> 00:28:07,367
Mr. Aood was with me when you called and asked for help.

349
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,920
Mr. Aood, I don't know where the car key is.

350
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:17,624
The key?

351
00:28:17,624 --> 00:28:19,640
It's here.

352
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,640
What's wrong with you?

353
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:27,740
Feel burning hot all over my body.

354
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,976
I forgot to mention that this drug's effect lasts for several hours.

355
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:32,936
Hey!

356
00:28:32,936 --> 00:28:35,460
- Let's hurry up. Here you are.
- Yes.

357
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,560
- Let's go.
- Hey!

358
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,400
What are you doing?!

359
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,360
I'm sorry.

360
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,920
Hey, I'm trying to help you.

361
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,600
I'm really sorry.

362
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,020
The drug makes me... horny.

363
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,944
Miss Pam, you'd better drive.

364
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:03,951
- I'll sit in the back.
- Yes.

365
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,763
Let's go, Miss Pam.

366
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,600
Hey, what are you doing?

367
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,316
What's going on, Mr. Aood?

368
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,024
Well, he's just taking his phone out.

369
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:38,900
I see.

370
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,240
[I know where you live.]

371
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,283
I can't go back to my room.

372
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:47,240
Miss Da texted me, saying that she knows where I live.

373
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,708
Where will you go then?

374
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,960
Just drop me off at your mom's office.

375
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,216
Nonsense. Look at you now. How can I leave you alone?

376
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,024
Let's go to my house.

377
00:30:04,024 --> 00:30:08,896
Miss Pam, won't Grandpa blame you?

378
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,379
Mr. Aood, since he's like that now,

379
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:14,024
I think Grandpa will understand the situation.

380
00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:16,820
I think he won't.

381
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,540
All right. Let's go to my house then.

382
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,024
Oh, thank you so much.

383
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:24,590
Yeah.

384
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,810
Let's go.

385
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,152
I'm thirsty. Do you have some water?

386
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:29,310
Water?

387
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,764
It's in the back. Please look for it, Mr. Aood.

388
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,666
I found it.

389
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,300
Here you are.

390
00:30:41,488 --> 00:30:43,384
Are you guys all right? I'm sorry.

391
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:45,533
There's a big hole.

392
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,890
How wicked this drug is.

393
00:30:53,616 --> 00:30:55,390
Hey, what's wrong with you?

394
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,040
Mr. Aood, is everything all right?

395
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,620
- He touched my ear.
- Huh?

396
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,510
Miss Pam!

397
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,010
To the left!

398
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,440
I didn't see that.

399
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,400
It's all right, Miss Pam. Just continue driving.

400
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,400
What are you doing?

401
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,968
Mr. Aood, are you all right?

402
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,850
Yes.

403
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm not hugging you.

404
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,857
I'm putting a seatbelt on for you.

405
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,544
Let's go, Miss Pam.

406
00:31:24,544 --> 00:31:25,744
Yes.

407
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,699
Miss Pam, floor it!

408
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:33,823
Sure!

409
00:31:36,816 --> 00:31:38,940
Hey! Don't!

410
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,412
- Miss Pam, go!
- I'm accelerating, Mr. Aood.

411
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:46,112
Hey, are you all right?

412
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,544
Hey. Should I just leave you here and let mosquitos bite you, huh?

413
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,311
Let me help.

414
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,049
Hey.

415
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,000
What's wrong with you?

416
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,294
The drug is still active.

417
00:32:09,504 --> 00:32:10,904
Hey!

418
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,192
Miss Pam!

419
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:18,047
Miss Pam!

420
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,073
Hey, pull yourself together!

421
00:32:23,073 --> 00:32:25,013
What are you doing to Mr. Aood?!

422
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,030
Mr. Aood, help me.

423
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,820
What should we do?

424
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,270
No idea.

425
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,900
- Miss Pam.
- Pam, come here.

426
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,769
Are you okay?

427
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,850
Yeah.

428
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,205
One more time.

429
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,720
[My Dear Donovan]

430
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,650
[My Dear Donovan]

431
00:33:08,584 --> 00:33:09,992
Come.

432
00:33:09,992 --> 00:33:13,620
Spray water on me. It could work.

433
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,160
Let's do it.

434
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,450
Are you sure?

435
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,460
Yes.

436
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,472
Hurry up. Let's do it.

437
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,200
Great.

438
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,232
Come on.

439
00:33:32,232 --> 00:33:34,603
More. Harder.

440
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:38,780
Like this.

441
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,576
Though he's in a terrible condition now, he still looks good.

442
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:47,670
He looks really good. How can he do that?

443
00:33:53,384 --> 00:33:55,600
Miss Pam?

444
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,493
Why are you here?

445
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,580
I just came to check.

446
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,020
I was afraid you couldn't handle him, Mr. Aood.

447
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,574
I can. I'm all right.

448
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,710
Hey.

449
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,020
Hey. Are you all right?

450
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,328
What's that look in your eyes?

451
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:36,486
You still feel it, don't you?

452
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,280
I'm all right now.

453
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,095
I'm okay.

454
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,670
Are you sure?

455
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,692
Yeah.

456
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:51,029
Let's continue.

457
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:00,889
I'll make it soft then.

458
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,900
You're still up?

459
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,238
Here's some tea.

460
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:50,646
Hey, let's be frank.

461
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:54,416
What's the relationship between Pam and you?

462
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,430
Me?

463
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,255
If you want to know, then I'll tell you.

464
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,800
I'm the person Miss Pam trusts the most.

465
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,944
She talks to me about everything.

466
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:14,744
Everything?

467
00:36:15,837 --> 00:36:17,337
Why?

468
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,800
Did she tell you that she talked to me on the phone last night until she fell asleep?

469
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:29,072
We talked about several things.

470
00:36:29,072 --> 00:36:31,024
Her favorite color.

471
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,103
Her favorite food.

472
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:34,280
How she became a kindergarten teacher.

473
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,207
She also sang me a song.

474
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:44,150
That's normal, isn't it?

475
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,100
The model's manager must talk to the model.

476
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,000
There's nothing special about it.

477
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,340
Also, it's not that important, so there's no need for her to tell me.

478
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,020
If thinking that way makes you feel at ease, then go ahead.

479
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,720
You just talked to her a bit, but you're bragging now?

480
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,512
Let me tell you this.

481
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:12,640
I'm allowed into her house 24 hours,

482
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,240
and I'm very close to her grandma.

483
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,632
Grandma has already allowed me to hit on her granddaughter.

484
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,520
What a regret I didn't record her voice.

485
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,840
If I did, I could show it to you.

486
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,680
You have to ask for permission just to talk to Pam.

487
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,960
I don't have to ask anyone for permission.

488
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,648
These days, Pam always sticks with me.

489
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,880
This is a Thai culture, you know.

490
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,736
When we want to hit on others' daughters or granddaughters,

491
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,736
we should ask for adults' permission.

492
00:37:45,736 --> 00:37:49,770
If they don't allow us to, then we can't do so.

493
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,120
A foreigner like you...

494
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,632
has no chance.

495
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,464
Pam's grandpa really hates your kind.

496
00:38:01,464 --> 00:38:04,960
He hates them like poison.

497
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,408
Also, Miss Pam loves her grandpa a lot.

498
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,320
I bet she will never displease him.

499
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,855
She's working with you now because she needs money for Grandpa's treatment.

500
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:28,091
Since you have already heard everything, you should know by now that you have no chance.

501
00:38:32,912 --> 00:38:34,488
Hey? What?

502
00:38:34,488 --> 00:38:36,394
Are you trying to get physical?

503
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,048
Don't.

504
00:38:46,552 --> 00:38:48,352
No.

505
00:38:49,264 --> 00:38:51,224
I'm going to sleep.

506
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,800
Is he sleepy already?

507
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,477
Are you not coming inside?

508
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,612
It's more comfortable here.

509
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,469
As you wish.

510
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,968
Do you need anything else? If you don't, I'll go to bed now.

511
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,200
Please go to bed.

512
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,560
I'm all right. Don't worry about me.

513
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,180
I'm not worried about you.

514
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,240
If it wasn't because of Miss Pam, I wouldn't even care about you.

515
00:40:47,496 --> 00:40:49,360
Please help, Mr. Aood.

516
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,632
Donovan will die for sure.

517
00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:54,360
Don't stop, Mr. Aood. Go.

518
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,817
- We won't make it, Miss Pam.
- We will. Hurry up. Faster.

519
00:40:56,817 --> 00:41:04,020
♫ I don't know why I remember everything ♫

520
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,425
Hey. What are you doing?

521
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:15,344
Don't move. Stay still.

522
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:18,280
It's just walking barefoot.

523
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,980
I'll be fine.

524
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:26,360
♫ The memory of how much we loved each other ♫

525
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:33,407
♫ is what I can never erase, no matter how much I want to ♫

526
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,640
Who is Maria?

527
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,936
She's my older sister.

528
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,420
Thank you so much.

529
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,000
♫ What do I do when I can't forget I love you? ♫

530
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,840
♫ I wish I hadn't met you ♫

531
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,870
♫ If I could turn back time ♫

532
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,030
♫ I wouldn't look into your eyes ♫

533
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,630
♫ And let you give my heart butterflies ♫

534
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:05,630
♫ It'd be better if we didn't know each other... ♫

535
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,496
♫ because it's too hard to forget you ♫

536
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:20,456
I bought some congee for you.

537
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:21,760
For both of you.

538
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,020
Miss Pam, you also remember that I don't like livers.

539
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,900
Well, the store told me they ran out of livers.

540
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,808
You kept saying you didn't want to do this job,

541
00:42:31,808 --> 00:42:33,520
but you tried to get close to him!

542
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,600
You went beyond the limit of your responsibility. That's why things have gone too far up to now!

543
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,120
Take this. And you don't have to do this job anymore.

544
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,680
I really pity myself now.

545
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,200
Feel free to cry, Miss Pam. No one can see you now.

546
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,970
♫ Who said that I'm so hot? ♫

547
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,520
♫ Sorry, if my hair looks too hot ♫

548
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,540
♫ What, a womanizer? It's not true!
(Don't believe it, don't believe what he says) ♫

549
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:59,650
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

550
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:04,320
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

551
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:10,340
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

552
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:17,620
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫

553
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:31,470
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

554
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:38,700
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫

555
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:47,050
♫ Don't get me wrong, wrong, wrong  ♫
