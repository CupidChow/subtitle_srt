1
00:00:04,978 --> 00:00:06,530
He's American.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,207
I want you to be his interpreter, Pam.

3
00:00:10,197 --> 00:00:11,550
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,546
Donovan, isn't it?

5
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,080
You look better in real life than in photos.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,720
If I'd known you'd be doing this too, I wouldn't have come.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,844
Don't cross the line.

8
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:19,223
What's going on between those two?

9
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:21,815
They're close friends who just behave like Westerners.

10
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,901
And we have dinner with her at 8:00 p.m. She wants to treat us.

11
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,200
Would you like to go to dinner with me?

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,106
She wants to talk to you, not me.

13
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:30,410
She's staying at the beach tonight.

14
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,533
At the beach?

15
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:31,670
Come up!

16
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:35,580
Hey, what the heck are you doing?

17
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,060
Pull me up first.

18
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,660
Come here.

19
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:55,546
You pervert! What are you doing?

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
Wait.

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,458
Who are you running away from?

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,766
What happened?

23
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:21,913
You were having dinner downstairs, weren't you?

24
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:25,911
I already did that perfunctorily.

25
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:29,356
Wait. You know the word perfunctorily?

26
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:31,622
It started with dinner.

27
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:33,844
[90 minutes ago]

28
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,781
Let's eat in a hurry and leave.

29
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,356
I don't want to stay here long.

30
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,320
It won't take long. Just for a while.

31
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,815
Just do it perfunctorily.

32
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:44,130
What does that mean?

33
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,723
It means we just have dinner to socialize.

34
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:51,280
We're not eating to get full. We just show up to let her see us.

35
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:14,391
Have you been waiting for long?

36
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,650
Move the chair for her.

37
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,745
Thank you.

38
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:45,610
How lovely you are.You have been waiting for me.

39
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,870
What a gentleman.

40
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,040
Punctuality has nothing to do with being a gentleman.

41
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,338
It's what we should always do.

42
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:56,030
You have a good attitude, too.

43
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,670
Since you're this nice, I've prepared a gift for you.

44
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,440
Here you are.

45
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,360
I want you to use my perfume, Donovan.

46
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,520
But I can't choose one, so I'm bringing many of them.

47
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,026
Let's try.

48
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:20,607
Let's try this scent since we're having a luxury dinner today.

49
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,020
This one.

50
00:04:29,507 --> 00:04:31,427
It smells good though.

51
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:34,781
Hey, she just sprayed perfume on you.

52
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,873
Did you have to run away like this?

53
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:38,546
It's not only that.

54
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:42,868
I'm definitely going to bring you here one day.

55
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,183
Wait a minute.

56
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,193
It suits you well.

57
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:51,135
Try smelling it.

58
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:55,683
Don't even think about it, bitch.

59
00:04:57,655 --> 00:04:59,155
All right.

60
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:02,220
Well, let's try the second one.

61
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,440
This scent is many people's favorite.

62
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,687
It's kind of...

63
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,701
Are you guys hanging out?

64
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,993
I'm kind of bored now, too.

65
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,969
I only invited the people I want to talk to.

66
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:18,003
But this is a restaurant.

67
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:20,055
Everyone can be here.

68
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,427
Excuse me?

69
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:26,907
Please bring me Double Whiskey Neat and one more set of cutlery.

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,930
What are you guys doing?

71
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,840
Are you selling perfumes?

72
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,343
I'm not selling.

73
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:37,365
I feel pleased, so I'm giving them to him for free.

74
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:38,823
Let's go with this scent then.

75
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:44,978
I think it smells like a sailor in need of love.

76
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,722
Here you are.

77
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,181
Oh my gosh.

78
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:52,670
What is this?

79
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,964
Is this a Tangke boat sailor love mantra or what?

80
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:57,393
You like something salty, don't you?

81
00:05:57,393 --> 00:05:59,763
If I didn't ask you,

82
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:02,163
then there's no need for you to say anything.

83
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:04,835
I have another scent that I want you to try.

84
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:08,130
This is Fine Gentleman scent,

85
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,218
and it suits those who prefer something classic.

86
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:15,444
It feels like you're coming out of an old-school barbershop on the upper east side.

87
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,711
I think it suits you well.

88
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,296
Are you imagining things on your own?

89
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:22,215
Oh, my god.

90
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:27,401
It smells like an old man wearing a lot of hair oil.

91
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:32,000
It's not surprising to me though since you have such poor taste.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,722
I guess you don't understand a master level of perfume knowledge.

93
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:40,755
I don't even need to have any taste to know that the scent that suits you

94
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:44,132
is something like Thai traditional scented water or herbal medicine.

95
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:46,977
Please excuse me.

96
00:06:46,977 --> 00:06:48,909
I'll go to the restroom.

97
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,143
I'll go with you.

98
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:52,681
Jess, sit down.

99
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:56,192
Your drink is here. Stay and drink with me first.

100
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,188
We have so many dishes.

101
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:13,375
I'm back in my room already. Find an excuse for me.

102
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,033
I'm back in my room already. Find an excuse for me.

103
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:28,660
Well, Donovan said he wants to take some rest for now.

104
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,938
He has a headache. He's feeling unwell.

105
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:38,250
I guess he was annoyed by an uninvited guest.

106
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,950
It's obvious who made him feel annoyed.

107
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:46,478
Or is he having a headache because of your perfume?

108
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:50,070
You ruined it.

109
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,647
- Mr. Pete.
- Yes?

110
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:54,150
Please enjoy. It's on me.

Wait.

113

How long are we going to stay like this?

114
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:09,883
Move.

115

I know you're in there.

If you don't open the door, I can still go inside anyway

124
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:14,063
because I have a keycard with me.

125
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:17,266
Don't play hard to get, baby. Open the door.

I'm coming in.

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,680
Wait.

She's here.

Don't open the door.

Open the door.

Hey, if we don't open it,

she will keep knocking all night.

143
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:30,620
Just tell her that you didn't see me.

What are you talking about? You're sitting here.

145

- Just lie to her.
- No. I don't like lying.

146
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:39,598
It's up to you then.

147
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:42,604
What?

148
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,907
What took you so long? What have you been doing, huh?

149
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:47,132
Have you seen Donovan?

Well, Donovan...

151
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:50,640
I know he's back in his room.

152
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,380
I went inside to check, but he was not there.

Where is he?

I don't know anything.

How can you not know? Your room is next to his.

A whole person has disappeared.

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,326
You're his manager, aren't you?

163
00:11:14,326 --> 00:11:16,840
I'm not. I'm his interpreter. I'll go to bed. I'm sleepy.

164
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,149
I don't care about your position. Call him now.

00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:27,811
I don't know. Oh, I mean he's not here.

170
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,458
- Hey!
- Babe?

171
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,327
Babe, are you here?

172
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:34,827
Babe?

173
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,246
What's wrong?

174
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,400
You ran away from me to... be with this girl?

175
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,760
Oh, my god.

176
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,043
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

177
00:11:58,043 --> 00:11:59,890
What the hell?

178
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,608
You shouldn't insult her like that.

179
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:05,025
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

180
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:08,240
Sometimes, I want to try something weird too.

181
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,727
Sometimes, it's tasty,

182
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:12,687
but sometimes, it's tasteless.

183
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:14,277
Great food is like great sex, you know?

184
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:16,160
The more you have, the more you want.

185
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,121
But this?

186
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,831
Junk food!

187
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,987
What? Junk food?

188
00:12:22,987 --> 00:12:24,720
Have you ever tried it?

189
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,870
What are you playing, huh?

190
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,920
Why didn't you tell her we didn't do that thing?

191
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,755
She wouldn't listen anyway. She chose to believe what she saw.

192
00:12:39,755 --> 00:12:42,844
She went into your room. What are you going to do?

193
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:46,420
Well, I probably can't return to my room tonight.

194
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,820
Oh? Then where will you sleep tonight?

195
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:55,216
Wait.

196
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:57,606
If not here, then where can I stay?

197
00:12:57,606 --> 00:12:58,835
Well...

198
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:00,781
I said that before, didn't I?

199
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:05,095
In the end, I have never learned to say no to anyone.

200
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:07,624
It's true I'm already 24,

201
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:13,446
but to be honest, I have never slept in the same room with any guy.

202
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:16,166
What's worse is that I have only known him for one day.

203
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,746
Just thinking about it stresses me out already.

204
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,250
[My Dear Donovan]

205
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,800
You don't have to be that scared.

206
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,834
I won't look.

207
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:47,090
Wearing no bra is just normal for Americans.

208
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,420
Saying that means you already looked.

209
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,543
I didn't intend to, and I didn't think anything about it at all.

210
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,138
That's not fine!

211
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:54,726
It's not fine even if you said so.

212
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:58,332
It's not your fault at all. I must control myself to not look at your boobs.

213
00:13:58,332 --> 00:13:59,526
Hey!

214
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:03,469
Why did you say it so straightforwardly? You didn't have to say that.

215
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:05,195
Take it easy.

216
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,420
Does the steak taste good?

217
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,320
It's nice.

218
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,817
You ordered it for me. Right?

219
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:20,637
I saw that you didn't eat anything.

220
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:26,895
I'm sorry for having given you a headache all day.

221
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,540
I'll just sleep there.

222
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,660
Don't care about me. You can do whatever you want.

223
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,004
How can I sleep while someone else is also here?

224
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,072
I give you another hour, babe.

225
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,780
What?

226
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,941
How could I fall asleep?

227
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,590
What?

228
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,761
He went back to his room already, didn't he?

229
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:46,660
Oh, my goodness!

230
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,150
Hey. You scared me.

231
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,028
Why are you standing in the dark?

232
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:55,120
Why did you wake up?

233
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,480
I thought you went back to your room already.

234
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,150
Hey?

235
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,823
Hey.

236
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,274
Are you all right?

237
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,590
Hurry, get out of here!

238
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,346
I don't know what I did that reminds him of that thing.

239
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:32,964
But sometimes, we recall our past memory not because something has just hurt us.

240
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:36,480
It's rather because that memory is our trauma.

241
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,589
I usually can't sleep well.

242
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,920
Since it's not my usual place, it's even more difficult.

243
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:48,592
I thought you already went back to your room.

244
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,933
I think Jessica is still there.

245
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,230
Don't you want to get famous?

246
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,587
Now is your chance.

247
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,166
It's a win-win.

248
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,053
Apart from hating to lie, I'm also nosy.

249
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:17,340
Can I ask you something?

250
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,152
Why do you want to be famous?

251
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,197
Everyone wants to be famous.

252
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:29,833
But what you do is strange.

253
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:30,960
How?

254
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,552
You said you ran away from dinner.

255
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:37,015
And you looked...

256
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,060
I'm sorry to say this, but it looks like you're against socializing.

257
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,220
It seems you don't want anyone to get involved with you. That's why it's like a contrast.

258
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,015
I think if you want to be famous, you must get to know more people.

259
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:50,480
I don't want to know anyone.

260
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,890
I just want many people to know me.

261
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:58,656
What is the difference?

262
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:01,093
For me, it's different.

263
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,122
Don't be curious.

264
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,700
Well, I don't know about the nature of where you grew up in.

265
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,904
But here, you must have more human relations.

266
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:15,187
I don't like talking to others.

267
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,800
If you don't, then you can just smile,

268
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,290
so your face won't look this serious.

269
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,663
Smile like this.

270
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,710
A hearty smile?

271
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,850
What? You know this word?

272
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,640
I'm starting to wonder.

273
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,621
If your Thai is this good, why did you hire me as your interpreter?

274
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:38,510
I don't want an interpreter.

275
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,086
I want a manager.

276
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,140
What?

277
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,901
She asked me to be your interpreter.

278
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:46,300
She's paying me 5,000 THB a day. That's why I came.

279
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,341
Is that so?

280
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:48,541
Yeah.

281
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,430
Oh, that's why.

282
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,615
That's why I had to accompany you to many places and was in charge of many things.

283
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:02,916
I was tricked?

284
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,343
Gosh!

285
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,255
But don't worry.

286
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:11,280
I won't stay and annoy you for long.

287
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,380
After this job is done, I'll leave.

288
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,940
What are you going to do?

289
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,731
I'll do my job.

290
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:21,566
I'm a teacher.

291
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:23,080
Teaching English?

292
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,526
Yeah. How did you know?

293
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:27,458
You have a good accent. It's easy to guess.

294
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,316
Not really.

295
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:31,260
I only teach kindergarten students.

296
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,105
I teach them simple phonetics. Sometimes, I teach them singing

297
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:36,880
and just some basic vocabulary.

298
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,040
Does that mean you love kids?

299
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,439
Not really.

300
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:48,933
It's not that I love kids.

301
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,007
But it's more because I like the moment when parents come to pick their kids up.

302
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,407
Why?

303
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,961
When I see them hug, I feel so good.

304
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:11,284
When the kids see their parents come to pick them up,

305
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:14,818
they run all the way, jump towards them and hug them.

306
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:17,980
It looks so genuine. I can feel it.

307
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,391
It's not pretentious.

308
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:26,618
It gives me such positive energy.

309
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,860
Well, to be honest,

310
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,620
I think...

311
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:56,186
I'm kind of envious of those kids.

312
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,166
I think I'm sleepy now.

313
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,181
I yawned too much that my eyes got teary.

314
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,390
I'll go to bed.

315
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,890
Goodnight.

316
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,878
Here you are.

317
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:15,467
Warm milk for a good sleep.

318
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,040
Thank you.

319
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,410
I'm going in.

320
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,470
[My Dear Donovan]

321
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,490
[Thank you Pam :)]

322
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,700
[Thank you Pam :)]

323
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,800
Oh babe, you are back.

324
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,352
I waited for a night. I missed you.

325
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:09,830
What the hell are you doing, Jess?

326
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,218
Why are you here, Pete?

327
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:12,960
Where is Donovan?

328
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,029
This is my room!

329
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,600
You got me sobered up. What the heck?

330
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,900
What time is it now?

331
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,040
Jess, it's late now.

332
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,710
You have a product shoot today.

333
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,023
Okay.

334
00:24:29,023 --> 00:24:31,115
- Yuck!
- Hurry up and take a shower.

335
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,984
In this past one day and one night, so many things came into my life,

336
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:03,320
and there's no way I will forget about them.

337
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,190
But from now, I think I won't see him again.

338
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,135
I admit to feeling a bit of regret though.

339
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:13,078
He's kind of interesting.

340
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,440
After this job is done, I have to go back and talk to mom.

341
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,175
Why did she lie to me?

342
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,070
[PARIE Modeling]

343
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:41,581
Mom, why didn't you tell me the truth?

344
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,181
What?

345
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:46,498
He said he wants a manager,

346
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:48,461
but you asked me to be his interpreter.

347
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,190
And this job was just a mess.

348
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,643
Nobody told me I had to stay overnight.

349
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:53,390
I didn't prepare any spare clothes.

350
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,448
What's worse is I don't know how to tell Grandpa and Grandma about this.

351
00:25:57,448 --> 00:26:00,276
Just tell them you worked with me.

352
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:02,426
Do you think they will be fine with that?

353
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:04,208
How will you tell them then?

354
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,400
Just forget about it.

355
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,910
But don't give me this kind of job anymore. I won't do it.

356
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,560
All right. I'm sorry I didn't tell you all about it.

357
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,386
I thought you could handle him, so I asked you to go.

358
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,240
I'll pay you 10,000 THB then.

359
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,272
I'll transfer now.

360
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,410
Mom, be frank with me.

361
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,630
Is there anything else you haven't told me about?

362
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,510
Done. You can check.

363
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,960
Have you come up with an idea of what to buy for your grandpa?

364
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,316
I think I'll buy a tablet for him.

365
00:26:37,316 --> 00:26:40,100
Oh, is that amount enough then? I'll give you more.

366
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,760
It's all right, Mom.

367
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,410
I'll pay the rest.

368
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,984
See you at his birthday dinner.

369
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,360
Sa, you shocked me.

370
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,822
Whoa, you're here finally.

371
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:09,980
Aood helped handle grandpa for you.

372
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,578
Is Grandpa okay with it?

373
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,045
See? He's coming.

374
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:18,970
Look at that pouty face.

375
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,900
Why didn't you tell us in advance that you would stay overnight there, Pam?

376
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,575
I told you already that she told me,

377
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:29,040
but I forgot to tell you.

378
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,840
Grandpa, it happened unexpectedly for real.

379
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,360
I didn't think it would be like this.

380
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,659
From now, I'll tell you about everything.

381
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:52,923
Don't sulk about it.

382
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,220
I don't like you staying overnight somewhere else.

383
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,960
No matter how late, just let me know. I'll wait.

384
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,620
It worries me when you stay overnight somewhere else.

385
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,220
Did you know I couldn't sleep?

386
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,935
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

387
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:20,246
I promise I won't let it happen again.

388
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:22,332
All right?

389
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:24,702
Don't promise.

390
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:31,360
By the way,

391
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,452
do you want to eat anything on your birthday this year?

392
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:38,690
I'll take you to eat out.

393
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,940
No. I don't want to go out.

394
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,021
How annoying.

395
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,720
Stop pretending to be uninterested, will you?

396
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,170
I'm not pretending.

397
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,203
I don't want to waste her money.

398
00:28:54,203 --> 00:28:56,203
It's a waste of money.

399
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:58,000
Grandpa, we only eat out once in a while.

400
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,840
I earned some money from this job, so I want to treat you to a meal.

401
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,680
Let me do it. Okay?

402
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,320
I have money.

403
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,616
Keep your money, Pam. It's all right.

404
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,821
Hey, I'm so sick of this.

405
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:14,010
You don't go, but I will.

406
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,860
Our granddaughter is treating us to a meal. Just go.

407
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,530
If you died tomorrow or the other day,

408
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,550
though she offered food to the monk and dedicated it to you, you wouldn't enjoy that kind of meal.

409
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,080
Sa.

410
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,250
Have you tried it yourself?

411
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:29,089
Come on. Let's go, all of us.

412
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:30,930
Happy family.

413
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,330
All right?

414
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,507
How lovely you are, Grandpa.

415
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:39,710
I didn't come home. Do you know how much I missed you?

416
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,570
Apart from behaving as a good granddaughter,

417
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,523
I have to be a good daughter for Mom

418
00:29:44,523 --> 00:29:47,021
as a glue that holds our family relationship together.

419
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:50,890
To be honest, I'm not doing this just for Mom, but also for me myself

420
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:56,581
because deep inside, I have always longed to have a perfectly happy family.

421
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:59,979
Done. Take it.

422
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,110
It's my grandpa's birthday.

423
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,141
Could you please bless him?

424
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,680
May you live long, stay healthy, and be happy.

425
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,340
Please pour water of dedication and receive blessings.

426
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,853
Today is the day I have been waiting for.

427
00:30:19,853 --> 00:30:22,400
I hope it turns out as expected.

428
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:28,686
Mom, me, Grandpa, and Grandma will live together as a family again.

429
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,843
It's so nice having a chance

430
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,523
to make merit and pour water of dedication with you, Miss Pam.

431
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:54,380
Have you heard that if we make merit together, we will meet again in our next life?

432
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,987
Did you start thinking about saying this while we were offering food to the monk?

433
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:02,223
You probably didn't get merit.

434
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,840
The monk won't punish me who is trying to make a move.

435
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,000
But I'm deducting your marks.

436
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,343
Wait, Miss Pam.

437
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:16,320
I already bought a tablet as you told me to.

438
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,177
I installed movie apps, music apps, and a Thai chess game, so Grandpa would like it.

439
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:23,800
Thank you, Mr. Aood.

440
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,920
Can we change from saying thank you

441
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,180
to you making merit and pouring water of dedication with me every morning?

442
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,041
Let's say I'm not deducting your marks then.

443
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,034
Wait for me.

444
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,129
Grandpa, are you hungry?

445
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:52,600
Have you decided what you want to eat?

446
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,720
After we get in, just order whatever you want.

447
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,150
You guys choose.

448
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:02,881
I'll just take a walk around here for a while.

449
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,320
Pam, where is your mom?

450
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,716
I also want to know.

451
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:13,670
Oh, she's calling.

452
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,980
Ask her.

453
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,080
Mom, where are you?

454
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,350
Which floor is it? I've arrived.

455
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,140
I'm on the third floor, in front of the restaurant.

456
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,439
All right. I'll be right there.

457
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,228
She's arrived.

458
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,461
Grandpa.

459
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:39,470
Grandpa.

460
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,030
Grandpa.

461
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,360
Which flavor do you think is more delicious?

462
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,429
Chocolate or vanilla?

463
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,870
I've never bought from this shop.

464
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,082
Which flavor are you going to order?

465
00:32:55,082 --> 00:32:57,100
What about lime flavor?

466
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,458
That sounds sour.

467
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:01,503
It's 130 THB.

468
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,544
I only have 100 THB.

469
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:09,379
Please take this first.

470
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,580
Take mine.

471
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,270
It's all right. I'll get it from my daddy.

472
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,420
He's there.

473
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,514
You don't need to go.

474
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:19,880
Daddy, can I have 30 bahts?

475
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,872
What will you do with 30 bahts?

476
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,809
I'm just going to buy ice cream.

477
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:25,980
How many ice cream did you eat today?

478
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,025
Just one.

479
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,123
What? What are you negotiating?

480
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:34,750
I saw Grandpa over there.

481
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,250
He's there.

482
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:42,879
The plan I had carefully made to make Mom and Grandpa meet at the right time

483
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:46,218
was ruined right in front of me.

484
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,800
Dad.

485
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,607
The truth and our expectation are always the opposite.

486
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:13,487
Dad!

487
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,010
Grandpa!

488
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,400
Grandpa!

489
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:42,480
[My Dear Donovan]

490
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,900
Grandpa, do you hear me?

491
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,180
Grandpa.

492
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,926
Grandpa, do you hear me?

493
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:53,440
You're with the doctor now.

494
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,890
You're with the doctor now.

495
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,499
You are not allowed inside. I'm sorry.

496
00:34:56,499 --> 00:35:00,730
Hey, he will be all right. Trust me.

497
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,167
It's all my fault.

498
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:08,230
- It's all because of me. I ruined everything.
- No, listen to me.

499
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,350
Listen to me.

500
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,050
Relax.

501
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,620
Don't blame yourself.

502
00:35:17,235 --> 00:35:18,387
Pam!

503
00:35:18,387 --> 00:35:19,384
Pam!

504
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,698
How is Grandpa? What did the doctor say?

505
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:25,049
We don't know yet, Grandma. They just took him inside.

506
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,146
Where is your boyfriend?

507
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:31,870
I told Dave to take Luke home already.

508
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:34,440
I'm afraid there will be a problem again if Dad sees them.

509
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,344
Thanks a lot, young man.

510
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,787
Thanks for propping him up on time.

511
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:41,000
What's his name?

512
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,560
Please just call me Dino.

513
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,650
All right.

514
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,840
Thanks a lot, Dino.

515
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,841
Thanks a lot.

516
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,909
It's all right.

517
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,206
Wait here with your mom and grandma.

518
00:35:55,206 --> 00:35:57,159
I'll buy something for you to eat.

519
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,893
Grandma, let's sit and take some rest.

520
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,227
He's with the doctor now. Don't worry.

521
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:16,027
Really?

522
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,183
How did he get here?

523
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,480
Miss Pam, how is Grandpa?

524
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,258
We don't know yet.

525
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,920
I was shocked when I heard about it.

526
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,032
But I'm sure he will be fine.

527
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,040
Is he your boyfriend, Pam?

528
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,820
No, Mom.

529
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,041
Mr. Aood is renting a room at Grandpa's house.

530
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,278
We're neighbors.

531
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,443
Pam, I picked this up for you.

532
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:15,363
Everything I intended to do has been ruined even before I started.

533
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,853
He has coronary artery disease,

534
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,930
but he's safe now.

535
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,993
I suggest we do a coronary bypass surgery for him.

536
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:59,507
I'll schedule it as soon as possible.

537
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:05,907
For now, we need to move him to a patient's room to observe his condition.

538
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:07,407
Thank you.

539
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,380
Grandpa, why are you getting up?

540
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,723
I'm fine. Don't panic.

541
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:30,140
I can go home soon.

542
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,163
But you must stay here, Dad.

543
00:38:32,163 --> 00:38:34,403
The doctor will schedule surgery for you.

544
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,480
Why are you here?

545
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,789
I... wanted to come back to see you, Dad.

546
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,153
I wanted you to know that my life is going well.

547
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,800
Shameful.

548
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,370
Is it good living off a foreigner, huh?

549
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,892
Get lost now.

550
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:00,792
Leave!

551
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:04,110
Don't hurt me even more.

552
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,840
Do you know you're the reason why I'm like this?

553
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:15,679
It's hard for what has already been broken to get back to what it used to be.

554
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,960
Don't worry about the expense.

555
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,195
I'll handle it.

556
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:30,720
I choose to die rather than accept your help.

557
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,787
Grandpa.

558
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,163
Hey, don't be angry. Relax.

559
00:39:35,163 --> 00:39:36,820
If you are like this, you'll die fast.

560
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,900
Just let me die already!

561
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:46,360
Don't let me find out that any of you takes her money to help me even for a bit.

562
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,680
Or else I will die already!

563
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,001
Grandpa, why are you saying such things?

564
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:53,440
- You have difficulty breathing. Right?
- Grandpa.

565
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,268
Slowly. Lay down.

566
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,960
Excuse me, please wait outside.

567
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
Please leave. Please wait outside.

568
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,827
Please wait outside.

569
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:03,827
Please.

570
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,586
Does anyone know how much the surgery cost is, approximately?

571
00:40:29,362 --> 00:40:31,921
It's about 500,000 THB.

572
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:34,420
One uncle I know just underwent this surgery, too.

573
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,809
It's as much as 500,000 THB?

574
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,850
I'll take care of it.

575
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,304
Just don't tell him.

576
00:40:45,304 --> 00:40:48,910
Come on. He knows I don't have that much money.

577
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,864
He will find out it's your money.

578
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:57,480
You can take my money first, Grandma.

579
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,667
I have around 300,000 THB of cash with me.

580
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,663
Pay them with this amount first. Then we can find 200,000 THB and pay later.

581
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:04,560
It's all right, Mr. Aood.

582
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,080
I can't take it. It's a large amount of money.

583
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,150
Grandma, do we have any cash at home now?

584
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,729
We have around 100,000 THB.

585
00:41:15,729 --> 00:41:19,563
But I think if we mortgage our house, we can get enough money from that.

586
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,694
Don't do that yet.

587
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:22,585
What do you want me to do then?

588
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:24,780
I told you I'll pay for it.

589
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,061
How could you? That's for sure going to be a problem.

590
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:29,353
What problem, Mom?

591
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,612
Your dad is not stupid. He will find out.

592
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:34,080
He knows we won't be able to find that much money.

593
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,864
Let me figure it out.

594
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:39,749
I'll be right back.

595
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:27,046
You haven't left?

596
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,198
I wanted to stay and wait to make sure you felt all right.

597
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,986
If you weren't there by chance,

598
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:42,117
I would now feel even worse.

599
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,760
Today, I wasn't there by chance.

600
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:49,775
I went to see you.

601
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,076
I asked Pete where you were.

602
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,260
I know you need money.

603
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:02,070
I don't have a manager yet.

604
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,034
I want you for the job.

605
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,803
Why me?

606
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,800
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

607
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,220
It's not because I feel sorry for you,

608
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,780
but you did a really good job.

609
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,878
Did I really do a good job?

610
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,382
You're very good.

611
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,243
I'm saying this from my heart.

612
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,260
On a super bad day,

613
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,547
a little compliment from the person I didn't expect it from

614
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:50,006
comforts me in a way I can't even explain.

615
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,850

624
00:45:02,781 --> 00:45:05,421
I've already figured out how to earn money for Grandpa's surgery cost.

625
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:07,723
I'll work at your company, Mom.

626
00:45:07,723 --> 00:45:10,375
Well, what is my responsibility?

627
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,033
As his manager, there's nothing much to do, actually.

628
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:16,220
You just have to manage everything for him.

629
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,440
Is it really fine with you to work with that guy, Miss Pam?

630
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,952
At first, I wasn't quite okay with that.

631
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,650
But as we get to talk more,

632
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,278
I feel he's not a bad guy.
