1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,020
I bought them for you.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,400
I think they'll suit you.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,388
A welcome gift for my manager.

4
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:10,580
Thank you.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,600
Explain this photo.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,970
Donovan suddenly ran outside, so I ran after him.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,680
But my leg was hurt that day.

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,360
Donovan just helped carry me.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,700
Why do I have to clean up the mess I didn't make?!

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,531
- Who just called?
- Miss Da.

11
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:27,880
She said she could make all the news vanish at once as if nothing had happened,

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,210
but she's asking for something in return.

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,160
- What is it?
- Dino must have dinner with her.

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,640
[I'll have dinner with you as invited.]

15
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,220
What took you so long to pick up the phone?

16
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,640
I was about to sleep.

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,690
I believe you. It's so dark over there.

18
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:42,104
Since I already called, can I see your face?

19
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,400
Are you hot?

20
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,580
If there's nothing else, I'm going to hang up.

21
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,618
What? I'm just happy that you've agreed to meet with me.

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,100
Let's have dinner tomorrow.

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,020
What would you like to eat?

24
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,240
Anything.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,277
Then I'll pick for you.

26
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,760
Okay.

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,860
I'm so excited.

28
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,857
I almost can't wait for tomorrow.

29
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,260
I've also prepared something for you.

30
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,590
What is it?

31
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,730
I won't tell you. It's a surprise.

32
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,730
If you want to know, then come see me quickly.

33
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,380
All right.

34
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,464
Good night.

35
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,073
When was the last time you talked for 3 hours-ish on the phone?

36
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,359
Can you remember?

37
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,168
I can't believe I fell asleep on the phone.

38
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,490
Do you want to see a doctor? I can make an appointment for you.

39
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,880
Grandma!

40
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,290
You startled me.

41
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,840
I'm the one who should be startled.

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,580
You haven't gone downstairs so I came to check on you.

43
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,860
What's wrong?

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,460
You're randomly smiling and moving like this.

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,600
What's wrong?

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,360
Are you possessed or something?

47
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,650
Hey. It's me, Pam.

48
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,400
The beautiful Pam.

49
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,200
Now I'm sure you're possessed because you're saying you're beautiful.

50
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,800
I need to handle you...

51
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,766
like this.

52
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:24,650
Sa!

53
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,500
Enough. I'm not afraid of you.

54
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,163
I actually came to ask if you're free today. Your grandpa is leaving the hospital.

55
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:37,080
If you're not free, I'll ask my boyfriend to pick us up.

56
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,240
Wait.

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,020
Who's your boyfriend?

58
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,960
Mr. Aood, of course. The handsome guy next door.

59
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,850
Really?

60
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,660
The young man next door, huh?

61
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,850
Actually, I don't want to get in the way of you and your man,

62
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:02,020
but I want to do my duty as a grateful granddaughter today.

63
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,053
Great.

64
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,426
But are you sure you're free?

65
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,060
This won't affect your job, right?

66
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,620
Are you free or not?

67
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,899
Do I have to go with you?

68
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,440
No, I will go myself,

69
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,320
but let me take a shower first.

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,900
You can go back to what you're doing.

71
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,153
Okay, I will soon, but let me hit you first.

72
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,880
Bye.

73
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,920
The happiness I got from talking to him last night is gone

74
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,050
now that I recalled my mom's words.

75
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,148
I'm thinking about the bad comments I read.

76
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,370
I know that the more I read, the more it hurts, but I can't help checking them.

77
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,780
What?

78
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,050
How come everything is gone?

79
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,920
The bad comments are gone, like nothing happened.

80
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,650
Even though I was surprised at that moment, I was more relieved.

81
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,749
At least, one bad thing is over.

82
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,661
What?

83
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,823
[Imagine how gorgeous you are in these. See you tonight.]

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,850
What's the patient's name?

85
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,664
Mr. Poon Koonthana.

86
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,843
The medical fee is 89,159 baht.

87
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,197
We work hard for our loved ones.

88
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,783
Careful, Grandpa.

89
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:21,600
Hey, how are you?

90
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,640
How are you?

91
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
I'm fine.

92
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,370
Have a seat. If I wasn't, the doctor wouldn't let me come home.

93
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,880
Talking back means you're recovered now.

94
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,220
That's good.

95
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,460
I'm relieved.

96
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,890
How much was the medical fee?

97
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,240
Not much.

98
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,356
I took an extra job to pay for it, remember?

99
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,020
How much was it?

100
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,220
Oh, I totally forgot.

101
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,536
What? I have something to show you.

102
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,680
Tada.

103
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,129
Isn't it cute?

104
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:58,520
I don't think that's what you meant to show.

105
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,480
Sa!

106
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,520
Wrong one.

107
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,700
How embarrassing.

108
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,970
- I'm embarrassed.
- You? Embarrassed?

109
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,260
Here it is.

110
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,360
Happy birthday, Grandpa!

111
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,420
You look handsome.

112
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,060
Why did you spend so much on this?

113
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,980
You should've saved your money.

114
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,650
I wanted to give you a present.

115
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,520
It's a waste of money.

116
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,130
If you won't accept the gift, I will.

117
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,400
Change it to my photo.

118
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,850
Get a pretty one. I'll pick.

119
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,597
My granddaughter bought it for me.

120
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,220
Thanks, dear.

121
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,930
Here you go.

122
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,340
This is so cute, Pam.

123
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,860
You look so smart in this photo.

124
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,700
I don't really know how to use it though.

125
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,880
It's all right. I'll teach you.

126
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,140
You have work to do. Will you have time to teach me?

127
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,131
Of course.

128
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm free today so I'm just chilling.

129
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,420
Open it.

130
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,130
- There are a lot of apps.
- Wow, it can turn upside down.

131
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,890
I like this photo.

132
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,520
Who's there?

133
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,510
- I'll go check.
- Okay.

134
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,030
Is it like this... or like this?

135
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,490
Hey. What are you doing here?

136
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,570
How's it going?

137
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,010
Is everything okay?

138
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,733
What are you doing at my house?

139
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,380
Who's that, Pam?

140
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,340
Who's there?

141
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,402
I was wondering who was here.

142
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,040
He's my friend.

143
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,090
Your friend?

144
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,960
He remembered the wrong house and thought I lived here.

145
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,049
My house is that one.

146
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,980
You can take your grandpa inside, Miss Pam. I'll take it from here.

147
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,120
Okay.

148
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,340
Grandpa.

149
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,520
That's Mr. Aood's friend. Nothing is going on.

150
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,120
Let's go inside. The weather is hot. You don't want to stand in the sun.

151
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,977
What are you doing here?

152
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,690
I'm here to see Pam.

153
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,010
Miss Pam is busy.

154
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,580
Really?

155
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,460
Hey.

156
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,840
Why are you here?

157
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,540
I just wanted to see your face, so I came to see you.

158
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
You just wanted to see my face?

159
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,650
Are you mad?

160
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,760
Actually, I have to go somewhere. I'm asking you to join me.

161
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,391
Why didn't you call me first?

162
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,560
I wanted to pick you up.

163
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,600
I wanted to see your face as soon as possible.

164
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,420
You're the most self-centered.

165
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,160
You're lucky my grandpa has bad eyes.

166
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,170
If he found out you came to see me, I'd be in trouble.

167
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,040
Wait here while I go get my stuff.

168
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,927
Have you already told Mr. Aood's friend not to randomly ring a bell at someone's house again?

169
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,930
He's a foreigner, so he doesn't really know the rules.

170
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,976
A foreigner with no manners.

171
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,480
Where can I watch things?

172
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,540
I'll be back to teach you. Okay?

173
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,200
I have to hurry to work.

174
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,740
Oh no, I'm going to be late now.

175
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,920
I thought you didn't have work today, Pam.

176
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,760
I got it wrong.

177
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,300
I'm going to be late. I have to go.

178
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,940
- Go.
- Bye.

179
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,440
Bye.

180
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,600
Don't come to this house again.

181
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,736
Don't get Miss Pam in trouble.

182
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,247
This family doesn't want anyone to have anything to do with Miss Pam,

183
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,719
except for me.

184
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,552
Unfortunately, Pam prefers having things to do with me than with you.

185
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:37,960
You want a go?

186
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,760
Bring it.

187
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,130
Stop!

188
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,949
What are you guys doing?

189
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,943
Nothing. Just a normal greeting.

190
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,190
Okay.

191
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,483
I should go.

192
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:01,340
Thanks for your help just now, Mr. Aood.

193
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,840
Of course.

194
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,332
I'll get the car.

195
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,530
[My Dear Donovan]

196
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,890
Hey.

197
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,090
Are we supposed to be here for work?

198
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,400
There's no work.

199
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,797
You know about my sister now, so I brought you here.

200
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:42,372
Hey...

201
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,840
Hey.

202
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,770
You said you wanted to see your sister. Right?

203
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,400
Have you found her already?

204
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,000
Here?

205
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,955
This is the fifth time I've been here to wait for Maria.

206
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,290
On the 24th of every month,

207
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,640
500 dollars is transferred from this bank to me in New York.

208
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,880
It's the money my sister earns from working in Thailand.

209
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,047
So I thought, if I came here, I might find her.

210
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:14,740
Wow, I get it now.

211
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,841
So have you found her already?

212
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,500
No.

213
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,677
Wait.

214
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,850
You've been here five times.

215
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,830
That means you've been searching for five months but still can't find your sister.

216
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,170
Wow.

217
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,850
You're quite dedicated.

218
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,580
If I were you, I would've given up after the second time.

219
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,020
Yeah, well.

220
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:51,326
It's suspicious that the money is transferred to me on the same date of every month.

221
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,591
That's why I thought I might have a chance to find her.

222
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,584
This is my sister.

223
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:18,240
Have you tried showing her photo to the staff?

224
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,662
I have. No one recognized her.

225
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,320
I have even asked to look at their security footage,

226
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,229
but they wouldn't let me.

227
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,520
It looks like she's not coming.

228
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,760
Be patient.

229
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,160
She might be on her way.

230
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,860
Look.

231
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,313
This is the ring she left me.

232
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,264
It's the last thing I have to keep her with me.

233
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,720
I feel bad and sad for him at the same time.

234
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,160
I sympathize with him about his sister

235
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,397
and feel good that he opens up to me.

236
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,610
We waited for quite some time, but no luck.

237
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,849
No one who looked like his sister showed up.

238
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,840
Hey!

239
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,327
Excuse me! You forgot your bag.

240
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,205
I forgot it. Sorry.

241
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,703
I wondered where you'd gone.

242
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:18,005
Now I know you're out to get food.

243
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,840
I thought you might be hungry.

244
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,970
Here.

245
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,220
No cucumbers.

246
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,850
I remember you don't like them.

247
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,621
- Do you want to try it?
- No.

248
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:31,990
The cucumber makes it even worse.

249
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,690
Thanks.

250
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,980
Water is here.

251
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,340
What about pickles? Do you like them?

252
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,520
I can eat pickles.

253
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,500
I can eat cucumbers, but not pickles.

254
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,290
My sister wants me to like their salty and sour taste.

255
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,680
She compares them to our lives.

256
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,942
It's a beautiful metaphor.

257
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,980
What does your sister do for work?

258
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,869
Is she an English teacher?

259
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:17,180
Fitness trainer?

260
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,152
No.

261
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:19,404
Import-export.

262
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:20,610
No.

263
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,320
A tattoo artist?

264
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,710
No.

265
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,720
Oh, is she a model like you?

266
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,890
Yes.

267
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,320
Finally, I guessed right.

268
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,860
Have you asked around the modeling agencies?

269
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,350
Yes, I reached out to every agency.

270
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,505
Everything I could think of, I have already done it.

271
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:51,252
Thank you.

272
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,130
What's your sister doing in Thailand?

273
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,981
I want to know the answer, too.

274
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,200
Actually, she left me back home,

275
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,919
even though she said she'd wait for me.

276
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,266
Why would she wait for you?

277
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:16,641
[Love you, my little brother]

278
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,002
You don't need to know.

279
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,497
Oh, have you tried to search for her through social media?

280
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,120
That look means you haven't.

281
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,460
If you do it,

282
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,480
a lot of people will help share your post.

283
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,920
If someone who knows your sister sees your post and tells her about it.

284
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,890
I think that could work.

285
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,340
You know what?

286
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,300
Thai people are on social media 24/7. We probably use it the most in the world.

287
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,330
Whether when we pee, poop, win a lottery, or when our dogs and cats die,

288
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,760
we post about everything.

289
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,160
I'm serious.

290
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,839
It makes me feel good that you want to help me.

291
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,470
But...

292
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,614
how do we start?

293

- Pam.
- Yeah?

294
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,010
Are we recording the video clip here?

295
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,730
Yes, this is where I work,

296
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,580
but since it's a school break, there are not many people around.

297
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,040
This place has all the essential equipment.

298
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,600
Pens, papers, colors.

299
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,580
And the space is so big with a lot of spots to choose from.

300
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,930
I'll be sitting while I talk to the camera, so it doesn't matter where I film.

301
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,840
It does.

302
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,250
Don't argue with me.

Okay. How about you paint the letters?

308
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,880
Well, I think I'd better do it myself.

309

336
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,849
I want to know how she's doing, if she's all right.

337
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:11,266
Maria,

338
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,827
this is for you.

339
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:15,928
I miss you.

00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:18,811
I want to see you so bad.

341
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:22,804
I'm so close to you, but it feels like I'm so far.

342
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:25,053
So please,

343
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:28,000
if you see this, come and find me.

344

Contact me. I'll be waiting for you.

345
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,160
Wow.

346
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,490
That's so good.

347
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,450
That's awesome.

348
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,610
Let me see the video.

349
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,410
What happened?

350
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:53,420
Can we do another take?

351
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,576
I forgot to press record.

352
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,038
I'm sorry.

Where is it?

354
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,100
It's not around here.

355
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,880
Is it here?

356
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,309
Where did I put it?

357
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,880
What are you looking for?

358
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,770
Have you seen the tablet Pam gave me?

359
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,580
I don't know where I put it.

360
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,980
How would I know?

361
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,780
You're the only one who uses it and keeps leaving it around the house.

362
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,960
If you really lost it, your granddaughter would be very sad.

363
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,527
If you don't want to help me look, fine, but don't criticize me.

364

We have so few viewers.

365
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:17,290
Maybe I post too many funny clips and they're restricting my reach.

366
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,410
Wait! Did people block me?

367

Don't think too much about it.

I'm so grateful for your help.

370

But if the video was going to go viral, it would have already.

371

You must have left it in the kitchen while listening to music.

390

You go screaming when you can't find it.

What is it?

396

Well, it's her job.

397
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,200
What job?

398
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,140
I thought she was taking care of a female model.

399

What does men's swimwear here mean? What's going on?

400

Is she lying to me?

No, look.

Of course. I like it very much.

I will wait to talk it out with her.

501
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,560
As you wish.

502
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,060
Grandpa. Grandma. I brought something for you.

503
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,360
Seeing it reminded me of you guys.

504
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,620
Aood, do you know about Pam's job?

505
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,255
What's she doing for work?

506
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:23,010
[Mercure Hotel]

507
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:52,036
You can't go up without a keycard, or have a room owner come get you.

508
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,010
It's me.

509
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,200
Let him come up.

510
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,800
Okay.

511
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,140
This way, please.

512
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,661
Grandpa, I didn't mean to lie...

513
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,330
This is the latest model from Japan.

514
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,900
It can relax your tense neck and shoulders.

515
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,050
Can it help me relax in Rangsit?

516
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,820
- It can relax you in Pathumthani.
- Wait!

517
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,965
What? This is not what I expected.

518
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,450
Pam, you're home.

519
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,650
Have you eaten?

520
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,340
Not yet.

521
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,600
You should've told me.

522
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,620
I already cleaned the pot and put it away. There's no food in the kitchen.

523
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,081
But it's okay. I can cook you rice.

524
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:18,210
No, Grandma, it's okay.

525
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,180
I can get something to eat outside.

526
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,500
It's late. You shouldn't go out again.

527
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,560
I can go with her.

528
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,860
I haven't eaten either.

529
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,040
Great. I'm too lazy to cook rice again anyway.

530
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,620
Go.

531
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,000
Okay. I'll hurry back.

532
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,780
Let's go, Miss Pam.

533
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,358
You're so cute.

534
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,777
You're wearing the outfit I gave you.

535
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,968
Am I good?

536
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,343
I've only known you a short time,

537
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,197
but I know your size already.

538
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,158
Do you want a drink?

539
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,040
I'm here for dinner.

540
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,100
Okay.

541
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,620
If you don't want to drink, let's dance.

542
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,130
I'm not a good dancer. Sorry.

543
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,305
You're not good at dancing.

544
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,885
What are you good at then?

545
00:43:43,842 --> 00:43:45,983
Nothing.

546
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,970
You're good at nothing?

547
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,640
Then allow me to teach you.

548
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,240
You invited me for dinner.

549
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,740
Where is it?

550
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,960
So impatient.

551
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,870
I'm hungry.

552
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,388
You can't seriously be hungry now.

553
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,210
Why did you change your mind and accept my invitation?

554
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:16,140
Sometimes we must agree to do something we don't like for the one we love.

555
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,220
He's here because of those words I said to him.

556
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:25,260
I realized that it's not a difficult task to dine with a beautiful woman like you.

557
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,700
Everyone can tell this is not going to end at dinner.

558
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,400
Really?

559
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,240
What's that smell?

560
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,020
What smell?

561
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,333
I wonder what that smell is.

562
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,600
It's the smell of my perfume.

563
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,300
Yes.

564
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,594
Can you grab the bag for me?

565
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,520
Thank you.

566
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,520
Here.

567
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,280
My surprise gift for you.

568
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,100
I thought...

569
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,840
Why?

570
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,430
Even though I've already given you something, it doesn't mean I can't give you another gift.

571
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,950
I know what you want from me.

572
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,100
Good.

573
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,459
Then I don't have to talk much.

574
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,840
I have a big project coming up.

575
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,500
If you get it, you will become very famous.

576
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,610
He told me he wants to get famous.

577
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,880
In exchange for that, he might agree to do anything.

578
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,940
I knew you'd agree with me.

579
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,442
Where should I...

580
00:46:38,148 --> 00:46:41,177
start eating you?

581
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:49,830
Here at your chest?

582
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:57,059
Or your abs?

583
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,620
Your abs or your...?

584
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,697
Please stop.

585
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,192
I can't sleep with you in exchange for the job.

586
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,180
Okay.

587
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,700
No means no.

588
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,923
I don't like to force anyone.

589
00:47:30,923 --> 00:47:33,381
Let's continue eating our dinner.

590
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,955
If I've made you uncomfortable, I'm sorry.

591
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,474
No, it's all right.

592
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,803
But if you think you can get me drunk, you're wrong.

593
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:02,006
I'm a hard drinker.

594
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,608
Is that the only hard thing about you?

595
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,040
Okay.

596
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,280
If you're a hard drinker, show me.

597
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:50,443
I told you it was not going to end at dinner.

598
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,160
What?

599
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,640
You thought I was trying to make you drunk?

600
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,820
I'm not that stupid.

601
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:07,090
Hello?

602
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:10,130
Help me.

603
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,830
What's wrong?

604
00:49:12,857 --> 00:49:14,380
I was drugged.

605
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,240
What?

606
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,753
Are you in this room?

607
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,890
Open the door!

608
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,860
Open it now!

609
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,780
Open it!

610
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:29,480
♫ Who said that I'm so hot? ♫

611
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,070
♫ Sorry, if my hair looks too hot ♫

612
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,950
♫ What, a womanizer? It's not true!
(Don't believe it, don't believe what he says) ♫

613
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:42,330
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

614
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:46,700
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

615
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:52,790
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

616
00:49:52,790 --> 00:50:00,000
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫

617
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,050
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

618
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:21,100
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.

619
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:30,550
