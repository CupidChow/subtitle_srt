1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,817
I feel that life is so uncertain.

2
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:08,013
Pam,

3
00:00:08,013 --> 00:00:09,917
do you want to move in with me?

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,420
Grandpa, I have a boyfriend.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,270
You know your boyfriend was a murderer before.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,030
Aren't you afraid he'll commit more crimes without your knowledge?

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,320
Wait. Others could see us.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,372
What do you say to that?

9
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:34,020
How many times do I have to tell you?

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,460
I didn't do it. I didn't know anything about it.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,740
You can't say that without proof.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,650
We have to conduct an investigation and follow many other procedures.

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,220
Miss Da put the ring in my bag.

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,830
I was framed.

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,640
I understand, but this is still under investigation.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,930
You can't just insist you didn't do it, you must provide some proof.

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,690
I'm the proof.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,850
I didn't do it. I was bullied. Miss Da made a false report.

19
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,450
You can't just accuse someone like that. You must have proof.

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,200
Hey. You keep asking for proof.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,220
Why won't you believe me? I swear I didn't do it.

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,000
Is it because she's rich, looks credible, has money and connections?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,670
Is that why you believe everything she says?

24
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,690
Is the whole country like this?

25
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,360
Please calm down.

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,670
Did you take her money?

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,850
What are you saying?

28
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,070
Sergeant, take her away.

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,390
I didn't do anything wrong.

30
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,220
Wait.

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,520
I didn't do anything wrong.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,270
Officer.

33
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,660
Hey.

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,550
This is bullying.

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,480
I know many people have been locked up when they're only suspects.

36
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,320
I just hope justice will shine on me.

37
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,330
I can only close my eyes and pray that when I wake up,

38
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,840
I'll find myself sleeping in my bed.

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,590
Let this crazy thing be just a dream.

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,663
But everything is still a nightmare that I don't know when I will wake up from.

41
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,540
Come on out.

42
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,752
Someone bailed you out.

43
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:19,327
Dino.

44
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,742
I thought I'd never get out.

45
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:29,010
I was so scared.

46
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,005
I was scared that Grandpa and Grandma would find out.

47
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:36,757
I was scared the police wouldn't let me fight the case.

48
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:40,751
I was scared I'd never see you again.

49
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,000
It's all right now, Pam.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,030
I'm here.

51
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,601
Don't cry.

52
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,277
I'm so happy to see him and hug him again.

53
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:03,630
I had no idea that he had decided to do something in exchange for my freedom,

54
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,211
which I don't know if it was worth it.

55
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,441
Thank you so much for getting me out today.

56
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:24,120
I was so scared.

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,392
Please let me stay like this for a while.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,542
If you didn't know me,

59
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,883
you'd probably be living a good life.

60
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,748
A normal life.

61
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,394
Really, you shouldn't have to go through that.

62
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,951
It's not your fault at all.

63
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,550
I will continue to fight the case.

64
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:15,612
I won't give up easily.

65
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,165
I didn't do it.

66
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:19,056
You know I didn't.

67
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,456
I know.

68
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,512
That's why I came to see you.

69
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:32,686
But after today,

70
00:05:36,592 --> 00:05:39,172
we'll probably have to keep our distance.

71
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,069
What do you mean?

72
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,120
This hug is not as warm as it normally should be.

73
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,714
I can feel the sadness in his arms.

74
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,539
This is probably the last time I can hug you.

75
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:16,014
Dino,

76
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,460
what's wrong?

77
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,040
Pam.

78
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:28,173
Pam.

79
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,443
Let's...

80
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:46,861
Let's break up.

81
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,760
Dino?

82
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,363
What did you say?

83
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,140
I'm so tired now.

84
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,404
What's wrong with you?

85
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:06,345
What is this?

86
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:10,363
I need some time to think about myself...

87
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,473
and think over our relationship.

88
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,423
Hold on.

89
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:23,172
We...

90
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,760
We've been doing great so far, haven't we?

91
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,121
So... why?

92
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:35,740
- Pam.
- What did I do wrong, Dino?

93
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,425
Tell me what's wrong.

94
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:40,938
- You did nothing wrong.
- Then why? What happened?

95
00:07:45,204 --> 00:07:47,076
Dino.

96
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:57,734
Goodbye.

97
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:01,606
No. No. No, Dino.

98
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,459
What is this?

99
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,743
What did I do wrong? You've never been like this.

100
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:11,943
Pam.

101
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,220
Pam.

102
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,990
Dino, don't you love me anymore?

103
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,943
Don't you love me anymore?

104
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,542
How could you leave me?

105
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:25,925
Pam.

106
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:28,266
What's wrong with you? You've never been like this.

107
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:29,566
Pam.

108
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:34,091
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,334
Dino, please.

110
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,026
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:45,741
Dino.

112
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,713
I should be running after him,

113
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,343
Dino...

114
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,220
but my legs wouldn't move.

115
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,188
I could only sit down and cry with no energy left...

116
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:21,207
until he walked out of my sight.

117
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:45,662
Some people who have ridden a roller coaster say it's riveting, exciting and extreme.

118
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:50,163
But for people who don't like it, it makes them feel nauseated

119
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:54,589
and want to throw up, like I do.

120
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,333
Miss Pam.

121
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,250
Are you all right?

122
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:53,017
Put this on your eyes to prevent them from swelling,

123
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:56,928
so you don't have to answer your grandparents' questions when you get home.

124
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:07,723
Do you want to tell me about it?

125
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:10,696
Will you be okay...

126
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:15,334
to hear me talk about another guy?

127
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:18,763
As long as there's no love scene.

128
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,923
Bad timing for a joke.

129
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:33,520
Tell me. I'll be fine.

130
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,596
He broke up with me.

131
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:46,771
I told Mr. Aood I want answers.

132
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:49,109
I've tried to get answers from him.

133
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,480
Dino!

134
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,260
But he wouldn't tell me. He wouldn't say anything.

135
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,980
I cried so much that night.

136
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,049
I cried the hardest in my life since I could remember.

137
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,091
What did I do wrong?

138
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:29,678
My mom finds out and takes it upon herself to deal with it for me.

139
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:31,556
Where's Dararai?

140
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:34,988
When she hears Miss Da would play so dirty and send me to jail,

141
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,925
Mom asks to see the troublemaker.

142
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:41,042
But no one dares tell her because they don't know what she'll do.

143
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,940
What the hell is wrong with you?

144
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,230
The moment she sees Miss Da, all Mom's pent up anger bursts out.

145
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,780
Get her out!

146
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,885
Mom is angry and believes this won't end easily.

147
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:58,751
Mom can't do anything now, but wishes she could get back at her some day.

148
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,397
My day will come, she thinks.

149
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,880
What's up?

150
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,744
Is it done?

151
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:40,030
Yes.

152
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,012
I did as we agreed.

153
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,650
Isn't there any footage in the dressing room?

154
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,961
Not as far as I've checked.

155
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:58,852
Why isn't there any?

156
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,650
What happened? I saw that junk food ride off in the police car.

157
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,967
I don't want to talk to you right now.

158
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,935
Are you sure? What if I tell you I can help her?

159
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,957
I hope you'll keep your word.

160
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:28,761
I should be the one telling you that.

161
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:32,853
I'll take care of it right now.

162
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:45,947
And of course, Miss Da never pays attention to Jessica.

163
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:52,101
Little does she know that someone who is off her radar is the most dangerous.

164
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,517
Jessica is one of the people who has long been holding a grudge against Dararai.

165
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:15,620
Whatevers she can do to take Dararai down, she's willing to do it.

166
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,291
No matter what it takes.

167
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:21,260
How can I help you?

168
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,414
I have information on Dararai's diamond ring theft case.

169
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,281
Can I see it?

170
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:30,988
Not sure if it's luck or because she happened to be where she wasn't seen.

171
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:33,926
But she accidentally got the evidence.

172
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:41,729
How did you get this video?

173
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:44,516
I was running an errand nearby.

174
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:50,018
Jessica tells the police she happens to know the owner of the studio where Dino was shooting...

175
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:04,149
and that he wanted to take her somewhere quiet to talk.

176
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,562
A woman's instinct told her something fishy was going on.

177
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:44,283
So she took out her phone and captured it.

178
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,940
That's how I got the video.

179
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:07,651
Do you confirm that you took this video by yourself?

180
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,744
Of course.

181
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:11,014
May I have a copy?

182
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:13,351
Please send it to me.

183
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:15,185
Scan this.

184
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,637
Nothing is more fun than seeing your enemy fall.

185
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:24,493
This time, she believes Miss Da will be buried in the ground.

186
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,533
The case progresses quickly.

187
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,225
Miss Da is invited to the police station for questioning.

188
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:36,282
She walks in like a winner that day.

189
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:40,103
She has no idea her destruction is looming.

190
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:47,420
She isn't sure if she really saw that jinx.

191
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
Have a seat.

192
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,069
She sits down on the same chair in the same manner Jessica did.

193
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:55,029
But their situations are different.

194
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,725
Why did you ask me to come in?

195
00:17:57,725 --> 00:18:00,021
I want to show you this video.

196
00:18:02,384 --> 00:18:07,455
The police charge her for making a false report and defamation,

197
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:12,480
saying there's a witness who confirmed I didn't steal the ring

198
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,300
and that it was her who put the ring in my bag.

199
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,050
The video clip clearly confirms she did it.

200
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,643
This can't be happening.

201
00:18:21,449 --> 00:18:23,141
Who is it?

202
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:28,723
Oh my god!

203
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,397
Hey! It was you, wasn't it?

204
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,749
- Miss Da's blood boils.
- Oh my god! Oh my god! I'm scared!

205
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,710
She doesn't care where she is.

206
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,074
Help! I'm so scared!

207
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:43,280
I'm scared already!

208
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,880
You crazy bitch.

209
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,557
Come back here.

210
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,677
Why are you taking photos?

211
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:59,010
Please continue.

212
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,102
After you're done, I'll give you all the details.

213
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:04,450
Continue.

214
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,842
This is Mom giving Dararai payback for daring to bully me.

215
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:20,560
The case is solved as it should be.

216
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,155
Just a moment, Grandma.

217
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,503
I heard you're sick.

218
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:57,529
How are you feeling?

219
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,629
I'm feeling better.

220
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,000
Does the school need a doctor's certificate...

221
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,760
if you want to take more than two days off these days?

222
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:14,271
No.

223
00:20:14,271 --> 00:20:17,113
I can go back to work soon.

224
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:21,963
Do you need anything? You could've just called me to bring it downstairs.

225
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:25,605
Did you have a fight with your boyfriend?

226
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,119
Does he know you're sick?

227
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,913
Won't he stop by to give you some food and medicine?

228
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:43,125
I'm a grownup, Grandpa. I can get food and medicine by myself.

229
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,960
Yes.

230
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,310
You have really grown up.

231
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:52,329
It feels like yesterday you were running around wearing a braid.

232
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,965
Now you've graduated and are working.

233
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,774
Time flew quickly, didn't it?

234
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:04,849
I forgot that you've grown up.

235
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:13,602
Actually, I'm not against you dating someone.

236
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:21,783
I believe you'll choose a good person.

237
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,187
Yes.

238
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:32,019
But you have to introduce him to me first...

239
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:36,625
before you make any decision.

240
00:21:37,954 --> 00:21:41,372
You may not be able to see things from all perspectives.

241
00:21:42,643 --> 00:21:45,289
I'll help you vet him.

242
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,742
Here.

243
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,431
Take this if you still haven't recovered.

244
00:21:56,271 --> 00:22:01,106
Your grandma said you wouldn't take your medicine during the day.

245
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,444
I'll leave you to it.

246
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:22,540
It feels like Grandpa has started to open up to things.

247
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:28,193
But it's hard to restore my relationship with Dino to what it once was.

248
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,831
Bye, Nina. Safe trip home.

249

Don't forget to hand in your homework tomorrow.

250
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:14,876
Okay.

251
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:15,825
Goodbye.

252
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:17,953
Goodbye, Nina's dad.

253
00:23:26,246 --> 00:23:28,308
What's wrong, Pam?

254
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:34,045
You mean this?

255
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,206
I accidentally cut myself with a cutter.

256
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:42,380
I didn't know a cut on your finger can cut through your heart.

257
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,720
What are you talking about?

258
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,165
Why are you talking like an adult?

259
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:50,227
Where did you hear that from?

260
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:52,027
A cartoon.

261

Come on. I'll take you.

262

Where?

263
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
To see Aood.

264
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,480
You'll stop feeling sad for sure.

265
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,880
Wait. Why do I have to go?

266
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,419
Aood is so fun to play with.

267
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:09,425
He's kind, too.

268
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,740

- Wait, Luke.
- Let's go.

272
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:22,635
Be careful of falling.

273
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:24,688
Thank you.

274
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,628
- Where do we put this?
- Right there.

275
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:31,878
Are we out of these or did you secretly eat them all?

276
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:35,853
I don't eat secretly. I eat openly.

277
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,960
Hi, Miss Pam.

Luke asked me to come get ice cream with him,

but he changed his mind and went home to wait for me.

Can I get a quart of chocolate ice cream?

Sure.

283

Got it.

284

Today is the first time Mr. Aood has openly tried to break the friend zone.

302
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:13,521
A lot of relationships I've seen actually start from friendship.

303

Why don't you feed yourself?

[Hot Model of the Year Makes Out With Wealthy Guy in the Car Park.]

332
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,330
Fuck!

333
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,940
Hello?

334
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,360
How are you?

335
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,948
The hot model who sleeps around.

336
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,656
Have you seen your clip?

337
00:29:11,656 --> 00:29:13,736
You look so cheap.

338
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,780
I want to throw up.

339
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,507
Old bitch! You did this, didn't you?

340
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,797
Why? What if I did it?

341
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:21,190
It's not hard.

342
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:25,300
I just sent people to ban you.

343
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,663
You think you can end me like that? You don't know me well enough.

344
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:30,855
You'll see, bitch.

345
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:36,266
Fuck!

346
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:53,463
Revenge is always scary.

347
00:29:53,463 --> 00:29:56,742
Research has found that when people get their revenge,

348
00:29:56,742 --> 00:29:59,344
the part of the brain that becomes distinctly more active

349
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:02,653
is the part related to pleasure and happiness.

350
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,960
Whether Jessica knows that is a mystery to me.

351
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,694
But someone like her

352
00:30:08,694 --> 00:30:12,760
wouldn't pass up a chance to get revenge on someone she regards as her enemy.

353
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,266
Before anything, she needs to get past the first barrier.

354
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:20,250
Our botox buffet is 50% off today.

355
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,700
Do you recognize her?

356
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,517
This promotion is very interesting,

357
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:28,112
but can I just get a facial treatment today?

358
00:30:28,112 --> 00:30:30,473
It's my first time here.

359
00:30:30,473 --> 00:30:34,080
Of course. May I have your ID card?

360
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,566
Thank you.

361
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:38,926
- Please wait a moment.
- Okay.

362
00:30:38,926 --> 00:30:41,407
Getting past the first barrier is easy success.

363
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,140
This is the facial mask for today.

364
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,280
I'll clean your face first.

365
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,804
Excuse me. Could you please turn up the temperature? I'm cold.

366
00:30:52,804 --> 00:30:54,663
Sure.

367
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:04,235
Excuse me.

368
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:08,700
Could you blow the air in another direction? My eyes are getting dry.

369
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,200
Okay.

370
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,970
She puts something she brought in the clinic's cream.

371
00:31:20,701 --> 00:31:22,600
Are you looking for something?

372
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,560
I was just changing my position.

373
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,277
I'm tense. Please don't tell me off.

374
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:31,571
It's all right. Just relax.

375
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:34,014
Let me apply the cream on your face and put the mask on later.

376
00:31:34,014 --> 00:31:35,399
Okay.

377
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,140
This will feel a little cool.

378
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,940
Excuse me.

379
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,747
Can I live stream this?

380
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:59,521
My friends who watch me might want to come here, too.

381
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:01,495
Go ahead.

382
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:08,164
Hello, everyone.

383
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:12,587
It's my day off, so I'm getting my beauty treatment.

384
00:32:12,587 --> 00:32:14,423
I'm about to become beautiful.

385
00:32:14,423 --> 00:32:16,168
This is a facial mask. Right?

386
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,478
Yes. It will feel a little cool on your skin.

387
00:32:19,478 --> 00:32:21,944
- Do you feel it?
- Yes.

388
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:27,064
Okay, I'll come back and clean your face later.

389
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:29,453
We're going to leave this on for about 15 minutes.

390
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:31,884
All right. Thank you.

391
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:46,240
- What is this cream?
- What's wrong?

392
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,702
What is this cream? My face is burning!

393
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:51,590
Are you crazy? It's burning!

394
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:59,080
Alpha hydroxy acid 50% more concentrated than the standards causes an acute allergic reaction.

395
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,880
You'll see the reaction within 5 minutes.

396
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,670
Everyone, look.

397
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,965
Look at my face.

398
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,865
Look!

399
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,401
Jessica really puts her effort into this.

400
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:18,606
When word gets out, you can't escape society's judgment no matter who you are.

401
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:23,080
No matter how many connections and how much power Miss Da has,

402
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:29,323
when she gets in trouble, no one offers to help her.

403
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:33,476
It might be because she's never been sincere with anyone.

404
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:54,026
Actually, she's quite pitiful.

405
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:01,748
As for Jessica,

406
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:09,191
she must be incredibly content and happy after getting her revenge and taking her enemy down.

407
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:10,180
You messed with the wrong person.

408
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,869
It must taste like delicious sweets.

409
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:22,978
After that, I haven't seen him for 10 months.

410
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:33,874
Hey.

411
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,447
Sorry, it's been a while.

412
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,195
I got you something.

413
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,974
Burrito.

414
00:34:54,538 --> 00:34:58,576
It's not as good as the ones you got me before, but...

415
00:34:58,576 --> 00:35:00,369
they are okay.

416
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:05,674
So I'll leave it right there for you.

You know...

419
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,408
I can eat pickles now.

420
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,633
Just like you said, one day I'd learn to like the taste of them.

421
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:41,529
Or at least you hoped that one day I'd like to appreciate the taste of pickles.

422
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:46,810
Salty and sour, just like our life.

423
00:35:49,624 --> 00:35:51,413
Well, I do now.

Maria, I miss you.

I miss you so much.

It's hard.

427
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,712
It's really, really hard.

428
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:43,972
I'm so lonely.

429
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,246
No one to talk to...

430
00:36:50,014 --> 00:36:52,675
No one to tell me what I should do...

431
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,778
like you always did.

432

Maria...

433
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:20,055
Should I go home?

434
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:24,205
Should I go...

- Hey, Grandma.

- Hey.
- What did you bring? Let me help you carry it.

438
00:37:49,712 --> 00:37:53,256
No need. Sit down. I'll serve you.

439
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,488
I tried making these dumplings.

440
00:37:57,488 --> 00:38:01,493
If they're good, I can expand my product line.

441
00:38:01,493 --> 00:38:05,360
Why don't you try these and let me know what you think?

442
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,620
Oh, what's this? This is interesting.

[Mr. Aood's Behavior Report Book]

444
00:38:14,045 --> 00:38:15,608
A love report book.

Stop.

446
00:38:16,614 --> 00:38:19,946
It's a behavior report book. Don't be funny.

447
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:25,880
A behavior report book of Avach Parinsawat...

from Pemanee Academy.

449

Aood is really something, isn't he?

450
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,120
Can I see this? I want to know his scores.

451
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,520
Even if I said you can't, you would still peep. What's the point of asking?

452
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,040
That's why you're my beloved granddaughter. You know me well.

453

Do you love me?

Wait, Pam.

Why is this all empty?

Why haven't you graded him? I want to know his scores.

I don't know how I should grade him.

You don't have to find any reason.

In some situations, your heart and feelings work better than reason.

Whatever you're comfortable with, I'm okay with it.

Are you really not going to explain anything?

479
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:45,050
Because every time we fall, we hurt.

- Grandma.
- What?

481

Can those scissors cut hair?

482
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:05,930
Yeah.

483

Can you cut my hair when you're free?

No.

You can't assume every person who gets a haircut is heartbroken.

After I cut it, you can't undo it.

Do it.

Are you sure about this?

Keeping your word doesn't work in every situation, you know?

496
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,726
I'll do whatever you want me to do about Pam.

497
00:42:32,726 --> 00:42:37,500
If keeping your word means you can't keep the person you love, then what's the point?

498
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,728
Grandpa!

499
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:40,209
What are you doing?

500
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:42,470
You know very well why.

501
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:48,690
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

502
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:53,240
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

503
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:59,370
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

504
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:06,990
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫

505
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:31,320
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

506
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,840
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

507
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,200
♫ Don't get me wrong, wrong, wrong  ♫
