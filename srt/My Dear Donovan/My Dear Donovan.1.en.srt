1
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:15,810
All right. Time to tell the truth. No more games.

2
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,779
Tell me where it is!

3
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:19,977
Where?

4
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:22,880
Everyone calls him Donovan.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,355
He's used to having wounds from fighting on his face.

6
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:29,911
Beat him.

7
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,550
All right.

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,007
So you won't answer to this.

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,292
Trouble is also his middle name.

10
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:40,981
You like it, huh?

11
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:43,041
Sure.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,840
Give him some more.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,486
Sure.

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,850
He has exceptional survival instincts in an emergency.

15
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,844
Who is he?

16
00:01:44,844 --> 00:01:49,222
You might think he's a member of the CIA or the KGB,

17
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:52,288
but in reality, he's a model.

18
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,788
He's actually quite handsome.

19
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:59,370
He's American.

20
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,223
His Thai is not very strong.

21
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:04,488
I want you to be his interpreter, Pam.

22
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:07,022
Why me, Mom?

23
00:02:07,022 --> 00:02:10,388
Many others are also good at English.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,879
Cut!

25
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,409
Got it.

26
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:19,453
- Good job, man.
- Thanks.

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,120
That was action, right?

28
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:35,200
- Please take care of it.
- Sure.

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,777
Good job.

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,892
Excuse me, Miss Ja.

31
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:46,930
The client wants to add one more scene.

32
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,264
Could you please talk to Mr. Donovan?

33
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:52,080
I'd appreciate it.

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,680
Of course.

35
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:03,226
D-Donovan.

36
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:07,739
They want to add one more scene. Could you please help?

37
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,809
No.

38
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:16,200
Please, just one last scene.

39
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,659
They can't finish the shooting without you.

40
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,948
And all the crew will not get paid.

41
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:23,980
- Could you please?
- Adding a scene out of the script...

42
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,400
It's selfish. It's unprofessional and it's unjustified.

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,529
So you go and tell them exactly what I just said, word for word.

44
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:38,736
If you can't do that, then you are not good enough to be my manager.

45
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:44,246
I don't have enough people.

46
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:46,953
I can't find someone in time.

47
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:49,470
Please help.

48
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,160
But how am I going to tell Grandpa and Grandma?

49
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,734
Grandma is not really going to be a problem, but Grandpa will be.

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,880
Just tell them you have a school tutoring job during the term break.

51
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,400
They won't check.

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,150
You know I don't really like to lie.

53
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,950
I'll give you 5,000 baht per day for your efforts.

54
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:16,610
Fine, I'll start practicing today.

55
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,956
It's a good offer though.

56
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:23,812
5,000 baht just for interpreting.

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,611
I'll use the money to buy Grandpa a birthday present.

58
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,930
Right.

59
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,161
His birthday is coming up.

60
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:38,420
Where do you plan to meet up with him?

61
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,113
Let's talk about this again when it's closer to the date.

62
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,113
Excuse me! I have another meeting to get to.

63
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,311
No! Where's my bag?

64
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,480
Once Mom finished talking about her own business, she left.

65
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,640
As usual, she never cared about me.

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,844
Whatever, I'd just focus on making money.

67
00:04:52,844 --> 00:05:00,488
At the time, I didn't know the job I took would completely change my life after I met...

68
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,606
him.

69
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,870
Who am I? I'm Pam.

70
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,680
A kindergarten teacher who is sure that she is loved by every kid in the school

71
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,522
because my beauty is extraordinary.

72
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:42,200
I'm just kidding. I understand best what it's like to be kids.

73
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,707
Let's continue picking up trash.

74
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:49,292
I live in the same house as my grandma who sells fruit shaped mung beans,

75
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,380
and my grandpa who's a retired government officer.

76
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:04,365
He earns a living by renting out his small house.

77
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,360
This is Mr. Aood, a patron who rents my grandpa's house.

78
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,933
He's also a minimart owner.

79
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,580
Hey, Miss Pam.

80
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:34,178
You're shopping a lot.

81
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,667
Yes.

82
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:39,218
Mr. Aood, I need some ideas.

83
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:41,400
My grandpa's birthday is coming up.

84
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,633
What should I get him?

85
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,800
Your grandpa loves watching clips on TV.

86
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,021
Why don't you get him a tablet?

87
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:57,100
He can watch movies and listen to music outside while enjoying the sun and fresh air.

88
00:06:58,713 --> 00:07:00,240
But will he know how to use it?

89
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,910
When I bought a TV box for him, it took me several days to teach him.

90
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,377
I'll help teach him.

91
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:11,618
He learned how to use a TV box before. This shouldn't be difficult.

92
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:14,427
Okay.

93
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,240
But I don't know much about tablets.

94
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,833
Can I do some research and ask you to help look at the reviews and specs?

95
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,966
Of course. I'll help you.

96
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:30,012
You can text me 24/7, Miss Pam.

97
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:33,355
Okay. Thanks.

98
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:37,106
You're getting a lot of stuff.

99
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,160
It's my grandma's order.

100
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,443
Do you know how tough it was for me to beg the client?

101
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,620
It's your responsibility, isn't it?

102
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,086
Yes, but you should help me too.

103
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,455
You're not the only one I take care of.

104
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:02,770
You know what? I just got a call from Ja.

105
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,015
Your manager was calling me crying and saying she wants to quit.

106
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,372
If she can't do her job, then she shouldn't. It's only right.

107
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:15,330
Listen to yourself. Who would want to work with you?

108
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,061
Whenever I try to recruit someone and they ask who they have to be a manager of,

109
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:23,356
they run away as soon as I say your name.

110
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:33,155
Are you looking for this?

111
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,510
I kept it for you as I was afraid you'd lose it.

112
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,250
Any news about her?

113
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:48,175
Nope. No news at all.

114
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:50,664
Anyway, please don't be difficult.

115
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,634
I beg you. I seriously beg you.

116
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,623
I have to go. I have a meeting with Pa at the beach.

117
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,490
I'm home.

118
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,692
The minimart is just in the middle of the alley.

119
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:57,280
What took you so long?

120
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,753
I couldn't find the fish feed you want on the shelf,

121
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:06,621
so Mr. Aood had to find it in the stockroom and that took some time.

122
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:10,590
Also, his register was broken.

123
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:22,429
Was it really broken for 3-4 hours?

124
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:24,976
Yes.

125
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,900
All right. Give me the fish feed...

126
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,730
so I can put it in the bottle.

127
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,326
Your fish feed.

128
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:37,726
Here you go.

129
00:10:40,855 --> 00:10:44,555
These are for Grandma and me.

130
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:57,020
What did your mother want?

131
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,790
She wants me to be an interpreter for her model, Sawitree.

132
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,372
You?

133
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:06,180
A model's interpreter?

134
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,644
Who is he?

135
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:10,040
Well.

136
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,076
Take this.

137
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:12,376
Okay.

138
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:19,820
- This is him.
- Wow.

139
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,723
Yes, this is it.

140
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,246
This is what you want. Right?

141
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,950
I already said yes.

142
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm only going to do it for a while for extra money.

143
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,212
Good.

144
00:11:35,212 --> 00:11:36,520
When do you start?

145
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,449
Tomorrow.

146
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:45,740
I think I'll use the money I get to buy a birthday present for Grandpa.

147
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,080
You annoyingly grateful granddaughter.

148
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,161
By the way, have you talked to your mom about that thing?

149
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:55,907
What did she say?

150
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:58,455
She wants to see Grandpa.

151
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:01,970
I told her his birthday is coming up.

152
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,398
She said she'd make plans when it's closer to the date.

153
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,120
So what do we do?

154
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,750
Sa,

155
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,393
do you think Grandpa is going to be okay with it?

156
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:19,310
I think we need to be very subtle.

157
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,370
We can't let your grandpa know or we'll be in trouble.

158
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,104
I have an idea.

159
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:27,060
Why don't we do what they did in that drama we watched last night?

160
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,680
We take him out for a meal

161
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,889
and surprise!

162
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,720
Sa!

163
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,520
What is it? You have something in your hair.

164
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,377
You're right.

165
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:41,970
He's not looking anymore.

166
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,022
We pretend to be surprised running into her.

167
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,207
Sa,

168
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,970
you're so cunning.

169
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,267
I can't help it, girl.

170
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:55,066
I'm quick-witted.

171
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,360
Of course you are.

172
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,680
Don't forget to wash your hands though.

173
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,030
Give the shoes to me.

174
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,480
Did you step in something?

175
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,622
Why did you hug them?

176
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:06,622
Shh!

177
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,867
Sis.

178
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:14,276
Did we really come all the way here to say no to her?

179
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:16,488
Aren't we putting too much effort into this?

180
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:22,690
We should say no in person, shouldn't we?

181
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:25,340
You're right.

182
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,822
I'm sorry to lose this opportunity,

183
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:32,533
but my friends warned me not to work with her.

184
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:36,350
They told me to run if I can because she's a headstrong drama queen.

185
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,160
If she wants something today, she'll want something different tomorrow.

186
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,711
She's unpredictable.

187
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,465
Even if we pull this project off, we won't be appreciated.

188
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:42,800
And if we make mistakes, we'll be in trouble.

189
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,612
She'll make sure we have no future in the industry.

190
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:46,280
Really?

191
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,920
Remember Took from the modeling agency?

192
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,520
She's now selling Pad Thai.

193
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,378
Whoa...

194
00:13:51,378 --> 00:13:55,910
But if she's really that scary, won't we be in trouble for canceling her?

195
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,310
That's why I need you to tell her in person together.

196
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,172
I have an idea.

197
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:07,080
You do?

198
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,020
She must be the one who cancels us.

199
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,800
We start by being difficult and demanding every little thing.

200
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,044
I'm good at these kinds of things.

201
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:18,400
Mineral water must be from Fiji volcanoes only.

202
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
It can't be from somewhere else because it'd smell of chlorine.

203
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,938
The cosmetics must be organic brands because our models have sensitive skin.

204
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:26,420
We'll only approve of an accommodation if it has a deluxe king-size bed or better,

205
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,892
great atmosphere, and is good for sleeping.

206
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:31,079
If we can't get all of that, then we're afraid it's a no.

207
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,777
You're really born for this.

208
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:38,888
You're such a natural asshole.

209
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,440
Is that a compliment or an insult, sis?

210
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,873
A compliment, dear.

211
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:50,033
You want to know who they're talking about. Right?

212
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,320
She's one of the most influential people in my mom's industry.

213
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,304
Yes, the word "influential" sounds a little shady.

214
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:11,589
It suits someone like her.

215
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,577
She's so perfect.

216
00:15:25,577 --> 00:15:27,150
Of course she is.

217
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,040
She has like ten personal plastic surgeons.

218
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,866
All of them are top class.

219
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,110
Hi.

220
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,288
Have you been waiting long?

221
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:52,100
I was checking out the coral reef that will be the location of my bikini brand's shoot.

222
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,750
Isn't it beautiful?

223
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,043
My friend owns this exclusive place.

224
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:59,088
It is so beautiful, Miss Da.

225
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:02,112
By the way, we have added some conditions to our contract.

226
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:05,555
Could you please take a look?

227
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,477
These are quite a lot...

228
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:16,313
but I don't mind.

229
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:19,059
Sorry? You don't mind?

230
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,156
You really don't mind at all?

231
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:24,455
Of course not.

232
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:26,955
You two seem to take good care of your models.

233
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:28,000
I like it.

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,800
I have high standards, too.

235
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,260
We're good.

236
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,956
It's a deal.

237
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,554
Their being-demanding plan doesn't work.

238
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:41,000
She seems to be okay with them.

239
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,420
Pete is probably not as half demanding as Miss Da is.

240
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,601
We're not demanding enough.

241
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:05,055
Am I too early?

242
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,280
That's the first moment I met him.

243
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,680
He's taller than I thought.

244
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,666
I accidentally looked all over his face.

245
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:44,622
His nose, eyes, eyebrows, and lips.

246
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:47,506
I looked at him for a long time.

247
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:50,314
He looks even more handsome than in photos.

248
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:05,610
You all right?

249
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:07,856
Yes.

250
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,039
I'm okay.

251
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,454
Today, I'm your translator.

252
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:17,462
Nice to meet you.

253
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,760
Parie Modeling sent you?

254
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,423
Yes.

255
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,680
Good to see you.

256
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,231
Please come to the dressing room, Mr. Donovan.

257
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:39,149
- You can follow her to the...
- I got it.

258
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,989
I guess the words are easy?

259
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:50,800
Hey! Hey!

260
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,904
Nice to meet you, Mr. Donovan.

261
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,830
Hi.

262
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm Tong, your photographer.

263
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,855
Has anyone briefed you yet?

264
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
Not yet.

265
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,670
Okay, then allow me.

266
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,510
Today's concept for shooting is grunge.

267
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,840
We want to be raw and wild.

268
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,550
We don't want to be innocent. We want to do American rock.

269
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,544
In English, "Too fast to live, too young to die."

270
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:29,540
Do you understand?

271
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,260
He wants you to...

272
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,012
I got it.

273
00:19:36,022 --> 00:19:37,057
I think his makeup is too thick.

274
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:39,357
That's why he's keeping such a straight face.

275
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:52,955
I have a feeling he understands Thai.

276
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:55,384
Why does he want me here?

277
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,620
[My Dear Donovan]

278
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:05,948
Get two more glasses and follow me quickly.

279
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:09,824
Walk carefully.

280
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,310
I brought your team some drinks and snacks.

281
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,010
Please join us.

282
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:22,778
Put them there.

283
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,520
Where are the models? I want to see them already.

284
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,320
Get Benz and Aum on camera.

285
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:38,390
There they are, Miss Da.

286
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,144
No.

287
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,430
No?

288
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,880
What do you mean by no?

289
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,489
Aum and Benz, come here. Come closer to Miss Da.

290
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,122
Is everything okay?

291
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,550
I don't want either of them.

292
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,264
You can tell us what you don't like. We'll fix it for you.

293
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:07,698
Is it the outfits, the makeup, or the hair?

294
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:10,910
I don't like anything. No more questions.

295
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,218
But you picked them when we showed you their photos.

296
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:17,329
I was okay then. I'm not okay now.

297
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:19,590
What don't you understand?

298
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,480
We understand.

299
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,042
Do you want to look at the other models?

300
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:24,490
If you like someone, we'll call them here right away.

301
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,895
We have Joseph.

302
00:21:25,895 --> 00:21:27,200
He just joined our agency.

303
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,588
He's a very good surfer and he has a super great body.

304
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,058
This is Pat.

305
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:32,090
She's...

306
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,850
Is this all you have?

307
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,650
Is this all?

308
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,473
This is all.

309
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,049
Then I guess we won't be working together.

310
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:46,109
Today is canceled.

311
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,400
Miss Da!

312
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,475
- Now she's starting to act out. See?
- Please wait.

313
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,827
How's work, Miss Pam? Is everything okay?

314
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,867
[I don't know. I'm confused. I'll send you a photo.]

315
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,280
Stop.

316
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,840
Is something wrong?

317
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,034
You can't take video and post something on social media. It's confidential.

318
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,059
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

319
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:45,006
Are you stupid?

320
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,507
Hey.

321
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:49,335
There's no need to be rude.

322
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:51,520
If you'd just explain nicely, I'd understand.

323
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,734
Snatching my phone and calling me stupid is out of line, don't you think?

324
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,760
This guy is starting to act out, too.

325
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,990
There are two more we haven't shown you yet.

326
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,735
Why didn't you show me in the first place?

327
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:14,580
At first, one of them was busy with another project

328
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,080
and we didn't think the other one would be able to come.

329
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,720
That's why we didn't present them to you.

330
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,569
What if I want these two? Would you be able to get them here?

331
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,579
We'd have to make it happen.

332
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,403
Good.

333
00:23:32,403 --> 00:23:35,649
I want these two to get here on time.

334
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,264
- Calm down.
- I know.

335
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:44,304
If I wasn't calm, I would have slapped her already.

336
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,784
You call that girl.

337
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:49,718
I'm going to call my daughter.

338
00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:03,200
Hello, Mom.

339
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,680
I was about to call you.

340
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,769
I don't want to do this interpreter job anymore.

341
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:10,680
Why not? What happened?

342
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,289
Your model is so mean.

343
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,830
I didn't know. I was just taking photos.

344
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,812
He could've just asked me nicely not to do it,

345
00:24:18,812 --> 00:24:24,320
instead of snatching my phone and calling me stupid.

346
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,944
He has no manners.

347
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:27,224
I'm not okay with this.

348
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:29,969
Wait! Don't give me a headache.

349
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,323
He's just that kind of person.

350
00:24:31,323 --> 00:24:33,655
Now I need your help with something and it's more serious than your problem.

351
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:34,610
What is it?

352
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,421
Get Dino to my set now. I'll send you the location.

353
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:38,436
What?

354
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,747
It's an urgent project.

355
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:43,249
Hurry up and get him here now.

356
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,747
What about his work here?

357
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:48,025
They've canceled him just now. They're changing the model.

358
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:50,230
The project I'm dealing with right now wants Dino.

359
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,193
Don't ask many questions. Get Dino here now.

360
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:56,984
Hold on. They can change models that easily?

361
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:59,190
It's normal in this industry.

362
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,221
Get Dino here now. Go start your car.

363
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:05,193
Why do I have to do it?

364
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:08,880
I don't want to be with him anymore. Can I not do it?

365
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,975
Pam!

366
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,298
I'm stressed out right now.

367
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:14,021
Don't mess with me.

368
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:19,720
Dino doesn't know the directions well yet.

369
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,796
Could you bring him here?

370
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:23,730
Please, I beg you.

371
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,021
Sorry.

372
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,790
Oh, hey.

373
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,216
You must come with me right now.

374
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:58,440
My mom called and told me they've canceled you.

375
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,570
They're going to change the model.

376
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,450
What's wrong? What did you do?

377
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,040
They canceled because of you.

378
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,790
What happened?

379
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,362
They don't want you anymore.

380
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:11,927
They don't want you to do this job anymore. Stop asking. Come with me.

381
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:13,388
- No, no...
- No, no, no.

382
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:16,300
We have no time. Come on.

383
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,417
Come with me now.

384
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:20,360
Come on!

385
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,062
Quickly!

386
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,496
Hey, where are you going?

387
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:29,944
Any luck?

388
00:26:29,944 --> 00:26:32,200
She won't pick up.

389
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,340
[P'Pete]

390
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,429
Can you try?

391
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,255
Did she block our numbers?

392
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:56,955
I don't know.

393
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:01,901
Kook, can I borrow your phone?

394
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,401
Quickly.

395
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:05,473
Try.

396
00:27:10,648 --> 00:27:12,030
What the fuck!

397
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,290
What the hell do they want?

398
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:17,721
Jessica is a sassy model who constantly causes trouble.

399
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,606
Hello?

400
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:22,800
So you won't pick up if it's my number?

401
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,500
Pete?

402
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,130
I was in the restroom. That's why I missed your calls.

403
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,033
I was just about to call you back.

404
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:33,667
Whose number are you calling from?

405
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,121
Stop bullshitting, Jess.

406
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,540
You yell at me every time you call.

407
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,141
That's why I don't want to pick up.

408
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:42,436
I have an urgent project for you. Are you coming?

409
00:27:42,436 --> 00:27:44,541
Do you still want to model?

410
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,929
What else would I do?

411
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,320
Become your wife?

412
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,338
Creepy. What a nonsense thing to say.

413
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:52,676
Am I not suspended from work anymore?

414
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:55,180
Get here quickly. You have only one hour, Jess.

415
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,215
Hurry.

416
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:57,606
What? An hour?

417
00:27:57,606 --> 00:28:00,424
It's such a short notice and I just woke up. I won't make it in time.

418
00:28:00,424 --> 00:28:02,065
Give me a break, Jessica.

419
00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:04,280
If you don't come, I will tear your contract.

420
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,320
Miss Parie, you're there too?

421
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,735
That means it's a very big project.

422
00:28:07,735 --> 00:28:09,981
I was just kidding.

423
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:11,550
Don't be so serious.

424
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,600
I'll quickly do my makeup, get dressed, and leave.

425
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,129
I can speed there in no time.

426
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:17,520
I'll be there in time.

427
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,169
Just send me the location.

428
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:21,913
Do not smell of liquor, Jess.

429
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:24,320
I won't. Now I feel guilty about what I did.

430
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,024
I won't make the same mistake twice.

431
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:28,233
See you. Talk later.

432
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:31,876
"Fickle" seems to be the right word to describe Jessica.

433
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,880
She's quick to go back on her words and change her actions.

434
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:40,381
In easy words, she's full of crap.

435
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:42,960
Sorry, that's a little too harsh.

436
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,600
- Why was I that harsh?
- Where are you going?

437
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,241
- You will understand later.
- Don't! I'm in a hurry.

438
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,890
What?

439
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,123
I saw them drive off.

440
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:57,913
Fix the problem.

441
00:28:57,913 --> 00:28:59,372
The shoot will happen.

442
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:01,224
Okay.

443
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:03,615
What the hell is going on?

444
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,692
Beautiful?

445
00:29:05,692 --> 00:29:07,470
I'm talking about the sea.

446
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,730
But I don't mind if any of you thinks it's me.

447
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,120
You may think I'm just chilling,

448
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,880
but I also want to work.

449
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,912
I'm tired of waiting.

450
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,220
That's so cute. I just followed you.

451
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,000
They'll be here very soon.

452
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,720
- They've already parked. Right?
- Yes.

453
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,400
They're not here in time.

454
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,603
Please pay for wasting my time. I'd rather not wait.

455
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:34,017
Actually, they arrived in time.

456
00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:35,563
They've finished parking and are currently walking here.

457
00:29:35,563 --> 00:29:37,457
They can meet you as soon as you finish drinking water.

458
00:29:37,457 --> 00:29:38,800
I don't want to wait any longer.

459
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,150
I should be dealing with more professional people instead.

460
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,920
Miss Da.

461
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,662
They've really arrived. Please have a seat.

462
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:47,741
No means no.

463
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:49,804
Please, Miss Da.

464
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,833
Here he comes.

465
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,839
Here he comes.

466
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,947
We can see his aura from here.

467
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:58,178
Please have a seat. He'll be here just in time.

468
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,633
Come.

469
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:28,640
Say hi.

470
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,320
Hi.

471
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,060
Donovan, isn't it?

472
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,876
You look better in real life than in photos.

473
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,653
We're in time, right?

474
00:30:37,427 --> 00:30:39,326
Please go get dressed.

475
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:43,209
So you're not leaving anymore. Right?

476
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:47,107
I like to give people a chance.

477
00:30:47,107 --> 00:30:49,136
Please go get dressed.

478
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,852
Pam, take Dino to get dressed.

479
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:52,787
Me?

480
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:54,627
Wait a minute.

481
00:30:54,627 --> 00:30:55,720
Hurry, Pam.

482
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,520
Hi. Parichat speaking.

483
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,587
What's the meaning of this, Pete?

484
00:30:59,587 --> 00:31:01,563
You have to take care of Dino.

485
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:04,450
The situation is chaotic right now.

486
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,250
I'll go help Pa. Okay?

487
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,400
Wait, Pete!

488
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,986
- I have to take care of him?
- Please take care of him for me.

489
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,126
The dressing room is that way.

490
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,526
Got it.

491
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,000
Come.

492
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,309
Can you check what I need to wear?

493
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,420
From there?

494
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,236
Right.

495
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:35,410
Men's outfits.

496
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,711
You need to wear...

497
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,058
I think you need to wear this outfit.

498
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:55,043
This outfit.

499
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,149
Go change.

500
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,080
Babe!

501
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,331
I've missed you.

502
00:32:05,331 --> 00:32:07,357
Come give me a hug.

503
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:14,120
Who are you?

504
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,000
You're one of the crew.

505
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,749
Could you leave us? I need to talk to him in private.

506
00:32:20,744 --> 00:32:22,363
Don't go anywhere.

507
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,396
You're in this project, too?

508
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:28,396
Yeah.

509
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,520
I know you've missed me.

510
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,840
If I'd known you'd be doing this too, I wouldn't have come.

511
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,224
Are you still mad at me?

512
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:39,440
All right, I won't bother you. We'll talk later tonight.

513
00:32:48,043 --> 00:32:49,723
See you later if you want more.

514
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,410
Understood.

515
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,949
I'll settle it when I'm back.

516
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,402
I'll hurry there.

517
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,064
What did they say?

518
00:33:13,064 --> 00:33:14,664
They cursed me like there's no tomorrow.

519
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,249
I had no choice.

520
00:33:17,249 --> 00:33:20,012
I'd rather cross them than her.

521
00:33:20,012 --> 00:33:21,012
Fair enough.

522
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,741
Help me take care of things here. I have to go.

523
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:25,476
Okay.

524
00:33:25,476 --> 00:33:26,476
Good luck.

525
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:31,243
Now I'm in trouble.

526
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,640
Where's my mom?

527
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,526
Your mom has left to deal with the people you walked out on.

528
00:33:37,526 --> 00:33:39,735
Walked out on? What does that mean?

529
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:43,240
Hold on. They didn't cancel us?

530
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,480
Yes, they did.

531
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,280
But we still need to discuss the fine.

532
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,421
I see.

533
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:56,760
Now that I've already dropped him off, I'm leaving.

534
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,406
I don't want to get back to Bangkok late.

535
00:33:58,406 --> 00:34:02,535
Pa has already left me.

536
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:04,116
Could you stay with me?

537
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,950
Please?

538
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,956
Do you need to go take care of something?

539
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:12,000
If that's the case, I can stay by myself.

540
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,489
But it will be chaotic here.

541
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,913
I'd be glad if you could stay.

542
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,584
Fine.

543
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:26,713
You're the best.

544
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:28,320
Stay and help me here.

545
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,110
My weakness is giving in to people.

546
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,101
If I give in once, I'll keep giving in non-stop.

547
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:38,381
This weakness will bring me a disaster soon.

548
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,440
- Pam.
- Yes, Pete?

549
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,920
Look how handsome he is.

550
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,680
Good.

551
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,455
This guy is very good.

552
00:34:52,455 --> 00:34:53,710
He is.

553
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,944
Why didn't you show him to me in the first place?

554
00:34:55,944 --> 00:35:00,239
He was initially busy with another project. That's why I didn't show him to you.

555
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,270
What's with that face, babe?

556
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,237
You want one more kiss?

557
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,670
What's going on between those two?

558
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,870
They're just teasing each other.

559
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:25,003
They're close friends who just behave like Westerners.

560
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,070
Really?

561
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,880
Yes. I assure you nothing is going on.

562
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,840
Hey!

563
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,116
Get to work already.

564
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:42,916
Enough playing.

565
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:44,190
All right.

566
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,100
Give me a honeymoon on the beach vibe.

567
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:52,001
Please use the product.

568
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,117
Don't cross the line.

569
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,020
I love my job.

570
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,033
Don't make me warn you again.

571
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:24,240
Hey, sorry.

572
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,810
We haven't been together...

573
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,430
We haven't worked together for a long time.

574
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:32,600
Hold on.

575
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,852
I think they're not wet enough. Make them look more wet.

576
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:37,316
Add more sweat.

577
00:36:37,316 --> 00:36:39,395
Okay.

578
00:36:52,904 --> 00:36:54,504
Excuse me.

579
00:36:58,596 --> 00:36:59,523
What the hell!

580
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:01,760
I'm giving you more sweat. I said I want you to look more wet.

581
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,025
This is not sweat. It's wet.

582
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:08,860
I want to highlight that the product is both sunproof and water-resistant.

583
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,240
Hey.

584
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,215
You want to highlight the product? Fine.

585
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,280
There's a moment when I secretly wondered what I was doing here.

586
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,270
Everyone knows the wet look thing is just an excuse.

587
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:34,560
If those two were alone, they would be spraying water into each other's eyes.

588
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,523
Am I highlighting the product enough?

589
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:39,290
You look very good.

590
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,821
Your idea is brilliant.

591
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:43,398
You made me look even more stunning.

592
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,183
Let's continue shooting before it gets dark.

593
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:04,123
Besides keeping Pete company, I'm watching two women fight over that guy.

594
00:38:04,123 --> 00:38:06,984
Besides his look, there's nothing interesting about him.

595
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:11,613
Is it worth doing this for the 5,000 baht?

596
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,212
You're okay with our work today. Right?

597
00:38:19,212 --> 00:38:20,627
Of course.

598
00:38:20,627 --> 00:38:23,970
Great job. Let me treat you guys to dinner.

599
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,403
I also want to talk to Donovan about tomorrow's shoot.

600
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:29,126
To make sure he understands the concept.

601
00:38:29,126 --> 00:38:31,255
We'd love that.

602
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,580
Let's meet at 8:00 p.m. sharp. Tell him not to be late.

603
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,087
He won't.

604
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,452
I thought you were going to leave after dropping me off,

605
00:38:55,452 --> 00:38:57,180
but you stayed until the end.

606
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,910
I didn't want to, but Pete asked me to.

607
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,880
Really?

608
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,537
Why do you give in to people's requests easily but won't stop fighting with me?

609
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,667
Because other people speak to me nicely and respect me.

610
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:17,404
Unlike you who totally has no manners.

611
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:23,227
Was that too harsh?

612
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:27,950
No.

613
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,710
That was honest.

614
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,880
You're leaving. Right? Can I tag along?

615
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,100
What?

616
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,246
Can I tag along?

617
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:39,840
Hey.

618
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,390
Are you done? You should get ready.

619
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,910
For what? I thought my work was done.

620
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,003
I'm about to leave.

621
00:39:46,003 --> 00:39:48,643
No, you have another day of shooting tomorrow.

622
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:51,400
Wait.

623
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,660
Pa didn't tell you?

624
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,063
No.

625
00:39:55,063 --> 00:39:56,664
Well, I'm telling you now.

626
00:39:56,664 --> 00:39:59,606
There's still one more product shot. We'll finish by late morning.

627
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,993
Miss Da has already booked you a room.

628
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:05,963
And we have dinner with her at 8:00 p.m. She wants to treat us.

629
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:07,020
Why?

630
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,520
She seems very pleased with you.

631
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,603
You might get to work with her long-term.

632
00:40:12,603 --> 00:40:16,560
Behave yourself and don't be moody, please.

633
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,890
I beg you.

634
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,098
I think dinner is out of scope for me.

635
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:23,895
It's about being polite and making friends with her.

636
00:40:23,895 --> 00:40:25,686
If you guys become good friends,

637
00:40:25,686 --> 00:40:27,587
she will keep giving you projects.

638
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:28,870
Don't you want to get famous?

639
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,236
Now is your chance.

640
00:40:31,236 --> 00:40:34,620
It's a win-win.

641
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:39,400
Since this doesn't concern me, I think I should go.

642
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,403
I don't want to drive in the dark. Bye, Pete.

643
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:42,904
Wait, Pam.

644
00:40:42,904 --> 00:40:44,209
Don't go yet.

645
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,650
I don't want you to drive back alone in the dark.

646
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,692
It's dangerous.

647
00:40:47,692 --> 00:40:50,418
Let's go back together after the morning shoot tomorrow.

648
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:54,250
But I haven't told my family.

649
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,477
You can call them.

650
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:57,305
Please, Pam. Please stay here tonight.

651
00:40:57,305 --> 00:41:00,203
I don't want you to drive back alone at night.

652
00:41:00,203 --> 00:41:04,320
Pa will kill me if you get into an accident.

653
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,550
I'm really worried about you.

654
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,210
Besides, you're an adult.

655
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,243
You'll be fine not going home for one night.

656
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:12,743
Please.

657
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,289
Don't forget our 8:00 p.m. dinner.

658
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:17,989
See you.

659
00:41:22,486 --> 00:41:27,020
Would you like to go to dinner with me?

660
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,740
No.

661
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,300
She wants to talk to you, not me.

662
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,735
But what are you going to eat?

663
00:41:35,735 --> 00:41:39,650
I don't know. I'll just find something stupid to eat.

664
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,750
Stupid?

665
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,690
Yeah.

666
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,600
Pam's calling.

667
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,864
Can you pick up?

668
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:01,563
My hands are dirty.

669
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:03,063
Sure.

670
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,193
Hello, Miss Pam.

671
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,570
It's Mr. Aood here.

672
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,580
Hey. Where's Grandma?

673
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,680
Your grandma's hands are dirty from making fruit-shaped mung beans,

674
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,664
so she asked me to pick up your call. Is everything all right?

675
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,576
I see.

676
00:42:22,576 --> 00:42:27,907
Well, I need your help.

677
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,289
I'm at the beach right now.

678
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:31,840
The beach?

679
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,160
But you were in Meng Jai this morning.

680
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,298
It's quite a long story.

681
00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:41,544
Now I randomly have to stay here tonight.

682
00:42:41,544 --> 00:42:45,729
Could you help me explain this to Grandma?

683
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,800
Please?

684
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,850
You know I'm not good at lying

685
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,960
and I won't get away with it.

686
00:42:56,412 --> 00:42:57,636
All right.

687
00:42:58,455 --> 00:43:00,450
Thanks, Mr. Aood.

688
00:43:01,427 --> 00:43:02,427
All right.

689
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,940
Thanks, Mr. Aood.

690
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,440
She's staying at the beach tonight.

691
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,800
At the beach?

692
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,615
Who?

693
00:43:19,428 --> 00:43:21,120
Why is he there?

694
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,972
Pam?

695
00:43:22,972 --> 00:43:25,630
Where is she staying tonight?

696
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:29,064
Oh...

697
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,400
We were talking about the bat.

698
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,446
We saw a big one flying by just now.

699
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,410
Pam is on a work trip

700
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,276
and she has to stay the night in that city.

701
00:43:44,276 --> 00:43:46,772
She already told me, but I forgot to tell you.

702
00:43:46,772 --> 00:43:48,410
I forgot.

703
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,289
Anyway, why did you come downstairs?

704
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:51,901
Why aren't you sleeping? Your blood pressure could go up.

705
00:43:51,901 --> 00:43:54,300
Go to bed.

706
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,101
The air conditioner is making some noise.

707
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,640
I can't sleep.

708
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,070
Let me go take a look.

709
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,403
That'd be nice.

710
00:44:03,403 --> 00:44:05,892
- Sure.
- Go.

711
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,018
Which one?

712
00:44:08,018 --> 00:44:10,120
The one in my bedroom.

713
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,320
- It's not cooling, right?
- It's making noise.

714
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,226
Yes. It's so annoying.

715
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,540
Room service. You have a food delivery, ma'am.

716
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,098
I think you got the wrong room. I didn't order anything.

717
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,670
No, someone ordered this for you.

718
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,815
Oh, okay.

719
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:51,050
I can bring it inside by myself.

720
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,850
Thank you.

721
00:45:22,332 --> 00:45:23,332
Wow.

722
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:42,840
An English message? It can't be anyone else other than him.

723
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,163
Turns out that guy can be nice, huh.
[Enjoy your dinner]

724
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:50,561
I guess some people just don't know how to say sorry directly.

725
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:57,320
But actually, I'm envious of someone like him, who's cold and doesn't care about anyone.

726
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,110
He doesn't care who hates him, whereas I care about everything.

727
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,250
Bye, Mom.

728
00:46:09,692 --> 00:46:11,592
Bye, Dad.

729
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,470
What I'm most afraid of is being hated, no matter by whom.

730
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,480
You know why?

731
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,743
Because my mom left me when I was a kid.

732
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,590
Come up!

733
00:47:17,606 --> 00:47:20,580
Hey! What are you doing?

734
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,675
- Pull me up first.
- Come here.

735
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,387
You pervert! What are you doing?

736
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:52,290
In the 24 years of my life,

737
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,460
today is the most chaotic day I've ever experienced!

738
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,350
I'm starting to wonder.

739
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,790
If your Thai is this good, why did you hire me as your interpreter?

740
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:08,030
I don't want an interpreter, I want a manager.

741
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,040
What? I was tricked?

742
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,000
Have you seen Donovan?

743
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,156
I don't know anything.

744
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:13,981
Wait.

745
00:48:13,981 --> 00:48:15,618
A whole person has disappeared.

746
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:19,046
She got into your room. What are you going to do?

747
00:48:19,046 --> 00:48:21,273
I give you another hour, babe.

748
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,320
I probably can't return to my room tonight.

749
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,756
Oh? Then where will you sleep tonight?

750
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:33,390
♫ Who said that I'm so hot? ♫

751
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,930
♫ Sorry, if my hair looks too hot ♫

752
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:40,030
♫ What, a womanizer? It's not true!
(Don't believe it, don't believe what he says) ♫

753
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:46,130
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

754
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:50,820
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

755
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:56,870
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.

756
00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:04,150

757
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:18,280
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.

758
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,970
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes ♫

759

♫ I want you to try to open your mind ♫
