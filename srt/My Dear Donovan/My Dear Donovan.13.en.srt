1
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:06,080
Dino!

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,155
I'm going to walk in Milan Fashion Week.

3
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:11,240
I'm so happy for you!

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,540
I gave you a chance, but you threw it away.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,860
Now what?

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,343
Everyone already knows.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,295
I know you've been worried since the day I went silent.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,106
I went silent...

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:59,140
because I was thinking over our relationship.

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,320
I admit that I was shocked.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,470
I was unprepared.

12
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:13,124
I didn't know how to handle the situation.

13
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:20,115
I didn't know what to do,

14
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:24,035
except getting myself out of there as soon as possible to compose myself.

15
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:34,846
I admit that I don't know everything about your past...

16
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,750
but I know who you really are...

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,845
and I believe...

18
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,211
you will have reasonable explanations for me.

19
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,561
I'm willing to understand you.

20
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,419
Thank you, Pam,

21
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,853
for giving me a chance.

22
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:37,300
I will tell you everything.

23
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,246
He then starts telling me everything about his past that he's never told anyone.

24
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:50,799
Stop!

25
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:56,727
Maria!

26
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,087
Maria!

27
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,197
Hang on, Maria. Keep going.

28
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,360
You gotta stand up. I know it hurts.

29
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,483
Come on.

30
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:19,907
It's him!

31
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,470
Stop!

32
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,066
In a country where there's serious law enforcement,

33
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,572
everyone must equally abide by it.

34
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:32,644
There's no exception for anyone.

35
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:35,200
Shortly after the incident,

36
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,220
he was imprisoned by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision.

37
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,440
As for Maria, she was treated in a safe place.

38
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,650
There's nothing to worry about in her case.

39
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,662
If anyone should be worried about, it was Donovan.

40
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:56,462
That's the whole truth about what I have been through.

41
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:05,675
His face, eyes, and feelings are telling me that everything he said is true.

42
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:09,554
How do you feel after hearing my story?

43
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,540
Are you mad at me?

44
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,635
I am.

45
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:25,523
I'm really mad at you.

46
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,695
When I saw your news,

47
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,710
I was so shocked.

48
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,140
I tried to tell myself that it was not true.

49
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,160
I thought Miss Da must be trying to play me against you like she did everyone else.

50
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:52,925
But it turns out to be true.

51
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:59,730
After that, there has been a lot of news about you.

52
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,444
When I saw them,

53
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,810
I felt something I can't explain.

54
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:19,154
I...

55
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:23,755
I felt bad.

56
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:27,655
I felt confused. I felt lost.

57
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:30,097
I didn't know what to do.

58
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,997
You're too mysterious.

59
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:43,535
I can't get through your walls.

60
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,321
I wasn't sure if I should try to accept you or walk away from you.

61
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,352
I tried many times to stop involving myself with you, but I couldn't.

62
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:14,265
This time,

63
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:18,935
I thought I finally could...

64
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,615
but I ended up here in front of you...

65
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:40,174
because I don't want to lie to myself about my feelings.

66
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,762
The more I try not to care, not to think of you,

67
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:54,709
the more it hurts inside me.

68
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:07,290
I don't want to be like this. I pity myself.

69
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,580
I'm weak.

70
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,480
And silly about love.

71
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,254
Don't cry, Pam.

72
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,501
I don't like this. I don't want to feel this way.

73
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,955
There, I've told you all about my feelings.

74
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,996
Dino,

75
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,610
I want to know the real you...

76
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,695
who doesn't hide anything from me.

77
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,455
No matter what happens,

78
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,101
no matter how bad it is,

79
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,485
I want to get through it with you...

80
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,234
because I want good love.

81
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:29,510
I want a good relationship with you.

82
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,515
Can you give me that?

83
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,841
Is it possible, Dino?

84
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,820
Pam.

85
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,250
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,410
No matter if he's a murderer or a famous model,

87
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,480
no matter what he's been through in the past,

88
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,332
to me, right now, he's just a guy who's falling apart.

89
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,730
Guys, I must talk about the news.

90
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,215
I'm so shocked.

91
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:32,440
I never thought he could be so cold-blooded.

92
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,651
But actually, I've been a victim of his fury before.

93
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,295
I'd rather not talk about it.

94
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:46,700
I'm scared.

95
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,100
I'm so scared.

96
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,220
I'm scared he will hurt me.

97
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,820
Please pray for me.

98
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,775
Please hashtag #SaveJessica.

99
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,068
Thanks, everyone.

100
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:05,536
Best acting I've ever done. Don't you think?

101
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:06,845
I'm about to cry.

102
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:09,379
Oh, poor little girl.

103
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,073
I will be safe. Right?

104
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,780
Will he come for me?

105
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,985
I'm so scared.

106
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:19,570
I'm so, so scared.

107
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,860
Don't be.

108
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,865
Let's have fun.

109
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:29,498
You're the police and I'm the murderer.

[Oasis Minimart]

111
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,334
I think that's clean enough.

112
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:54,530
What are you doing here? Have you finished organizing the store?

113
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,270
I heard the water. I thought there was a leak,

114
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,909
but it turns out you're the leaker.

115
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,960
Anyway, did Pam eat the food you brought her?

116
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,210
Yes.

117
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,885
Then, why were you zoning out here?

118
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:11,125
She ate the food you cooked. You should be happy.

119
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,940
Why didn't you pick her up from school?

120
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,830
I shouldn't have to be teaching you about something so easy.

121
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:24,010
You're like this because she went with her model boyfriend. Right?

122
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,025
Why are you rubbing salt in the wound?

123
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:30,045
Get back to organizing.

124
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,806
Wait.

125
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:40,840
You know who Miss Pam's boyfriend is?

126
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:45,660
You want to know.

127
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,410
Look! You're not the only phone owner in this world.

128
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,765
Do you think he will hurt Miss Pam?

129
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,348
If you're worried about her, why don't you secretly follow her?

130
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,515
But I don't think he will hurt Miss Pam.

131
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:10,070
She doesn't seem like a stupid person. She should be able to tell good from bad guys.

132
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,960
Okay.

133
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,436
I won't bother you anymore.

134

Welcome to Jubilee Diamond.

- I'll get that whole set.
- You got it.

136
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,540
I want the 250,000 one and the 230,000 one.

137
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,801
- Actually, I'll get everything in this row.
- You got it.

138
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,661
- That whole set too.
- You got it.

139
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:34,519
Let me also try on your new expensive products.

140
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,505
Yes, ma'am.

00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,922
- Hurry up.
- You got it. It'll be just a moment.

What is it now, Pete?

144
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,160
Today is my day off. Let's take a break from work.

145
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,060
Sure, you will get a long break because the clients canceled all your jobs.

146
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,980
I just called to let you know.

147
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,640
Wait.

148
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,920
Why did they cancel my jobs?

149
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,900
Don't ask the reason.

150
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,580
I have a bad headache right now.

151
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,438
What the fuck!

152
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,915
Can I help you?

153
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:32,610
I'm here to see the old bitch.

154
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,495
Who?

155
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:34,870
That bitch Da.

156
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,980
She's here, isn't she? Which room is she in?

157
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,501
You can't go in.

158
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:42,370
Excuse me! You can't go in.

159
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,690
Get up and talk to me now.

160
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,345
- Miss Da was about to get a facial fat transfer.
- What do you want?

161
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:52,335
- She'll still probably get it later.
- It's none of your business.

162
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:54,675
I don't care what freaking injection you're getting.

163
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:57,790
Why did you cancel all my jobs? How could you do this?

164
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,435
Donovan is a murderer, and how is that related to me?

00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,460
it's only natural that you fall too.

168
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,320
You wouldn't even be getting jobs today if you didn't sleep your way to it.

169
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,606
You bitch. You're talking shit.

170
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:15,028
I won't leave until I get to slap you.

171
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,115
Don't you know how expensive that is?

172
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:23,480
I don't care.

173
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,419
You're an old bitch. The fat injection would have collected in your double chin.

174
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,330
What are you doing, you lowlife?

175
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,114
I'm going to inject this to your foul mouth.

176
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:56,340
What should we do, Doctor?

177
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,880
Don't do what they did, or you'll get yourself in trouble.

178
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,580
You can only inject your own fat.

179
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,160
Soon, her body will create antibodies to fight it.

180
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,060
The injected area can get rotten, infected or swollen. Anything can happen.

181
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,162
And I don't know what will follow.

182
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,955
If you're looking for a silver lining in the middle of this storm,

183
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:29,130
it's that when you fail, you have a chance to start again.

[Famous Model Holds Press Conference]

185
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,494
Don't worry.

186
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:38,464
Did I make the right decision?

187
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:42,558
You're doing the right thing.

188
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,200
Go tell people everything.

189
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,240
Tell them what you told me.

190
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,610
I believe everyone will understand and give you a chance...

191
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,430
like I did.

192
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,827
No matter the results,

193
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:22,234
I will always be by your side.

194
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,849
Let's go.

195
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,657
Donovan is here.

196
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,330
The photo of me in a prison uniform is a real one.

197
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,596
It's not edited.

198
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,214
I really went to prison in America.

199

[Model D. Admits to Spending Time in Prison]

200
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,815
I didn't live a comfortable life in America.

201
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:30,890
My sister and I lived together in New York, just the two of us.

202
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,713
I did everything to survive.

203
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,420
I earned money from collecting trash and selling it.

204
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,566
I did underground boxing.

205
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,110
I had to get hurt to earn more money than I could get from anywhere else.

206
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,480
I wanted to take care of my sister.

207
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,283
I didn't want her to struggle.

208
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,971
We helped each other make money.

209
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:06,964
We wanted a better life.

210
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,137
Cheers.

211
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:18,786
We ate leftovers from restaurants.

212
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:23,667
But before we could get a glimpse of a good life,

213
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,296
something happened.

214
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:32,827
Stop!

215
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,123
Maria!

216
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,374
Maria!

217
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:42,829
Are you okay?

218
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,041
Who did this?

219
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,991
My sister...

220
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,238
was raped.

221
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,571
I ran after the rapist.

222
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:22,975
I was arrested by the police and sentenced to prison,

223
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:25,877
but not for the murder charge.

224
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,114
That rapist is still living in a prison cell somewhere.

225
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,520
The court ruled that I used excessive force.

226
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,586
My history as an underground boxer made the court think I was a threat to society.

227
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:48,417
I was immediately sentenced to two years in prison.

228
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,720
After getting her treatment and rest,

229
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,788
Maria paid me a few visits in the beginning,

230
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,963
but I told her not to waste her time visiting me.

231
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,910
We called each other from time to time.

232
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,710
But in the last six months of my sentence,

233
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,181
we lost contact.

234
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:16,308
I got news about her again on the day I was released.

235

[Love you, my little brother]

236
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,061
Maria disappeared without telling me anything.

237
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,195
Not even a goodbye.

238
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:55,090
The only thing I know about her is that she moved to Thailand.

239
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,692
So I left everything in America and came here to find her.

240
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,253
I hope I will get to see her once.

241
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:13,010
I want to hear from her the reason why she ran away from me to here.

242
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:30,436
Maria...

243
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:37,647
If you're out there, if you see this...

244
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm here.

245
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,625

I miss you so much.

So please... come and find me.

00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:17,211
Thank you.

251
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:31,720
I want to apologize to you.

252
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:37,760
I'm sorry for writing those bad headlines about your imprisonment...

253
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,447
and making most people see you in a bad light.

254
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,488
It's all right.

255
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,662
Everyone makes mistakes.

256
00:22:55,335 --> 00:23:01,297
That's all I wanted to say today.

So please... come and find me.

258

I'll be waiting.

He's been through a lot in his life, hasn't he?

260
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:44,626
Pam must be there.

261
00:23:44,626 --> 00:23:48,752
When I opened the store this morning, I saw her car drive past.

262
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:56,503
I guess you're officially the losing second male lead now.

263
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,638
Losing what?

264
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,220
Aren't your legs so comfortable?

265
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,115
- Do you want to put them on my neck?
- Can I?

266
00:24:05,115 --> 00:24:06,360
Stop it.

267
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,206
Go check the stock.

268
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,127
When you can't argue, you abuse your power.

269
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:16,025
Wait.

270
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:19,785
Now you can relax because he's not a bad guy.

271
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:21,480
Go.

272
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,091
Why do you have to raise your voice?

273
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:25,635
Are you an employer or employee?

274
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:31,197
Dino has been going there for six months now.

275
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,710
Yes.

276
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,691
I've been there but didn't find her.

277
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:42,669
Thank you, Mom.

278
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,346
Thank you so much.

279
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,160
Mom and Pete called to say they were watching your press conference.

280
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,950
They also asked me to apologize that they're busy with work

281
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,445
and couldn't be here for you.

282
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:18,752
It's okay. Having you beside me is enough.

283
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:21,995
Pam.

284
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:26,193
Thank you for still being with me.

285
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,826
The press all sympathize with you.

286
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,021
You gave a really good speech, you know?

287
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,915
I don't care what anyone else says or thinks.

288
00:25:45,915 --> 00:25:48,638
I only care about your feelings.

289
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,770
Let's get through anything together from now on.

290
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,095
Everyone makes mistakes.

291
00:25:56,095 --> 00:26:00,955
We just need to find someone who will accept our flaws and mistakes,

292
00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:04,965
and help make sure we don't make the same mistakes again.

293
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:15,110
Damn.

294
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,408
From a murderer to a poor soul.

295
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:21,544
Watching this gives me goosebumps.

296
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,950
Oh, my god.

297
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,696
Oh, my god!

298
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:44,445
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

299
00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:47,544
Are they going to believe everything he said?

300
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,508
What can I do to finally take you down?

301
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:08,586
It actually feels good letting it all out.

302
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:16,000
You're no longer feeling uncomfortable. Everyone else understands you.

303
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,500
See?

304
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:23,784
I've been having nightmares about this for a very long time.

305
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:30,336
The guilt in my heart never went away.

306
00:27:33,455 --> 00:27:35,845
At first, I was scared.

307
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,843
I was scared that if I reopen my wound and tell everyone,

308
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,884
it wouldn't stop bleeding.

309
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:58,203
But it turns out that it's getting healed, because of you.

310
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:13,195
Your wound has formed a scab.

311
00:28:13,195 --> 00:28:15,267
It's almost healed.

312
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:21,825
I knew you had things to say,

313
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:29,589
but you just felt that you wanted to get through your situation by yourself.

314
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,593
I don't want you drowning in pain anymore.

315
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,047
You see?

316
00:28:41,445 --> 00:28:44,082
You're the perfect manager for me.

317
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,459
If you hadn't told me to hold a press conference,

318
00:28:49,655 --> 00:28:52,481
I would still be stuck in my trauma.

319
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,854
You're really amazing.

320
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:07,520
What he said reminds me of the day when I felt so lost.

321
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,097
He became a light in my life.

322
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:24,960
You want a high five?

323
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,680
Sometimes, we have to act like a mirror for people around us.

324
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,930
Not to tell them what's good and bad about them,

325
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:39,272
but to reflect light and positive energy we receive back to them when they need it.

326
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,975
Wait. Is my hair messy?

327
00:29:55,975 --> 00:29:57,275
No.

328
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,730
I just want to see your face more clearly.

329
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:02,864
I want to remember this.

330
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:09,577
Will you tie my hair for me?

331
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
Pam,

332
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,179
- I've never done this before.
- Try it.

333
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,889
Dino.

334
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:05,861
Let's get our stuff.

335
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:13,461
Oh, you're still here.

336
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:15,564
I'll leave after I get my stuff.

337
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,435
I watched your press conference.

338
00:31:19,435 --> 00:31:21,240
Are you okay?

339
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,005
I'm sorry for not being there.

340
00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:26,072
It's all right.

341
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:29,375
I guess I'm okay now.

342
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,625
I said everything.

343
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:36,623
Pa asked me to give you something.

344
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,150
What's this?

345
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,610
Pa and I haven't been ignoring your search.

346
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,946
We tried to contact Maria's old agency to find her address,

347
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:50,760
but no one knows where she disappeared.

348
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,675
We just heard from Pam earlier that she sends you money every month,

349
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:59,040
so I used my connections to get you her address.

350
00:32:00,345 --> 00:32:02,298
Maria lives there?

351
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,700
Go check. I hope you find your sister soon.

352
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,805
Thank you so much.

353
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,015
Don't forget to lock the door for me.

354
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,530
I'm going on a date.

355
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,614
- Bye, Pete.
- Bye.

356
00:32:18,655 --> 00:32:19,400
Pam.

357
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,945
The little sparkle of hope he almost lost is shining again.

358
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,165
You don't only get bad things.

359
00:32:27,165 --> 00:32:31,959
A lot of time, good things keep happening, too.

360
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,805
He's really close to achieving his life goal.

361
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:50,427
This is the right house.

362
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:52,715
Let's go.

363
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:54,695
Not yet.

364
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,269
Are you nervous?

365
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,984
Not really.

366
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:11,125
But I'm feeling so many things.

367
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:14,853
Pam, I don't know what to say.

368
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:20,311
I don't want... I don't know what to do, I don't know what to talk to her about.

369
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:23,116
It's been years...

370
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:25,483
It's been years since I've seen her.

371
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:27,217
Why is our life like this?

372
00:33:27,217 --> 00:33:28,903
I hate this.

373
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:33,270
And there's this... doubt that keeps eating me up inside.

374
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,280
I've been in the media a lot, right?

375
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,708
I'm sort of famous now.

376
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:47,911
Every time I've been on TV or been in public, I've asked for her to reach out to me.

377
00:33:47,911 --> 00:33:49,763
All for nothing.

378
00:33:53,142 --> 00:33:55,007
What does it mean?

379
00:33:56,657 --> 00:34:00,676
I hope one day that you'd learn to appreciate the taste of pickles.

380
00:34:00,676 --> 00:34:02,131
What if the reason why she...

381
00:34:02,131 --> 00:34:04,340
I mean, like our life.

382
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,880
The reason why sh-she hasn't reached out to me is because she doesn't want me in her life.

383
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,138
She... She...

384
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:14,496
Me being here is just a bother to her, then...

385
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:19,194
Wha... What if all that... all that work for has been for nothing...

386
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:21,825
- What if... I can't...
- Dino.

387
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:24,440
- I... I...
- Dino.

388
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,900
- Dino, Dino.
- What?

389
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,300
Hey.

390
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,050
Calm down.

391
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,411
Take a deep breath.

392
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,170
Calm down. Okay?

393
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,691
Listen to me.

394
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,727
We will never know what will happen...

395
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:54,253
until we go in there.

396
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:03,565
Ready?

397
00:35:04,823 --> 00:35:06,315
Okay.

398
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:07,542
Let's go.

399
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:14,800
Wait.

400
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,460
Huh? What?

401
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,720
Here.

402
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,114
You have to look presentable for your beautiful sister.

403
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:27,335
Okay.

404
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:28,635
Let's go.

405
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:37,576
Behind this gate lies an answer that will change his life completely.

406
00:36:01,135 --> 00:36:02,994
Who are you here to see?

407
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,590
Oh.

408
00:36:05,945 --> 00:36:08,065
Sorry.

409
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:13,290
I don't think this is the right house, Dino.

410
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,700
Is Maria here?

411
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,610
Maria?

412
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,475
I'm leaving for work soon.

413
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:24,905
Is everything all right?

414
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:25,995
Yes.

415
00:36:25,995 --> 00:36:27,711
They've just got the wrong house.

416
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:30,730
I'll tell them the directions.

417
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,115
But I've been told this is Maria's address.

418
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:36,480
I don't know anyone named Maria.

419
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,280
Wait.

420
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,321
You look very familiar.

421
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,900
Have we met before?

422
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,271
No.

423
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,108
Sorry.

424
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:52,775
Wait.

425
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,440
You know Maria, don't you?

426
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,840
No.

427
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,043
Sorry, my husband has to go to work.

428
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,968
Sorry.

429
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,786
Come on. I don't think it's this house.

430
00:37:11,786 --> 00:37:13,480
Let's keep looking.

431
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,240
Dino is sure that woman knows his sister.

432
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,972
But why is she not telling the truth?

433
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,033
What are you doing?

434
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:37,611
Come on.

435
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,055
When I'm stressed, you always help me relax.

436
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,222
Now I'm going to return the favor.

437
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,765
I think boxing can make you feel better.

438
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:53,565
Come on.

439
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,030
Give me your other hand.

440
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,505
In this outfit?

441
00:38:08,505 --> 00:38:11,195
Yes. You don't need to change.

442
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:13,285
You can do it.

443
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:14,930
Okay.

444
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,435
Come on!

445
00:38:16,435 --> 00:38:18,000
Quickly.

446
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,785
Quickly. I'm ready.

447
00:38:19,785 --> 00:38:21,352
Get up.

448
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,935
I'm tired.

449
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:31,560
You know I have a lot of energy.

450
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,247
The fact that you're bragging means you're already feeling better.

451
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,225
I don't know.

452
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:41,225
I guess I am.

453
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,191
Don't worry.

454
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,543
We will find Maria.

455
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:54,665
We will definitely find her.

456
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,314
Maybe.

457
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,086
No matter what happens,

458
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,499
I will always be by your side.

459
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,338
What's going on?

460
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:58,700
There's still hope of finding his sister.

461
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:04,859
My instincts tell me this time he might finally get to see her.

462
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,610
All this time Maria was gone, he's been wondering where she is.

463
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:15,880
What reason does she have to keep it from him or cutting contact with him?

464
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,500
Does she hate him? Is she angry at him? Is she being locked away?

465
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,880
None of the reasons he could think of makes sense to him.

466
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,328
Maybe the only reason that does is something he's afraid to accept.

467
00:40:47,885 --> 00:40:51,278
I'm sorry about yesterday.

468
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,943
I didn't want to cross my husband.

469
00:40:56,685 --> 00:41:00,575
So you do know Maria?

470
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:05,864
Yes. I knew her.

471
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,924
We used to date.

472
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:52,575
Where is she?

473
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:55,365
Outside.

474
00:41:55,365 --> 00:41:57,740
Follow me.

475
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,120
Outside?

476
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,018
Come on, let's go.

477
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,385

I feel that life is so uncertain.

480
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,954
Pam, do you want to move in with me?

481
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,531
Grandpa, I have a boyfriend.

482
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,240
You know your boyfriend was a murderer before.

483
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,953
Aren't you afraid he'll commit more crimes without your knowledge?
