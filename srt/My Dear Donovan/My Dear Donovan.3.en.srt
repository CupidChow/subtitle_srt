1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,400
Does anyone know how much the surgery cost is, approximately?

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,440
It's about 500,000 THB.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,880
Don't worry about the expense.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,370
I'll handle it.

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,330
I choose to die rather than accept your help.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,710
I know you need money.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,170
I don't have a manager yet.

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,530
I want you for the job.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,223
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

10
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:26,643
It's not because I feel sorry for you,

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,470
but you did a really good job.

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,520
I'm saying this from my heart.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,910
I'll tell your mom you're going to work with me.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,400
Though I have to warn you,

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,829
working with me is not easy.

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:10,080
Actually, I've never worked as a manager before.

17
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,150
It's not easy,

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,410
but I think you can do it.

19
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,050
All right.

20
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,840
Thank you.

21
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,140
Thank you so much.

22
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,720
I'm going to tell my grandma now.

23
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,440
Where's Grandma?

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,920
She's gone to the restroom.

25
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,880
Is everything all right?

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,280
I've already figured out how to earn money for Grandpa's surgery cost.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,980
How?

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,240
I'll work at your company, Mom.

29
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,840
What?

30
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,270
I just spoke with Donovan.

31
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,520
He said he wants me to be his manager.

32
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,940
Are you sure you're up to the task?

33
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,280
Just the other day, you said you never wanted to do it again.

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,053
If it's the best and only way to earn money without bothering others,

35
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,350
I think I can do it.

36
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,686
But will your grandpa let you work with me?

37
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,900
I'll talk to him myself.

38
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,160
Thanks.

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,500
What's up, Pam?

40
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,220
How are you feeling?

41
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,630
I'm still alive.

42
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,570
Grandpa, you always say these kinds of things.

43
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,110
Anyway, I'll take a part-time job to pay for your treatment.

44
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,070
What job?

45
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,780
A personal manager.

46
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,500
Of whom? Your mom?

47
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,370
No.

48
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,820
Really?

49
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:20,310
Her company is not the only modeling agency in the world.

50
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,750
I'm going to work for a place that my friend recommended to me.

51
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,150
They need someone who can speak English.

52
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:29,950
Don't tire yourself out.

53
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,720
I'm dying soon. Why waste money to get me treatment?

54
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,550
Why do you say that?

55
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,993
It hurts me, you know?

56
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,230
I want you to be with me for a long time.

57
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,428
If we don't have money to pay them, we can sell our house and land.

58
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:56,188
Then we can rent a small place to live.

59
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,710
I don't want to burden you.

60
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,160
You're not a burden at all.

61
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,270
I can do it.

62
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,080
It's the school break and I have free time.

63
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,170
Getting a job is the best thing to do.

64
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,954
We don't have to sell the house.

65
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,580
Please, Grandpa.

66
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,830
Let me do it.

67
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:29,750
You didn't say no, so I'll assume you're already aware.

68
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:32,912
Come on.

69
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:35,168
I love you, Grandpa.

70
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,140
Get well soon so you can go back to our home. Okay?

71
00:05:47,672 --> 00:05:49,144
Thank you.

72
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:51,064
Put that on the bill.

73
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,686
Here you go, Miss Pam.

74
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,823
I take it you couldn't sleep.

75
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,670
I had something on my mind.

76
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,340
Is it really fine with you to work with that guy, Miss Pam?

77
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,026
I overheard you talk with your mom.

78
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,400
At first, I wasn't quite okay with that.

79
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,630
But as we get to talk more,

80
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,550
I feel he's not a bad guy.

81
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,830
So that means I have a rival now.

82
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,430
I don't have feelings for him.

83
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,600
Great.

84
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,210
I don't have feelings for you, either.

85
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,120
Ouch.

86
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,320
That's harsh.

87
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,078
You really hit the spot.

88
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,840
Anyway, if you're no longer okay, you can tell me.

89
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,220
I'm ready to support you 24/7.

90
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,210
Feel free to call me at 2:00, 3:00, or 4:00 a.m.

91
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,730
I'll certainly answer.

92
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,083
Mr. Aood, I was expecting a nice ending.

93
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,530
Thank you so much.

94
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,730
I should probably go.

95
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,820
I have to wake up early tomorrow and go talk to Mom.

96
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,520
Okay.

97
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,150
Good night.

98
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,712
Good night, Miss Pam.

99
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:43,360
- Do you need a ride home?
- No, I'm fine.

100
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:46,430
Safe trip home then.

101
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,030
Thanks.

102
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,320
Someone told me today is the result of yesterday's actions.

103
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,030
And tomorrow is the result of today's.

104
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,830
But no one is going to think about tomorrow...

105
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,778
if they're still starving today.

106
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,684
There you are.

107
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:44,920
Sorry.

108
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,280
No steak today, only vege.

109
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,467
That's all right.

110
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:50,786
No pickles.

111
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:53,120
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,907
All right.

113
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:57,796
Cheers.

114
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,675
You know, I hope one day that you learn to appreciate the taste of pickles.

115
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,523
You know, like our life.

116
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:13,210
Salty and sour, just like our life.

117
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:17,351
Such a weird metaphor.

118
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,562
You'll get it someday.

119
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,044
You know why I hate pickles?

120
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:33,939
I hate the way it tastes, I hate the texture,

121
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,201
the way it sits in the mouth.

122
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,447
How was your day?

123
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,827
Well, a customer threw coffee on me again.

124
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:52,395
I might as well never clean this apron.

125
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:53,592
What?

126
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:56,816
Your service was that bad?

127
00:09:56,816 --> 00:10:00,668
No, but you know, the coffee is too hot.

128
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,125
Sometimes it's too cold.

129
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:09,560
And how about you?

130
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,893
- Me?
- Yeah.

131
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,529
Same old.

132
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:17,725
Every day is the same.

133
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:23,196
Yeah, every day is the same.

134
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,377
That's okay.

135
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,415
I don't mind the routine of it.

136
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:37,680
It's not like the world is a fair place.

137
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:42,017
Just got dealt a bad hand.

138
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,390
All I can do is stay positive and keep fighting.

139
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:51,042
That's all there is to it.

140
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,477
It's a new day when I start my new job.

141
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,872
500,000 THB is a lot of money.

142
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:02,430
I have to do my best.

143
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,056
I can't afford to make any mistakes.

144
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:08,859
I have to look the most professional.

145
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,420
Mark, chin up.

146
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,940
Turn 45 degrees.

147
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,680
Okay.

148
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,180
Mom, I'm here.

149
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,560
Give me a second.

150
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,800
Hi, Pete.

151
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,911
- Pete, can you take care of this for a while?
- Of course.

152
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:50,080
Ailee, please don't hunch your back.

153
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,170
Okay.

154
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,420
Make sure he doesn't put his chin down.

155
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,200
- Of course, I will take care of him.
- Let's talk in my office.

156
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,620
Which one should we pick, Miss Pa?

157
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,456
Which one?

158
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:06,536
How about this one? We're shooting a winter look.

159
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,080
- Okay, great.
- That one is summer.

160
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,240
Okay.

161
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
Follow me, Pam.

162
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:18,020
It's a little chaotic today.

163
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,860
Everything is so urgent.

164
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,080
Here's your coffee.

165
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,060
Have you eaten? Would you like some tea or coffee?

166
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,350
No, I'm good. I've already eaten.

167
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,070
Give me another cup of this.

168
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,280
Okay, let's get to the point.

169
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,160
Well, what is my responsibility?

170
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,066
As his manager, there's nothing much to do, actually.

171
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:37,100
You just have to manage everything for him.

172
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,290
What do you mean by everything? Please give me some details.

173
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,380
You take care of him, manage his work schedule,

174
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,600
and facilitate his work from the moment he wakes up until he goes to sleep.

175
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,483
In the morning, wake him up on time.

178
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,940
Check his schedule to see where he has to go, what time, and who he has to work with.

179
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,050
You have a 10:00 a.m. photoshoot in Asoke

180
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,693
and a 3:00 p.m. fitting near the expressway.

181
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:12,452
Then you take him there.

182
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,600
After work, take him to work out.

183
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,880
The first 30 minutes are for burning fat.

184
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,760
Your heart rate is in zone 2. Not bad.

Keep running.

186
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,650
After this, don't forget to activate your muscles with myofascial release

187
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,510
and do spinal mobility to reduce muscle pain.

188
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,280
That's about it. Are you following?

189

Yes.

You don't need to write them down.

191

You can use the company's tablet.

193
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,510
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

194
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,300
You also need his room code.

195

That's not right.

201

This shouldn't be difficult. I've handled dozens of kindergarten kids.

202
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,640
This is just one model and I already have his schedule.

203

I just need to follow it. It will be very easy.

Okay, let's start by picking him up and dropping him off at work.

No.

Okay. I'll quickly make you something.

It'll be just a moment.

No!

222
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,420
The color is already a turn-off.

Since it's not my usual place, it's even more difficult.

But Donovan seems like a young man who takes good care of his health.

So, if the reason for his sleeping problems is not physical,

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,916
I really didn't know.

335
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:34,520
Anyways...

336
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,400
You're not doing anything.

337
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,760
Why don't you make yourself useful instead of looking at men's photos?

338
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,760
It's a purple tumbler.

339
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,558
Hi, everybody. I'm here.

340
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,650
Whatever.

341
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,760
A job you think is easy and you're well prepared for,

342
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,610
may have some unexpected factors.

343
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,379
One of them is Jessica.

344
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,428
Why is this car so messy and dirty?

345
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,600
Where is it?

346
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,660
Here comes the second problem.

347
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,220
My new shoes.

348
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,621
I couldn't find it.

349
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,340
Did you look everywhere?

350
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,860
Yes.

351
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:19,510
I only found dirty workout clothes, a few paper bags, and used coffee cups.

352
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,080
Did you look under the driver's seat?

353
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,890
Why didn't you give me specific instructions?

354
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,930
You didn't look everywhere and you're blaming me?

355
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,960
Go get it for me, please.

356
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,734
Is she bullying me?

357
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,713
Here's your cup.

358
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,790
Please keep things tidy next time.

359
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:04,120
Thank you.

360
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,730
Can you buy me some coffee, too?

361
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,270
I'd like a grande nitro cold brew with less ice and one pump of syrup.

362
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:16,001
Get me a mushroom bruschetta and a soft oatmeal raisin cookie, too.

363
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,220
Go buy them yourself.

364
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,720
She's my manager. You have no right to order her around.

365
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,640
Who can I order then?

366
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,320
Almost everyone here has a responsibility.

367
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,170
Only one doesn't.

368
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,660
I can't work without coffee.

369
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,890
I'm going to be so sleepy. I'm going to have a headache.

370
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,600
Just thinking about it makes me...

371
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh my gosh. I don't wanna think about it.

372
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,600
All right.

373
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,123
I'm going to buy those things for you.

374
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:52,153
Pam, you don't have to.

375
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:09,170
[My Dear Donovan]

376
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,380
Here you go.

377
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,810
That's everything.

378
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,140
You don't want anything else, do you?

379
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,170
You're so late.

380
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,300
I can't eat anymore. I've already applied my lipstick.

381
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,344
Guys, if you're ready, please come on set.

382
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:10,142
I'm ready.

383
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,684
This way, please.

384
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,360
I'm ready, guys.

385
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,820
We're ready.

386
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,180
Hey.

387
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,490
Your necklace.

388
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,287
Don't you need to take it off?

389
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,680
Give it to me.

390
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,476
Let's keep it like this so you won't lose it.

391
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:15,330
He's very good-looking.

392
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,260
Good. One, two, three.

393
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:22,683
He has such a great body that it's easy to fall for him.

394
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,270
This doesn't mean I've fallen for him.

395
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,440
What I'm trying to say is

396
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,940
a perfect face and body can make people fall in love easily.

397
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,200
But for some people,

398
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,900
it's the moment when someone does something so ordinary naturally

399
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,480
that makes their heart flutter without knowing.

400
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,730
I thought you were daydreaming.

401
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,826
Be professional.

402
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,160
What's going on between you and that girl?

403
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,440
Isn't it just casual sex?

404
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,010
Or is she playing hard to get so you want to win her over?

405
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,191
She's my manager.

406
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,646
Please, I can tell it from your eyes.

407
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,106
She's an interesting girl.

408
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,040
You think that junk food is interesting?

409
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,600
Have you lost your mind?

410
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,480
Has your taste gone bad?

411
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,006
She doesn't suit you.

412
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:01,163
Mind our own business.

413
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,026
All right. Let's call it a day.

414
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,338
You and her will never work out.

415
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,930
Hey.

416
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,846
Are you hungry? What do you want to eat for dinner?

417
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,920
I don't eat dinner.

418
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,740
Okay, then let's go home now.

419
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:48,220
In the end, my first day as a manager went well.

420
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,100
Or did it?

421
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:59,040
Hey! Where are you going?

422
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,740
Hey!

423
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,470
Hey!

424
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,900
Stop!

425
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,330
Wait!

426
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,949
Maria!

427
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:16,792
Maria!

428
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,460
Hey!

429
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,860
Hey!

430
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:53,320
Hey!

431
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,120
What's wrong with you? Why were you standing in the middle of the road?

432
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,010
You almost got hit.

433
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:04,170
I thought she was someone I knew,

434
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,260
but she wasn't.

435
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,400
I was so worried about him that I forgot about my own pain.

436
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,380
What's wrong?

437
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,780
Hey.

438
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,794
That looks so bad.

439
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,410
Can you get up for a bit?

440
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,645
One, two, three.

441
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,680
Come here.

442
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,092
Hey. What are you doing?

443
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:31,017
Let go of me.

444
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:34,240
Hey. What are you doing?

445
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,650
Don't move. Stay still.

446
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,753
Watch out.

447
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,896
- Hey.
- It's okay.

448
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,360
[My Dear Donovan]

449
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,380
[My Dear Donovan]

450
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,210
Why didn't you tell me you had such a bad shoe blister?

451
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,280
I was wondering why you seemed to be in pain.

452
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,400
I'm fine.

453
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,940
It's my first day of work. I didn't want to cause trouble.

454
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,272
Next time when something happens, tell me.

455
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,360
Okay.

456
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,658
You can't wear these shoes anymore.

457
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,030
Wear mine.

458
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,480
What? But what will you wear?

459
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,913
I'll walk barefoot.

460
00:39:44,853 --> 00:39:46,710
What?

461
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,520
It's just walking barefoot.

462
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,320
I'll be fine.

463
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,800
Try them on.

464
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,560
Do they fit?

465
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,750
Come on.

466
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,320
Actually, you didn't have to drive me home.

467
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,353
It's all right. My feet don't hurt as much anymore.

468
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,890
Thank you for being my manager.

469
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,155
You're doing a very good job.

470
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,689
Get home safe.

471
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,003
Thank you.

472
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,480
"I'm off to visit your grandpa."

473
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,010
"Please go buy these items for me. I'm not sure I can get back in time."

474
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,910
"From Grandma."

475
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,053
Hello, welcome.

476
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,286
Hi, Pam.

477
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,600
What are you looking at?

478
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,850
Your necklace is so pretty.

479
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,400
Did my teacher buy it for you?

480
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,360
Nonsense. Someone left it with me.

481
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,680
Right.

482
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,086
Hi, Miss Pam.

483
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,855
What are you shopping for?

484
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,600
You can find my care here.

485
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,585
My attention here. But if you're looking for the right person, he's here.

486
00:42:44,585 --> 00:42:47,600
- I'm going somewhere else.
- Wait, Miss Pam.

487
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,800
I'm just kidding.

488
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,180
I'm just trying to entertain you while shopping.

489
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,330
All right.

490
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,490
What can I get you today?

491
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,970
Here.

492
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,960
- A lot of things.
- Whoa.

493
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,400
These are a lot of things.

494
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,106
It's Grandma's order.

495
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,660
By the way, how's your first day of work?

496
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,660
It's quite fun.

497
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,380
I got to see how a fashion shoot is done.

498
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,100
We only see a few people on camera

499
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,946
but there are so many teams involved behind the scenes,

500
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:17,440
including props, lighting, costume, makeup, and hair.

501
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,969
There were dozens of people.

502
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,740
Good.

503
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,240
That means you weren't alone with that model.

504
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,330
I would be so worried if that were the case.

505
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,770
Nonsense, Mr. Aood.

506
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,406
He won't do anything to me.

507
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:40,326
Well, is he dating anyone?

508
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,506
I didn't ask him.

509
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,250
Right.

510
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,666
Mr. Aood's question stunned me

511
00:43:57,666 --> 00:44:00,290
and made me seriously want to find out the answer.

512
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:06,440
Why? Have I started to feel something for him?

513
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,500
Why does it have to break down now?

514
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:15,100
It's all right, Mr. Aood.

515
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,640
I can go home by myself.

516
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,580
But your stuff is heavy.

517
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,900
I walked here by myself. I can walk back by myself.

518
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,300
I'm sorry, Miss Pam.

519
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,720
Call me when you get home. Okay?

520
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,220
Okay.

521
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,820
- I'm going now.
- Bye.

522
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,327
- Get home safe.
- Thanks.

523
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:43,340
Why now?

524
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:54,930
What's wrong, Teacher?

525
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,820
My motorbike.

526
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,886
Now I regret calling you Teacher.

527
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,800
How would I know what's wrong?

528
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,880
But you're the owner of the motorbike.

529
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,290
Dude, look at her.

530
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,560
She's carrying heavy stuff.

531
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,370
I should go help her.

532
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:19,840
Women love kind men.

533
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,180
Let's go.

534
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,246
Hi, there.

535
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,220
Hi, there.

536
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,980
Can I help you?

537
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:42,480
Hey.

538
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,950
Can I help you?

539
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,750
Let go!

540
00:45:50,093 --> 00:45:53,080
Oops, the bag got ripped.

541
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,120
- Are you hurt?
- No.

542
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,760
You nosy ass.

543
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,640
Watch out!

544
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,962
You're bleeding.

545
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,240
Run!

546
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,560
Hey.

547
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,640
Hey.

548
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,280
Hey!

549
00:46:58,038 --> 00:47:03,120
He went from being strong to weak in seconds.

550
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,680
It's okay.

551
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,650
I'm here.

552
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,313
Now is probably not a good time to ask questions.

553
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,390
The best thing I can do is to hug him until he becomes strong again.

554
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,246
Calm down.

555
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:33,688
Whose shirt is this?

556
00:47:33,688 --> 00:47:34,772
It's not a shirt.

557
00:47:34,772 --> 00:47:37,500
It's a new design of an eco-friendly tote bag.

558
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,400
I bought this for you.

559
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,160
I think it'd suit you.

560
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,650
Thank you.

561
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:43,680
Keep going.

562
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,720
At least someone is rooting for me.

563
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,720
What are you doing?

564
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,260
What are you doing to me?

565
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,174
I've been waiting a long time for a chance to sleep with you.

566
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:56,610
You're so careless that they secretly took inappropriate photos of you.

567
00:47:56,610 --> 00:48:00,560
Why do I have to clean up the mess I didn't make?

568
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,060
Pam.

569
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:05,610
♫ Who said that I'm so hot? ♫

570
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,140
♫ Sorry, if my hair looks too hot ♫

571
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:12,230
♫ What, a womanizer? It's not true!
(Don't believe it, don't believe what he says) ♫

572
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:18,420
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

573
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,020
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

574
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:29,120
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

575
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:36,180
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫

576
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:50,380
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

577
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,130
