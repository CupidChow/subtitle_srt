1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,370
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,410
You and I have a lot to talk about.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,457
What's the meaning of this?

4
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:08,780
It's in your car.

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,640
Did what you see hit you so hard that you had to come and cry in the toilet?

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,840
I know you used to date him.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,040
But please listen.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,330
Dino and I are together now.

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,560
So please stop what you're doing already.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,880
Did Miss Dararai bring that agency?

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,359
I'm surprised she gave me the job when we have personal issues.

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,208
We're all born but with unequal life resources in the first place.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,603
Some start from zero, while some start from negative.

14
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,755
As for his life, I think it was below negative.

15
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,668
I need my rent.

16
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:55,437
I have it. You'll get it soon.

17
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:58,296
Well, you said that a hundred times.

18
00:01:58,296 --> 00:02:00,303
This is your last chance.

19
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:03,241
Tomorrow, I'm dumping all your stuff.

20
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,250
Do whatever you want.

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,863
Easy.

22
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:19,385
- How are you doing?
- Better.

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,880
Bought some soup.

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,780
- Thank you.
- A bit warmer.

25
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,054
What happened to your face?

26
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:35,105
That's nothing. It's all right.

27
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,010
Let me see.

28
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,258
- That's okay.
- Look at me.

29
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,280
My God.

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,840
It's just a scratch. It's okay. It'll get better soon.

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,314
Does it hurt?

32
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:52,759
Doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt.

33
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:55,560
- Maria, just eat your soup. It's okay.
- You gotta stop doing this.

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,572
It's part of my job.

35
00:02:56,572 --> 00:03:00,405
Yeah, you keep getting hurt because of me.

36
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,720
Why is our life like this?

37
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,540
- I hate this.
- Hey...

38
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,280
Hey, don't say that.

39
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,880
I-I don't want to live like this anymore.

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,500
Maria, look at me.

41
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,607
It's going to be okay.

42
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:18,788
Promise.

43
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:26,234
Come here.

44
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,650
Because his life was more lacking than others',

45
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,340
he had to try harder and struggle more.

46
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:50,095
Come on! Yeah!

47
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:52,047
Yeah!

48
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,670
There aren't many choices for him.

49
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:59,196
Get up!

50
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:02,697
Get up!

51
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:06,040
Come on! Get up!

52
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,546
Get up! Yeah!

53
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,871
Get up!

54
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:14,238
Come on!

55
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:32,340
Come on.

56
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,039
Come on!

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,880
Get up! Get up!

58
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,843
Yeah, come on!

59
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:52,015
Come on!

60
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:25,194
Come on!

61
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:31,405
Get up! Come on!

62
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:35,442
Come on!

63
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:03,836
This is your money.

64
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:08,436
Do you want it or not?

65
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:47,953
Maria.

66
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,266
Maria!

67
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:54,550
Maria.

68
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,084
My god. Are you okay?

69
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:01,584
Who did this?

70
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:10,400
Okay, I'll be right back.

71
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,100
It's going to be okay.

72
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:24,105
Oh my god! What the hell?

73
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,760
Hey, stop!

74
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,367
He must have got her killed.

75
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,280
Okay, I'm back.

76
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,880
It's going to be okay.

77
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,482
Are you all right?

78
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,912
Okay. We got to get you to a hospital, all right?

79
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:20,400
But you gotta stand for me.

80
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,760
Okay, let's go.

81
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:25,776
Slowly. Here we go.

82
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,599
You're good.

83
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,107
Keep going.

84
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:32,900
Stay with me.

85
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:40,646
The nightmare of his past keeps haunting him every night when he closes his eyes,

86
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,838
so he has been suffering from insomnia until now.

87
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,880
What's going on?

88
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,980
Is anyone hurt?

89
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,520
Luke, are you all right?

90
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,240
I'm all right.

91
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,663
Why is he here?

92
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,851
Luke, say hello to your grandpa.

93
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,530
Hello.

94
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,960
His mom brought him here.

95
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,440
She can't take care of him herself

96
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,100
and is now bothering others again.

97
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,980
That's because she has to work.

98
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,565
Why doesn't she hire a babysitter?

99
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,810
She just found out that the former babysitter pinched Luke.

100
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,500
Is that right?

101
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,890
Fine.

102
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,930
You can stay,

103
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,658
but don't cause any mess.

104
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,320
I was bringing that to you, Grandma,

105
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,280
but I dropped it.

106
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,490
No worries.

107
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,961
You can drop it as many times as you want. It's fun.

108
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:15,770
Pick it up now, so you can go help me.

109
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,120
Give it to me.

110
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,240
You're bringing it to me. Right?

111
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,258
Let's go. Let's do our job.

112
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,450
Hello. What's the matter, Grandpa?

113
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,680
Pam, when are you coming back? I miss you.

114
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,343
Luke.

115
00:11:43,343 --> 00:11:46,860
Are you using Grandpa's phone?

116
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,723
Are you at my house?

117
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:51,170
I'm still working.

118
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,145
When are you coming back? I miss you.

119
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,280
In the evening.

120
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,780
What time in the evening?

121
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,730
That will be around 5:00-6:00 p.m.

122
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,010
Buy some ice cream for me.

123
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,140
I'll wait for you.

124
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,890
All right.

125
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,320
Pam, Grandma is cooking some kind of a set meal.

126
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,450
Don't eat anything yet. Come eat at home with Luke.

127
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,690
Sure, Grandpa.

128
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,420
I'll hang up now. I'll hurry and finish my work.

129
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,340
Whoa. I thought something happened.

130
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,993
They are now close, aren't they?

131
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:45,125
See you tomorrow.

132
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,304
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

133
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:01,414
Surprise.

134
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,250
Dino!

135
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,660
Wait.

136
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,657
We're at school now. Kids are everywhere.

137
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,320
I missed you.

138
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,500
You came to surprise me like this. I know you missed me.

139
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,300
How long have you arrived?

140
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,083
After I landed, I came straight here to see you.

141
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,170
Are you tired?

142
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,730
I am.

143
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,774
But after seeing your face,

144
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:30,460
I don't feel tired anymore.

145
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,290
Wait.

146
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,380
Where did you learn this sweet talker skill from?

147
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,730
Ever since I kissed you,

148
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,205
my lips have become sweeter.

149
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,960
I've started to feel hungry also.

150
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,160
Wait. What are you hungry for?

151
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,480
Food.

152
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,800
I haven't eaten anything since I finished work.

153
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,380
I was on the flight for a long time. After I landed, I came straight to see you.

154
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,204
Let's go eat, shall we?

155
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:06,040
But today I'm having a family dinner.

156
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,140
Can't you come with me first?

157
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,650
We haven't seen each other for long.

158
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,620
I also have big news to tell you.

159
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,640
What is it?

160
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,470
Come with me, and I'll tell you.

161
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,816
Cheers!

162
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,680
For the success of this upcoming Milan Fashion Week!

163
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,620
Cheers again!

164
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,940
Ever since I was born, nobody has gotten to join it before.

165
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,170
Donovan is the first one to be joining.

166
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,020
Let's party!

167
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,103
Congratulations, Pete.

168
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,861
Thank you.

169
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,660
Giordano, Gucci, or Louis Vuitton,

170
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,330
I'll buy them all with my credit card.

171
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,839
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

172
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,850
Cheers, guys!

173
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,517
Let's party!

174
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,630
Thank you.

175
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,080
Can you tell me your big good news already?

176
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,584
Come closer. I don't want to say it loudly.

177
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,720
Hey. There're so many people around.

178
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,560
- You shocked me.
- I missed you, Pam.

179
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,800
Can you not go back tonight?

180
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,940
I want to be with you.

181
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,070
Nope.

182
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,053
I must wake up early to go to school.

183
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,576
Can't you just stay and celebrate with me?

184
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,820
I'm going to walk in Milan Fashion Week.

185
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,970
Are you serious?

186
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

187
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,820
I'm so happy for you!

188
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,031
Give me a prize.

189
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:36,351
No.

190
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,200
- Pam...
- No.

191
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,538
Nobody will look at us.

192
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,940
Just one kiss.

193
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,520
I'll hide it like this.

194
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
Come on.

195
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,053
Just one kiss.

196
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:50,653
Just one.

197
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,092
Just this.

198
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,840
I didn't expect that I would come this far.

199
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,010
You deserved it.

200
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,800
I'm so happy for you.

201
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,370
I'm happy, too.

202
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,660
I'm happy because of my job and also because I have you with me.

203
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,240
Pam, please celebrate with me tonight.

204
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,140
Please.

205
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,300
- Hey. Don't say no.
- Hey.

206
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,250
I have to go home.

207
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,093
I have to buy ice cream for my brother.

208
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:30,360
My family is also waiting for me to have dinner together.

209
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,820
Just give me two hours.

210
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,650
Two hours and that's it, Pam.

211
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,560
Nope, Dino.

212
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,699
You're tricky.

213
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,440
Which one do you want?

214
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,318
That one.

215
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,954
Dino.

216
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,900
Hey. I'll look for ice cream over there.

217
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,881
You go that way.

218
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,840
Hurry up.

219
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,850
I want to eat some ice cream.

220
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,630
See you soon.

221
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,549
- Okay.
- Don't be gone for long.

222
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,420
[Your boyfriend is very famous now. The time I've been waiting for has come.]

223
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,940
What's wrong with her? She's mental. What does she want?

224
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,280
[Look at this.]

225

226
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,590
Why? Are you calling to cry?

227
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,500
What's so wrong with you? Stop making up stories already.

228
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,560
Can't you accept the truth?

229
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,500
Why? Does it feel like your pink world is about to break down?

230
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,400
Someone like me won't risk my reputation by making up fake news.

231
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,490
Hey. If it's true, why doesn't anyone know about it?

232
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,060
That's because the case happened in the USA.

233
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,460
Even for some cases that happen in Thailand,

234
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,088
if they aren't on the news, you will never know.

235
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,340
But I guess you know it now

236
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,291
because I already sent this news to reporters.

237
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,149
I'm trying to tell myself that that woman is lying.

238
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,343
I must trust him.

239
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,760
Though I'm trying to keep saying that to myself,

240
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,100
my hands can't stop searching for the news.

241
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,711
I admit that I'm scared.

242
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,320
Where did you run away from me to?

243
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,272
I've been looking for you everywhere.

244
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,976
What I'm scared of has turned into the truth.

245
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,960
Dino's secret.

246
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,813
Now, I don't know who the man in front of me really is.

247
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:43,007
What should I do?

248
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,200
Where did you run away from me to?

249
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,080
I've been looking for you everywhere.

250
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,880
Pam.

251
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,262
Is something wrong?

252
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,700
Now, I don't know who the man in front of me really is.

253
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,052
What should I do?

254
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,247
My grandma is calling.

255
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,690
Hello, Grandma.

256
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,290
Aren't you coming back yet? Where are you now?

257
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,070
Grandpa asked me to call you.

258
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,400
I'm having dinner now, Grandma.

259
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,343
Are you? Who are you eating with?

260
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,690
I'm eating with my colleague at school.

261
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,820
It's his birthday.

262
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,210
I see.

263
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,730
Luke is asking when you're coming back.

264
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,380
All right. I'm going back now.

265
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,080
I'll hang up.

266
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,852
What did your grandma say?

267
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,390
I'm sorry. I have to go back now.

268
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,490
Pam.

269
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,488
What were you going to show me?

270
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,436
Let's talk later.

271
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:26,080
- That's the sun, right?
- Yeah.

272
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,760
I'm good at it.

273
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,060
- I'm back.
- Whoa.

274
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,580
It took you ages.

275
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,800
Luke has been waiting to eat his ice cream for so long that he's tired now.

276
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,040
Luke, come get your ice cream. I bought it for you.

277
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,360
I'll go upstairs now.

278
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,520
I have to get prepared for tomorrow's class.

279
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,530
I feel agitated, so I'm trying to search for the information on the internet.

280
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:09,850
But I forget that, in the country where rights are important for every citizen,

281
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:17,220
violating the right by posting an ex-prisoner's name and photos publicly could never happen.

282
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,300
That's why I haven't found anything.

But because of Miss Da's power,

285
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:33,987
she could get that secret piece of information and pass it on to the media with her own hands.

286

How did you get into my room?

If a person like me wants to do something, I can always do it.

288
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,320
If you don't stop threatening me,

289
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,880
I can call the police.

290
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,386

291

but you threw it away.

00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,697
There's one thing I have always told you.

337
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:45,796
I asked if there was anything else you'd been hiding from me.

338
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,821
What was your answer?

339
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,816
You said there's none.

340
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,675
What are you going to explain now?

341
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,970
Dino,

342
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,791
how many times have you lied to me?

343
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,610
The sound of me crying is loud enough to make him hear it through the call.

344
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:32,826
After hearing it, of course, he feels so guilty.

345
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,750
Are you ready to explain all the truth to me now?

346
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,858
I'm sorry.

347
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,010
The car that has been running at a speed of 140 km/hrs

348
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,520
and then gets into an accident after another car severely crashes into it

349
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,080
might feel like how I'm feeling now.

350
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,480
I think it's the same for him.

351
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,440
The two cars that both lose control and crash into each other

352
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,360
are suffering hard and hurting all over,

353
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,584
and they didn't even have time to prepare for it.

354
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:46,853
♫ It'd be better if we didn't know each other... ♫

355
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,267
♫ because it's too hard to forget you ♫

356
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,940
Sometimes, things happen without allowing us to prepare in advance.

357
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,960
As I used to say, I think I'm cursed in love.

358
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,933
I'm always cursed to have an unsuccessful love life

359
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:29,930
and to have never been happy since I was born.

360
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,819
Mom gave birth to me when she was not ready.

361
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,178
I've never seen what my dad looks like.

362
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:56,400
I have to live with my grandparents.

363
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,463
No matter how much they love and adore me,

364
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:03,777
it can never compensate for the love I have been lacking.

365
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,980
When Mom was 18, she told Grandpa she was pregnant.

366
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,850
That's when she had me.

367
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:15,363
The moment Grandpa found out,

368
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,100
he couldn't accept it

369
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,560
because she was pregnant since she hadn't finished high school.

370
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Most people criticized that she couldn't afford to raise the kid.

371
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,370
You don't care about how embarrassed we would feel at all!

372
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,500
Don't you see I'm working as a government official?

373
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,010
When I grew up, I met my first love that had felt like a dream,

374
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,200
and I have given him both my body and my heart.

375
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,952
But in the end, it's not the love I expected.

376
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,521
That's miserable.

377
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,407
But no matter what, life still goes on.

378
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,410
Because I have been brought up without my parents,

379
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,970
I don't know who I can cry my heart out with.

380
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,147
That's why I think I must heal myself on my own.

381
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,200
He's not quite different from me in this.

382
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,620
He's stronger than me when it comes to living a life,

383
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,590
but love must be his weakness.

384
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,763
Hello, Miss Pam.

385
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:03,503
Where are you going early in the morning?

386
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,000
"Don't run away from me anymore."

387
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,640
The wolf says that to the sheep.

388
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,120
The sheep nods and hugs the wolf.

389
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,600
After that, the wolf invites the sheep to have dinner together.

390
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:39,599
That's the yummy corn soup.

391
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,413
How could they become friends?

392
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:46,996
Wolfs are cruel, aren't they?

393
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,440
Not every wolf is cruel.

394
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,280
Don't judge things easily.

395
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,372
Got it?

396
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:58,157
Yeah.

397
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,504
That's right. Not every wolf is cruel.

398
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,843
Is there any other story you want to listen to?

399
00:38:10,843 --> 00:38:12,814
This one.

400
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,799
I dropped it.

401
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,985
- Let me see.
- Miss Pam.

402
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,210
Are you just passing by, Mr. Aood?

403
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,710
Yes.

404
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,947
I dropped by to give this delicious meal to Teacher Pemanee.

405
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,885
These past few days, you haven't eaten much, have you?

406
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,900
Thank you, Mr. Aood.

407
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,635
But I'm not hungry yet.

408
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:58,280
I know that what you're going through now is such a big problem

409
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,370
and hurts your feelings a lot.

410
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:05,563
If I were you, I would have gone crazy by now.

411
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,947
But since you're acting normal while this thing is actually so tough for you,

412
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,566
I'm worried about you even more. Don't you know?

413
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,916
I don't know what I should do now.

414
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,580
I thought I knew him well enough,

415
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,666
but actually, it seems I don't know him at all.

416
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,363
Let's eat for now.

417
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,480
We all need to eat.

418
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,788
All I can help is to make you eat,

419
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,199
so you can have enough strength to handle your love.

420
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,730
Mr. Aood.

421
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,466
You said you didn't know him at all. Right?

422
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,040
Now, it's all up to you whether you really want it to end like this or not.

423
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,780
He doesn't eat or sleep.

424
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,130
He doesn't do anything at all, apart from burying himself in guilt.

425
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:45,480
Lacking sleep results in low blood pressure and makes his brain function more slowly,

426
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,113
and now his skin, nails, and hair have all turned dry.

427
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:51,713
Dino.

428
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,137
Pam.

429
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,898
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

430
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,160
I bought some food for you.

431
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,101
Pam.

432
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,013
Why did you cancel all my jobs?!

433
00:42:33,013 --> 00:42:35,160
Donovan is a murderer, and how is that related to me?

434
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,820
I tried to tell myself that it was not true.

435
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,000
I thought Miss Da must be trying to play me off against you like she did everyone else.

436
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,140
But it turns out to be true.

437
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:50,320
I was arrested and sentenced to prison,

438
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,970
but not with a charge of murder.

439
