1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,700
To be honest, we haven't lived together for 20 years.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,130
Sometimes, I forget that you're my daughter.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,760
I'm just calling to tell you that I already quit the job.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,480
But we still have a contract.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,220
Do you want to get fined?

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,720
I have something to talk to you about.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,780
You don't have to do anything for me anymore.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,540
You're no longer my manager.

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,890
Why did you disappear then?

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,690
Someone doesn't want to see you cry anymore.

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,400
I feel that this woman looks very familiar,

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,655
but I don't know where we've met before.

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,000
Take it easy.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,980
You will find her.

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,485
I think we're on the right track.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,879
I hope so.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,760
Do you want a cold drink? I'll get one for you.

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,404
No, it's okay.

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,800
Pam.

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,453
Are you really going to quit?

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,100
Yes.

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,445
That's what I told my mom.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,257
I don't want you to go.

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,420
His big hands are so powerful that I almost changed my mind.

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,292
Why did you do that?

26
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:39,410
Come on.

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,500
It's only a light slap. Don't tell me your hands are going to break.

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,220
Too weak.

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,520
I'm not talking about your hands, but your heart.

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,810
Hey, stop it!

31
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,090
Are you searching for your sister?

32
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,530
Let's go, Pam.

33
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,854
I know your sister.

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,640
Really?

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,580
You never talked about it before.

36
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,490
When could I have found the time to talk about it?

37
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,210
When we were together, you kept putting something in my mouth.

38
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,360
Wow. How could she say that so blatantly?

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,130
I can't deal with her.

40
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,480
It's so fun to see someone make that face.

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,420
She's talking trash. Don't pay attention to her.

42
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,800
Before I joined Parie, I used to work with Maria.

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,960
I'm telling the truth.

44
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,580
I have photos with her in my room.

45
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,440
Come take a look if you want, I don't mind.

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,800
But if you think I'm talking trash and nonsense,

47
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,690
then don't bother.

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,953
Hi, everybody!

49
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,356
Should I believe her?

50
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,160
I don't know if she really knows your sister,

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,589
but I know she didn't invite you to her room just to look at the proof.

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,356
I think you know that, too.

53
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,460
Oh, my god. I can't believe it.

54
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,493
I didn't think you'd come to my room again.

55
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,325
Can I kiss you?

56
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,128
Come on, baby.

57
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,940
Do you really know Maria?

58
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,650
If you lied to get me to come here,

59
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,570
you're going to get it.

60
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,920
You're going to get it.

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,320
I'm afraid of not getting it.

62
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,250
I like it when you're aggressive.

63
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,634
The photos are in my bedroom.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,563
I'll wait here.

65
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:17,227
You have 30 seconds.

66
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:18,889
Up to you.

67
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,323
30, 29,

68
00:04:25,323 --> 00:04:28,720
28, 27

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,650
26, 25, 24, 23, 22...

70
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,470
Found them.

71
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,960
Bring them here.

72
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,092
Just go home if you don't believe me.

73
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,370
See?

74
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,530
I don't talk nonsense.

75
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,640
I really know Maria.

76
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,200
I didn't tell you because I didn't know she was your real sister.

77
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,451
Where is she now?

78
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,172
Do you know that?

79
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,300
No,

80
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,708
but it won't be hard to find out.

81
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,635
Do you remember those moments?

82
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,065
I miss those times when you and I were...

83
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,760
always on the bed.

84
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,829
What are you doing, Jess?

85
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,327
Jess?

86
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:24,743
I told you she's going to get him.

87
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,841
I want to be yours again.

88
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,360
[She really knows my sister!]

89
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,570
I know why he went to her, but I can't help feeling bothered.

90
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,060
Anyway, we're not together.

91
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,035
So I have no right to stop him from doing anything with anyone.

92
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,882
I won't ask you anymore if you feel uncomfortable answering.

93
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,200
But I'm still curious anyway.

94
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,460
You disappeared like that and didn't explain anything to me

95
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,020
while that day we almost...

96
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,583
We almost kissed?

97
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,707
Thank you for coming to see me today.

98
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,600
Nothing we said implied that we were each other's.

99
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,943
No matter how much my heart is yearning for him,

100
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:52,875
if he doesn't return the feelings, there's nothing I can do.

101
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,531
Pam.

102
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,040
Grandpa, why haven't you gone to bed?

103
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,719
I've been waiting for you.

104
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,120
So?

105
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,790
You didn't get my stuff?

106
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,600
Oh, it's not available.

107
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,920
Did you really go shopping?

108
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,008
I hope you're not lying to me again.

109
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,810
No, I'm not lying. I really went shopping.

110
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,250
I'm going up to get some rest.

111
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,004
I was so lost in thought about him that I almost forgot I lied to Grandpa.

112
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,780
He looks so happy with her.

113
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,040
They look so adorable together.

114
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,933
They don't even look good together.

115
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:11,320
Seeing them makes me want to vomit.

116
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,690
Are they a real couple?

117
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,730
Well, I don't know, but like...

118
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,180
Can we change their outfits now?

119
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,450
Go ahead.

120
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,140
Okay, we're done with this set.

121
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,642
Let's move on to the next set.

122
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:28,857
Can we change their outfits for the next set?

123
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,370
Kissing like that means they're together. I ship them so much.

124
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,540
I can't deal.

125
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,847
Okay, guys. Let's call it a day.

126
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,490
Thank you so much.

127
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,220
- Thank you so much.
- Can I get a photo?

128
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,400
- Sure.
- Thanks.

129
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:09,140
Ready?

130
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,640
One, two, three.

131
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,140
One, two, three.

132
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,170
Can I get a photo with just him?

133
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,300
Of course.

134
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,960
Okay. Ready?

135
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,420
One, two, three.

136
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,650
One, two, three.

137
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,210
Thank you so much. I hope we get a chance to work together again.

138
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,450
- It'll be my pleasure.
- Thanks for letting me borrow him.

139
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,955
- You're very welcome.
- Thank you.

140
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,410
- I'll send you the photos.
- Okay.

141
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,580
- Please have a seat.
- Sure.

142
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,160
I don't feel the same about you anymore.

143
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,860
I once read about the theory of evolution.

144
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,240
Human beings are social animals that live in groups.

145
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,090
Living alone is life risking.

146
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,940
That's why our body has evolved to develop deep connection

147
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,707
so that we can take care of each other.

148
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,670
Come.

149
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,713
I'll walk you home.

150
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,040
When human beings feel connected, we miss each other.

151
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,330
We want to see each other. We want to spend time together.

152
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,280
Here you are.

153
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,690
I bought them for you.

154
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,920
What are you doing?

155
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
You're stubborn,

156
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,043
so I'm putting them on for you.

157
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:04,318
A welcome gift for my manager.

158
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,781
When we start missing someone, that feeling works in cruel ways.

159
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:16,180
[Are we never going to talk again?]

160
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,780
Even though we try to suppress and ignore it,

161
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,061
it still keeps attacking us.

162
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,000
Some photos.

163
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,540
Is this you?

164
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,168
What?

165
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,500
Hey!

166
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:18,782
[I found you, my missing piece]

167
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,088
Some sentences.

168
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,069
Some words...

169
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,890
[Indicate, Don't look, Be brave]

170
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,952
...attract us to each other.

171
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,191
They lead us to such special moments.

172
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,600
The feeling of missing someone is too powerful to resist.

173
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,200
Pam.

174
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,410
♫ I wish I hadn't met you ♫

175

179
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,710

180
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,940
Pam.

181
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,560
That feeling makes time stand still.

182
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,000
Now it's just the two of us.

183
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,599
Whatever will be, will be.

184
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,124
I'm going to be honest with you now.

185
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,431
I won't run from it anymore.

186
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,788
I love you.

187
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,052
I want you in my life.

188
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,500

194
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,748
The June rain soaks us both completely.

195
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:23,050
♫ Why do you only remember the good things that ended? ♫

But he's gentle with me.

200
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,500
He takes off my glasses.

201
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,160
My first time feels like a dream.

202

Am I really your missing piece?

205
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,225
I used to think I could never love anyone again in this life.

206
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,570
But then I found you.

207
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,620
You make me want to live.

208

I can't remember the last time I was this happy.

215
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,479
I will never forget today.

216
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:44,220
My first time.

217
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:49,840
- Stop.
- What?

218
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,123
You can leave me here.

219
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:53,280
Why?

220
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,080
What if someone sees us and tells my grandparents?

221
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,683
What will I do?

222
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:01,856
I can walk from here by myself.

223
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,211
Are you sure? It's late.

224
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:06,520
I can walk by myself. You can go.

225
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,220
Go now.

226
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,620
Bye.

227
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,052
Watch out when you walk.

228
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,259
I think I should walk you to the front of your house.

229
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,820
No.

230
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,370
I can keep my distance.

231
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,800
No one will know we're walking together.

232
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,698
How?

233
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,618
Okay, stop.

234
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,571
You look suspicious walking after me like that.

235
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,190
Suspicious how?

236
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:10,680
It looks like you're going to rob me.

237
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,820
How should I walk then?

238
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,581
Should I walk like this?

239
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,120
No.

240
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,668
That looks even more suspicious.

241
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,776
Don't pay attention to me.

242
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,050
I'm worried about you.

243
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,174
Let me walk you home.

244
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:50,100
I'll keep a longer distance from you so other people won't notice.

245
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,500
Okay?

246
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,337
You're so cute, Dino.

247
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,400
Don't walk towards me yet.

248
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,602
You can leave me here.

249
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,970
Bye.

250
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,245
Dino!

251
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,663
Everyone who's fallen in love must have felt this happy.

252
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,040
[Tell me when you get home.]

253
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,140
I feel so shy about what I did,

254
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,885
but my heart says I'm not a little girl anymore.

255
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:39,759
I'm 24 already.

256
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,024
But 24 is still young.

257
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,243
Are you home already?

258
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:05,100
That's so fast.

259
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,860
Not yet.

260
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,490
I'm still on your street.

261
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,399
I just left you but I miss you already.

262
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,102
I don't know how I will be able to sleep tonight.

263
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,250
Then go to work.

264
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,210
It's almost morning now.

265
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,060
But I don't want to go to work alone.

266
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,820
Please come back and be my manager again.

267
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,930
Come take care of me.

268
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,640
I can't.

269
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,120
I already told Grandpa and Grandma that I quit.

270
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,200
Then make something up.

271
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,400
Just come to me.

272
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,945
Please?

273
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:48,067
Please.

274
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:51,170
You're a bad influence, Dino.

275
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,080
You know I'm bad at making things up.

276
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,960
Don't you want to see me, Pam?

277
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,930
Please?

278
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,640
Please?

279
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,212
Please.

280
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,773
No. I don't want to lie.

281
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,290
Grandpa, I'm going to the school to clear some tasks before the new semester starts.

282
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,640
I made up a story.

283
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,610
Isn't it a month away?

284
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,160
Why do you need to prepare so early?

285
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,540
There's a lot to do and so many documents to deal with.

286
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,940
- I should go.
- I'm running away.

287
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,300
Won't you eat something first?

288
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,960
Your grandma has gone to the market to buy some food.

289
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,100
No, I don't want to be late.

290
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,480
I made an excuse.

291
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,040
Why are you in such a hurry?

292
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,643
You're going to forget something.

293
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:49,360
What's up with my granddaughter?

294
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,698
Please don't hold this against me, Grandpa.

295
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,930
Hey, today, I lied to Grandpa about three things.

296
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,760
You're becoming such a bad influence, you know?

297
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,892
Have you eaten?

298
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,860
Dino?

299
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,228
Hey?

300
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,190
What are you doing?

301
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,660
Seriously?

302
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,740
If someone locked your neck like this, what would you do?

303
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,670
Hold on.

304
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,412
Are you serious?

305
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,960
No. I don't want to play.

306
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,573
I'm not playing.

307
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:44,130
I'm serious.

308
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,483
If you can't break away, I will lock my arms even tighter.

309
00:28:49,286 --> 00:28:51,320
Dino!

310
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,120
Dino, this is too much!

311
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,320
Dino!

312
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,000
I surrender!

313
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,680
What's that prank?

314
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,263
That's not a prank.

315
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:10,067
I'm serious.

316
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,989
Why?

317
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,900
I'm worried after seeing that guy last night.

318
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,040
Something bad could happen to you at any time.

319
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,401
I won't be able to walk you home every time.

320
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,690
Even though I'm a little shocked, I understand his reason.

321
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,759
What should I do?

322
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:41,126
I'm going to teach you self defense.

323
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,944
Chin.

324
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,872
Adam's apple.

325
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:58,839
Solar plexus.

326
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,673
And...

327
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,590
genitals.

328
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,500
Those are the areas you have to remember.

329
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,775
Make sure you attack the right spots.

330
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,093
Now let's go through that again.

331
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:14,393
Go.

332
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,690
Chin.

333
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,061
Adam's apple.

334
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:22,190
Chin.

335
00:30:23,177 --> 00:30:24,624
Dino, what are you doing?

336
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:28,013
When you give a wrong answer, you get a kiss.

337
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:31,840
Dino.

338
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,010
You're going to get another kiss.

339
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,103
Be faster.

340
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:36,803
Okay.

341
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,508
Dino, let go!

342
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,180
I did it!

343
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,500
Very good.

344
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,640
You're better than I thought.

345
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,684
It's a different kind of romantic when a guy teaches you self-defense.

346
00:30:57,684 --> 00:31:00,563
Very good. But not good enough.

347
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,360
Just now he was teaching me how to defend myself,

348
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,960
but now it seems he wants to attack me again.

349
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,001
I guess this is what it's like to be crazy in love.

350
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,222
You can't run away from me.

351
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,106
I'm not even thinking of running anywhere.

352
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,925
Bad timing.

353
00:32:15,072 --> 00:32:17,453
What the hell is going on?

354
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,495
Who's there?

355
00:32:26,897 --> 00:32:28,900
Good morning, baby!

356
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,440
I know you're awake.

357
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,660
So open up.

358
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,792
Jessica?

359
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,600
She came to see you in your room?

360
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,012
I had no idea she was coming.

361
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,410
Open up already.

362
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,880
I know you're inside.

363
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,486
Open up quickly. I have a special gift for you today.

364
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,393
Wait for me inside. I'll send her away.

365
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:08,432
Wait! Why do I have to hide?

366
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,844
What are you doing here?

367
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:21,480
I should ask you that question.

368
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,180
I'm picking my babe up for work.

369
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,774
You have nothing to do with him anymore.

370
00:33:26,774 --> 00:33:29,400
Why are you here, junk food?

371
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,620
I'm back to take care of Dino.

372
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,440
A silly girl like you?

373
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:41,240
Sorry, but I don't think my babe needs a troublemaker like you to take care of him.

374
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,391
Okay, it sounds like she's looking for a fight.

375
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,800
Stupid. Silly. Burden.

376
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,440
Troublemaker.

377
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,480
Did your brain even process before you say those words out loud?

378
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,660
There are campaigns against bullying, you know?

379
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,060
If you were a student in my school, I would ask to meet your parents.

380
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,010
Why do you love insulting other people?

381
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,450
Were you insulted before?

382
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,890
Or are you jealous of me? Is that why you're insulting me?

383
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:12,370
Is it because you want to feel better, that you have more value?

384
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,500
Or is it because you're so unhappy that you want me to be unhappy, too?

385
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

386
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,130
Are you trying to show that you know everything, smarty-pants?

387
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,360
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

388
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,040
You're challenging me to engage in violence?

389
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,721
You may want to see a psychiatrist. I'm worried about you.

390
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:31,300
Stop.

391
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,490
- What are you doing?
- She insulted me.

392
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,960
You insulted her, too.

393
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,760
I want you to leave now.

394
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,970
You're siding with her again.

395
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,522
Do you really have feelings for this basic bitch?

396
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,226
Get out.

397
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,142
Let me tell you something.

398
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,558
You and this girl will never work out.

399
00:34:57,155 --> 00:34:58,843
Let go.

400
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,520
Soon, he'll get bored of you

401
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,340
and I'll be laughing at you when that day comes.

402
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:11,440
Bitch!

403
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,940
Get out.

404
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,164
Jessica is a psycho.

405
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,480
Do you have to work with her later?

406
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,880
Yes.

407
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,890
Then go take a shower and have breakfast.

408
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,490
I'll go with you.

409
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,730
You shouldn't.

410
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,620
Why not?

411
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,348
I have to act like I'm close with her when I'm working.

412
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,875
I don't want you to see that and feel uncomfortable.

413
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,840
I can separate personal life from work.

414
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,140
Are you sure?

415
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,000
Of course.

416
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,682
I have to hug her,

417
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:06,817
kiss her...

418
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,179
and act like I love her.

419
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,639
Are you still sure now?

420
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,200
I am sure.

421
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,237
I can separate personal life from work.

422
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,120
I want to create a story.

423
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,634
You're the lead guy who rescues the lead girl,

424
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:33,653
but you're stuck in handcuffs that bind you together.

425
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:34,986
You have to drive with one hand.

426
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:36,410
Can you do that?

427
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,080
Sure.

428
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,557
Can you give me the handcuffs?

429
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,050
You look so professional with them.

430
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,785
Don't tell anyone I use one of these with Dono all the time.

431
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,040
Here we go again.

432
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,085
Get on the bike quickly.

433
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:59,153
Are you comfortable in that position? Try moving around.

434
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,020
I think if the lead girl was afraid of falling off,

435
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,066
she would hug him like this.

436
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,265
That's good.

437
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:12,290
Now she's hugging him.

438
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,201
And kissing his cheek.

439
00:37:15,886 --> 00:37:19,621
Put this where it's comfortable for you.

440
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,129
Give it to me, babe. I know where to put it.

441
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,139
Unbelievable.

442
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,660
There's no bullet, right? I don't want the gun to accidentally go off on him.

443
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,660
This part of him is my favorite property.

444
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,789
I can't let it break down.

445
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,050
Let's put it here.

446
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,240
I think it's easy to grab. I can move around him and shoot.

447
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,450
Okay. Can you show me how to do it?

448
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,450
Is this okay?

449
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,178
Now I pick the gun up and shoot. Right?

450
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,680
Bang.

451
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,760
Bang.

452
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,340
Bang.

453
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,093
I know it's work, but who can stand seeing this in front of their eyes?

454
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:20,640
I'm just kidding, guys.

455
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,560
I'm too familiar with this position.

456
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,213
Let's work first.

457
00:38:26,213 --> 00:38:28,456
We can continue this at home.

458
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,040
Pam?

459
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,254
Why do I have to run into Mom here now?

460
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:46,720
They're shooting inside.

461
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,220
Wait.

462
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,592
What are you doing here?

463
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,800
Me?

464
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,530
I brought fruit-shaped mung beans for Donovan.

465
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,803
He's supporting Grandma.

466
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:01,640
Another lie.

467
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,820
Really?

468
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,773
Yes.

469
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:06,273
Bye, Mom.

470
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,620
Dino.

471
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,090
Sorry, I was late to your shoot this morning.

472
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,890
I was busy. It took me a while to find someone to leave my kid with.

473
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,980
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

474
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,600
See you.

475
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,540
Wait, Dino.

476
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,473
There's another thing.

477
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,659
Be honest with me.

478
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,373
What's going on between you and my daughter?

479
00:40:02,022 --> 00:40:05,406
What do you mean?

480
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,476
Are you guys dating?

481
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,020
Are you serious or just playing with her?

482
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,980
I'm serious about her.

483
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,040
You're getting Pam in trouble, you know?

484
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,622
My dad will never let his granddaughter be with you.

485
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,058
He will never accept it.

486
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,065
I know about you and Dino.

487
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,720
You do?

488
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,406
What do you know?

489
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,000
I know you two are dating.

490
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,060
It feels like Mom already knows everything,

491
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,973
including my private life with him.

492
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:29,030
I asked Dino and he told me everything.

493
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,957
Pam, if it's just you and me in this family, I won't have a problem with it.

494
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,850
But that's not the case now.

495
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,838
I think you know that.

496
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,580
Besides, I think you're too young.

497
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,560
Mom, did you forget that I'm already 24?

498
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,710
I've already graduated and I have a job now.

499
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,860
When I said you're too young, it's not about your age,

500
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,140
but your life experience.

501
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,142
You haven't been through that much.

502
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,890
And do you even know Dino well enough?

503
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,810
Do you know who he really is?

504
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,730
Is he sincere with you?

505
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:25,300
Can he really take care of your whole life from now on?

506
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,050
I usually can't sleep well.

507
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:30,760
What's your sister doing in Thailand?

508
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,610
Actually, she left me back home

509
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,298
even though she said she'd wait for me.

510
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,000
You may think that love is the most important thing.

511
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,400
You're just like me.

512
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,720
Before I had you, your grandparents warned me but I didn't listen to them.

513
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,820
I chose my feelings over reason.

514
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,320
In the end, I made a mistake.

515
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,500
I got pregnant before graduating.

516
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,890
I'm not blaming you for my mistake.

517
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:04,460
I was young. Your father was also young.

518
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,570
Neither of us was mature enough to take the responsibility of raising a child.

519
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:11,740
We went from being in love to having problems.

520
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,648
We started fighting and he ended up abandoning us.

521
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:27,473
I thought my first love was going to be my last,

522
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:31,639
but in the end, it fell apart.

523
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,073
I thought I could raise you,

524
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,010
but you know what happened.

525
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,162
I had to do what I didn't want to do.

526
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:51,986
What are you trying to imply by all of this?

527
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,493
I don't want you to end up like me.

528
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,893
I don't want you to regret your actions later.

529
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,920
I hurt your grandpa once.

530
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,540
Think about what'll happen if he finds out about you and Dino.

531
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,880
If someone who hates Westerners to the bone like him

532
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,130
finds out that his most beloved granddaughter is dating a Westerner,

533
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,400
will he be okay with it?

534
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:31,300
I don't want you to date Dino.

535
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,280
Think it over carefully.

536
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,146
If two things we love can't go together, we have to choose one.

537
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,526
But which one should I choose?

538
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:08,260
If you had to choose between doing things for yourself and your family,

539
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,379
which one would you choose?

540
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,740
Do you know what makes someone feel the weakest?

541
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:20,620
It's the feeling of not being able to protect themselves.

542
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,230
I thought he said he was not going with her.

543
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,480
Don't give me a pitiful look.

544
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
Stop what you are doing.

545
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,122
Stop flirting, stop bothering, stop...

546
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:34,820
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

547
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:39,560
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

548
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:45,620
♫ What you've heard seems to be negative.
If you try me, you'll be hooked ♫

549
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:54,500
♫ Don't just believe them, just look into my eyes.
I want you to try to open your mind ♫

550
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:17,580
♫ Who said I was a playboy? I just enjoy being with many girls ♫

551
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,200
♫ Do you want to try me for a bit?
Don't you want to know what the real me is like? ♫

552
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,800
♫ Don't get me wrong, wrong, wrong  ♫
