What are you looking for?

383
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,050
Buying here is cheaper than market price.

384

The fish tank.

385

from the city procuratorate.

390

Jiang Ting and I were schoolmates.

I've seen some
of her case details on the news,

392

plus we have local support,

418
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,750
she came to testify, I think.

419
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,510
Yes, that's her.

420

Maybe it's like your glassmaking.

429

Or maybe it's because

430
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,580
I've handled more and more cases,

431
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,030

432
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,310
those lines of text

433
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,970

these threads can get tangled up,

438

can change someone's entire life.

440
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,240

562
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,840
were knocked unconscious, and abducted.

563
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,840
When you woke up,

564
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,230
you found yourself tied to

565
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,360
a steel platform
at the East Suburb Fishery,

566
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,620
with the sea below you,

567
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,110
50 meters deep.

568
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,070
You had no way to escape.

569
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,150
After being repeatedly
tortured by the kidnapper,

570
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,350
in the early morning,

571
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,320
you got a chance to escape.

572
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,120
The kidnappers caught you.

573
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,720
They were going to kill you.

574
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,110
You had no choice.

575
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,960
To survive, you had to

576
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,070
fight back.

577
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,880
It seems I guessed right.

578
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,710
You have injuries.

579
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,960
No matter what,

580
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,320
you must say they
were caused by the other party.

581
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,000
There was a fierce
struggle between you two,

582
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,710
so the knife

583
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,550
has DNA from both of you.

584
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,230
Repeat what

585
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,280
I've said to the police.

586
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,120
When it goes to court,

587
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,840
leave it to me.

588
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,580
Is there anything else to add?

589
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,880
Alright.

590
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,330
During interrogation,

591
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,360
say what needs to be said,

592
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,820
keep quiet about the rest,

593
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,650
and don't cause me any trouble.

594
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,490
Since leaving you, I haven't lost a case.

595
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,230
[Agreement on Transfer of Child Custody After Divorce]

596
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,000
Sign it.

597
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,200
[Agreement on Transfer of Child Custody After Divorce]

598
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,110
Why?

599
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,730
Once you're acquitted,

600
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,010
I'll arrange for Yingying
to visit you once a month.

601
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,030
I won't sign it.

602
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,960
Then let her be
the daughter of a murderer.

603
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,190
I acted in justifiable defense.
