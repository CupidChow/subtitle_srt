00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,870
At that critical moment,

192
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,210
only one thought ran through my mind:

193
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,720
I must not die.

194
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,390
Put yourself in the defendant's shoes.

195
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,750
Put yourself in the defendant's shoes.

196
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,550
Imagine

197
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,550
if you were in my place,

198
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
if he had you pinned down like that,

199
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,640
what would you have done?

200
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,420
You know very well

201
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,000
the chain of evidence is still incomplete.

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,030
And when you're unable

203
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,670
to prove everything,

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,080
our law dictates

205
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,720
that any doubt must benefit the suspect.

206
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,250
Presumed innocence
in cases of uncertainty.

207
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,870
Ding Yi.

208
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Pour Duan Hongshan a glass of water.

209
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,210
Ding Yi, take notes.

210
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
If I weren't a prosecutor,

211
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,610
if I were just an ordinary person,

212
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
would I already

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,480
be released by now?

214
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,700
It's because I'm a prosecutor

215
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,440
that you can't rule this

216
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,840
as justifiable defense.

217
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,270
Otherwise, the public would accuse

218
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,200
our justice system of protecting its own.

219
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,000
Right?

220
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,710
Duan Hongshan.

221
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,150
I know who you want to hear those words.

222
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,630
You want others to see

223
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,600
that what you're going through

224
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,470
is because of
your identity as a prosecutor.

225
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,580
But the public won't buy it

226
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,320
because this case is so unusual.

227
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,810
They simply can't understand.

228
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,390
Yingying.

229
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,750
Go home first.

230
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,360
Mom has something

231
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,490
to deal with at work.

232
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,270
Is it about Dad?

233
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,730
Yes, it's about Dad.

234
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,240
Dad is sick.

235
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,080
Dad… is sick?

236
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,030
Dad is sick,

237
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,240
But trust Mommy.

238
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,600
I'll bring him home

239
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,870
before he's too weak to hold on, okay?

240
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,030
So tonight, can you do
your homework on your own,

241
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,230
eat by yourself, and sleep by yourself?

242
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,640
Mommy believes in you. Go ahead.

243
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,080
Don't worry.

244
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,070
Director Duan is sick?

245
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,080
If he's sick,

246
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,030
can't he go to a hospital?

247
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,080
There are doctors in the detention center.

248
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,120
So he can't leave.

249
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,690
I've lived with Dad for so many years.

250
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,870
He rarely gets sick.

251
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,100
He must be feeling really bad now.

252
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,270
Even if I can't see him,

253
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,120
there's one way

254
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,510
to reach him.

255
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,870
What is it?

256
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,390
Writing letters.

257
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,960
I already wrote one.

258
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,480
But Mom hid it.

259
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,830
Then I'll write him another one.

260
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,200
Sorry,

261
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,750
I'm late.

262
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,760
Just got Yingying home.

263
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,030
This rain just won't stop.

264
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,970
In a couple of days,

265
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,510
I'll file for your release on bail

266
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,030
due to health reasons.

267
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,420
Then you can see Yingying.

268
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,630
She'll be so happy

269
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,840
if she gets to see you.

270
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,840
I hope it's sunny that day.

271
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,550
No rain.

272
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,390
No need.

273
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,000
What?

274
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,440
I said, no need.

275
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,930
I want to terminate our agreement.

276
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,100
I'll defend myself.

277
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,870
Why?

278
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,030
Did I do something wrong?

279
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,070
Why?

280
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,960
[No Smoking]

281
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,870
Duan Hongshan.

282
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,000
I've been running around

283
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
everywhere for your case.

284
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,550
I've done what
I should and shouldn't have.

285
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,480
Now, right before
the finish line, you kick me aside?

286
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,510
Why?

287
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,829
Why?

288
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,550
Have you really forgotten

289
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,940
the mistake you made 14 years ago?

290
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,829
Is there anything else

291
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,030
you need help
with regarding Zhou Lin's arrangements?

292
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,030
Just let me know.

293
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,890
I wouldn't dare trouble you.

294
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,569
Still no word from Zhou Lin's father?

295
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,170
Just assume he's dead.

296
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,970
We've been separated for years.

297
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,640
No contact at all.

298
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,880
Alright.

299
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,510
We've made our position clear today.

300
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,840
You understand why we handled it this way.

301
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,200
If you do hear from Zhou Lin's father,

302
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,000
please let us know

303
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,110
right away.

304
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,950
No need.

305
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,930
I haven't counted on him in years.

306
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,840
Alright, I understand.

307
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,830
Ma'am, I'll be leaving.

308
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,310
If not for the oversight back then…

309
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,960
Take care.

310
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,240
Would Zhou Delong
really go through all this...

311
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,920
Go back.

312
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,510
Okay.

313
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,790
just to take revenge on me?

314
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,030
In the end, it all comes down to
not having done a good enough job

315
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,490
explaining the law
and reasoning behind it.

316
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,200
I went.

317
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,830
I went.

318
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,160
I didn't find Zhou Delong.

319
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,480
But now we have.

320
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,640
And he's dead.

321
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,160
Zhou Delong lived next door to you

322
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,480
for such a long time.

323
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
And you didn't even notice, did you?

324
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,240
Duan Hongshan.

325
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,240
You think…

326
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,270
You think Zhou Delong
was the only one out to get you?

327
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,200
Let me tell you.

328
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,400
There are people lining up
from the procuratorate

329
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
all the way to
Wuyan Station who want your head.

330
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
If I were Li Mufeng, I'd be angry too.

331
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,270
People always believe they're right,

332
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,720
that they're innocent.

333
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,830
It's been 14 years.

334
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,960
I've paid the price for my mistake.

335
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,590
Because of you, because of this case,

336
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,000
I took off my prosecutor's uniform.

337
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,270
I gave up my daughter to you.

338
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,070
I started over as a lawyer.

339
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,920
You've never once asked

340
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,510
how hard it's been for me.

341
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,030
I've always believed
I was the one who made the mistake,

342
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,790
never considering
that you might have judged wrongly.

343
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,960
Duan Hongshan.

344
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,640
It's been 14 years.

345
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,070
I've borne this burden for 14 years.

346
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,440
Isn't that enough?

347
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,370
I don't blame you
for what happened with Zhou Delong.

348
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,590
I've never blamed you.

349
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
It was my fault.

350
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,270
14 years on,

351
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,400
I still don't know
how to choose the right people.

352
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,120
Duan Hongshan.

353
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,720
Are you saying all this to provoke me?

354
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
Did you plan it all from the start?

355
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,830
Using me out there

356
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,440
to arrange everything for you?

357
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,530
You're not doing it for me.

358
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,960
For who, then?

359
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,830
You did it for Yingying.

360
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,720
I did it for Yingying, for you,

361
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,680
and for myself.

362
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,720
You're not the only one
with a sense of justice.

363
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,830
I have one too.

364
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,830
It's been 14 years.

365
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,830
This matter deserves a conclusion.

366
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,510
It's time to end it, isn't it?

367
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,110
Yes.

368
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,960
It's time.

369
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,030
Sir!

370
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,240
What is it?

371
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,930
I'd like to end the visitation.

372
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,480
Duan Hongshan.

373
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,910
I know what you're doing.

374
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,960
Duan Hongshan,

375
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,750
I know you want to defend yourself

376
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,270
