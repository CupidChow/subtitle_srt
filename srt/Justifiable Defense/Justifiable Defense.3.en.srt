Tell us,

5
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,880
what's your relationship
with the deceased?

6
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,800
Can I have a cup of water?

7
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,079
I don't know him.

8
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,400
He kidnapped me

9
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,960
and tried to kill me.

10
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,750
What happened that night?

11
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,750
That night after dinner,

12
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,910
at around 8:30,

13
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,680
I went out to meet an old friend.

14
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,160
What's this old friend's name?

15
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,420
That might involve someone else's privacy,

16
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,480
so I'd rather not say it.

17
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,520
Fine.

19
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,610
When I was walking down the street,

20
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I came across a ring toss game stall.

21
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,360
I bought three rings with ten yuan.

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
After my third try,

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,460
I was lucky enough to
win a Rainbow Dash doll.

24
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,470
My daughter has always loved
Twilight Sparkle.

25
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,150
She sleeps with the doll every night.

26
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,030
Thank you.

27
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,930
I thought if I brought the Rainbow Dash
doll back for her,

28
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,870
she would be very happy.

29
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,840
Then I walked into an alley.

30
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,250
It was pitch-black all around.

31
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Next thing I knew,

32
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,750
I was hit on the back of my head.

33
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,430
When I regained consciousness,

34
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,400
it was probably in the morning
of the next day.

35
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,360
I was tied up there

36
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,709

at Wuyan Third High School,

56
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,830
but I didn't show up either.

57

a new place,

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,750

as justifiable defense.

Some people believed it was
justifiable defense.

321
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,200
But you still initiated a public prosecution
for it.

322
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,420
The deceased was Zhou Lin.

323
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,790
The suspect was Li Mufeng.

324
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,160

329

Back then, I only met Zhou Lin's mother.

330
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,760
I only found out later

331
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,030

You killed Zhou Delong.

334
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,550
That may be considered as justifiable defense.

335
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,400
It could also be intentional homicide

336
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,350
disguised as justifiable defense.

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,030

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,720
It's very clear now

340
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,010
that it was Zhou Delong

341
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,590
who orchestrated this kidnapping.

342
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,000
If he had killed me,

343
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
he would have destroyed my present.

344
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,350
If he was killed by me,

345
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,240
it would have destroyed my past.

346
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,100

348
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,580
is a chance.

349
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,080
Zhou Delong wanted to take this chance

350
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,920
to make people challenge

351
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,350
all my previously settled cases

352
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,640
so as to ruin my reputation

353
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,340
and thereby undermine

00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,440

377
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440

Do you remember Zhou?

381
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,800
Wasn't he released last month?

382
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,000
I heard

383
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,830
he has a daughter in college

384
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,750
who was bullied by classmates

385
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,750
and had to drop out.

386
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,720
Really?

387
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,720
It's true. Why would I lie to you?

388
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,000
My cousin is his neighbor.

389
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,110
He told me about it

390
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,910
when he visited me this morning.

391
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,830
That's just his fate.

392
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,200
That's right.

393
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,070
It's all because he was once in prison.

Your lawyer wants to see you.

398
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
In your case,

399
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,160
there is neither physical evidence

400
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,550
nor eyewitnesses.

401

The injuries and marks on your body

402
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,440
only prove you were kidnapped,

403
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,400
but can't prove your life

404
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,030
was at stake at that time.

405
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,320
This case isn't that simple.

406
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,270
Many people online are saying

407
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,150
that as a prosecutor,

408
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,590
you should be severely punished for
breaking the law.

409
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,390
Fortunately,

410
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,030
many others believe

411
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,030
your actions were justifiable defense.

412
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,720
The key is to

413
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,000
gain the upper hand before the procuratorate decides

414
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,560
whether to approve your arrest.

415
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,850
Your case is special,

416
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,210
and so is your identity.

417
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,030
So the procuratorate might conduct

418
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,750
a very thorough investigation into it.

419
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,880
Based on your account,

420
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,070
I also believe your actions

421
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,530
are justifiable defense.

422
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,100
You just need to tell the truth, understand?

423
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,350
You don't understand what I meant.

424
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,270
I do.

425
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,070
Just sign it.

442

there's still time for you to get a new lawyer.

I don't care who he is.

445
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,750
Based on the distance from your home to
the crime scene,

446
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,790
I can determine this wasn't a coincidence,

447
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,850
but a carefully planned kidnapping.

451
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,200
it would end with either you or him dead.

00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,130

It does

483
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,310
because the person who kidnapped Duan Hongshan

00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,490
when the TV station came to interview us,

565
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
he said

566
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,510
every prosecutor,

567
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,110
no matter what situation they face,

568
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,320
must remain calm, rational, and objective

569
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,070
and that is the most basic requirement for every prosecutor?

570
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,400
And look at him now.

571
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,510
Do you think

572
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,630
Duan Hongshan

573
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,400
is putting on an act?

574
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,590
That's hard to say.

575
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,400
Prosecutor Duan in our city

576
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,760
turned himself in to the police,

577
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,440
claiming that he had killed someone.

578
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,840
The police have taken action quickly

579
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,040
and investigated the case thoroughly.

580
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,800
This incident has attracted widespread attention.

581
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,510
Recently, at the East Suburb Fishery,

582
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,960
the identity of the discovered body has been confirmed.

583
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,870
He was a truck driver working for the fishery.

584
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,670
[How does the judicial institution respond to the case of a prosecutor?]

585
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,800
It's said that on the day of the incident, Duan

586
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,110
drove the delivery truck of the East Suburb Fishery

587
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,960
to Duanke Town Police Station

588
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,440
and turned himself in to the police.

589
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,550
Currently, the prosecutor has been

590
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,760
detained by the police according to law.
