00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,930
it couldn't have drifted that far.

191
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,290
Your fish fishery is in open water.

192
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,750
The phone was found after quite some time,

193
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,670
it would be perfectly normal the phone

194
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,200
drifted with the current that far.

195
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,330
No, it's not normal.

196
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,150
Everyone, please look at this.

197
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,010
These are the details of fishery.

198
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,070
The crime scene is in the breeding area.

199
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,910
To prevent the fish from escaping,

200
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,710
the entire fishery is surrounded
by fishing nets.

201
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,840
This is a fishing net

202
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,360
of the same specifications
as those at the fishery.

203
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,030
And this

204
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,910
is Zhou Delong's phone.

205
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,360
This is a model with the same

206
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,150
specifications as Zhou Delong's phone.

207
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,150
Do you think

208
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,750
the phone could pass through
the fishing net?

209
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,320
If I remember correctly,

210
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,480
this is an old fishery.

211
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,390
Could there be a hole in a fishing net

212
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,850
due to years of disrepair?

213
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,440
We went to the fishery to investigate

214
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
with the same questions in mind.

215
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,150
Our investigation revealed that

216
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,750
one week before the incident,

217
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,360
due to years of disrepair,

218
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
the fishery replaced their nets
with new ones.

219
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,510
So the net were not broken.

220
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,840
The owner of the fishery can confirm this.

221
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,160
That's right,

222
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:30,630
[Hearing Officer]

223
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,830
we just replaced the old nets recently.

224
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,840
The fishery is located in Duanke Town.

225
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,040
According to witness Mei Zheng,

226
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,610
the phone was found outside
the fishing net.

227
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,000
But in reality,

228
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,080
this phone

229
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,630
could not possibly

230
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,440
pass through such a small net.

231
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,120
If it did,

232
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,150
someone must have forced it through.

233
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,600
If someone had forced it through,

234
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,910
the phone would definitely show signs
of damage.

235
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,720
Or else,

236
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,880
there's another possibility.

237
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,150
Like this.

238
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,750
Throwing the phone out this way.

239
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,760
We measured the net.

240
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,840
The fishing net is 3.5 meters high.

241
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,750
You need to work hard enough

242
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,600
to throw the phone to let it pass through.

243
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,720
If you do this,

244
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,870
you are doing it

245
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,120
to destroy the phone

246
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,750
and hide the truth in it.

247
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,240
Is there any evidence pointing to who

248
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,120
might have thrown the phone out?

249
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,550
I believe

250
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,720
this phone

251
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,790
is the most direct and effective evidence
to prove

252
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,990
Duan Hongshan's justifiable defense.

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,720
Therefore,

254
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,510
the person who threw the phone
couldn't have been Duan Hongshan.

255
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,000
Its gaze

256
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
is so weary from those endless

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,790
iron bars that entangle it.

258
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,840
Nothing can shelter it.

259
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,550
It seems there are only
a thousand iron bars,

260
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,270
and beyond those thousand bars,
there is no universe.

261
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,870
What kind of leopard is this?

262
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,970
A leopard trapped in a cage, I suppose.

263
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,320
Why do I feel like it's a leopard

264
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,890
trying to break free from its cage?

265
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,530
And it has already succeeded.

266
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,080
[Wuyan Municipal People's Procuratorate]

267
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,000
Regarding Zhou Delong's phone,

268
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,750
do any representatives have questions?

269
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,550
You may speak.

270
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,640
Justifiable defense is a clearly
defined action.

271
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,870
In legal terms,

272
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,600
it requires objective evidence
for confirmation.

273
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,960
The presumption of innocence
and justifiable defense

274
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,120
can both serve as

275
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,580
ways to exonerate
Duan Hongshan at present.

276
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,870
But presumption of innocence is
only provisional.

277
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,000
Investigating authorities must continue
their inquiry into this case.

278
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,510
Whereas justifiable defense is conclusive.

279
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,550
It will confirm

280
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,000
the legality of Duan Hongshan's actions.

281
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,840
As a prosecutor,

282
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,510
he must know

283
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,730
the differences between them.

284
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,670
If this phone truly contained

285
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,000
video evidence that would help prove

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,720
his justifiable defense,

287
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,440
he wouldn't have thrown it into the sea.

288
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,510
If discarding the phone

289
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,550
could put you
in an disadvantageous position,

290
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,960
could it have been

291
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,080
Zhou Delong who threw it away himself?

292
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,720
I didn't see

293
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,390
Zhou Delong make any such move.

294
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,480
There's another possibility.

295
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,750
In fact, Zhou Delong

296
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,210
didn't have a live stream.

297
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,870
He just used this way

298
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,870
to confuse you.

299
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,200
Or

300
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,390
you made all this up.

301
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,270
I have no reason

302
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,870
to make such a fake video.

303
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,690
That would be overkill.

304
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,120
That's right.

305
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,150
After being a prosecutor for
over 20 years,

306
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,440
you handled so many criminal cases
every year.

307
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,640
You should know how to defend yourself.

308
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,030
On this matter,

309
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,540
I believe Duan Hongshan is not lying.

310
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,720
It's because he knows everything

311
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,790
that it's not impossible for him

312
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,040
to fool us in this way.

313
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,770
Regarding this matter,

314
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,000
I'd like to talk about

315
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,660
another discovery I've made.

316
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,360
14 years ago,

317
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,120
when Zhou Delong
and Zhou Lin's mother separated,

318
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,840
there should be a process

319
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,390
of explaining laws
to both Zhou Lin's parents,

320
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,510
but it wasn't done.

321
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,840
By the time Duan Hongshan went to
find Zhou Delong again,

322
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,720
he discovered

323
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,510
that Zhou Delong had already
directed his hatred

324
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,080
toward Mei Zheng.

325
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,160
Actually, I've been looking
for someone recently.

326
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,720
Duan Hongshan searched everywhere

327
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,880
for Zhou Delong in Wuyan,

328
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,140
but couldn't find him.

329
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,349
Until several years had passed
since Li Mufeng's case,

330
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,030
when he was about to give up.

331
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,400
one day,

332
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,440
he came to an area near a university.

333
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,300
An elderly man?

334
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,680
I don't think so.

335
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,510
Alright, thank you.

336
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,349
You're welcome, bye.

337
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:26,880
Okay.

338
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,640
[Mei Zheng is a slut who caused
my son's death. I'll never forgive you.]

339
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,830
Duan Hongshan thought

340
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,960
it was likely to be done by Zhou Delong.

341
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,930
and that he might return here.

342
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,850
[Mei Zheng is a slut who caused
my son's death. I'll never forgive you.]

343
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,480
Mei Zheng.

344
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,560
The suspect, Duan Hongshan,

345
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,310
according to our investigation,

346
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,110
You often revisit both victims
and perpetrators.

347
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,110
You've been in contact with Mei Zheng

348
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,350
partly to prevent her from

349
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,550
being harassed by Zhou Delong,

350
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,550
and partly to find Zhou Delong.

351
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,480
Is that correct?

352
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,640
Yes.

353
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,750
Did Zhou Lin's father

354
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,350
come to see you?

355
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,920
He came before.

356
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,610
Actually, I've been looking for him
all these years.

357
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,120
If he comes to see you again,

358
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,680
could you let me know?

359
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,160
He won't come again.

360
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,960
I'm about to leave school.

361
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,510
He posted those notices

362
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,650
on the walls of teaching buildings

363
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,270
and the dormitories many times.

364
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,590
My classmates look at me strangely.

365
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,100
I can't stay here anymore.

366
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,550
If you need any help

367
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,960
in the future,

368
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,000
feel free to call me anytime.

369
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,980
Based on our investigation results,

370
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,810
Zhou Delong did kidnap Duan Hongshan.

371
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,440
The question is

372
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,500
what happened after the kidnapping.

373
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,090
We only have Duan Hongshan's testimony.

374
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,790
Yes,

375
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,240
but this also means

376
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,920
we have no evidence to prove

377
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,720
this was intentional homicide.

378
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,850
What does she mean?

379
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,070
Is she taking Duan Hongshan's side?

380
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,070
Everyone,

381
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,160
according to our investigation,

382
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,350
Zhou Delong lived in the same residential
complex as Duan Hongshan's.

383
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,790
In the same block and on the same floor,

384
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,320
separated by just one wall.

385
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,010
Duan Hongshan lived here?

386
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,400
There.

387
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,640
We also found

388
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,540
many surveillance devices
and weapons in his home,

389
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,440
along with numerous materials

390
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,640
and photos related to Duan Hongshan.

391
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,480
We confirmed with the landlord that

392
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,680
Zhou Delong started renting last year,

393
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,430
which proves Zhou Delong had been
planning it for a long time.

394
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,480
Duan Hongshan,

395
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,370
there's something I'm curious about:

396
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,720
have you ever seen Zhou Delong?

397
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Your apartments share a wall.

398
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,590
You must have seen him.

399
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,110
I might have.

400
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,270
On the night of April 27th,

401
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,920
I was kidnapped.

402
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,750
On the balcony,

403
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,000
I saw a person standing down there.

404
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,610
He stood in the rain for a long time.

405
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,550
I didn't pay much attention then.

406
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,880
Now I think about it.

407
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,920
His height and body shape

408
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,370
were similar to Zhou Delong's.

409
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,720
But I'm not sure

410
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,450
if that person was Zhou Delong.

411
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,460
It's obvious that,

412
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,070
whether to protect himself

413
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,790
or his family's lives,

414
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,590
or to protect his career,

415
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,960
it's very possible that Duan Hongshan

416
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,160
intended to kill Zhou Delong.

417
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,920
Yes, Duan Hongshan and Zhou Delong

418
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,070
had such deep enmity.

419
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,200
It was clearly intentional homicide,

420
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,920
and then he used his legal knowledge
to escape from punishment.

421
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,570
I don't have the expertise of them.

422
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,180
But based on the available information,

423
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,960
from when you left your home until
you disappeared,

424
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,750
in all the surveillance footage,

425
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,480
there's no sign of Zhou Delong.

426
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,070
I am the prosecutor in charge
of Jiang Ting's case.

427
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,550
Mei Zheng called me,

428
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,610
saying she wanted to meet with me.

429
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,290
Does it have to be today?

430
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,110
Perhaps she wanted

431
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,240
to tell me something

432
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,900
related to Jiang Ting's case.

433
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,960
Since Zhou Delong had been
monitoring Mei Zheng all along,

434
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,830
he might have known about

435
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,720
our meeting tonight

436
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,480
and set up an ambush in advance.

437
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,720
So,

438
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,550
it does explain

439
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,440
why Zhou Delong wasn't
in the surveillance footage.

440
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,680
If it wasn't a deliberate kidnapping,

441
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,270
there would be no need to deliberately
hide his tracks.

442
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,070
According to the
supplementary investigation,

443
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,640
in the entire Xingfuli Complex,

444
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,030
there are over 1,000 households.

445
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,720
Only about a dozen households

446
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,000
have ever seen Zhou Delong.

447
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,720
And the timing of these sightings
was very strange,

448
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,440
either early in the morning

449
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,160
or late at night.

450
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,460
Are you suggesting

451
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,510
that Duan Hongshan

452
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,770
might have never seen Zhou Delong at all?

453
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,880
I'm just providing
the investigative facts.

454
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,030
Regarding how Duan Hongshan

455
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,790
normally handles cases,

456
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,660
you've all heard about it.

457
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,240
I don't know if you've watched

458
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,840
the livestream of Li Mufeng's
appeal hearing.

459
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,270
Judging from his attitude towards
Li Mufeng over the years,

460
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,270
it's clear that

461
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,880
Duan Hongshan is thorough and meticulous.

462
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,350
When dealing with
highly controversial cases,

463
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,350
many of us often will lose our

464
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,720
judgment because of

465
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,880
the horrific crime scenes

466
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,410
or the victims' suffering,

467
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,750
But he doesn't.

468
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,680
Duan Hongshan always objectively
and calmly

469
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,160
handles every case.

470
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,680
I believe he truly cares about

471
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,030
every person

472
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,310
in every case.

473
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,490
He ensures that every citizen

474
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,790
can feel fairness and justice.

475
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,400
Does someone who has done good deeds

476
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,070
never do anything wrong?

477
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,720
I still believe

478
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,550
Duan Hongshan is highly suspected
of intentional homicide.

479
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,880
As a prosecutor with
many years of experience,

480
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,920
if it was truly justifiable defense,

481
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,680
he would have handled it properly.

482
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Director Duan received commendations

483
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,350
for his excellent handling

484
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,880
of several criminal cases.

485
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,440
How come in his own case,

486
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,270
first,

487
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,510
he can't prove his life was threatened,

488
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,270
and second,

489
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,610
he couldn't escape from Zhou Delong?

490
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,030
As an experienced director of
the prosecution department,

491
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,830
isn't this too unusual?

492
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,680
So you're suggesting that

493
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,070

no matter what situation one encounters,

00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,550
one should always maintain

498
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,550
calmness, objectivity, and rationality,

499
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,310
and shouldn't even have

500
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,310
normal human emotions?

00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,110

you drove away from the scene in this car

512

00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,000
You're being quite dishonest.

562
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,110
According to Duan Hongshan's description,

563
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,590
when Zhou Delong lunged at him,

564
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,830
he had already freed himself
from the ropes.

565
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,310
I have a question here.

566
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,310
Since you had already freed yourself
from the ropes,

567
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,880
didn't you think about escaping?

568
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,350
Fleeing immediately when facing danger

569
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,550
is human instinct.

570
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,030
If you had the chance to escape
but didn't,

571
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,510
and instead grabbed a knife to kill him,

572
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,370
that's not justifiable defense.

573
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,550
I did try to escape,

574
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
but as Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang
mentioned,

575
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,720
the fishery was completely surrounded
by metal fences,

576
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,320
I didn't even have a chance to
jump into the sea.

577
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,110
Under those circumstances,

578
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,130
I couldn't escape.

579
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,830
So Zhou Delong caught up with you
with a knife,

580
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,880
and then you took the knife
and stabbed him?

581
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,400
No.

582
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,750
I did take Zhou Delong's knife,

583
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,760
but I didn't immediately stab him.

584
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,400
Instead, I wanted to use the knife
to force him back.

585
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,070
But Zhou Delong disregarded his own safety

586
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,240
and continued to chase me

587
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,040
and attack me.

588
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,360
My head was injured and still bleeding.

589
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,480
My leg was tightly caught
in the fishing net.

590
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,440
My life was

591
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,300
in serious danger at that moment.

592
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,920
At that moment, I couldn't think clearly.

593
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,370
Duan Hongshan,

594
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,680
could it be that Zhou Delong reported you,

595
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,960
threatening your future and your family,

596
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,920
so you killed him?

597
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,320
I was protecting myself.

598
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,160
Zhou Delong was holding an iron hook,

599
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,550
swinging it at my head,

600
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,590
I had no choice but to fight back.

601
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,350
I see.

602
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,880
Well said.

603
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Your statements are inconsistent.

604
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,920
When things don't work in your favor,

605
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,450
you claim you were nervous,

606
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,160
but when it benefits you,

607
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,070
your statements become
clear and organized,

608
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,930
saying you were sane at that time.

609
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,310
I'm now more convinced

610
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,510
that to save yourself,

611
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,790
you killed Zhou Delong,

612
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,790
then fabricated this justifiable
defense scenario.

613
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,200
Your theory has no evidence.

614
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,680
My theory may lack evidence,

615
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,030
but so does your story.

616
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,510
The professor just said,

617
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,030
since there's no evidence,

618
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,310
we can't prove it was justifiable defense.

619
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,750
Even if you try to get away with it
with presumption of innocence,

620
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,030
we, the investigative team,

621
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,350
won't let this go.

622
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,680
We'll keep investigating
until we find the truth.

623
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,880
What do you think

624
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,580
will happen to Duan Hongshan?

625
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,480
I don't know either,

626
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,400
but at least

627
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,830
he's invoked

628
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,890
the statute of justifiable defense.

629
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,270
So there'll be bigger hopes for him.

630
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,550
But don't you think he's

631
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,480
also trapped by this same statute?

632
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,350
How many people can clearly

633
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,070
recite all these legal provisions?

634
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,000
Even if they memorize everything,

635
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,000
everyone interprets

636
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,460
the wording differently.

637
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,880
When can you fight back,

638
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,540
and when can't you fight back?

639
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,960
It's all too vague.

640
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,480
If only it could be like traffic lights.

641
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,920
Red light means stop.

642
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,680
Green light means go.

643
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,310
If the law could be that clear,

644
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,240
then we

645
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,110
wouldn't have to worry about
making mistakes.

646
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,160
Indeed.

647
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,640
I think

648
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,420
Under any circumstances,

649
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,350
anyone can commit a crime,

650
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,010
and such criminal behavior

651
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,110
doesn't determine

652
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,200
whether a person is good or evil.

653
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,970
Duan Hongshan,

654
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,550
we have no

655
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
personal grudge,

656
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,620
we're even both members
of the judicial system.

657
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,680
I should be inclined to side with you,

658
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,160
but there's something you should know:

659
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,030
you must be willing to sacrifice yourself

660
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,560
to work in law enforcement.

661
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,790
It seems

662
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,510
this is not a simple case.

663
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,310
It's quite a textbook example.

664
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,250
What I don't understand is,

665
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,310
if it wasn't intentional homicide,

666
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,750
why was a single stab

667
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,750
enough to pierce Zhou Delong's chest?

668
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,880
I don't know if you remember

669
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,420
a case from five years ago.

670
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,140
Two parties involved,

671
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,070
Diao and Guo.

672
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,880
Diao stole Guo's wife,

673
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,510
making him a cuckold,

674
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,400
and regularly beat him up.

675
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,110
Then one day,

676
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,160
Diao got drunk

677
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,680
and went to Guo's home again

678
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,960
to insult and beat him.

679
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,680
Guo couldn't escape,

680
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,320
and couldn't fight back,

681
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,070
so he grabbed a pair of scissors

682
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,730
and stabbed Old Diao to death.

683
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,720
Guo had no intention to kill,

684
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,920
but he was in extreme panic

685
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,030
and desperate to save his own life.

686
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,870
Are we still expecting him
to accurately judge

687
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,350
at that moment

688
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,880
whether Diao had already

689
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,200
lost the ability to continue his assault

690
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,000
while also considering

691
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,260
the appropriate level of self-defense?

692
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,110
That's too demanding.

693
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,240
It's not realistic.

694
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,040
No, wait, Duan Hongshan.

695
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,680
What does this case have to do

696
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,640
with your case?

697
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,000
He's referring to the a case in
the Supreme Procuratorate's

698
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,680
compilation of typical cases.

699
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,680
It's about analysis of Guo's
justifiable defense case.

700
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,880
But the knife was in your hand after all.

701
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,310
But he hadn't stopped the assault,

702
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,200
nor had he left the scene,

703
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,650
so it shouldn't be considered that
the threat was over.

704
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,480
You're just making sophistry.

705
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,410
This is Procuratorial Case No. 47,

706
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,920
the procuratorate's analysis

707
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,320
of Yu Haiming's justifiable defense case.

708
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,750
The situation I faced

709
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,640
can be found in previous cases

710
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,510
with similar circumstances,

711
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,070
all defined as justifiable defense.

712
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,920
How come in my case,

713
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,640
none of these definitions apply anymore?
