Jiang Ting has been released,

5
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,680
which brings you

6
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
one step closer to being acquitted.

7
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,710
It only proves

8
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,680
that during my handling
of Jiang Ting's case,

9
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,680
all my actions were legal and compliant,

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,610
and the allegations against me are false.

11
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,080
I have a question

12
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,090
that I'd like you to answer.

Go ahead.

14
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,280
What exactly is the law?

15
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,310
Is it a code of conduct,

16
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,370
or a tool for people to use?

17
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,810
The law is people's

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,250
expectation for a better life.

19
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,280
The consensus of the expectations
is the law.

20
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,290
Law is a fiction created by people,

21
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,750
yet it constrains people
in their real life.

22
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,360
Yes.

23
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,840
For ordinary people,

24
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,110
it's invisible and intangible,

25
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
yet it's ubiquitous like the air.

26
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,710
People don't really understand

27
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,970
where the true boundaries of the law lie.

28
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,030
However, what constitutes a crime

29
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,430
and how it should be sentenced

30
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,710
are all determined by these boundaries.

That has nothing to do with your case.

38

I was once the lead prosecutor
of Jiang Ting's case.

True.

44
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,970
The most suspicious person is Mei Zheng,

45
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,740
because only she knew
Jiang Ting's address.

46
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,520
However…

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,579
I think someone else might aslo be it.

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,680

49

He didn't want Mei Zheng to be in danger.

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,190
He didn't want Mei Zheng

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,630
to get involved in the dispute

52
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,560
between Jiang Ting and Zhang Yuan.

53
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,400
So, he secretly

54
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,430
gave Jiang Ting's home address

55
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,110
to Zhang Yuan in advance.

56
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,760
While Mei Zheng was away,

57
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,570
Zhang Yuan forcibly entered
Jiang Ting's home.

58
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,560
This way,

59
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,310
the entire case

60
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,760
could be separated from Mei Zheng.

61
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,240
At the public hearing,

62
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,950
Mei Zheng personally revealed

63
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,550
the secret from 14 years ago.

64
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,680
She let everyone know

65
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
that Zhang Yuan was her enemy.

66
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,830
In such situations,

67
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,040
people tend to say things

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,840
that serve their own interests,

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but Mei Zheng did just the opposite.

70

71

I believe

72
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,720
the only reason is

73
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,780
she wanted to protect
another person under suspicion.

Zhang Yuan's case

75

and who they don't want us to discover?

76
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,870

77

with knives.

81

It looks like they're hurting each other,

but in reality,

83

through amputation.

Back then, he asked me

90

if Mei Zheng would be forced to testify

91

If Mei Zheng had to

93
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,120
describe the assault in court,

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
he said he would rather plead guilty

95
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,330
and accept the punishment.

96
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,560

97

that he barely knew Mei Zheng.

98
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,150
