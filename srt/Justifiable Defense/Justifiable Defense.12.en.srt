5
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,770

9
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,800
Hello, we're...

10
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,730
We're from Huasheng Supermarket.

11
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,750

12
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,360
Yes.

13
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,750
I'm sorry,

14
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,680
we had some trouble recently.

15
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,610
I understand. We saw it on the news.

16
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,120
You must be having a hard time.

17

coming around asking questions,

19
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,260
turning everything upside down.

20
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,910

21
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,720
What are you here for?

22
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,470
We've already spoken with Mr. Zhang,

23
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,590
just here to check out the scene,

24
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,020

25
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,240
Sure, that's fine.

26
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,590
Go ahead, do your thing.

27
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,680
Thank you, Sir.

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,010
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

30
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,910
how did you know

31

32

33
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,510
Don't we need to do our research?

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,890
The police were
here investigating earlier.

35
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,360
They had to stop work for days.

36
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,400
They must be frustrated.

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,520
If we told them we came to investigate,

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
would they still cooperate with us?

39
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,520
The scene has already been cleaned up,

40
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,180
what can we possibly find now?

41
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,610
Zhou Delong isn't nearly
as strong as Duan Hongshan.

42
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,730
So how did he manage
to move Duan Hongshan?

43
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,620
I got it.

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,310
The dolly.

45
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,360
This place for him is

46
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,860
the most familiar,

47
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,800
and most advantageous.

48
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,390
How many times have I told you?

49
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,750
These are yellow croakers.
They're sensitive to light.

50
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,310
Once you take them out of water,

51
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,000
they change color in no time.

52
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,800
Sir,

53
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,000
I really didn't mean to.

54
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,870
Never mind.

55
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,920
It's too late to put them back now.

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,040
Throw away the dead ones,

57
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,020
and take the live ones inside for me.

58
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,750
Okay.

59
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,210
Where did Mei Zheng say

60
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,510
she found the phone?

61
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,720
She said it was

62
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,360
outside the breeding area.

63
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,070
If

64
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,430
Duan Hongshan and Zhou Delong

65
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,680
fought here,

66
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,240
and the phone fell,

67
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,430
how did it float outside
the breeding area?

68
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,120
Unless

69
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,750
Zhou Delong, like him,

70
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,950
threw the phone away.

71
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,040
Then he was trying to destroy

72
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
evidence of kidnapping Duan Hongshan?

73
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,640
That doesn't make sense.

74
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,270
If he wanted to destroy evidence,

75
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,800
why would he livestream it?

76
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,640
There's another possibility.

77
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,700
The person who found the phone

78
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
lied.

79
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,130
Look familiar?

80
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,600
Sorry to disturb your rest.

81
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,120
Zheng, why do you always seem

82
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,180
so nervous whenever I come to see you?

83
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,480
Do I?

84
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,170
Yes, you do.

85
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,620
Let's talk inside.

86
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,040
I have something to do later,

87
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,600
so you need to keep it brief.

88
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,450
Do you remember Zhou Delong's phone?

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,870
Phone?

90
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,240
Didn't I already give it to the police?

91
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,070
I want to know

92
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,040
if what you gave to the police

93
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,970
was actually Zhou Delong's phone.

94
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,560
Of course it was,

95
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,690
the one retrieved from the water.

96
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,800
I've already explained this.

97
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,480
Director Duan has helped me before,

98
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,680
and I just wanted to do

99
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,720
whatever I could for him in return.

100
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,360
Then why was there nothing on the phone?

101
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,290
Let me suggest a possibility,

102
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,120
shall I?

103
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,560
You said that

104
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,330
Zhou Delong was always watching you.

105
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,390
Is it possible that you already knew

106
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,850
about Zhou Delong's plan,

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
and wanted to use Duan Hongshan

108
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,240
to get rid of Zhou Delong as a problem?

109
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,800
But

110
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,830
you were afraid his phone

111
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,430
contained evidence against you.

112
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,310
So

113
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,630
you put on an act

114
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,070
of retrieving the phone.

115
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,480
And then

116
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,159
you switched it with another one...

117
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,830
-And gave it to the police.
-Officer.

118
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,070
I found a phone.

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,570

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,550

means to me?

126
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,160
Perhaps Zhou Delong

127
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,790
never stored anything
on it in the first place.

128
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:34,950
Fine,

129
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440

he doesn't seem like a killer.

561
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,920
It was just a moment of impulse.

562
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,510
And look,

563
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,400
he ruined his whole life.

564
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,840
In that situation,

565
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,240
if he hadn't fought back,

566
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,860
he might've been the one injured.

567
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,930
This is called a Prince Rupert's Drop,

568
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,380
also known as a glass tear.

569
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,110
The teardrop part

570
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,000
is much stronger than ordinary glass.

571
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,800
You can't even break it by force.

572
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,400
I heard that on opening day,

573
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,360
there'll be a light show up top,

574
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,320
a rainbow made of colored glass.

575
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,190
You know a lot.

576
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,190
He told me.

577
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,230
This...

578
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,150
What kind of drop?

579
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,450
Prince Rupert's Drop.

580
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,680
Does it mean something special?

581
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,880
Love.

582
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,510
No wonder.

583
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,290
The shape is so unique.

584
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,280
Thanks.

585
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,240
He probably made it for you.

586
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,110
Actually, his work

587
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,150
deserves to be seen in the sunlight.

588
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,760
Because of what happened 14 years ago,

589
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,090
he never had the chance.

590
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,000
Now it's finally happening.

591
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,080
A love that was delayed 14 years.

592
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,630
Cherish it well.
