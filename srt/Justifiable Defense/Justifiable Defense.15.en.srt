[Justifiable Defense]

00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,009
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,460
Justifiable defense.

4
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,590
It goes dormant when told to,

5
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,530
and restarts when told to.

6
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,509
But based on what?

7
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,510
Public expectation
and the progress of the rule of law.

8
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,640
Is it society's expectation,

9
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,120
or just yours?

10
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,280
Do you think you alone can represent

11
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,610
everyone's interests?

12
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,090
Why am I the one
who ended up being sacrificed?

13
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,750
After your case,

14
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,320
across the whole city of Wuyan,

15
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,579
the rate of student fights

16
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,280
causing injury or death

17
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,750
dropped significantly.

18
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,750
Take Wuyan Third High School,

19
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,360
ever since then,

20
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,270
bullying has nearly vanished.

21
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,450
Because of you,

22
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,970
teachers started to reflect,

23
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,760
students grew cautious,

24
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,120
those who were bullied learned

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,050
where the line of resistance lies,

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,680
and bullies

27
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,550
saw the worst that could happen.

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,560
You

29
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,680
influenced many of your peers.

30
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,150
But what does that have to do with me?

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,100
What about my own life?

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,870
Did you find

33
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,800
Zhou Delong?

34
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,890
He was the one who saved me.

35
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,400
[October 12, 2022]

36
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,960
Prosecutors like you,

37
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,970
always standing above others,

38
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,030
will never understand

39
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,840
the kind of life I lost.

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,000
You only spent seven days inside.

41
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,710
But me?

42
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,150
Four whole years.

43
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,800
I tried to reform.

44
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,079
Naively believed

45
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,630
I could start over.

46
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
But in the end,

47
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,870
the label of "murderer"

48
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,870
is stuck on me for life.

49
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,000
He committed murder...

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,540
-I couldn't get a job.
- And served time.

51
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,400
Li Mufeng,

52
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,630
according to regulations,

53
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,280
you can't pass the political screening,
you're ineligible for the bar exam.

54
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,140
-Couldn't even rent a place.
-Li.

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,370
We're not renting this place anymore.

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,190
You have to move out by next month.

57
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,870
Or I'm calling the police.

58
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,330
I'm sick of always
being stopped by the cops.

59
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,360
Li Mufeng.

60
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,510
Where are you headed now?

61
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,160
The provincial capital.

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,310
He's from Third High School.

63
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,950
Killed someone fourteen years ago.

64
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,750
I have a piece in an art show.

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,750
It's nearby.

66
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,600
If you have time,

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
you could bring them to see it.

68
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,360
The shop's busy.

69
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,000
-Even...
-We don't have time.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,390
My mom doesn't want to see me.

71
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,159
Go, go, go.

72
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:42,750
Mom.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
My life is ruined.

74
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,870
Besides dying,

75
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,360
what other option do I even have?

76
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,920
But just when I was at my lowest,

77
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,750
it was him,

78
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
Zhou Delong, who saved me.

79
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,600
He was mentally unstable

80
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,870
after Zhou Lin's death.

81
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,910
He sometimes mistook me for Zhou Lin.

82
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,560
He always believed

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,770
Mei Zheng killed his son.

84
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,310
He hated her.

85
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,510
And hated that you were helping her.

86
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:42,490
Thought there was something
wrong with your relationship.

87
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,250
Why did you save me?

88
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,390
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,190
No need.

90
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,910
Lin couldn't hear it anyway.

91
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,240
Can't you give me a chance,

92
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,130
a chance to make it up to you?

93
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,270
You can't.

94
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
The dead are gone.

95
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,800
The living suffer.

96
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,170
Throw your shoes in the river.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,630
Pretend you died once.

98
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,190
Come on.

99
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,270
One, two, three.

100
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,800
Listen,

101
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,960
don't follow me anymore.

102
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,360
Go home.

103
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,070
Sir.

104
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,580
I just want to make it up to you.

105
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,830
You're not the one

106
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,160
who owes me.

107
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,970
It's that girl who seduced
my son, Mei Zheng.

108
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,549
And that prosecutor

109
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,070
who can't tell right from wrong.

110
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,790
They used you.

111
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,090
They're the ones at fault.

112
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,080
And me too.

113
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,550
I didn't spend enough time with him.

114
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,320
That's why those people

115
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,360
had the chance to hurt him.

116
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,200
If that hadn't happened back then,

117
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,510
my son Zhou Lin

118
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,690
would probably
have turned out just like you.

119
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,600
You know,

120
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,790
I often

121
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,360
see Lin in my dreams.

122
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,030
He was

123
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,230
just standing there,

124
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,600
not far from me,

125
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,960
covered in blood.

126
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,550
Reaching out to me.

127
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,390
Just like when he was little,

128
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,480
asking me to hold him.

129
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,790
Or maybe,

130
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,210
asking me to pull him back.

131
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,240
But I

132
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,670
couldn't do anything.

133
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,080
Sir.

134
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,030
If I'd been the one stabbed that day,

135
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,240
what would you have done?

136
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,790
I'd have died.

137
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,990
To atone for Zhou Lin,

138
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,270
for your family.

139
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,180
We all thought Zhou Delong hated you.

140
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,740
But it's the opposite.

141
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,180
You've been with him all this time

142
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,770
just in a different way.

143
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,870
Li Mufeng.

144
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,550
Tell me the truth.

145
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,360
Did Mei Zheng kill Lin?

146
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,270
Did you take the fall for her?

147
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,840
That woman.

148
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,800
There's definitely
something wrong with her.

149
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,080
What?

150
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,030
In Jiang Ting's case,

151
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,510
Duan Hongshan
wants to rule it justifiable defense?

152
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,630
Mei Zheng's testimony helped.

153
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,480
Most likely,

154
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,270
justifiable defense.

155
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,440
False testimony.

156
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,480
It has to be.

157
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,280
I'm going to report Duan Hongshan.

158
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,240
This time,

159
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll make sure

160
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,790
he's removed as a prosecutor.

161
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,870
Duan is now
Director of the First Procuratorial Department.

162
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,360
Taking him down

163
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,080
won't be easy.

164
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,870
Li Mufeng,

165
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,240
you're smart.

166
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,240
You'll find a way.

167
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,080
If not for Duan Hongshan,

168
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,390
you wouldn't have been branded a murderer.

169
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,080
And Lin

170
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,870
wouldn't have been accused of rape.

171
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,200
We can't let him go.

172
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,200
Whatever way we use,

173
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,320
it's too dangerous.

174
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,920
I'm not even afraid of dying.

175
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,870
Truth is,

176
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,510
I've got cancer.

177
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,270
At most,

178
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,480
I have two months left.

179
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,960
What I fear most

180
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,320
is dying without

181
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,480
seeing Duan Hongshan punished.

182
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,000
Lin's gone.

183
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,270
My heart

184
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,120
died with him.

185
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,080
Until I met you.

186
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,390
You

187
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,960
reminded me of Lin.

188
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,160
These past few years,

189
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,750
you made me feel like I wasn't alone.

190
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,150
That's enough.

191
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,510
Now,

192
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,270
