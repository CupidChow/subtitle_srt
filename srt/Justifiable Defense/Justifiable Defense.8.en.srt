the actions of the petitioner, Li Mufeng,

32

Yes.

Zhang Yuan was suspected of harassing you,

but this circumstantial evidence

35
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,750

57
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,350

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The legal facts indicated that only three
people were present at the scene.

We can't just accept that 14 years later,

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,480
Mei Zheng claims without evidence
that Zhang Yuan was there

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,610
and then we'll all conclude it's true.

you remembered
Zhou Lin's previous harassment of her

them kissing in a secluded area.

Everyone said so,

182
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,000
but did you personally see

her kissing or hugging Zhou Lin,

184

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,840
I didn't.

186
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960

At that time, everyone was saying it.

00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,960
So your testimony

189
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,030
is based on hearsay, isn't it?

190
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,030
And you didn't even know

191
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,630
Li Mufeng or Mei Zheng at all.

192
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,390
Oh my God, so much blood.

193
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,960
Mei Zheng is nothing but trouble.

194
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,200
She actually encouraged Li Mufeng
to kill Zhou Lin.

195
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,960
Yeah.

196
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,550
Step back, step back.

197
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,670
She's even pretending to be the victim.

198
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,690
It's terrifying.

199
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,390
Zhang Yuan.

200
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,720
Weren't you pretty close with Zhou Lin?

201
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,150
Weren't you in the same class?

202
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,120
I guess so.

203
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,650
Zhou Lin, Li Mufeng, and Mei Zheng -

204
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,440
what exactly was going on
among the three of them?

205
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,270
The teacher asked me
to talk to the police.

206
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,770
I'm scared to death.

207
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,310
What am I supposed to say?

208
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,920
Don't you know
what kind of person Mei Zheng is?

209
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,010
Before Mei Zheng even graduated,

210
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,480
lots of people saw her

211
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,120
taking older boys

212
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,640
to the library for dates.

213
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,320
The library?

214
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,080
How do you date in a library?

215
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,360
It's not strictly supervised

216
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,510
and hardly anyone goes there.

217
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,080
Once they're there,

218
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,810
they can do whatever they want.

219
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,030
She even had the nerve to claim

220
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,630
she was tutoring those boys.

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,330
And the way she dressed?

222
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,070
Her skirts was up to here.

223
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,840
All the buttons on her chest were undone.

224
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,910
She even wanted to tutor me.

225
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,390
So, you...

226
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,150
Would I ever bother with
someone like that?

227
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,000
That kind of person, let me tell you,

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
to put it bluntly,

229
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,910
she's just a tart.

230
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,070
A famous one in the whole school.

231
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,200
She seduced two boys into
fighting over her,

232
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,030
and it ended in a knife fight.

233
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,960
Isn't that exactly what happened?

234
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,920
So, should I tell the police

235
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,270
exactly that?

236
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,870
Just tell the truth.

237
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,710
Jiang Ting.

238
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,600
Your few simple words

239
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,240
ruined 14 years of two people's lives.

240
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,440
Me?

241
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,790
Let's talk about your husband, Zhang Yuan.

242
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,840
What does he have to do

243
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,570
with the case from 14 years ago?

244
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,630
The fact that I'm asking means
there is a connection.

245
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,690
You don't need to know anything else.

246
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,550
Fang Lingyuan.

247
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,770
Why are you pestering me?

248
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,720
Are you trying to frame me for murder?

249
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,490
Sit down.

250
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,640
Sit down.

251
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,920
Control your emotions! Sit properly!

252
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,270
I just want to talk about

253
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,130
your husband's high school days.

254
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,000
Why are you so agitated?

255
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,690
I'm not very clear about that.

256
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,580
He was one year ahead of me.

257
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,730
I only saw his name

258
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,920
at the top of the grade rankings.

259
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,270
Did he show any violent

260
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,130
or abusive tendencies back then?

261
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,120
Do you think I'm crazy?

262
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,200
Would I have married him

263
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,510
if I knew he was violent?

264
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,510
Witness Jiang Ting,

265
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,440
are you saying that

266
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,030
you're strongly against
violent behavior, correct?

267
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,910
Do you remember

268
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,390
this outfit,

269
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,750
my class monitor, Jiang Ting?

270
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,720
My family

271
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,790
ran a tailor shop.

272
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,060
It didn't make much money.

273
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,870
All the clothes I wore since I was little

274
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,400
were handmade by my father.

275
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,960
My father, to do what he could

276
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,700
to let me wear nice clothes,

277
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,720
would copy designs from stores.

278
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,870
Coincidentally,

279
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,510
this outfit was

280
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,150
the same as the one my class monitor,

281
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Jiang Ting, wore.

282
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,680
But what I didn't expect was,

283
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,750
just because I wore the same clothes

284
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,120
as my class monitor,

285
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,670
throughout my three years of high school,

286
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,760
So ugly!

287
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,960
-I've been abused,
-Eat it.

288
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,790
beated, and bullied.

289
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,120
Eat it!

290
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,410
Search her!

291
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,340
I always thought
it was the fault of this outfit.

292
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,190
Fortunately,

293
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,120
I don't think that way anymore.

294
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,550
I admit

295
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
we had issues before,

296
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,650
but after those things happened,

297
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,080
we never even spoke to each other again.

298
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,240
How could I have bullied you?

299
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,420
We indeed barely spoke to each other,

300
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,720
but Jiang Ting,

301
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,360
you led and incited other students

302
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,390
to bully me,

303
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,320
humiliate me, and beat me.

304
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,750
Do you think such behavior

305
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,320
counts as bullying or not?

306
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,910
That was all their fault.

307
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,570
I expected this answer.

308
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,180
I knew you would respond this way.

309
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,670
This Jiang Ting was a bully before.

310
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,630
Didn't people on the internet say

311
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,080
she was a poor woman

312
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,870
fighting against domestic violence?

313
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,960
Prosecutor Fang

314
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,480
seems to be the lead prosecutor
in Jiang Ting's case.

315
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,680
According to the regulations,

316
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,810
shouldn't she recuse herself from it?

317
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,750
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang,

318
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,880
I don't understand.

319
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,750
What does all this have to do

320
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,790
with Li Mufeng's case from 14 years ago?

321
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,790
Don't forget

322
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,720
the appeal request

323
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,550
of today's public hearing.

324
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,400
I haven't forgotten.

325
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,440
Now I'm getting to the key point.

326
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,680
There's a type of bully

327
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,770
who doesn't appear menacing or vicious.

328
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,360
They might actually seem quite friendly.

329
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,350
They use their own methods

330
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,510
to gradually

331
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,790
isolate their targeted victims.

332
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,200
In social settings,

333
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,890
they're probably very accomplished

334
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,720
or very popular.

335
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,790
They're so exceptional
that others can't even believe

336
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,790
they would do such terrible things.

337
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,320
But precisely because
others think that way,

338
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,160
they become even more reckless.

339
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,920
And Jiang Ting and Zhang Yuan

340
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,970
were exactly this type of
exceptional bullies.

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I have, in my hand,

342
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,110
Zhou Lin's autopsy report

343
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,070
from 14 years ago.

344
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,880
The autopsy report shows

345
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,350
that Zhou Lin had extensive tattoos
on his body.

346
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,310
At first, I thought

347
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,350
these tattoos were just

348
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,070
Zhou Lin's way of expressing himself

349
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,680
during his rebellious phase.

350
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,940
But later, when I looked more carefully,

351
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,050
I discovered that underneath those tattoos

352
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,810
was hidden his past.

353
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,750
You can take

354
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,410
a close look at these tattoos.

355
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,030
Can you notice

356
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,750
that underneath the tattoos,

357
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,350
there are numerous

358
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,270
cigarette burn scars?

359
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,920
He got all those tattoos

360
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,790
to cover up these burn scars,

361
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,790
and these scars

362
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,000
are evidence of the bullying
Zhou Lin endured.

363
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,520
Witness Mei Zheng,

364
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,410
did you know about this all along?

365
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,740
Yes.

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,330
I can't take it anymore.

367
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
It hurts too much.

368
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,550
Just one more step,

369
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,870
and our ritual will be complete.

370
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,110
There are so many already.
It's still not enough?

371
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,040
Have you forgotten what I told you?

372
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,400
This is our testament,

373
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,090
a testament to our friendship.

374
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,480
Isn't this what they all do on TV?

375
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,350
Real brothers swear blood oaths.

376
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,920
I've already been burned so many times.

377
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,160
It really hurts. I can't stand it anymore.

378
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,560
Let me ask you something.

379
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,070
In this school,

380
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,720
who else would
hang out with you besides me?

381
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,670
Does anyone else in this school
even want to talk to you?

382
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,480
Come on.

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,240
One more time. Just one last burn.

384
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,880
Yuan,

385
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,350
can we not do it?

386
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,830
Fine,

387
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,730
then let's not hang out together anymore.

388
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,200
Yuan.

389
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,380
Real man.

390
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,240
We're still brothers, right?

391
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,920
Of course.

392
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,720
My best brother.

393
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,650
We're friends forever.

394
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,340
I once asked Zhou Lin

395
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,920
if he needed help.

396
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,880
But he told me

397
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,680
it was voluntary.

398
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,920
So, that day,

399
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,480
was it Zhang Yuan
who sent Zhou Lin to the library?

400
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,600
I guess that was the case.

401
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,790
But weren't those two kids friends?

402
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,430
Even if Zhou Lin was bullied,

403
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,200
he was perfectly capable of fighting back.

404
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
If Zhang Yuan was bullying Zhou Lin,

405
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,840
other students would have known about it.

406
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,550
Bullying.

407
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,610
It's not just physical violence.

408
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,140
There's another kind:

409
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,350
social isolation

410
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,600
and verbal humiliation.

411
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,920
In school,

412
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,490
we tend to categorize people
into two groups.

413
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,790
The first group are
those with good grades,

414
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,120
the ones teachers like.

415
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,040
Then there's another group,

416
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,840
those the teachers don't like,

417
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,480
the ones with poor grades

418
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,810
and odd personalities.

419
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,360
And often, this group

420
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,800
becomes the target of bullying.

421
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,960
Zhou Lin belonged to the latter.

422
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,340
During his time at school,

423
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,510
no one wanted to be his friend.

424
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,640
For a teenager,

425
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,880
the feeling of loneliness is terrifying.

426
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,960
And at that moment,

427
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,750
if someone suddenly

428
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,400
was willing to approach him

429
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,960
and be his friend,

430
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
then this person,

431
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,550
for Zhou Lin,

432
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,080
was undoubtedly a lifeline.

433
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,000
And Zhang Yuan

434
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,700
was that lifeline.

435
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,960
So,

436
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,510
any request from Zhang Yuan,

437
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,490
Zhou Lin would fulfill.

438
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,140
That's because he cherished this friend

439
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,400
and this

440
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,860
seemingly hard-won friendship.

441
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,030
Even though…

442
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,590
Zhang Yuan just treated him as

443
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,920
a tool to be used at will.

444
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,410
Even though…

445
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,310
Zhou Lin

446
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,750
paid for it with his life.

447
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,030
What Zhang Yuan used to control Zhou Lin

448
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
was perhaps just a casual phrase,

449
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,070
"Aren't we friends?"

450
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,680
For Zhou Lin,

451
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,200
just because they were friends,

452
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,070
he'd go to any lengths?

453
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,160
Perhaps only Zhou Lin

454
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,170
could answer that question of yours.

455
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,590
Zhang Yuan looked gentle,

456
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,030
kind, and filial,

457
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,960
but it was just his mask.

458
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,550
In fact, Zhang Yuan

459
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,400
controlled Zhou Lin.

460
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,550
Buddy.

461
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,220
He bullied Mei Zheng.

462
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,240
Fragile.

463
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,950
He abused Jiang Ting.

464
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,220
So, Witness Mei Zheng,

465
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,880
did you know all this all along?

466
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,270
But because Zhou Lin

467
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,920
wasn't the real mastermind

468
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,110
and you were worried
Li Mufeng would receive a heavy sentence,

469
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,680
so you hid all this for 14 years.

470
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,880
But 14 years ago,

471
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,750
except for Mei Zheng,

472
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,790
no one knew Zhang Yuan was at the scene.

473
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,880
I don't think this could be

474
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,410
a reason to rule my case
as excessive defense.

475
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,590
I think

476
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,350
only Prosecutor Duan Hongshan

477
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,080
knows the answer to all of this.

478
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,910
[Procuratorial Hearing
Wuyan Municipal People's Procuratorate]

479
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,480
Next,

480
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,940
I'd like to invite the former prosecutor

481
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,160
of Zhou Lin's case, Duan Hongshan,

482
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,750
to explain the questionable aspects

483
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,590
of this case.

484
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,400
As to the case of
Li Mufeng's excessive defense

485
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,130
resulting in Zhou Lin's death,

486
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
if we look solely at the crime scene,

487
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,280
it's actually not complicated.

488
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,920
The two had a conflict in the library.

489
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,920
Li Mufeng stabbed Zhou Lin with a knife,

490
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,590
causing the death of the latter.

491
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,850
It's as simple as that.

492
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,440
However, when considering the entire case,

493
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,120
trying to reconstruct the whole incident

494
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,130
is not simple at all.

495
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,480
The reason is that the statements
from the parties involved

496
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,750
and the witnesses

497
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,410
are inconsistent.

498
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,850
The case from back then

499
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,310
has no audio or video evidence

500
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,470
that could reconstruct
what truly happened at the scene.

501
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,780
Duan Hongshan, I have a question.

502
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,750
There was a fourth person
at the scene, Zhang Yuan.

503
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,680
Do you know that?

504
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,370
I was not aware of that.

505
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,690
All evidence used to determine

506
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,400
the nature of this case

507
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,440
was included

508
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,680
in the case file.

509
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,750
Evidence is our only basis

510
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,350
for establishing the legal facts
of this case.

511
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,790
Then why did you, 14 years ago,

512
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,550
determine that Li Mufeng's actions
were excessive defense?

513
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,550
As we all know,

514
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,160
justifiable defense

515
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,910
is stated in
Article 20 of the Criminal Law.

516
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,690
It reflects the legislators'

517
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,000
affirmation of an individual's right
to self-defense.

518
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,400
As judicial personnel,

519
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,930
we must first implement
the legislators' intent,

520
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,070
[Knowledge Changes Fate; Effort Reshapes Future]

521
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,130
clearly identify the actions
of individuals in a case,

522
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,950
and determine the boundary
between guilt and innocence.

523
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,040
Of course,

524
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,830
we cannot enforce the law mechanically;

525
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,960
nor can we be swayed by emotions

526
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,270
resulting in
misinterpreting objective facts

527
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,680
or making incorrect judgments.

528
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,720
That's because the judicial system

529
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,960
is the last line of defense

530
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
in upholding justice in our society.

531
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,400
Article 20 of the Criminal Law

532
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,400
is divided into three paragraphs.

533
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,030
The first paragraph
defines justifiable defense.

534
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,680
The second paragraph
describes excessive defense.

535
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,340
The third paragraph
mentions special defense.

536
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,720
During the social investigation
of this case,

537
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,790
we learned that

538
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,000
Li Mufeng was normally
an excellent student

539
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,920
with very good evaluations.

540
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,880
And based on the evidence

541
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,350
obtained from
the crime scene investigation,

542
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,550
we could confirm that

543
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,240
Li Mufeng was indeed

544
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,680
being subjected to

545
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,730
unlawful harm at that time.

546
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,440
Therefore,

547
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,640
we determined that Li Mufeng's actions

548
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,740
had defensive characteristics.

549
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,950
Then I'd like to ask this.

550
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,400
Why did you consistently
classify my actions as

551
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,530
excessive defense?

552
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,310
In the following provision,

553
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,200
there is a proviso.

554
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,880
However,

555
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,070
when defense exceeds necessary limits

556
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,480
and causes significant harm,

557
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,140
criminal responsibility must be borne.

558
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,290
Back then, Zhou Lin

559
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,830
had no motive to kill Li Mufeng.

560
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,770
Nor was there premeditation.

561
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,070
The stick he used to attack Li Mufeng

562
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,840
wasn't a very thick one

563
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,940
and wasn't enough to kill Li Mufeng.

564
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,170
However, Li Mufeng was holding

565
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,580
a deadly weapon

566
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,830
and eventually killed Zhou Lin with it.

567
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,440
That caused serious harm

568
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,110
and thus exceeded the limits
of justifiable defense.

569
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,350
I don't understand why

570
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,070
actions taken to stop unlawful harm

571
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,070
would ultimately be classified as…

572
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,200
as a conflict!

573
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,160
Why, when someone is being beaten,

574
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,310
would a knife of unknown origin
falling to the ground

575
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,720
be considered not life-threatening?

576
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,160
Okay, we just mentioned special defense.

577
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,880
Special defense refers to

578
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,720
the defensive actions taken against

579
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,480
onging violent crimes
posing a threat to personal safety,

580
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,400
such as homicide,

581
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,350
robbery, rape, and kidnapping

582
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,350
and resulting in
the perpetrator's injury or death

583
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,510
are not considered excessive defense.

584
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,110
No criminal responsibility
needs to be borne.

585
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
I'd like to ask

586
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,830
why my case didn't qualify
as special defense.

587
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,680
Was Zhou Lin

588
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:19,030
in the act of raping Mei Zheng
at that time?

589
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,570
From Mei Zheng's testimony back then

590
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,720
and the evidence
from the crime scene investigation,

591
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,440
we cannot confirm

592
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,640
that Zhou Lin was actually committing rape

593
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,440
against Mei Zheng at that moment.

594
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,500
Therefore, I cannot rule your actions
as special defense.

595
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,750
If no new evidence emerges today,

596
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,590
I will stand by my determination

597
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,050
from 14 years ago regarding this case.

598
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,550
Li Mufeng,

599
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,640
your willingness to step forward

600
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,200
when someone near you

601
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,360
suffers unlawful harm,

602
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,410
disregarding your own safety,

603
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,530
is truly commendable.

604
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,920
When handling the case,

605
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,000
I fully considered the righteousness
of your actions

606
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,590
and did everything possible

607
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,920
to reduce your sentence to the minimum.

608
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,320
During these four years,

609
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,880
you've taught yourself law

610
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,630
and become familiar with it.

611
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,450
I'm sure you can understand

612
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,650
my position as a judicial officer.

613
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,610
No crime or punishment without law.

614
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,160
Helping people distinguish

615
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,200
between justifiable defense

616
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,750
and excessive defense through cases

617
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,150
is extremely important.

618
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
It ensures that such acts of courage

619
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,240
are protected by law,

620
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,110
and at the same time,
social hostility won't be fostered.

621
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,240
This way, people won't mistakenly believe

622
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,970
that fighting back with a knife

623
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,720
is the right thing to do.

624
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,480
Otherwise, when they face conflicts
in the future,

625
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,880
they'll just grab a knife

626
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,350
and kill someone.

627
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,160
Of course I encourage people

628
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,070
to fight back when they're being

629
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,270
unlawfully attacked,

630
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,270
but I absolutely do not encourage them

631
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,270
to casually use dangerous weapons.

632
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,680
If this behavior becomes widespread,

633
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,010
it would be terrifying.

634
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,160
So,

635
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,640
this is what you considered

636
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,840
the most righteous choice.

637
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,920
Back then,

638
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,770
when facing that crossroads,

639
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,450
I had to make a choice

640
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,350
to prevent others from

641
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,240
copying you.

642
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,880
Just not long ago,

643
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,810
Prosecutor Fang Lingyuan

644
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,750
mentioned this to me again:

645
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,210
"It's not the cases
that we prosecutors handle,

646
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,310
but people's lives."

647
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,860
The Case 6.28 from 14 years ago

648
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,830
has changed your life.

649
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,340
Fourteen years later,

650
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,120
it's also changing mine.

651
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,110
I, Li Mufeng,

652
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,720
withdraw my appeal.

653
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,630
What does that mean?

654
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,160
Withdraw?

655
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,790
Yeah.

656
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,790
What does that mean?

657
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,910
What's going on?

658
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,400
[Procuratorial Hearing,
Wuyan Municipal People's Procuratorate]

659
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,530
The hearing is over.

660
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,400
Go, Duan Hongshan.

661
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,040
Take him back to his cell.

662
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,110
What about Li Mufeng?

663
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,090
Do you think he hates you?

664
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,900
He believes you ruined his life.

665
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,969
This is Li Mufeng's answer,

666
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,540
an answer through action.

667
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,429
But the defendant Li Mufeng

668
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,130
used the knife.

669
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,070
He stabbed the victim, Zhou Lin,

670
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,230
and caused his death.

671
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,710
If you had seen that knife

672
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,810
fall to the ground,

673
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,150
w-what would you have done?

674
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,400
Died of hemorrhagic shock,

675
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,380
caused by a stab wound to the chest.

676
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,870
Yet you managed to kill with one strike.

677
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,330
I reacted instinctively.

678
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,540
I wasn't even aware where I was stabbing.

679
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,960
Is it possible you did it deliberately?

680
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,070
What I did was entirely
justifiable defense!

681
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,659
He's well-versed in law,

682
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,110
skilled in strategy,

683
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,800
and particularly knowledgeable
about justifiable defense.

684
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,460
The person you're describing

685
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,790
sounds a lot like you.

686
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,630
I was truly acting in justifiable defense.

687
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,660
Duan Hongshan!

688
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,550
Duan Hongshan.

689
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,210
Duan Hongshan.

690
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,360
Duan Hongshan.

691
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,420
You are a murderer.

692
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,890
What you did is murder!

693
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,920
Duan Hongshan.

694
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,840
Just confess.

695
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,640
Confessing can reduce your sentence.

696
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
How exactly did you kill him?

697
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,120
Duan Hongshan, what you did is murder.

698
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,360
Confess your crime.

699
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,400
Duan Hongshan, you are a murderer.

700
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,800
I was truly acting in justifiable defense.

701
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,140
Duan Hongshan.

702
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,070
What you did

703
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,150
is murder.

704
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,480
Zhou Delong was 67 years old

705
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,770
with terminal cancer.

706
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,500
Your height and weight

707
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,340
far exceed his.

708
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,920
You could totally have taken the knife
and escaped.

709
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
But instead,

710
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,210
you chose to stab him to death.

711
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,360
That goes far beyond

712
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
the limits of justifiable defense.

713
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,440
No.

714
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,160
That's not true.

715
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,070
You're a prosecutor.
You know perfectly well

716
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,330
what constitutes justifiable defense,

717
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,620
so you exploited this knowledge.

718
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,080
Tell me.

719
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,190
You stabbed an unarmed cancer-stricken
elderly to death.

720
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,760
Why are your actions justifiable defense,

721
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:50,770
but not mine?

722
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,810
On what grounds?

723
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,960
On what grounds?

724
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,190
You're awake.

725
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,630
Why are you here?

726
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,140
I asked about your condition.

727
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,630
It was caused by extreme stress,

728
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,590
malnutrition,

729
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,150
and sleep deprivation.

730
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,150
An IV drip will help.

731
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,090
You need to take care of yourself,

732
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,530
even if it's for Yingying's sake.

733
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,150
Even if I clear my name,

734
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,800
will I ever truly be free?

735
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,890
You need to trust me.

736
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,920
Okay?

737
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,110
I've always trusted you.

738
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,190
You've never lost a case.

739
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,090
But I understand prosecutors better

740
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,050
and how the justice system works.

741
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,230
I had a dream.

742
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,510
What did you dream about?

743
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,090
I dreamed about Li Mufeng.

744
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,030
I was just like him,

745
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,480
locked up in here

746
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,070
day and night.

747
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,060
We didn't know when we'd be released,

748
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,360
