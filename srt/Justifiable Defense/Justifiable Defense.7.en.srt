Is it because you had issues with her?

27
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,750
Are you trying take a revenge on her

Stop hitting her!

171
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,630
If she tells on us to the teacher,

172
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,760
we'll be in trouble.

173
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,770

174

Back then, Jiang Ting

179

180
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,510

185

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,780
being so arrogant today?

190
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,460
I'm so done with her.

191
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,320
If it weren't for

192
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,870
my son's schooling matter,

193
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,800
I wouldn't have been so nice to her.

194
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,480
Just now,

195
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,010
how could you even say that?

196
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,560
What have you ever done to help her?

197
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,790
I remember when we bullied her back then,

198
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,870
you contributed the most.

199
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,450
Not me.

200
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,120
Fang Lingyuan got a poker face.

201
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,650
I really want to ignore her.

202
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,840
Let me tell you,

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,270
Fang Lingyuan...

204
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,390
What's new about Fang Lingyuan?

205
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,610
This is so awkward.

206
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,450
Come on, everyone, have another drink.

207
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,030
Be careful.

208
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,510
Are you okay?

209
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,780
You...

210
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,940
Be careful.

211
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,840
Here.

212
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,440
Thank you.

213
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Drank too much at the class reunion?

214
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,030
No.

215
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,120
Hold this for me.

216
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,880
Was Jiang Ting your classmate?

217
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,550
Yes, who are you?

218
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,480
Here's my business card.

219
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,670
[Lawyer Lei Shuang]

220
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,870
Ms. Lei.

221
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,320
Can I have a chat with you?

222
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,120
Does it fit?

223
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,240
Yes.

224
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,240
When was it made?

225
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,580
You don't come back often.

226
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,450
Your dad

227
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,840
makes one for you

228
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,200
now and then.

229
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,810
The closet is almost full of the clothes
he made for you.

230
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,200
So,

231
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,670
how's his gout?

232
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,560
Not much difference.

233
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,390
I told him to drink less every day.

234
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,720
But he wouldn't listen.

235
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,480
He often cries in pain at night.

236
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,600
We used to be reluctant to
spend much money.

237
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,390
Your clothes

238
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,120
were all made by your dad.

239
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,110
I remember once

240
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,370
a customer brought a designer outfit.

241
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,240
Your dad thought it was very good.

242
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,360
So he made an outfit

243
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,790
in its style for you.

244
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,120
He even stitched an extra rabbit doll
on it.

245
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,720
Mom.

246
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,170
Let's not talk about the past.

247
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,870
I think the clothes my dad made for me
are good.

248
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,070
Even better than the designer clothes.

249
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,120
I'll call your dad

250
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,440
to ask when he'll come back.

251
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,790
Mrs. Fang, is my outfit ready?

252
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,790
Li, you're here.

253
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,400
I've finished tailoring your outfit.

254
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,440
This is my daughter, Lingyuan.

255
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,610
She works in the provincial capital.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I didn't know

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,400
your home is so close to
our glass workshop.

258
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,830
But how come I've never seen you before?

259
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,670
It's normal.

260
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,440
I went to college in
the provincial capital.

261
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,320
I've been working there since I graduated.

262
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
I only come back

263
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,790
a few times a year,

264
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,480
It's normal that you've never seen me before.

265
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,150
Right.

266
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,420
Your job must be very busy.

267
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,440
Yes.

268
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,070
That's one of the reasons.

269
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,360
And...

270
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,500
When did you move here?

271
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,240
Almost ten years ago.

272
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,150
I couldn't find a job after I
got released from prison.

273
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,630
Then I became an apprentice
of my current master.

274
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,480
I moved here with him.

275
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,440
Ten years ago?

276
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,390
Ten years ago,

277
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,410
I was about to graduate from university.

278
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,100
Busy with the bar exam?

279
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,520
I graduated a year ahead of you.

280
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,390
I remember a question
on that year's exam.

281
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,630
Facts 3.

282
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,220
After Person A and Person B
committed burglary and murder,

283
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,550
they assaulted the police and ran away.

284
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,510
In pursuit of justice, Xie ran after
Person A and Person B.

285
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,270
In order to prevent Xie
from overtaking their car,

286
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,110
Person A and Person B
drove in a serpentine way.

287
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,030
After a 2-kilometer drive,

288
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,670
their car hit a cement barrier
on the road.

289
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,320
Xie had no time to brake

290
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,200
and hit the car of Person A
and Person B.

291
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,750
As a result, Xie got critically injured.

292
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,680
This should be a question
on that year's exam, right?

293
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,440
I think so.

294
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,000
So,

295
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,590
what was your answer?

296
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,630
I...

297
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,480
It was too long ago. I almost forgot it.

298
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,320
Let me think.

299
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,200
Person A and Person B drove
in a serpentine way,

300
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,750
creating intolerable risks.

301
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,150
What they did was dangerous.

302
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,480
And that behavior led to

303
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,750
this outcome.

304
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,910
So both Person A and Person B

305
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,770
should take the responsibility.

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,530
I don't think that's right.

307
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,870
In some cases, although the person created

308
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,400
created intolerable risks

309
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,670
and caused the result.

310
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,720
But if the relation between the risks
and result is not

311
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,380
within the scope of the effectiveness
of constitutive elements,

312
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,920
the person doesn't need to
take responsibility for the result.

313
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,750
But I think

314
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,930
the fugitive should take
some responsibility.

315
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,600
Let me give you an example.

316
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,270
If a drug seller sold drugs to someone
and the drugs caused the buyer's death,

317
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,120
should the seller

318
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,480
be charged with the crime
of negligent homicide?

319
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,470
If a prostitute with a venereal disease

320
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,510
told her customer that she had the disease

321
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,960
but the customer insisted having sex with
the prostitute and then got infected,

322
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,000
should the prostitute be charged

323
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,630
with offenses of causing bodily harm?

324
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,150
The drug buyer
and the prostitute's customer

325
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,270
were aware of the risks

326
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,200
and were willing to take full responsibility
for the risks.

327
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,930
The risks are self-trap risks.

328
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,250
In the case we discussed just now,

329
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,360
the behaviors of Person A and Person B

330
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,870
were one of the factors

331
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,910
for Xie's serious injury.

332
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,840
Xie was seriously injured

333
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,910
mainly because he drove improperly

334
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,790
and caused the rear-ending accident.

335
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,829
So,

336
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,720
the responsibility for the result

337
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,680
shouldn't be taken by Person A
and Person B.

338
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,589
This should be

339
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,400
the standard answer to the question
from that year, right?

340
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,859
You can still memorize it.

341
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,680
But more factors need to be taken
into consideration

342
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,410
in the actual judgment, right?

343
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,000
I didn't know until I became a prosecutor

344
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
that the Persons ABCD in those questions

345
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
on our test papers

346
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,590
are no longer imaginary figures.

347
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,310
They were real people.

348
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,790
So,

349
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,630
when we're working on a case,

350
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,480
we can't ignore

351
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,280
what the people in the cases
have been through.

352
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,440
You

353
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,010
are familiar with the law.

354
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,000
I was very interested in law
when I was in high school.

355
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,550
Actually, before I graduated
from high school,

356
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,440
I got the recommendation

357
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,130
and was admitted to your university.

358
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,830
Li Mufeng.

359
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,110
Your package.

360
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,920
Coming.

361
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,600
Thank you.

362
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,290
[Admission Letter]

363
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,620
-I dreamed to be a prosecutor back then
-Mom.

364
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,520
like you.

365
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,450
Have you heard

366
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,130
the story of the spider's web?

367
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,680
An unforgivable sinner

368
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,780
saved a spider

369
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,750
and got a chance to leave Hell.

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The Buddha put a cobweb down in Hell.

371
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,650
So he climbed up along the cobweb.

372
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,400
But during the process,

373
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,590
he found that other sinners

or the process of handling the case
is controversial?

468
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,310

485
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,720
What do you mean by "waste time"?

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,240
The person may have got a wrong verdict.

487
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,510
And he spent so many years in prison.

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,170

we must hold a public hearing

495
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,640
Though this is a case

496
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,110
from 14 years ago,

497
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,200
people who have lived in Wuyan for long

498
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,630

506
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,270

What we couldn't do in the past

541
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,880
can only be harder to achieve now.

542
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,640
I know.

543
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,590

00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,110
and it had been mistakenly
left there for some time.

748
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,510
It fell because your fight

749
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,110
knocked over the bookshelf.

750
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,210
According to evidence No. 30,

751
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,830
the weapon used by the victim

752
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,150
was a stick he randomly picked up

753
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,920
casually at the library entrance.

754
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,980
It was not very hard

755
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,110
and not lethal.

756
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,880
But you used a knife,

757
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,310
exceeding the limits of self-defense.

758
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,590
But I...

759
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,190
I didn't mean to hurt him.

760
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,480
I just wanted to protect myself.

761
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,510
And Zhou Lin fought a lot in school.

762
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,880
In that situation,

763
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,030
it was impossible for me to defeat him.

764
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,910
Defendant Li Mufeng.

765
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,030
You mentioned

766
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,920
Zhou Lin fought a lot in school.

767
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,400
Who can prove that?

768
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,110
I think my schoolmates can.

769
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,920
Once in the dining hall,

770
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,190
Li Mufeng and I sat behind Zhou Lin.

771
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:01,670
[Witness]

772
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,590
I heard Zhou Lin telling others

773
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,150
that Li Mufeng looked gentle

774
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,630
but maybe he was actually a violent boy

775
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,070
and maybe he was a pervert.

776
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,070
I heard that.

777
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,910
Li Mufeng must have heard it too.

778
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,320
I think

779
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,630
Li Mufeng probably started to
hate Zhou Lin

780
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,710
at that time.

781
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,930
My grades are average.

782
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,550
So our teacher asked Li to
help me with my study.

783
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,850
One day, it was very late.

784
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:25,230
[Witness]

785
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,190
and he said

786
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,880
he wanted to walk me home.

787
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,760
He kept following me that night.

788
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,420
I didn't know what he was up to.

789
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,230
Also,

790
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,310
he often went to the library.

791
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:36,460
One day, I was in the library to
borrow a book.

792
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,560
[Witness]

793
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,070
I saw him standing at the bookshelf,

794
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,320
being fishy.

795
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,500
like he was hiding something.

796
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,110
Soon,

797
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,960
Zhou Lin was killed.

798
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,670
I sent you home

799
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,190
because the teacher thought

800
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,440
it was too late after I finished
tutoring you that night

801
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,590
so he asked me to watch you...

802
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,230
When you got home, then...

803
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,000
Defendant, don't be so emotional.

804
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,110
Petitioner.

805
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,190
Petitioner Li Mufeng.

806
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,710
What is your request?

807
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,920
I want a retrial.

808
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,480
to overturn my guilty verdict.

809
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,880
Zhou Lin was sexually
harassing Mei Zheng.

810
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,000
I tried to stop him.

811
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,320
When he was beating me up,

812
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,000
a knife fell on the ground.

813
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,440
I was afraid he would use a knife

814
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,000
to hurt me,

815
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,880
so I counterattacked

816
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,070
to protect myself.

817
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,660
This is obviously justifiable defense.

818
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,000
But Prosecutor Duan Hongshan

819
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,600
insisted that what I did be
excessive defense.

820
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,480
During the investigation,

821
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,590
because I had been recommended and admitted
to the University of Political Science and Law,

822
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,280
he suspected I was using

823
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,580
the justifiable defense law to
escape punishment.

824
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,320
[Knowledge Changes Fate;
Effort Reshapes Future]

825
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
This is a wrong judgment.

826
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,030
And his conjecture was groundless.

827
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,230
It has

828
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,000
created a devastating impact on my life.

829
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,670
But you did kill him.

830
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,080
Zhou Lin had a stick, and you had a knife.

831
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,880
Prosecutor Duan Hongshan took the situation into account

832
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,960
and held that what you did was excessive defense.

833
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,710
You received a lighter sentence.

834
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,800
This isn't about severity, it's about

835
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,550
being guilty or not guilty.

836
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,510
Though it's excessive defense,

837
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,800
it's still a crime.

838
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,070
For the rest of my life,

839
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,230
I will be seen as a murderer.

840
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,680
Please think of yourselves

841
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,640
as an ordinary person on the scene.

842
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,590
What would you do

843
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,320
at that time?

844
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,030
When facing a threat to life,

845
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,840
I should consider whether my actions
of self-defense would be too much or not?

846
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,920
When facing a threat to life,

847
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,320
one should chose to either commit a crime
or wait ti be killed?

848
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,590
So I insist that what I did be
justifiable defense.

849
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,390
I'm innocent.

850
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,190
We need to collect more evidences
from different parties

851
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,110
to see whether there is anything wrong

852
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,840
with the way the case was handled
14 years ago.

853
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,920
Next, let's ask

854
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,450
the other person involved.

855
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,290
The witness, Mei Zheng.

856
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,880
Do you remember who he is?

857
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,630
Zhou Lin.

858
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,540
I'll never forget him.

859
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,920
As you said,

860
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,360
you were sexually harassed by Zhou Lin
in the library,

861
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,680
he was forcing you to have sex with him,

862
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,280
and when you shouted for help,

863
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,010
Li Mufeng arrived on the scene.

864
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,030
To protect you,

865
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:30,670
in the end,

866
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,590
he killed Zhou Lin

867
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,510
during his fight with Zhou Lin.

868
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,440
Is that so?

869
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,110
No.

870
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,480
To be precise,

871
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,940
not entirely true.

872
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,030
Did Zhou Lin harass you

873
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,510
when you were in school?

874
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,360
No.

875
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,680
Have you ever hated Zhou Lin or been
annoyed by him?

876
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,400
No.

877
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,280
He didn't have the intention

878
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,320
of beating you or sexually
assaulting you, right?

879
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,960
No.

880
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,120
What was your relationship with Zhou Lin?

881
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,280
We were just classmates.

882
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,190
He was a good person.

883
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,920
Back then,

884
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,660
the person who was always threatening me

885
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,110
was someone else.

886
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,130
My head was pressed on the bookshelf,

887
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,150
and his face was hidden behind that book.

888
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,320
Whose face?

889
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,160
Zhang Yuan's.

890
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,190
You mean

891
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,150
Zhang Yuan was there too?

892
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,360
He was there.

893
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,660
Stop fighting!

894
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,920
You're so cheap!

895
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,070
Hello?

896
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,530
Don't you find it strange?

897
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,520
What's strange?

898
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,320
It's been over two hours.

899
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,780
I haven't been called yet.

900
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,400
That only means

901
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,410
something big is happening on the scene.

902
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,110
I think she's lying.

903
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,150
Every word I said is true.

904
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,320
Then why haven't you

905
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,280
ever mentioned that for the past 14 years?

906
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,920
Why did you suddenly tell lies now?

907
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,190
I'm not lying.

908
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,030
What I said today

909
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,920
is the truth.

910
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,340
Witness Mei Zheng.

911
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,510
Can you guarantee

912
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,640
you're telling nothing but the truth?

913
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,440
It's been years.

914
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,760
Everyone says

915
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,550
I was seducing men

916
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:46,840
and I made men jealous.

917
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,670
and that's why things ended up like this.

918
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,480
But that's not the truth.

919
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,840
These are all rumors.

920
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,570
These are slanders against me.

921
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,050
Do you have any evidence to prove that?

922
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,510
I brought it here.

923
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,510
This is the phone I used
when I was in school.

924
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,280
The messages of harassment

925
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,540
Zhang Yuan sent me are still stored in it.

926
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:10,920
Senior.

927
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,710
Zhang Yuan.

928
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,920
What's up?

929
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:18,320
Happy birthday.

930
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,420
I made this specially for you.

931
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:22,320
Thank you.

932
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:27,250
[I like you. Please accept my love.
Happy birthday.]

933
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,530
I can't accept this.

934
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,430
You're in the 12th grade now.

935
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:35,830
You should focus on preparing
for the college entrance exam.

936
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,500
Senior.

937
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,630
Do you remember that word?

938
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,800
Fragile.

939
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:50,920
F-R-A-G-I-L-E.

940
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,710
This word

941
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,670
is very suitable to

942
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,270
describe your temperament.

943
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,710
Beautiful.

944
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,920
Delicate.

945
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,480
Fragile.

946
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,000
Brittle

947
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,190
Let's take a break.

948
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,400
Well.

949
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:19,360
Since the witness submitted a new evidence,

950
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,190
we will

951
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:21,650
take a short recess

952
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,340
We'll continue in an hour.

953
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,930
The lights went out.

954
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,070
The hearing is temporarily over.

955
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,530
It will resume in one hour.

956
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,380
Aren't you hungry?

957
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,720
My stomach's upset. I can't eat.

958
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,460
Do you think it's almost over?

959
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,360
On the contrary,

960
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,840
this will be a long battle.

961
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:35,970
Because everyone has their own purpose.

962
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,320
You are not there.

963
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,840
You can't hear a word.

964
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,800
How did you know?

965
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,440
Li Mufeng lodged an appeal

966
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:47,330
because he doesn't want to
be seen as a murderer.

967
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,330
Prosecutor Gong agreed to
hold this hearing

968
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:54,560
because he wanted to reassure the people.

969
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,450
Fang Lingyuan supported this hearing

970
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,840
to uncover the truth.

971
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,150
Everyone has their own plans.

972
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:22,590
I want to ask

973
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,630
why.

974
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,110
There is a witness from 14 years ago.

975
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,630
What is her plan?

976
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,070
She has been troubled

977
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,670
by the rumor for 14 years.

978
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,360
She's willing to attend this hearing today

979
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,240
and talk about what happened back then

980
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:45,360
because she's ready

981
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:49,150
to dispel the rumors

982
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,240
in front of everyone in Wuyan.

983
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,130
I've been seen as a slut for 14 years.

984
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,590
The rumors should be dispelled now.

985
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,440
I want to clear my name.

986
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,590
What about mine?
