00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,970
[Episode 10]

3
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,920
By the time I am released,

4
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,560
the rainy season should be over.

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,790
You won't hire a lawyer?

6
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,740
You plan to get out of here on your own?

7
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,000
I can defend myself at the hearing.

8
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Defend yourself?

9
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
You're locked up in here every day.

10
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,340
How will you defend yourself?

11
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,520
Locked up in here,

12
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,590
I don't know what's happening
in the outside world.

13
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,190
But there is someone who will

14
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,190
bring me information from outside.

15
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,000
Me?

16
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,120
I rearrange and analyze

17
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,350
the information you bring me

18
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,010
to find potential possibilities.

19
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,880
Write it down.

20
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,370
So what possibilities have you found?

21
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,780
The human eye is very sensitive to light.

22
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,910
Mei Zheng once said

23
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,120
she witnessed the entire crime,

24
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,380
using a beam of light to distinguish
between two knives.

25
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,190
But in Jiang Ting's testimony,

26
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,610
there was no mention of this light.

27
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,560
So there are two possibilities.

28
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,310
First,

29
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,610
Mei Zheng didn't use a flashlight.

30
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,520
Second,

31
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,340
she never witnessed the murder at all.

32
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,400
Mei Zheng anticipated

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,200
that Zhang Yuan would eventually
find Jiang Ting.

34
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,120
She only needed to keep fueling

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,579
the flames of revenge
in Jiang Ting's heart.

36
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,150
and then watch it happen.

37
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,220
When Jiang Ting committed the murder,

38
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,470
she came out and testified

39
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,210
that her actions were justifiable defense.

40
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,680
Then a perfect revenge was finished.

41
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,340
There's just one thing I'm still
not sure about.

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,360
Did Mei Zheng just want to have
Zhang Yuan killed for revenge

43
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,820
or did she also plan to send

44
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,250
Jiang Ting to prison at the same time?

45
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,010
No matter which possibility it is,

46
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,120
the most crucial evidence now

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
should be with Mei Zheng.

48
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,960
Are the handcuffs uncomfortable?

49
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,880
I've never had the chance before

50
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,710
to examine handcuffs so carefully.

51
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,590
There are three metal rings in the middle,

52
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,520
connecting the cuffs on both sides

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,530
and restraining a person here.

54
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,000
If the two ends of the handcuffs
represent Li Mufeng

55
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,070
and Jiang Ting,

56
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,000
then the metal ring connecting them
in the middle

57
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,240
is Mei Zheng.

58
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,190
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang,

59
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,990
would you like hot or cold water?

60
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,470
Hot water, thank you.

61
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,210
Is this where you saw
into Jiang Ting's home?

62
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,870
Thank you.

63
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,830
Zheng.

64
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,430
You seem quite nervous every time
you see me.

65
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,800
May I ask why?

66
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,750
You seem to have no problem

67
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,350
communicating with others.

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,310
Because they're just ordinary people,

69
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,240
but you're here to interrogate me.

70
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,630
So how do you communicate with Li Mufeng?

71
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,010
With Jiang Ting?

72
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,890
And with Duan Hongshan?

73
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,270
Or do you just

74
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,530
tell people what they want to hear?

75
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,430
You're joking around.

76
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,390
Is that funny?

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,130
I never joke during an interrogation.

78
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,120
Actually, before you took over this case,

79
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,360
I had some contact with a prosecutors.

80
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,800
I know, Director Duan.

81
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,230
But he's a suspect now,

82
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,430
so I need you to

83
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,600
explain your relationship with Jiang Ting

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,830
to me again.

85
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,720
Okay.

86
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
We were schoolmates in high school.

87
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,120
So was I.

88
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,210
She was even my classmate.

89
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,630
But I wouldn't go to her home to cook.

90
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,630
Neither would I.

91
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,000
Really? You wouldn't?

92
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,190
Did you get to know about

93
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,050
Jiang Ting's situation long ago?

94
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,000
All her neighbors knew.

95
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,560
But they surely didn't know
about the past

96
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,890
of you, Jiang Ting, and Zhang Yuan, right?

97
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,260
Well.

98
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,430
Just because he was Jiang Ting's husband,

99
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,390
my contact with her made me an accomplice,

100
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,310
and everything I did

101
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,040
was taking revenge?

102
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,070
I don't mean that.

103
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,680
Zheng.

104
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,800
I know that

105
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,120
the past 14 years

106
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,850
must have been really hard for you.

107
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,270
It's time for you

108
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,190
to come up from underwater,

109
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,120
take a good breath,

110
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,120
and look at yourself.

111
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,200
Many people went through misfortunes

112
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,480
as they grew up.

113
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,760
I had those experiences too.

114
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,020
So I understand your reluctance
to move forward.

115
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,560
[Mei Zheng is a slut who caused my son's
death and I'll never forgive you.]

116
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,690
You can't get over it

117
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,750
and you feel dead inside.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,789
It seems as if there were only two ways

119
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,870
that could save us.

120
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,630
The first is

121
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,360
to get back what was lost.

122
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,870
[Petitioner] [Witness]

123
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,630
I just want to tell the truth.

124
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,669
The second

125
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,309
is to destroy what we hate.

126
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,520
Do you feel so?

127
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,910
I also rose from misfortune before.

128
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,870
So,

129
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,790
I want to tell you,

130
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,020
maybe there's a third choice for you.

131
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,490
Have you thought about it?

132
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,790
We only live once.

133
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,650
We can't be troubled by the past forever.

134
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,790
Zheng.

135
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,930
What you're trying

136
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,850
to get back now is dangerous.

137
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,950
I can't do nothing about it.

138
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,090
What you're trying to cover up

139
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,440
is exactly what I'm good at uncovering.

140
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,840
Please, you have to believe me.

141
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,870
What I'm telling you

142
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,670
is not my baseless speculation.

143
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,720
I ask you again.

144
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,520
Were you and Jiang Ting conspirators?

145
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,530
You made so many dishes for me,

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,240
yet you're leaving.

147
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,940
The kid is asleep?

148
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,240
Don't worry too much.

149
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,810
If anything unexpected happens,

150
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,260
call me immediately.

151
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,510
I'll come by more these days.

152
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,590
How about this?

153
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,140
I'll install a camera across the way

154
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,630
to record everything constantly.

155
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,530
That way, we'll have evidence.

156
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,790
If he really comes

157
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,670
and hurt you,

158
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,000
we'll give the video to the police.

159
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,470
You can report him for domestic violence,

160
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,600
and he'll have to agree to divorce you.

161
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,790
I just wanted to help her.

162
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,360
Help her kill Zhang Yuan?

163
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,870
I...

164
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,330
I wanted her to have a different life.

165
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,670
So all of this was your plan.

166
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,670
I...

167
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,600
I don't know.

168
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,790
I didn't expect things would
turn out like this.

169
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,390
I just wanted to help her break free.

170
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,440
So what was your expectation?

171
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,430
Or what was your plan?

172
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,200
We anticipated

173
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,050
Zhang Yuan would come after her
sooner or later.

174
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,600
But he came earlier than expected.

175
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,530
What could we do?

176
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,390
Zhang Yuan not only came earlier

177
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,940
but he also beat Jiang Ting.

178
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,150
So the situation spiraled out of control.

179
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,320
Jiang Ting had no choice but to
grab a knife and fight back,

180
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,240
stabbing Zhang Yuan seven times in a row.

181
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,030
At that time,

182
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,000
your plan had to change.

183
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,960
Right?

184
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,560
We didn't have a plan.

185
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,670
And you have no evidence.

186
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,600
Zheng.

187
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,950
When I said I understand how you felt,

188
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,360
I meant it.

189
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,720
I genuinely want to help you.

190
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,200
But the premise is

191
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,290
that you must be willing to save yourself.

192
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,800
What you did for Jiang Ting was
returning kindness for cruelty.

193
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,910
You've done so much for her.

194
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,480
I'm truly impressed.

195
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,120
I just feel so much sympathy for her.

196
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,480
And this time,

197
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,840
her actions were indeed
justifiable defense.

198
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,400
What about the evidence?

199
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,220
Can you give me the evidence now?

200
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,840
Fang.

201
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,760
Since Mei Zheng has the video,

202
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,590
why didn't she hand it earlier?

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
If you had been her

204
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,570
who had recorded a video that's so blurry,

205
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,200
would you have submitted it?

206
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,530
The light!

207
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,150
Can you please

208
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,810
stay calm?

209
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,440
You scared me.

210
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,270
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,470
That beam of light Mei Zheng mentioned
really isn't there.

212
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,200
So,

213
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,960
Duan Hongshan's inference was correct.

214
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,290
Though Mei Zheng didn't admit it herself,

215
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,200
I think she most likely committed perjury.

216
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,670
No wonder

217
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,600
she specifically pointed out

218
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,270
Zhang Yuan at the hearing,

219
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,600
right?

220
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,030
Mei Zheng had already set everything up,

221
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,320
but things didn't

222
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,840
go as she had planned.

223
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,390
In that case,

224
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,520
what Mei Zheng did constitutes
preparation for a crime.

225
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,910
But if the crime

226
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,010
remained at the preparation stage,

227
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,960
and Mei Zheng had the motive
to kill Zhang Yuan,

228
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,390
but due to unexpected circumstances,

229
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,790
the action was terminated,

230
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,320
and the objective evidence

231
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,490
shows that a new danger appeared,

232
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,910
then how should we determine the nature
of Jiang Ting's actions?

233
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,080
There was an unplanned real danger.

234
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,740
How should Jiang Ting's actions
be determined?

235
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,790
That's me?

236
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,440
It's you,

237
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,550
your home,

238
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,600
your balcony,

239
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
and your husband Zhang Yuan.

240
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,510
After stabbing him the first time,

241
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,120
you stabbed him six more times,

242
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,200
and he died.

243
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,320
It's so blurry,

244
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,370
How can you be sure it's me?

245
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,580
Then let's wait for the video
to be restored.

246
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,200
It can be restored?

247
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,870
Once it's restored,

248
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,450
take a closer look at it.

249
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,970
Look carefully and you'll know

250
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,550
my actions were indeed
justifiable defense.

251
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,010
I will watch it carefully.

252
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,670
whether your actions were
justifiable defense

253
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,070
isn't up to you to decide.

254
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,170
We only base our judgment on facts.

255
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,000
Fourteen years ago,

256
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,550
I was your class monitor.

257
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,720
Now,

258
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,630
you're the prosecutor judging me.

259
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,750
I can't judge you.

260
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,610
I can only characterize your actions.

261
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,350
My characterization

262
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,000
is based on truth.

263
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,440
So,

264
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I hope you will tell me

265
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,569
everything you know in complete detail.

266
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,030
I can't save you.

267
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,589
Only you can save yourself.

268
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,990
Am I making myself clear?

269
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,560
That woman who should have been my enemy...

270
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,020
It was she

271
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,540
who pulled me out of the abyss.

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,440
I met you at the aquarium.

00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,460
You swam really well.

thanks to you.

278

You can't hold a baby like that,

279
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,210
If you keep covering him this way,

280
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,400
he'll suffocate.

Go home.

284

I'm not going back.

285
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,920

How dare you run away with my child!

Let me tell you,

299
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,430
I will definitely find you.

300
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,020
Divorce? Don't even think about it.

304
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,650
He was yelling at me.

305
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,300
Called me crazy.

306
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,690
He said that how dare I run away
with the child again,

307
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,070
and that he would definitely find me.

308
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
He tore up the divorce papers.

309
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,270
He won't divorce me.

310
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,480
He said I was his lucky charm.

311
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,110
He'll never let me go.

312
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,350
What's wrong, Jiang Ting?

313
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,590

What are you doing?

318
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,750
I'm going to fight him to the death.

320
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,720

If I don't do this,

325
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,660
I'll never escape from him.

326
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,480

What if he comes?

330
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,920
Do I have to keep being beaten, scolded,

331
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,550
and mentally tortured by him
for the rest of my life?

-I don't want this.
-I don't want to live like this.

336
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,440
listen to me.

337
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,310
If you go kill him,

338
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,700
that's intentional homicide.

339
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,280
But if he comes and you kill him,

340
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,640
it's justifiable defense.

341
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,920
Understand?

342
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,130
Understand?

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,850

I would have to live like that forever.

unrelated to the case,

very carefully.

when Zhang Yuan broke into
Jiang Ting's home,

373

he was carrying a knife.

374
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,350
Jiang Ting was facing
a serious threat to her life.

it was justifiable defense.

377
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,770
is the immediacy of the unlawful threat.

378
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,830
When Jiang Ting stabbed Zhang Yuan
for the first time,

379
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,160
he had already lost his ability to attack,

380
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,270
and her crisis was already over.

381
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,270
However, she continued

382
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,400
and stabbed Zhang Yuan six more times.

383
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,790
Therefore, I believe

384
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,860
these six stabs

385
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,060
can definitely be classified
as intentional assault.

386
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,350
Last night,

387
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,550
we collected the subjective descriptions

388
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,680
of the same video footage

389
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,400
from five groups of third parties.

390
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,590
Please take a look.

391
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,520
Group one said

392
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,200
Jiang Ting stabbed Zhang Yuan
viciously with a knife.

[Jiang Ting is suspected of intentional homicide]
[Video Evidence Analysis Report]

394
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,830
After he fell down,

395
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,200
she continued stabbing him ferociously

396
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,400
six times in a row.

397
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,000
Group two said

398
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,430
Zhang Yuan held a knife

399
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,920
and cornered Jiang Ting on the balcony.

400
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,000
Jiang Ting was terrified

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,270
and seemed to have closed her eyes.

402
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,070
She then stabbed Zhang Yuan.

403
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,640
After seven stabs, she opened her eyes.

404
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,680
Different people

405
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,290
have different biases.

406
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,600
We always talk about being objective,

407
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,590
but how many people

408
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,440
can be absolutely objective?

409
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,400
I've read the latest interrogation
transcript.

410
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,200
It shows Jiang Ting has admitted

411
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,230
that if Zhang Yuan dared to come to her home,

412
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,510
even killing him

413
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,590
would count as justifiable defense.

414
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,120
Doesn't this further prove

415
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,900
she had the intention to kill?

416
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,240
And she did buy a new knife.

417
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,240
This does fit the criteria for
crime preparation.

418
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,590
But remember,

419
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,480
before the incident,

420
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,270
Jiang Ting was receiving nearly twenty calls

421
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,750
from Zhang Yuan every day.

422
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,070
Nearly twenty calls

423
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,510
every day for several months.

424
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,830
In other words,

425
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,920
Jiang Ting was living in constant fear

426
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,400
that Zhang Yuan might appear at
any moment.

427
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,790
So isn't it possible that the knife

428
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,310
was for her self-defense?

429
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,400
We need to consider

430
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,030
what kind of situation

431
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,880
would make Jiang Ting feel she needed
a knife for protection.

432
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,420
We always emphasize whether
an action is justifiable defense

433
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,100
depends on the immediacy
of the unlawful threat.

434
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,190
If the unlawful threat hasn't come

435
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,830
but is very imminent,

436
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,940
can one fight back?

437
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,030
Or if

438
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,840
the unlawful threat has ended

439
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,240
but the danger still exists,

440
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,440
can one fight back?

441
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,830
In such cases,

442
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,960
there should be another criterion
for judgment,

443
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,690
which is the last opportunity.

444
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,310
What if a criminal points a gun at you

445
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,110
what would you do?

446
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,880
Run!

447
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,290
Can you outrun a bullet?

448
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,880
Then we can only wait to die.

449
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,930
You have a knife.

450
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,400
Then use it to defend yourself.

451
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,750
When do you pull out the knife?

452
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,590
If we strictly follow

453
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,160
the standard of ongoing threat,

454
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,510
then we would have to wait until

455
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,110
the criminal aims before we can
defend ourselves.

456
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,200
Then we'll die too.

457
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,160
Therefore,

458
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,110
the moment the criminal pulls out a gun

459
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,270
is the victim's last chance
for self-defense.

460
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,200
If it's too late,

461
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,200
they could lose their life.

462
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,440
But was it Jiang Ting's last chance?

463
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,500
Then one stab would have been enough.

464
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,000
Everyone.

465
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,590
A woman

466
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,790
was beaten by a man for five whole years.

467
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,010
Have you ever thought about

468
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,590
what kind of fear this woman lived in?

469
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,310
If we had been Jiang Ting,

470
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,050
and that man suddenly appeared again,

471
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,440
threatening to hurt me,

472
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,110
and I happened to have a knife nearby,

473
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,920
how would we fight back?

474
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,750
You dare to take a knife!

475
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,550
Stay back!

476
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,150
Prosecutor Xu just said

477
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,240
that perhaps one stab
would have been enough.

478
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,790
You may have overlooked the extreme
nature of the situation.

479
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,840
In such an extreme situation,

480
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,590
if we had been Jiang Ting,

481
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,030
after I stabbed Zhang Yuan once...

482
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,310
I'll kill you!

483
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,070
How could I be certain

484
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,440
that the man who is much stronger than me,

485
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,400
would fall down

486
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,480
and lose his ability to fight back?

487
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,440
Wouldn't he, out of rage,

488
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,590
continue to assault me,

489
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,550
and beat me to death?

490
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,350
Can we expect

491
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,590
Jiang Ting

492
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,350
to stop and calmly consider

493
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,790
whether everything she was doing

494
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,550
met

495
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,750
the criteria for justifiable defense?

496
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,050
We can't, can we?

497
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,400
All of us are sitting here now,

498
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,640

and watching this brief video.

501
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,150
But shouldn't we also

502
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,480
try to see things from Jiang Ting's
perspective?

503
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,830
If I had been Jiang Ting,

504
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,970
putting myself in the defendant's shoes,

505
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,520
and these few minutes

506
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,240
were my last chance

507
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,560
to escape from unlawful harm,

508
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,010
I must fight back.

509
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,960
We can't demand that a victim

510
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,720
be a perfect victim.

511
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,920
Accordingly, we can't

512
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,640
demand that a justifiable defense

513
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,070
be a perfect defense.

514
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,010
I want to remind everyone

515
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,400
that as prosecutors,

516
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,310
when we handle all kinds of crimes,

517
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,650
we can't just focus on the law itself

518
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,530
and ignore the people

519
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,590
in these cases.

520
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,590
Because

521
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,360
we're not handling cases,

522
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,070
but people's lives.

523
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,030
Because

524
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,880
the law

525
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,740
must not yield to wrongdoing.

526
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,050
Therefore,

527
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,090
for Jiang Ting's case,

528
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,920
I think her action constitutes
justifiable defense,

529
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,120
and prosecution should not be pursued.

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,400
It might be a bit inconvenient.

565
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,350
And also,

566
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,440
the floor might be a bit slippery.

567
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,690
What's inconvenient about that?

568
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,590
Hurry up.

569
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,350
Hurry up.

570
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,920
Put it on.

571
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,930
You don’t need to wear a coat.

572
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,350
Stop making excuses and take it off.

573
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,070
That's Director Chen
from the Education Bureau.

574
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,620
Don't embarrass me.

575
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,270
Go ahead and eat if you want.

576
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,060
Help yourself.

577
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,100
Turn on the AC.

578
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,200
Okay,

579
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,750
I've turned on the AC for you

580
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,880
and set it to the optimal temperature.

581
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,800
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming back?

582
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,330
What are you doing here?

583
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,190
I only heard from the procuratorate

584
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,190
that you were being released today.

585
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,000
So I came over to tidy up for you.

586
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,889
I took all your dirty clothes

587
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,630
to the dry cleaner's.

588
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,880
And I threw out a lot of those messy shoes

589
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,000
lying on the floor.

590
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,510
You live here for now.

591
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,110
Don't buy anything useless.

592
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,150
Once the gossip dies down,

593
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,410
you can move back home.

594
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,070
I'm not going back.

595
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,280
Don't worry,

596
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,370
I'm never going back there again.

597
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,880
What do you mean?

598
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,630
Let me ask you something.

599
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,190
I was locked up for so long.

600
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,660
Why didn't you visit me even once?

601
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,480
How dare you blame me?

602
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,360
I've been a successful lady
for my entire life.

603
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,630
The daughter I was always so proud of

604
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,150
killed someone.

605
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,960
Do you know how many people at work

606
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,670
are laughing at me behind my back now?

607
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,320
My leader today

608
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,280
told me to take time off

609
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,480
to lay low for a while.

610
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,880
Don't think you're the only one...

611
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,710
Just go.

612
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,670
You're kicking me out?

613
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,630
Jiang Ting.

614
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,630
I raised you all by myself
with such hardship.

615
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,000
Rain or shine,

616
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,800
I took you to dance lessons.

617
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,960
Don't think

618
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,080
you're the only victim here.

619
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,880
How dare you throw my bag!

620
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,820
Jiang Ting.

621
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,030
Jiang Ting,

622
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,800
Open this door!

623
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,110
You ungrateful daughter!

624
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,000
I raise your child all by myself!

625
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,960
Open the door!

626
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,920
Finally free.

627
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm free,

628
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,680
but it doesn't feel like it.

629
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,190
I always owe you something to say.

630
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,670
And I owe her it too.

631
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,280
I'm sorry!

632
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,670
I'm sorry.

00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,400
