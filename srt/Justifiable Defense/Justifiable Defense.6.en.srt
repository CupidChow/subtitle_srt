Back in the 1980s,

when you were born,

158
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,970
the society was quite chaotic.

159
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,320
Many people

160
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,450
used justifiable defense as an excuse

161
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,120
to fight and hurt others.

162
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,080
That's why our country's judicial system

163
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,910
decided

164
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,790
to be strict on the judging

165
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,790
criteria for justifiable defense.

166

It's been 30 or 40 years already.

172
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,440
Even our country's laws

173
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,090
have been constantly being improved

174

someone is ahead of their times?

180
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
We all know that

181
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,790

of legal loopholes.

and there happens to be a gun
within your reach,

187
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,440
will you grab the gun or not?

188
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,960
It takes a bullet only an instant to hit you.

189

the dinner wasn't cooked by you.

374
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,680
Why would he say that?

He said

376
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,680
I never peeled asparagus when I cooked it.

377
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,610
More than that.

379
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,880
Zhang Yuan attacked her that day

380
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
because he discovered

381
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,510
the asparagus wasn't prepared by her

382
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,070
because she always

383
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,350
cooked asparagus without peeling it.

384
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,160

Someone else cooked for her.

not a coincidence.

557
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,430
Did Jiang Ting ask you to be her
defense lawyer?

558
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm her last hope now,

559
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,270
so of course she's turning to me.

560
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,110
But her situation

561
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,770
isn't much better than yours.

562
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,970
Those seven stab wounds

563
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,640
are the biggest problem for her
in her case.

564
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,400
So in everyone's mind,

565
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,590
she's still a woman

566
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,590
who brutally murdered her husband.

567
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,070
Jiang Ting shows characteristics of women
with Battered Woman Syndrome.

568
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,670
Domestic violence is a topic

569
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,810
that easily evokes empathy
and sympathy in the society.

570
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,240
Winning her case wouldn't be
that difficult,

571
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,900
but we're running out of time.

572
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,590
Do you believe she's a victim?

573
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,270
There are Psychiatric evaluation,
injury assessment

574
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,640
and witness testimonies.

575
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,570
Such a complete chain of evidence.

576
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,040
Isn't that proof enough?

577
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,770
There's one more thing.

578
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,410
Keep an eye on Fang Lingyuan

579
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,790
Fang Lingyuan?

580
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,680
She's the main prosecutor for your case.

581
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,480
What's wrong?

582
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,350
It's not about me.

583
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,530
It's about Jiang Ting.

584
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,750
Jiang Ting again?

585
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,790
I always feel that she

586
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,520
desperately wants Jiang Ting
to be found guilty.

587
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,290
When can I go home?

588
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,040
Your case is in the prosecution
review stage,

589
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,160
and right now

590
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,070
there's no evidence to support your claim
of justifiable defense.

591
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,030
What makes you think

592
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,680
you can be released without charges?

593
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,830
They told me

594
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,160
there's an eyewitness.

595
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,160
The witness's testimony
will incriminate you.

596
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,200
That's impossible,

597
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,600
absolutely impossible!

598
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,160
They both went to Third Middle School?

599
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,330
There must be some stories between them.

600
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,680
If we could discover

601
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,480
the secrets between Fang Lingyuan
and Jiang Ting,

602
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,750
these three cases

603
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,970
might have completely different outcomes.

604
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,000
How is Yingying

605
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,000
doing lately?

606
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,400
Has she been bullied

607
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,240
or ostracized at school

608
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,280
because of my situation?

609
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,160
She

610
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,640
takes after both of us.

611
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,510
Stubborn and proud.

612
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,040
She doesn't give up easily,

613
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,170
and she'll fight back if provoked.

614
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,030
You should know

615
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,330
your own daughter.

Yes.

Not really.

Wait.

629
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,720
Is it related to the case?

630
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,330
Of course it is.

631
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,510
Then I can't help you.

632
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,400
Do it yourself.
