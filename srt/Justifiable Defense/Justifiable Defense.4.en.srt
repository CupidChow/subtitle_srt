[Episode 4]

3
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,590
This is our freshest

4
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,250
farm-raised yellow croaker.

5
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,000
This kind of fish has a yellow body,

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,400
but it can't be exposed to light.

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,590
Once it's exposed to light,
it will turn silver

8
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,190
and won't fetch a good price.

9
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,350
So, no one

10
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,430
comes to fish here during the day, right?

11
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,000
Right.

12
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,640
Not just during the day,

13
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,280
we can't even fish on nights

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,680
when there's moonlight either.

15
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,470
We can only work on nights

16
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,560
when there's no moonlight.

17
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,800
Even moonlight is a problem?

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,360
Yes,

19
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,800
these fish can't be exposed to any light.

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,400
Okay.

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,590
I see. Thank you.

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,430
I'll get back to work then.

23
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,400
Sure, go ahead.

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,980
That night, there was a full moon.

25
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,630
No one was here.

26
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,960
No wonder

27
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,590
Zhou Delong dared

28
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,480
to bring Duan Hongshan here
after the abduction.

29
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,150
Hello?

30
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang,

31
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,579
we found the phone.

32
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,910
You did? Both of the phones?

33
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,190
We only found one.

34
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,190
According to Duan Hongshan's description,

35
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,079
it should be the one

36
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,140
Zhou Delong used for livestreaming.

37
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,070
Has the data been recovered?

38
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,960
It's being examined now.

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
After being in seawater for so long,

40
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
recovering the data will be challenging,

41
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,820
but the tech team is working on it.

42
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,030
Okay, let me know if you have any news.

43
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,800
Thanks.

44
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,840
Wait.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Who's the diver who found the phone?

46
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,120
Well, I didn't ask the name.

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
It's a woman.

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,520
She's quite pretty

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,420
and brought in from the aquarium.

50
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,470
This is the second dive.

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,860
Everyone, please search carefully.

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,120
If there are any thin ropes in the water,

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
pull them all up and check.

54
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,430
Pull up and tap on each of the buoys.

Officer,

56
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,630
I found a phone.

57
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,280
Great!

58
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,400
Thank you, ma'am,

59
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,460
for your hard work.

61
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,710
Take it to Forensics Division immediately

62
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,190
and have them examine it.

[Interrogation Room 2]

64
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,440
Prosecutor Gong mentioned

65
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,180
that you're very meticulous,

66
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,280
I can rest assured

67
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,430
to entrust my case to you.

68
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,150
I heard

69
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,360
you hired Ms. Lei as your defense attorney

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,310
and you're still claiming
it was justifiable defense.

71
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,370
Right now there's only my testimony,

72
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,160
without any other witnesses
or physical evidence,

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,600
so it's hardly convincing.

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,560
Once you recover the phone data,

75
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,610
there must be a livestream recording
from that day.

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,220
But the phone was likely
to be severely damaged,

77
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,790
and the police must need time
to restore it,

78
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,120
so we just need to wait some more.

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,260
Just wait a little longer,

80
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,290
and everything will become clear.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm not in a hurry.

82
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,480
Neither am I.

83
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,240
How long did it take

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,000
from the fishery to the police station?

85
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,160
I was driving the victim's car.

86
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,750
It took about 43 minutes.

87
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,510
That's quite precise.

88
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,940
After I got in the car,

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,170
I turned on the music player.

90
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,280
It was playing "The Silence of the Lambs,"

91
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,200
which is 4 minutes and 52 seconds long.

92
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,060
It played 9 times in total,

93
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,420
and I arrived at the police station
just as it finished.

94
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,030
We've been to the fishery.

95
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,800
They said they didn't hear
any calls for help.

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,160
They also said

97
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,430
that driving from the fishery
to the police station

98
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,390
took at most 30 minutes.

99
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Have you been to Duanke Town before?

100
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,510
Do you know where

101
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,870
the Duanke Town Police Station is?

102
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,240
If it weren't for this kidnapping,

103
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,800
I'd never have gone there.

104
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,800
That day I had just been through

105
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,750
a life-or-death struggle.

106
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,120
My head was bleeding,

107
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,390
it was raining,

108
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,360
it was pitch black everywhere,

109
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,950
and I was driving alone.

110
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,870
It just took me about ten more minutes

111
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,930
to reach the nearest police station,

112
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,600
and you're expecting me to arrive on time.

113
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,830
Isn't that too harsh on me?

114
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,250
Could it be that you took a detour?

115
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,510
You wanted to temporize

116
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,370
so that the severely injured person
couldn't get help.

117
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,090
I'm very clear about the conditions
for justifiable defense.

118
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,250
I wouldn't deliberately take a detour

119
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,030
and put myself
in a disadvantageous position.

120
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,990
Did you really not know Zhou Delong?

121
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,340
I've already said this.

122
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,750
I can say it again.

123
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,120
I had only met Zhou Lin's mother before.

124
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,180
I didn't know Zhou Delong.

125
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,630
But I can tell you

126
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,760
that Zhou Delong was very close to you.

127
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,240
Just a wall apart.

128
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,480
What I mean is,

129
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,320
he lived right next door to you,

130
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,870
listening in on you

131
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,260
and spying on you.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,430
Could it be that you didn't want him
to follow you

133
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,970
and wanted to protect your daughter,

134
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,000
so

135
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,920
you decided to strike first?

136
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,690
Could that be it?

137
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,300
Before he kidnapped me,

138
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,780
I had never seen Zhou Delong.

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,260
How can you prove that?

140
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,510
How can you prove the knife

141
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,710
wasn't brought into the library by you?

142
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,430
I can't.

143
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,430
I can't.

144
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,190
We went to Zhou Delong's home

145
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,110
and found some photographs.

146
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,080
These photos prove

147
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,720
that you've been in frequent contact

148
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,120
with Mei Zheng recently.

149
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,300
It seems that this case
has many suspicious points.

150
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,550
We need some time to sort it out properly.

151
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,320
Let's call it a day.

152
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,270
If everything is correct here,

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,270
sign and fingerprint the document.

since you're a murderer,

159
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,240
there must've been problems
with the cases you handled before.

160

377
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,030
I wasn't sure whether to
go to the police station

378
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,000
or the procuratorate,

379
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,860
so I thought I'd come to you first.

380
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,230
Have you eaten?

381
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,950
Yes, I have.

382
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,020
What's the matter?

383
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,540
I want to prove

384
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,140
Director Duan acted
in justifiable defense.

385
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,050
Ding Yi, take notes.

386
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,090
Okay.

387
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,040
Is black tea okay?

388
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,000
Thank you.

389
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,020
How long have you been waiting?

390
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,150
Not long. It's fine.

391
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,550
Let's begin then.

392
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,270
Alright.

393
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,030
How can you prove

394
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,830
that Duan Hongshan acted
in justifiable defense?

395
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,640
If we can prove

396
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,500
that Zhou Delong intended to harm him,

397
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,690
would that

398
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,070
indirectly prove

399
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,360
Director Duan acted
in justifiable defense?

400
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,930
But how do you know that?

401
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,270
[I'll kill you sooner or later,
just you wait]

402
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,070
Did Zhou Delong send this to you before?

403
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,260
Actually, after I got out,

404
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,800
he came looking for me

405
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,690
and said he would never let me off.

406
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,970
I was really scared at the time,

407
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,110
afraid he might do something extreme.

408
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,450
I changed my address

409
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
and my phone number,

410
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,400
but six months ago,

411
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,440
he still

412
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,880
found me at our store.

413
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,270
Duan Hongshan.

414
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,160
Mei Zheng!

415
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,830
Li Mufeng!

416
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,680
I'll kill you all!

417
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,080
He threatened to kill me,

418
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,750
Director Duan,

419
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,700
and Mei Zheng.

420
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,350
He also said we were all his

421
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,200
enemies,

422
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,110
and that he would never let us go.

423
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,550
Fortunately,

424
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,030
some neighbors rushed over,

425
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,830
so he ran away.

426
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,450
Did he harass you often?

427
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,940
Not really. Just that once.

428
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,150
And then there was this text message.

429
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,110
Then how can you be so sure

430
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,460
that he hated Duan Hongshan just as much?

431
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,120
I think from what he said and his tone,

432
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
he felt that the four-year sentence

433
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,100
was still too lenient.

434
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,590
Especially Director Duan

435
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,880
was rewarded later

436
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,080
because of this case.

437
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,160
I think he felt somewhat

438
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,000
resentful,

439
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,750
which is why he said

440
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,160
he wanted to kill Director Duan.

441
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,420
Is that his exact words
or your speculation?

442
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,440
His exact words.

443
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,880
His exact words?

444
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,470
Yes.

445
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,450
So I believe

446
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,890
if Director Duan hadn't fought back,

447
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,730

in Director Duan's case.

Let's begin.

481

Someone has come forward
to testify for you,

482
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,260

Your attitude toward me hasn't changed,

486
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,470
which means you don't believe
what he said.

487
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,150
These are your previous statements.

488
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,720
You stated,

00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,790
"Zhou Delong was chasing
and beating me desperately."

490

492
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,770

I reacted instinctively.

500
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,780
I wasn't even aware where I was stabbing.

You weren't aware,

yet you managed to kill with one strike.

Isn't that a bit too convenient?

504
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,850
Or…

505
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,580
is it possible you did it deliberately?

If you were in my position,

507
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,860

Get him some water.

512
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,060
Okay.

513
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,750
Let's talk about the crime scene.

514
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,880
According to your statement,

515
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,750
Zhou Delong tried to stab you with a knife

516
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,610
and you fought back desperately.

517
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,550
But your body and face

518
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,880
are covered in scrapes,

519
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,200
without a single stab wound.

520
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Is that possible?

521
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,840
I have another hypothesis.

522
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,710
Unfortunately,

523
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,470
a heavy rain

524
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,060
washed away all your careful planning.

525
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Of course,

526
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,530
this is just my hypothesis.

527
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,670
Your hypothesis is bold.

528
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,420
But it's reasonable.

529
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,860
If I were in your position,

530
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,380
I might think the same way.

531
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,280
And I would exhaust all possibilities.

532
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,680
Then, is there

533
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,110
such a possibility right now?

534
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,570
From the moment
I took over Jiang Ting's case

535
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,720
to when I was anonymously reported

536
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,830
and then kidnapped,

537
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,830
everything behind all these

538
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,290
seems to have been orchestrated
by someone.

539
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,430
People with murderous intent

540
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,340
are like dangerous chemical reagents.

541
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,720
When these substances come into contact,

542
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,980
a violent chemical reaction will occur.

543
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,110
That's why we should always

544
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,960
store these dangerous reagents separately,

545
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,680
to prevent them from gathering

546
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,940
and coming into contact with each other.

547
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,790
Unless…

548
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,010
someone deliberately put them together.

549
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,050
If we find this person,

550
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,800
we can uncover the whole truth.

551
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,600
Who do you think that person is?

552
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,480
This person must be connected

553
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,139
to Case 6.28 from 14 years ago.

554
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,790
He's well-versed in law,

555
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,750
skilled in strategy,

556
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,760
and particularly knowledgeable
about justifiable defense.

557
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,130
That's why he could design

558
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:23,139
a game that appears accidental
but is actually deliberate.

559
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,679
Your analysis makes sense.

560
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,400
But why do I feel like

561
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,210
the person you're describing

562
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,480
sounds a lot like you?

563
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,540
I'm already a suspect

564
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,050
and locked up in here.

565
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,950
I am that dangerous chemical reagent,

566
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,110
but I'm not the one who

567
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,970
mixed those chemicals together.

568
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,130
I also want to know who that person is.

569
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,100
I'm desperate to find him

570
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,670
to clear my name.

571
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,760
But I can't get out now.

572
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,010
So, I can only share

573
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,400
my most honest thoughts

574
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,580
with my case prosecutor.

575
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,550
Officer!

576
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,840
Officer!

577
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,880
Officer!

578
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,960
Officer!

579
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,020
Stop yelling.

580
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,160
What's wrong?

581
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,880
Who's in charge of my case now?

582
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,480
Has Duan Hongshan really
abandoned my case?

583
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,610
You'll have to ask the procuratorate.

584
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,110
Who replaced him?

585
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,030
Fang Lingyuan.

586
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Fang Lingyuan.

587
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,840
It must be Fang Lingyuan.

588
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,010
It must be Fang Lingyuan.

589
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,560
She's doing this on purpose.

590
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,130
She's deliberately trying to hurt me.

591
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,300
-She doesn't want me to go home.
-Jiang Ting.

592
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,980
-She wants to hurt me.
-Get up!

593
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,800
-Why is she doing this?
-Jiang Ting.

594
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,350
-She wants revenge on me.
-Jiang Ting, are you okay?

595
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,020
Jiang Ting!

596
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,510
-Can't go home.
-You two, come here.

597
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,190
-Keep an eye on her.
-Yes, ma'am.

598
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,670
-I can never go home.
-I'll go find someone

599
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,480
to take her to the counseling room.

600
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,280
I'm dying.

601
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,740
-I'm dying.
-Keep an eye on her.

602
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,030
-I'm dying.
-There, there, Jiang Ting.

603
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,840
I'm dying.

604
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,070
-I'm dying.
-Are you okay, Jiang Ting?

605
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,590
Dying!

606
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,190
Are you okay?

607
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,800
I want to go home. I want to go home!

608
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,450
Home, home!
