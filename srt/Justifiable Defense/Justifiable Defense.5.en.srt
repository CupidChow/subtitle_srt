00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,560

Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang.

21
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,930
What are you doing?

22
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,329
Still analyz...

23
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,920
ing.

24
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,230
Analyzing...

25
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,630
Alright.

26
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,520
You draw. Let me see.

27
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,190
Let me see.

(Victims and Perpetrators)

29
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,030
You can't keep going, can you?

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,150
If you don't understand the case,

31
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,590
isn't the more you draw,
the messier it gets?

32
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,860
Yeah, it's a bit messy now.

33
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,590
But I think these three cases

34
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,430
are connected.

35
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,560
I want to sort them out.

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,750
That way I can figure out whether
Director Duan committed murder

37
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,610
or acted in justifiable defense.

38
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,450
Let me do it.

39
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,970

(Zhou Delong — Father of Zhou Lin)
(Li Mufeng, Duan Hongshan)

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,350
Got it now?

63
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,330
Got it.

64
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,450
Then your turn.

65
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,070
Zhou Delong hated
the people who killed his son,

66
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,159
Li Mufeng and Mei Zheng.

67
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:46,920
So he hid next door
to Director Duan's house.

68
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,220
(Zhou Delong, born 1956)
So he hid next door

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,140
(Framed Mei Zheng as a witness)

(Framed Mei Zheng as a witness)

78

that there was something
between Li Mufeng and Mei Zheng.
(Framed Mei Zheng as a witness)

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,920
But 14 years later,

The one she once framed, Mei Zheng,

82
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:57,900
testified for her.

83
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,060
(Mei Zheng testified for Jiang Ting)

The lead prosecutor in both cases

86

90
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,590
are connected to
the case from 14 years ago.

91
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,260
No.

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,560
Actually

93
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,960
they're all connected to one person.

94
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,760
Duan Hongshan.

95

Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang.

96
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,390
Why are you so convinced

97
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,600
that Director Duan is the mastermind?

98
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,130
When did I say he was the mastermind?

99
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,850
Isn't that what you meant?

100
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
What do you think I meant?

101
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,560
Aren't you suspicious of Director Duan?

102
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,270
I...

103
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,000
So what if I am?

104
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,500
Can't I just want to find out

105
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,780
the truth?

106
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,880
So, what's your plan

107
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,900
to uncover the truth?

108
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,930
I'm a little hungry.

109
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,850
Let's get something to eat.

110
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,850
You still haven't told me,
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang.

111
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,110
Joint investigation of the three cases.

112
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,460

117
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,000
(Criminal Law)

118
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,560
This time I mainly want to ask you

119
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,420
about what happened 14 years ago.

120
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,360
Doesn't your procuratorate

121
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,490
have the case files?

122
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,070
Yes.

123
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,680
The files are there.

124
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,830
But I want to hear it from you directly.

125
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,630
I didn't expect

126
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,420
that after all these years

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,290
I'd have to talk about it again.

128
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,680
The year we finished
the college entrance exam,

129
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,680
I often went to the library

130
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,630
to borrow books.

131
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,410
On the day of the incident,

132
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,430
I was passing the reading room

133
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,920
and heard someone inside yelling for help.

134
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,500
Acting all high and mighty?

135
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,120
(14 years ago)
Acting all high and mighty?

136
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,140
(14 years ago)

137
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,800
Looking down on this, on that?
(14 years ago)

138
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,230
Let go!

139
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,430
-I went in...
-Help!

140
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,360
-And I saw...
-Stop pretending!

141
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
Zhou Lin was assaulting Mei Zheng.

142
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
Keep pretending!

143
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
I got a rush of blood to the head,

144
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
rushed in and pushed Zhou Lin away.

145
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,680
I pulled Mei Zheng and tried to run.

146
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,800
But Zhou Lin had a stick.

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,270
He caught up and hit me

148
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,530
on the back of the head.

149
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,750
Let go!

150
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,390
Go!

151
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,159
Let go!

152
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,950
Anyone there?

153
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,560
Help!

154
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,310
Anyone there?

155
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,400
Help!

156
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,430
Help!

157
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,970
But honestly, I was really scared.

158
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,930
I definitely couldn't beat Zhou Lin.

159
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,630
After I fell,

160
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,680
he just kept hitting me.

161
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
Stop hitting me, please!

162
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,870
-Anyone help?
-How is it?

163
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,330
-Anyone there?
-How is it?

164
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
Stop, stop!

165
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,020
-Stop, please!
-How is it?

166
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,010
Anyone there?

167
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,250
During the beating,

168
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,280
a knife fell to the ground.

169
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,190
I was terrified.

170
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,510
So I grabbed it first.

171
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,480
And in the struggle,

172
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,040
with no other choice,

173
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,360
I fought back.

174
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,580
While Zhou Lin was attacking you,

175
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,720
you and Mei Zheng

176
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,750
didn't call for help?

177
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,930
Of course we did.

178
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,670
But the library's
nearly empty during holidays.

179
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,200
And it was raining that day.

180
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,690
Maybe it was fate.

181
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,720
But no one else was at the scene.

182
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,280
There wasn't a single witness.

183
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,040
Then

184
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,950
before that day,

185
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,130
did you know Mei Zheng?

186
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,880
We were at the same school.

187
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,750
She was a year ahead.

188
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,960
But we never talked.

189
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,850
Maybe just

190
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,280
vaguely knew each other.

191
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,710
Did you risk your life to save her

192
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,240
because you liked her?

193
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,150
They asked me that too 14 years ago.

194
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,020
But you don't need to be in love

195
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,040
to save someone's life.

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,080
So it was just

197
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,300
passing by,

198
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,510
happened to see it,

199
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,660
and jumped in.

200
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,910
If it were truly considered heroic,

201
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,060
I wouldn't have been convicted.

202
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,250
So

203
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,810
Duan Hongshan charged you
with excessive defense

204
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,750
and you got four years.

205
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,390
You've never blamed him?

206
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,170
Of course

207
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,930
I have.

208
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,870
I wanted to be found not guilty.

209
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,680
But in the end,

210
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,310
I've come to accept the outcome.

211
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,750
Li Mufeng testified for Duan Hongshan.

212
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,590
Jiang Ting...

213
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,750
Mei Zheng testified for Jiang Ting.

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,360
College's out for break.

215
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,960
I want to visit the campus.

216
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,480
College's out for break.

217
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,490
I want to visit the campus.

218
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,450
Still borrowing books in the library.

219
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,790
When I was studying at No. 3 High School,

220
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,390
I loved going to the library.

221
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,510
(14 years ago)

222
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,910
That day...
(14 years ago)

223
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,390
Ma'am.

224
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,160
Ma'am.

225
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,470
Ma'am.

226
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,870
Ma'am, returning a book, Ma'am.

227
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,630
Ma'am.

228
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,900
Ma...

229
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,870
Alright.

230
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,550
Thanks.

231
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,740
That bookshelf had wheels underneath.

232
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,960
If you twist the handle,

233
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,240
the shelf moves.

234
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,510
I felt the shelf

235
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,030
closing in on me.

236
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,410
I turned around,

237
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,440
and I was terrified.

238
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,480
I turned around,

239
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,990
Zhou Lin was holding a wooden stick.

240
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,450
His expression was absolutely terrifying.

241
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,750
He was tall and strong,

242
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,470
blocking the aisle between the shelves.

243
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,270
There was no way for me to escape.

244
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,320
Aren't you usually good at pretending?

245
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,240
-Always looking down on others.
-Let go!

246
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,910
Let go!

247
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,440
-Let's see you pretend now.
-Help!

248
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,320
Help!”

249
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,550
I kept screaming for help.

250
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,480
He was threatening me with the stick.

251
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,030
He was about to kiss me.

252
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,200
And just at that moment,

253
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,330
Li Mufeng showed up.

254
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,510
He came to save me.

255
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
He pulled me along,

256
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,350
trying to run forward.

257
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,960
But Zhou Lin had the stick.

258
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,670
-He knocked Li Mufeng down.
-Help!

259
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,400
-He kept hitting him...
-Help!

260
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,510
He kicked him,

261
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,980
and cursed at him.

262
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,350
I was so scared,

263
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,580
so I curled up in the corner.

264
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,510
Zhou Lin was too strong.

265
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,720
Too brutal.

266
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,550
Maybe,

267
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,950
Li Mufeng really thought
he might die from the beating.

268
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,370
Just before Zhou Lin
went to hit him again,

269
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,720
I saw a knife fall to the ground.

270
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,940
Li Mufeng picked it up

271
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,960
and stabbed him.

272
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,150
That day,

273
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,580
that day was complete chaos.

274
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,550
What I remember

275
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,850
is just that.

276
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,330
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang.

277
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,600
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang.

278
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,200
I'd say the two testimonies
don't really contradict each other.

279
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,340
On the surface, they're mostly the same.

280
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,370
But in fact,

281
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,360
there are still some differences.

282
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,820
Some details don't match.

283
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,460
What kind of mismatch?

284
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,200
Let me ask you all something.

285
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,720
If,

286
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
many years ago,

287
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,050
someone caused you to go to prison,

288
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,630
and years later
that person got in trouble,

289
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,550
and you happened to be the one

290
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,960
who could prove they were innocent,

291
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
what would you do?

292
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,600
Come on, say it.

293
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,370
Speak up.

294
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,150
I...

295
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,670
You...

296
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,870
You don't dare speak?

297
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,360
You, Ding.

298
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
What would you do?

299
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,580
If that person had truly wronged me,

300
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,360
I'd probably choose to stay silent.

301
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,150
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang, I think

302
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,350
Li Mufeng testifying for Duan Hongshan

303
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,720
is just like Mei Zheng

304
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,240
testifying for Jiang Ting.

305
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,480
If Mei Zheng didn't know

306
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,630
that Jiang Ting had once defamed her,

307
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,480
then her testimony

308
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,030
was likely out of sympathy.

309
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,120
By the same logic,

310
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,270
14 years ago,

311
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,840
if Li Mufeng

312
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,150
felt grateful to Duan Hongshan

313
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,630
for a more lenient sentence,

314
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,750
then it's very likely

315
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,270
he testified falsely

316
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,510
to help him.

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,840
So,

318
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,200
now the real key is,

319
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,240
we need to find out

320
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,600
that 14 years ago,

321
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,200
did Li Mufeng feel grateful, or resentful,

322
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,460
toward Duan Hongshan?

323
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,380
Right?

324
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,870
So,

325
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,930
was he grateful or resentful?

326
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,320
(Wuyan Hub to Shengchengnan Road)

327
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,150

Open the door.

330
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,920
Routine inspection.

331
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,000
Please cooperate.

332
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,790
Hold your ID.

333
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,990
Everyone off the bus.

334
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,640
What's this check for?

335
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,700
You don't know?

336
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:01,930
(Name: Li Mufeng)
You don't know?

337

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,880
A murderer
(Name: Li Mufeng)

339
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,100
killed a family of five and ran.
(Name: Li Mufeng)

340
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,730
killed a family of five and ran.

341
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,680
For real?

(Data Inquiry System)

343
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,830
(Public Security Data Inquiry Platform)

344
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,060
Come here.

345
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,040
What's your name?

346
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,160
Li Mufeng.

347
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,230
Where are you heading this time?

348
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,160
Provincial capital.

349
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,750
What for?

350
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,590
What's going on?

351
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,920
My family is in the provincial capital.

352
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,810
Who?

353
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
My mom's there.

354
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,750
What's this about?

355
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,790
Who is he?

356
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,090
Let me tell you,

357
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,920
he went to No. 3 High School.

358
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,570
Same school as me.

359
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,240
Killed someone 14 years ago.

360
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,890
He killed someone?

361
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,880
Did you get off the bus at any point?

362
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,440
No, I didn't.

363
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,450
I didn't.

364
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,660
You came alone?

365
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,640
Yes, alone.

366
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,970
Alright, good.

368
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,720
Here he comes.

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,550
Here he comes.
(Muyan Bay Shugang Expressway)

370
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,460
(Muyan Bay Shugang Expressway)

371
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,030
Is he here?

372
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,240
Have a seat.

373
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,110
You used this vase.

374
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,890
He thought the design was nice.

375
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,320
Looks good,

376
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
and sturdy.

377
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,430
Didn't think about dyeing your hair again?

378
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,110
I'm old.

379
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
I accept it.

380
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,550
Why'd you suddenly come back?

381
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,720
Didn't even call.

382
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,350
I'm entering a competition,

383
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,240
and

384
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,550
the museum

385
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,640
is showing my work.

386
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,550
I thought it's nearby.

387
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,480
If you've got time,

388
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,590
you can take them to see it.

389
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,510
I'm busy at the store.

390
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,640
No time, really.

391
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,350
Leave it here.

392
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,460
If I get a chance, I'll definitely go.

393
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,920
Alright.

394
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,000
Here are the tickets.

395
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,680
Is there a cash prize for the competition?

396
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,440
Yes.

397
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,030
If I win,

398
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,240
I might even get a chance

399
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,930
to go abroad for the finals.

400
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,400
It's kind of

401
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,240
an industry recognition for us.

402
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,830
Go for it.

403
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,510
You've got this.

404
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,440
I believe in you.

405
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,330
When I was little, you used to say

406
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,720
hard work always pays off.

407
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,190
He's back.

408
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,830
Go. Go.

409
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,640
Quick, quick.

410
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,270
You're back.

411
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,510
Did you ask about

412
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,450
the junior high placement?

413
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,220
They said applications

414
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,110
for special talent students

415
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,240
start the week after next.

416
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,960
Bao's English

417
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,160
is quite good, right?

418
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,000
I think

419
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,960
the English special class
at Experimental Middle School

420
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
is pretty decent.

421
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,160
Sounds good.

422
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,550
Then go give it a try.

423
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,620
The problem is

424
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,440
your other son.

425
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,240
What about him?

426
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,710
That criminal record of his...

427
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,990
Will it affect Bao's school admission?

428
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,510
I asked the police station
about it before.

429
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,440
They said unless he's applying
to work in a government agency,

430
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,200
the background check might be an issue.

431
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Otherwise,

432
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,440
there shouldn't be much of a problem.

433
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,940
What do you mean
"shouldn't be much of a problem"?

434
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,960
What if Bao

435
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,200
wants to apply for
a government position in the future?

436
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,400
Aren't we basically

437
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,440
killing his future

438
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,960
in the cradle?

439
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,160
I'm sorry.

440
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,930
Actually, back then,

441
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,820
you shouldn't have lied to me.

442
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,200
You shouldn't have hidden the fact

443
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,260
about you and your ex-husband's son.

444
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,070
If I had known about it back then,

445
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,960
would I have dared
to have a child with you?

446
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,640
What he did doesn't affect me,

447
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,790
but it can affect our child's future.

448
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,830
Don't you get it?

449
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,640
Forget I said anything.

450
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,350
What a mess.

451
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,000
Come out. Hurry, hurry.

452
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,810
Mom.

453
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,110
I'm sorry.

454
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,970
You don't need to apologize to me.

455
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,410

Please don't disturb him for now.

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,680
I'm not here for him.

00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,640
I'm here for you.

505
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,950
Have you seen

506
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,770
this person before?

507
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,640
About half a year ago,

508
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,750
he came by.

509
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
He even broke one of your glass pieces.

510
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,750
Only I can

511
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,510
break my pieces.

512
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,160
No one else can.

513
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,060
He told me

514
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,720
he wanted to kill me

515
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,920
and to kill Director Duan and Mei Zheng.

516
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,180
Here, corn.

517
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,240
Thanks, ma'am.

518
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,750
The corn is really good.

519
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,320
Never noticed it before.

520
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,330
I'll finish it when I get back.

521
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,300
Oh right, ma'am,

522
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,020
when did

523
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,560
you learn

524
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,330
that stuff?

525
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,270
What stuff?

526
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,370
Sign language.

527
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,480
There was a victim's family once.

528
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,680
They were deaf and mute.

529
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,600
I had to communicate with them,

530
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,190
so I learned sign language.

531
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,880
And after enough communicating,

532
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,940
I just picked it up.

533
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,350
That's what they call

534
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,000
a handy skill never being a burden.

535
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,310
Someone's talking sweet today.

536
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,830
No, I mean it.

537
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,650
I should really learn from you.

538
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,940
Then start learning seriously.

539
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,830
Alright.

540
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,030
Li Mufeng probably never expected

541
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,140
you knew sign language.

542
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,880
Or that you'd catch the chance
to confirm things with his mentor.

543
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,470
Now that's perjury.

544
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,480
Should we bring him back
to the procuratorate?

545
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,730
I want to ask Duan Hongshan first.

546
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,590
In my mind,

547
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:07,860
you've always been a great prosecutor.

548
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,750
(Be diligent in work,
be honest in conduct)
you've always been a great prosecutor.

549
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,900
(Be diligent in work,
be honest in conduct)

550
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,540
Even back in school,

551
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,530
we'd already heard about
all your accomplishments.

552
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,390
A lot of things you said,

553
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:18,570
I still remember to this day.

554
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,560
(Interrogation Room 2)
I still remember to this day.

555
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,310
(Interrogation Room 2)

556
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,240
I remember our professor once said
(Interrogation Room 2)

557
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,930
(Interrogation Room 2)

558
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,000
that if you were handling a case,

559
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,640
whether it was the victim

560
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,400
or the suspect's family,

561
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,630
you always handled it properly.

562
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,030
Strived for the best outcome.

563
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,910
So there'd be no appeals.

564
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,920
In that regard,

565
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,520
you're someone I truly respect.

566
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,590
I used that approach a lot too.

567
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,110
When a suspect

568
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,390
starts to feel like
the prosecutor cares about them,

569
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,600
that's a very dangerous sign.

570
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,090
Because in here,

571
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,350
aside from meeting

572
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,010
with their defense attorney,

573
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,960
the only person they can really talk to

574
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,350
is the prosecutor.

575
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,740
Over time,

576
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,090
they start to trust
the prosecutor more and more.

577
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,820
They rely on them more and more.

578
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,530
They believe everything they say.

579
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,660
They follow everything they suggest.

580
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,510
Eventually, they become like

581
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,790
a vending machine.

582
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,550
No matter what you ask,

583
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,170
they'll answer.

584
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,290
Right?

585
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,640
So, what brought you here today?

586
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,440
Did you discover something new?

587
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,550
14 years ago, you ruled Li Mufeng

588
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,000
used excessive defense.

589
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,280
What was that based on?

590
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,470
On June 28, 14 years ago,

591
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,100
Li Mufeng struck back

592
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,560
to protect Mei Zheng.

593
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,700
At the time, Zhou Lin had a stick.

594
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,900
Li Mufeng had a knife.

595
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,800
Zhou Lin's stick

596
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,800
was not enough to be
life-threatening to Li Mufeng.

597
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,930
But Li Mufeng fought back with a knife.

598
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,780
That exceeded the bounds of self-defense.

599
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,360
Same conclusion as 14 years ago.

600
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,240
Because my judgment now

601
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,960
is the same as it was then.

602
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,460
What about Li Mufeng?

603
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,450
Do you think he resents you?

604
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,000
I…

605
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,680
(14 years ago)

606
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,400
I really didn't mean to hurt him.
(14 years ago)

607
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,110
I…

608
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,030
I picked up that knife

609
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,640
just to protect myself.

610
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,350
I…

611
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,240
That counts as justifiable defense, right?

612
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,770
Zhou Lin had a stick.

613
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,940
You had a knife.

614
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,170
And you stabbed him to death with it.

615
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,440
I've already said it many times.

616
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,770
That knife wasn't mine.

617
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,000
I don't even know

618
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,070
where it came from.

619
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,960
How do you prove

620
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,690
that you didn't bring
the knife into the library?

621
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,470
I can't prove it.

622
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,440
But…

623
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,750
But there's no way to prove

624
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,550
that the knife was mine either, right?

625
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,640
We'll look into the origin of the knife.

626
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,270
But,

627
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,960
at the time, the knife was in your hand.

628
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,380
You had every opportunity
to hold it for defense.

629
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,830
But that's not what you chose to do.

630
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,780
You chose to stab.

631
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,780
That already exceeded
the bounds of self-defense.

632
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,720
Before I…

633
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,880
Before I fought back,

634
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,270
he kept beating me.

635
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,160
I really had no other choice.

636
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,020
I was afraid...

637
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,110
I was afraid he'd
take the knife from my hand.

638
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,830
If he fought back again, I…

639
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,550
What could I have done?

640
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,160
I…

641
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,550
Li Mufeng,

642
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,770
your first college choice

643
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,180
was the School of Law
at the University of Politics and Law.

644
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,250
(Li Mufeng, you have been admitted
to the 2009 experimental law class
was the School of Law
at the University of Politics and Law.

645
00:33:59,250 --> 00:33:59,790
at Dongyao University
of Politics and Law)
was the School of Law
at the University of Politics and Law.

646
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,330
at Dongyao University
of Politics and Law)

647
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,570
We also visited your home.

648
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,710
In your study,

649
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,730
there were many books
related to the bar exam.

650
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,670
Yes, I…

651
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,199
I was already guaranteed admission
to the University of Politics and Law.

652
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,920
Because I wanted to

653
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,520
become a prosecutor myself.

654
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,670
Just like you.

655
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,480
So I started

656
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,570
doing some early preparation.

657
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,580
You're very familiar with the legal
definition of justifiable defense.

658
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,320
W-what do you mean?

659
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,770
Your understanding of the law

660
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,540
is far beyond that of the average suspect.

661
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,570
I have reason to believe

662
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,090
you were using that knowledge.

663
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,280
I…

664
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,190
How could I possibly
use that legal concept?

665
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,360
Precisely because I understand the law,

666
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,710
I know how difficult it is

667
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,630
to prove
justifiable defense in real cases.

668
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,360
Why would I try to exploit that?

669
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,480
Fine, say...

670
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,030
Say I know too much.

671
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,320
But in my view, everything I did

672
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,850
met the conditions
for justifiable defense.

673
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,510
You should ask him that question.

674
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,740
He's already answered with his actions.

675
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,810
He came and testified.

676
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,110
He said

677
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,440
Zhou Delong had been harassing him

678
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,970
and even threatened to kill all of you.

679
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,150
Of course,

680
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,190
that's perjury.

681
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,760
A lie that's easily exposed.

682
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,840
Why do you think

683
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,410
he would give false testimony

684
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,670
that on the surface benefits you

685
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,210
but gets debunked immediately

686
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,630
and makes you look worse?

687
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,480
Why would he do that?

688
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,030
Because from the very beginning,

689
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,760
he believed he had acted
in justifiable defense.

690
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,230
And he believes you ruined his life.

691
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,040
That's Li Mufeng's answer.

692
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,300
His answer through action.

693
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,970
Director Duan,

694
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,250
there's one sentence

695
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,680
that both of us should know by heart.

696
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,610
You should remember:

697
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,120
You're not handling a case,

698
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,070
but someone's life.

699
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,880
My life

700
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,760
is in your hands now.

701
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,610
Dad, Mom!

702
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,700
Come look! This is my brother's work!

703
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,990
Very impressive.

704
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,180
This piece, number nine,

705
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,560
has a good concept.

706
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,520
“See the leopard through a tube.”

707
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,320
“Gentlemen change like a leopard.”

708
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,230
Interesting.

709
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,550
This is the best piece I've seen today.

710
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,990
Accurate proportions,

711
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,060
a solid foundation in sculpture,

712
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,680
and the glass colors
are very contemporary.

713
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,280
On the leopard's body,

714
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,400
it expresses the conflict

715
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,710
between industrial society
and primal nature.

716
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,550
You could say
it combines beauty with depth.

717
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,070
Of all the works today,

718
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,020
this is my favorite.

719
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,490
Excellent.

720
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,770
Truly impressive.

721
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,920
Very well done.

722
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,000
Very nice.

723
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,000
Not bad at all.

724
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,070
Nervous?

725
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,840
A little.

726
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,150
Should turn out well, right?

727
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,050
I don't know.

728
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,600
The results aren't out yet.

729
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,260
The results are already
written on the judges' faces.

730
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,420
I think so too.

731
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,070
Your work is great.

732
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,360
But that's not the only reason

733
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,420
you came, is it?

734
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,240
Come with me.

735
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,650
You said Zhou Delong threatened you

736
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,540
at your shop half a year ago.

737
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,320
Do you realize

738
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,150
that giving false testimony
to frame someone

739
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,670
is a criminal offense?

740
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,670
You want to go back to prison?

741
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,800
I didn't expect

742
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,000
you'd know sign language too.

743
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,510
There's a lot you didn't expect.

744
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,240
But that text message was real.

745
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,070
Doesn't that prove

746
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,440
Zhou Delong had
murderous intent toward me?

747
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,210
If you knew the message was proof,

748
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,360
why lie in the first place?

749
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,030
I was afraid
that if I didn't say it that way,

750
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,440
you wouldn't think

751
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,640
my life was in danger.

752
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,150
I didn't expect

753
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,430
that over these 14 years,

754
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,790
you not only mastered the law,

755
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,960
but also mastered the human heart.

756
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,880
Back then in my case,

757
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,360
even though I was being beaten,

758
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,020
even though
there was a knife on the scene,

759
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,230
the final ruling

760
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,440
was still that my life wasn't in danger.

761
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,760
People always underestimate

762
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,920
the threats others face.

763
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,440
I just wanted you to take me seriously.

764
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,700
Is that your reason for lying under oath?

765
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,710
In your eyes, there's only justice.

766
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,620
Only one person

767
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,680
has truly cared about me.

768
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,810
Duan Hongshan came to see you?

769
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,360
After I got out of prison,

770
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,560
I couldn't find a job.

771
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,110
My parents didn't want me.

772
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,760
I didn't even have a place to live.

773
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,190
He quietly

774
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,120
introduced me to my current mentor

775
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,560
and helped me find work.

776
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,320
At that time,

777
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,120
he was the only one who helped me.

778
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,760
So you're saying

779
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,400
you lied to help Duan Hongshan?

780
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,250
I wouldn't exactly call it “help.”

781
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,190
If Zhou Delong wanted to attack me,

782
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,920
he would've

783
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,590
wanted to attack Director Duan too.

784
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,700
In his eyes, we were both enemies.

785
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,880
Weren't we?

786
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,530
Did Duan Hongshan
say anything else to you?

787
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,400
(Dongyao Glass Art Innovation Competition)

788
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,880
If it's still testable,
(Dongyao Glass Art Innovation Competition)

789
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,090
his fingerprints should be on it.

790
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,030
(Dongyao Glass Art Innovation Competition)

791
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,230
He came to you

792
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,360
just to encourage you

793
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,890
to enter this competition?

794
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,960
He also said,

795
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,110
14 years ago, justifiable defense

796
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,840
was a dormant clause in the law.

797
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,510
The court couldn't
declare me not guilty back then.

798
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,440
But now,

799
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,600
he wants to revive
the idea of justifiable defense.

800
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,280
If that's the case,

801
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,190
if you ask me,

802
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,840
then this work of art is nothing special.

803
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,320
If it came from an ordinary person,

804
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,850
the idea might seem clever.

805
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,400
Using the image of a cage

806
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,710
to reflect a real-life

807
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,150
prison experience.

808
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,930
But in this context,

809
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,880
it loses all sense of sophistication.

810
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,650
It becomes dull.

811
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,900
Even downright crude.
