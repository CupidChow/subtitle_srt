00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,670
can go back to the past, too.

189
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,320
I've read the previous statement.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,060
You mentioned that

191
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,700
Zhang Yuan thought
the dinner wasn't cooked by you.

192
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,230
Why would he say that?

193
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,870
He said

194
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,240
I never peeled asparagus when I cooked it.

195
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,200
Before Zhang Yuan barged into your house,

196
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,890
had anyone else been there?

197
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,480
No.

198
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Did you forget something again?

199
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,860
Who are you expecting?

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,720
No one.

201
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,920
At that moment, I was totally shocked.

202
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,150
Sit.

203
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,430
Why are you just standing there?

204
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,240
Sit down.

205
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,730
I need to hang the laundry.

206
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,080
Someone came by, right?

207
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,630
Whether anyone came by or not

208
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,680
has nothing to do with you, doesn't it?

209
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
Now, you talk back.

210
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,200
You promised me.

211
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,550
You'll keep your promise, right?

212
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,550
Zhang Yuan,

213
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,530
we've known each other for so many years.

214
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,320
Can't we just part on good terms?

215
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,280
When did you learn to keep fish?

216
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,580
They're from a friend.

217
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,600
Which friend?

218
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,440
Someone you don't know.

219
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,360
A new friend?

220
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,120
Call him over.

221
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,840
Have dinner together,
and I'll get to know him.

222
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,350
The asparagus is delicious.

223
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,820
Pity that it's not you who made it.

224
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,870
You never peel the asparagus.

225
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,550
Come here. Eat with me.

226
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
I told you to come here!

227
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Zhang Yuan was always paranoid.

228
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,870
Even if he saw a rooster,

229
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,030
he'd think I'd cheat on him with it.

230
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,550
If he wanted to hit me,

231
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,690
anything could be his excuse.

232
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,560
Come here. Come here.

233
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,200
Yes.

234
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,610
I just want to have a good meal with you.

235
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,630
Here.

236
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,050
You haven't eaten yet, right?

237
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,120
Come on. Try it. See if it's good.

Come on. Try it.

You're with a man behind my back,
aren't you?

245
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,550
I'll kill you if you come closer!

246

247
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,200
Run!

248

You dare stab me?

255
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,250
The legal provision on justifiable defense

256
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,480
is just a few short lines.

257
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,000
The law seems clear,

258
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,700
but the more I read it,
the more complicated it gets,

259
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,630
and the less I understand it.

260
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,240

what crime I'm guilty of now.

262
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
I couldn't hold onto my past,

263
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,330
and now I can't see my future clearly.

264
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,150
You can convict me of murder

265
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,670
and put me behind bars.

266
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,000
That's okay.

267
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,320
But can anyone tell me,

in that situation,

[Wuyan Municipal People's Procuratorate]

340
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,800
I think it's excessive defense.

341
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,830
The first stab

342
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,510
could be considered justifiable defense,

343
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,200
but the following six
can only be considered excessive.

344
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,400
Because

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,720
in terms of timing,

346
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,510
means, intensity

348
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,200

exceeded necessary limits

350
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,030
So, they should be considered
as excessive defense.

00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,350
Was that the best choice Jiang Ting

376
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,900
could make at that moment?

377
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,960
Why didn't she run out the door?

378
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,240
That's why I have doubts on this point.

379
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,110
I think it was
intentional homicide in nature.

380
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,060
The law must not yield to wrongdoing.

381
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,200
I think we've

382
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,240
discussed the immediacy

383
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,160
of justifiable defense,

384
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,760
but we've underestimated
its level of danger.

385
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,890
According to our investigation,

386
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,760
the danger Jiang Ting was facing

387
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,160
not only happened

388
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,030
during that half-hour

389
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,000
on April 17, 2023,

390
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,960
but also existed constantly

391
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,110
during the three years

392
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,000
of her marriage with Zhang Yuan.

393
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,240
Moreover, after they separated,

394
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,270
the danger kept getting escalated.

395
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,640
Except for Prosecutor Luo,

396
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,960
we are all men here.

397
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,680
Say, a man breaks into your house

398
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,720
with a knife.

399
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,900
He corners you to the balcony.

400
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,880
You have three choices at the moment.

401
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,480
First, you get killed by him.

402
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,440
Second,

403
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,790
you jump off from the balcony,
not knowing if you'll survive.

404
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,510
Third,

405
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,270
you fight back with a knife.

406
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,600
Which would you choose?

407
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,830
Based on what we know now,

408
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,510
about Jiang Ting's case,

409
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,250
I tend to think it as justifiable defense.

410
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,500
Director Duan,

411
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
you've made up your mind.

412
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,560
Director Duan is experienced.

413
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,960
We can't stop him even if we want to.

414
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,750
Prosecutor Gong, there's an eyewitness.

415
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,160
The eyewitness' name is Mei Zheng.

416
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,720
She works at the aquarium.

417
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,880
An eyewitness?

418
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,830
Name?

419
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,240
Mei Zheng.

420
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,680
That day…

421
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,720
I couldn't sleep that night,
so I browsed the Internet.

422
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,920
I accidentally looked out of the window.

423
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,270
It was pitch dark all around.

424
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,550
Only the lights at her place were on.

425
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,070
I have good eyesight.

426
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,160
I could see a man holding a knife.

427
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,350
So was the woman.

428
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,590
My first reaction was to call the police.

429
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,830
But it happened too fast.

430
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,440
The man would stab her in no time.

431
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,550
The beam of my flashlight
flashed into his eyes,

432
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,650
and at that moment, he stopped.

433
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,940
But what I didn't expect is

434
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,860
that right at that moment,

435
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,410
the woman raised the knife in her hand

436
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,400
and stabbed him.

437
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,020
What took you so long to call the police?

438
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,610
I don't know much about the law.

439
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,030
After all, someone died.

440
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,640
I didn't know
if flashing the flashlight at them

441
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
would get me involved in the case.

442
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,480
Then, why did you

443
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,070
choose to step forward now?

444
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,070
I learned her story through the media.

445
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,160
I felt sorry for her.

446
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,590
But in Jiang Ting's statement,

447
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,650
she didn't mention the beam of light.

448
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,110
Maybe she wanted to protect

449
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,730
the person who helped her.

450
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,640
What flashlight did you use?

451
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,840
It can shine that far.

452
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,460
What's the distance between the buildings?

453
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,750
The report says 60 meters.

454
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,040
Sixty meters?

455
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,640
Then there's a problem with the testimony.

456
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,070
We've all used flashlights.

457
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,830
It can only illuminate 10 meters or so.

458
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,510
Does it really have such strong light

459
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,110
that it can penetrate 60 meters

460
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,840
and even dazzle the man's eyes?

461
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,480
What she used seems to be a diving flashlight,

462
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,140
one that can be used undersea.

463
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,030
There's hardly any light undersea,

464
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,690
yet this flashlight can still
illuminate up to almost 100 meters.

465
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,160
If the testimony is true,

466
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,400
then as Director Duan believes,

467
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,960
the possibility of justifiable defense

468
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,760
is quite high.

I wasn't even here 14 years ago.

00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,080
What? I haven't arrived yet.

561
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,690
It was not Ding Yi who did it.

562
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,880
Ding Yi, don't go to the 14th floor.

563
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,160
Climb two more floors

564
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,480
to the 15th or 16th floor hallway.

565
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,310
The ventilation window.

566
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,830
Go and see who's there.

567
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,160
Okay, I got it.

568
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:22,330
[Fifteenth floor, Ningwan Residence]

569
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,810
[Fifteenth floor, Ningwan Residence]

570
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,350
No one. No one is upstairs.

571
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:48,470
[Justice, Diligence, Integrity]

572
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,480
Come in.

573
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,240
Last night,

574
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,100
we revisited Jiang Ting's place.

575
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,240
I asked Ding to go up
to the building opposite

576
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,030
and test the diving flashlight.

577
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,440
Its beam did reach us

578
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,830
and was quite glaring.

579
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Mei Zheng's testimony on this point

580
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,770
should be reliable.

581
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,070
Wait a moment.

582
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,390
Let me introduce someone to you.

583
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,550
Fang, let me introduce you.

584
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,000
this is

585
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,350
the Director of
the First Procuratorial Department,

586
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,310
Duan Hongshan.

587
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,590
And this is sent down
from the Provincial Procuratorate

588
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,720
and has been appointed
as our Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

589
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,780
I'm Fang Lingyuan.

590
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,350
Hello.

591
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,480
Nice to meet you.

592
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,200
We met yesterday.

593
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,750
I also went to the crime scene.

594
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,550
I was at the 15th-floor hallway.

595
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,030
Although there is a 60-meter distance,

596
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,000
it can be ignored.

597
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,000
Therefore, Mei Zheng was correct,

598
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,400
her flashlight could indeed shine across.

599
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,350
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang
is a meticulous person.

600
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,720
The Provincial Procuratorate
sent someone over.

601
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,120
Does it indicate that they see issues
with Jiang Ting's case?

602
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,750
Wasn't it too hasty to classify it

603
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,720
directly as justifiable defense?

604
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,310
Zhang Yuan broke
into Jiang Ting's place with a knife,

605
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,660
which constitutes unlawful intrusion.

606
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,960
According to the principle
of in dubio pro reo,

607
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
combined with witness testimonies

608
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,570
and considerations of both logic and law,

609
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,200
justifiable defense is currently

610
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,790
the comparatively appropriate judgment.

611
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,970
Director Duan, let me ask this,

612
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,960
Zhang Yuan had already
lost the ability to resist,

613
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,020
yet Jiang Ting continued to stab him.

614
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,510
Wouldn't that constitute harm
to Zhang Yuan's life?

615
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,310
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang,
you may have arrived in a hurry

616
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,160
and might not
have seen everything clearly.

617
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,400
According to the police investigation,

618
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,790
Zhang Yuan, armed with a knife,

619
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,790
cornered Jiang Ting to the balcony.

620
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,790
In such a dangerous situation,

621
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,390
Jiang Ting could not
make a rational judgment.

622
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,240
The subsequent stabs

623
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,830
were to prevent further harm

624
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,240
from Zhang Yuan

625
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,510
and should be regarded as a single act.

626
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,510
I disagree.

627
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,240
Without knowing the full truth,

628
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,480
you can't attribute everything
to justifiable defense.

629
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,400
So, Deputy Chief Prosecutor Fang,

630
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,920
are you suggesting that this was a case
of intentional homicide?

631
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,270
I think...

632
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,920
This is just a private discussion.

633
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,030
You two,

634
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,000
don't be so serious.

635
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,120
Come, help me lift this.

636
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,750
No need to worry.

637
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,500
We're just trying to
understand each other better.

638
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,480
Discussing a case

639
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,200
is a shortcut
for two prosecutors to communicate.

640
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,880
It's more severe
than intentional homicide.

641
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,400
I have a hypothesis.

642
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,590
There was a third party
in Jiang Ting's place.

643
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,830
Although this third party

644
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,680
wasn't at the crime scene,

645
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,000
it doesn't mean

646
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,030
they didn't intervene in the murder.

647
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,160
It is highly possible

648
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,920
that this person understands the law well

649
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,750
and exploited
the justifiable defense clause

650
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,920
to design an elaborate murder.

651
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,200
Murder?

652
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,400
Yes, murder.

653
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,750
Even if, as you suggest,

654
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,010
such a person existed,

655
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,680
how could they ensure

656
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,810
that Jiang Ting would kill Zhang Yuan?

657
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,440
Or are you suggesting

658
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,910
that Mei Zheng and Jiang Ting

659
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,830
had been colluding all along?

660
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,090
Maybe it was Mei Zheng,

661
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,350
or perhaps it was someone else.

662
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,480
Where does this conclusion come from?

663
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,790
Jiang Ting and Mei Zheng

664
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,850
were both connected to the same case.

665
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,590
On June 28, 2009,

666
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,160
two male students got into a fight
at Wuyan Library.

667
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,030
One student

668
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,790
stabbed the other with a knife,

669
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,320
causing him to die
from excessive blood loss.

670
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,270
The focus of the case at the time

671
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,470
was whether it could be
considered justifiable defense.

672
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,720
Jiang Ting and Mei Zheng

673
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,590
were both witnesses in this case.

674
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,030
They had known each other for a long time

675
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,400
and were both familiar
with the justifiable defense law.

676
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,680
At that time, the prosecutor

677
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,350
in charge of the case was…

678
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,890
Duan Hongshan.

679
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,550
Duan Hongshan has been close to

680
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,590
Mei Zheng, a party involved in his case

681
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,590
from 14 years ago.

682
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,840
They've been in contact all these years.

683
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,070
Fourteen years later, he conspired
with Mei Zheng and Jiang Ting

684
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,960
to commit murder,

685
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,110
planning to leverage his position
to ensure a light sentence for Jiang Ting

686
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,550
and release her under the pretense

687
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,949
of justifiable defense.

688
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,070
All the above mentioned,

689
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,210
from "I have a hypothesis" onward,

690
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,070
is all that has been reported about you.
