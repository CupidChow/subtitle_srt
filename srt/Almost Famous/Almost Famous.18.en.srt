<i> (Almost Famous) </i>

19
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,740
Hey, Dongdong, I see you're up and ready to go so early.

20
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,450
Running back and forth so many times; exactly where are you going?

21
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,610
Professor Li Shuangbai recommended someone who might invest in our graduate Beijing opera show. I'm going to see him in a little bit.

22
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,930
I had to check and do some revisions on the script last night.

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,490
Go for it!

24
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,770
Brother You, what are you doing now?

25
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,030
I'm taking a fresh look at the composition. 'Share'.

26
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,220
Oh, the composition.

27
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,070
Great.

28
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,900
Zhang Yiyong, what are you staring at?

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,650
I was thinking that time really flies. 4 years has passed in a flash.

30
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,810
We're about to graduate.

31
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,380
I really envy you guys. Either you have goals or you have aspirations.

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,990
Not like me. I just spend every day messing around, just like that salt fish.

33
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,350
"Fritter away my time". (idiom)

34
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,580
Just be a fish then.

35
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,840
If yoy have no goals, you don't have any troubles.

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,340
If you're someone with aspirations, worries bring more worries.

37
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,850
All of your aspirations for your craft...

38
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,310
we'll help you realize them.

39
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,310
Are you two trying to comfort me?

40
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,970
Fine. That kind of comfort

41
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,260
just makes me feel even more like that salt fish.

42
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,900
Leave aside you guys; just look at the girls in our class.

43
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,070
Ya Li? She's auditioning for an international dance group.

44
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,050
Who knows? She might spend her days abroad.

45
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,810
And Amy has become a teacher at a dance studio.

46
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,570
I'm sure she'll have a lot of students.

47
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,930
Qu Shiyun visited different projects within few days.

48
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,900
She'll definitely become a good actress in the future.

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,570
Cheng MIng? I really don't understand Cheng Ming.

50
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,000
In order to be in the graduate Beijing opera, she gave up the chance to be Director Lin's number 2 female lead.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,210
She really doesn't understand how many people can't even dream of that opportunity.

52
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,840
She suddenly just...just refused him.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,310
I have only one thing to say about your Cheng Ming: tough to a fault.

54
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,680
You can't think that way. You can just say that it's good that, 'everyone has their own aspirations'.

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,040
I actually want to interview your family members.

56
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,350
Anyway, I support whatever she decides.

57
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,290
Everything.

58
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,720
Just like a lapdog. I admire you.

59
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,690
I'm finished; I'm out of time. I have to go.

60
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,970
I really have to go.

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,240
Who says you don't have any aspirations? Since your first day at Starry Arts Academy,

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,220
your goal was very obvious.

63
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,070
Think about it. Bye bye.

64
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,660
The first day?

65
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,650
That's right.

66
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,710
I still have my female idol, Fang Yali. My dream is to

67
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,450
the man behind the idol.

68
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,320
That's right. I can't lose track of that.

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,250
I have to go too.

70
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,690
- What are you going to do? <br> - I'm going to buy some food for my idol.

71
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,900
I'm off. Bye bye.

<i> (Episode 18) </i>

73
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,910
He is the writer of the script "Almost Famous", Ding Dongdong.

74
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,770
I hope all of you will give me your guidance.

75
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,920
I've read the script. I like it very much.

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,970
You in the edit team should read it carefully.

77
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,330
Discuss the feasibility of the project and how it should be adapted.

78
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,560
Yes, sir, President Mi.

79
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,490
Dongdong, tell everyone an overview of the story.

80
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,050
Hello Everyone. The reason why I write "Almost Famous" is to show the

81
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,960
students at an art school who are on the path of chasing their dreams, with its ups and downs.

82
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,780
It's a story about how they struggle but never give up their dreams.

83
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,120
First, we think that this script is very original.

84
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,430
The content is unique and the characters have vitality; and it's quite distinctive form the scripts we've seen before.

85
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,430
However, if we look at it from the marketing perspective, I think this script lacks an element of sensation.

86
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,630
If If we can put a little sensation into it, this script would be something that makes it a topic of conversation.

87
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,120
Thank you, sir. I understand what you're saying, but this is a true story of my classmates and me.

88
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,580
I think this kind of realistic story could move an audience even more.

89
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,390
Dongdong, have a seat.

90
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,940
There's really no contradiction between sensation and realism.

91
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,130
As long as you can draw the audience in and it resonates with them, that's a good thing.

92
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,100
Do any of the rest of you have any ideas?

93
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,550
I think the the romance between the lead male and female is very moving.

94
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,360
That continuing struggle for their dreams is quite exciting.

95
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,370
But audiences today like romantic dramas better.

96
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,040
I think that some of that sweetness that you find in Mary in the Jiangsu opera could be added in.

97
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,960
I think the role of the second male should be elevated a little.

98
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,990
Many of the most popular dramas have 2 male leads these days.

99
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,810
A pair of men is much more popular than pairing a guy and girl. Isn't that right?

100
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,730
- True. <br> - Most have 2 male leads these days.

101
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,830
That's right.

102
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,360
We can reference to those Bollywood movies.

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,500
That's right.

104
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,170
I think this script is dry and boring.

105
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,260
- Nowadays, who watches a show without humor? <br> - Who watches a plain school drama?

106
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,560
Is a youth drama without a break up or cheating even a youth drama?

107
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,050
Yes, the time has changed.

108
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,810
It has none of that. What will we film? We won't film it.

109
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,540
What do we do?

110
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,350
There's nothing to see.

111
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,340
I wrote a story about my classmates and I

112
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,380
chasing our dreams. It's an inspirational youth school story.

113
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,360
It's not some farce about sacrificing oneself and spilling blood.

114
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,080
And it's definitely not about some animal world.

115
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,100
Then you shoot it yourself.

116
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,930
Anyway, I can't accept this type of change.

117
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,690
If this can only be made into IP after freakish modifications, then I'd rather give up.

118
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,790
Sorry, President Mi.

119
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,390
Young man, hold on.

120
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,670
Our Yiyu's culture always focuses on cultivating new talent.

121
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,640
We give people with talent opportunities and resources.

122
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,710
How about this? I'll divulge some information to you.

123
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,790
I heard your professor say that your work is being used for the graduation show.

124
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,170
If your graduation show is received very well,

125
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,490
then I'll proceed with your ideas. What do you think?

126
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,650
Really?

127
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,370
I remember you told me

128
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,310
Your stories were all written based on your classmate's real stories?

129
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,090
Yes, for the most part they're all real stories.

130
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,890
There's Qi Shiyun who debuted as a child start at 8 years old.

131
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,130
There's also Fang Yali who's practiced ballet since she was really young.

132
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,810
And Cheng Ming who's always been number one in her department.

133
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,730
- There's also— <br> - One named Amy.

134
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,380
How did you know? Yes.

135
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,130
She's really good at dancing. She's out class's street dancing battle queen.

136
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,810
Is that kid really that outstanding?

137
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,380
All of the students in our class are very outstanding.

138
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,890
Oh right, all the girls I mentioned are all in the same dormitory.

139
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,200
I see.

140
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,260
President Mi, Director Lin is here.

141
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,010
- Director Lin. <br> - Dongnan, hello.

142
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,930
It just so happened that when you called our screen director was here too, so I called you over to chat.

143
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,730
Dongdong, this is Director Lin.

144
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,430
-Hello. <br>-Hello.

145
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,640
I saw your work, it's really good. Your'e very talented.

146
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,200
Dongnan, you have a really good eye. You always find talent with good potential.

147
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,490
Dongdong, everyone in the entertainment circle knows Director Lin is known for cultivating new talent.

148
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,940
Plus she has a unique vision. She really likes your script.

149
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,160
If we have her guidance with our project,

150
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,910
then we'll definitely succeed.

151
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,420
- Thank you, Director Lin. <br> - Young man,

152
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,090
I have the same idea s Dongnan. We want to make a Chinese version of "Fame". <br> (T/N: A teen musical film from 1980)

153
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,880
I'll arrange the best resources and team. You just need to focus on writing a good script.

154
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't have to worry about anything else.

155
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,180
Okay-okay Director Lin.

156
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,130
I'll definitely work on my script.

157
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,060
The school still thinking about it.

158
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,840
If it doesn't work, then we'll rehearse "Becoming famous", it suits us the best.

159
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,930
What do you know? The graduation performance has to be a classic

160
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,130
If we can't do "Almost Famous" then we should do "Cats".

161
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,940
It'll showcase my talent.

162
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,660
Let's wait for a bit longer. I still think it's better to performance our own production.

163
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,730
It's our graduation project at the end of the day.

164
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,920
Also, once we're graduated even know what we'll be doing.

165
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,630
Cheng Ming, we just started our career, can you not say something so depressed?

166
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,420
Little princess, can you not only think about yourself?

167
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,320
I think Cheng Ming's word makes sense. You might be full of dreams

168
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,850
But reality is very harsh.

169
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,340
A lot of us might change their career after graduation and they can no longer step onto the stage.

170
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,310
That's why we need to put our dream on to the graduation project.

171
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,650
But Aimy also right about it.

172
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,460
We shouldn't prepare both ways, just in case.

173
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,510
<i>-That's right. <br> - It sounds like we've not talked about it.</i>

174
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,230
What's the matter? Are we done?

175
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,330
<i> What's the situation?</i>

176
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,680
Let me breathe. <br> <i>- Tell us! What's going on?</i>

177
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,540
Come up, just tell us.

178
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,950
We got it!

179
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,140
<i> We got it?</i>

180
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,160
<i> That's great!</i>

181
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,200
Director Mi said Professor Li has agreed,

182
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,260
has decided our graduation performance will be

183
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,150
"Almost Famous".

184
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,610
<i> That's amazing!</i>

185
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,260
<i> Mr. Dao is here!</i>

186
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,390
<i> Hello Mr. Dao.</i>

187
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,880
- Mr. Dao. <br> - Hello!

188
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,580
What makes you guys so happy?

189
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,550
Let me tell you another good news, we've decided our graduation performance will be...

190
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,750
"Almost Famous"!

191
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,610
- You all know about it already?<br> - We do!

192
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,580
Let me congratulate you guys first.

193
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,700
The school let you manage the entire production because we're great expectation from you.

194
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,350
The school will invite a lot of outstanding organizations to the show,

195
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,980
also many

196
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,050
famous actors and directors.

197
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,030
There is more.

198
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,620
They invited Broadway production company to watch your performance.

199
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,720
It'll help you tremendously for your future careers.

200
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,700
That's why I hope everyone can fight for the role you wanted to play, all right?

201
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,490
- Okay!<br> - You can do it!

202
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,630
<i>We can do it!</i>

203
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,110
How is it? How's the script reading?

204
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,110
Which role do you want?

205
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,630
This script is pretty good, each character is very robust.

206
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,120
For me, I like the female lead the most.

207
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,380
I want to be the main lead.

208
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,460
Who don't want to be the female lead on the gratulation performance? I want it too.

209
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,760
Qu Shiyun. Female lead is not the only good role.

210
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,820
You need to find a role that suits you.

211
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,760
Why am I not suitable to that role? I look apart,

212
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,150
I've the popularity and I've many fans.

213
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,400
Ding Dongdong wrote that female lead role based on me, okay?

214
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,950
Based on you?

215
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,950
Ding Dongdong said so?

216
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,100
This graduation performance audition needs to see the actual ability.

217
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,020
Now you're saying I don't have the ability?

218
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,860
Tell me honestly.

219
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,540
It's written based on you. Your acting is great

220
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,560
and you've the popularity. This musical is going to have a television version,

221
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,090
why don't you be the lead role over there?

222
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,170
You don't deserve to be the lead on this school production.

223
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,390
You guys arelooking down on me, aren't you?

224
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,750
You'll wait and see.

225
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,550
Brother, let me tell you a great news. Our graduation performance script is confirmed.

226
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,440
Our graduation performance script is confirmed.

227
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,810
"Almost Famous"?

228
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,770
I've already told our Brother You.

229
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,850
Thanks to you, there're no longer surprises.

230
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,520
You're not sincere at all.

231
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,000
How about this? Since we've not determined who will be the main leads,

232
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,450
and both of us look just like blood related twin brothers,

233
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,100
why don't you give me

234
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,510
the male lead role

235
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,070
based on our friendship?

236
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,940
Can you try not to think of those tricks in daily bases?

237
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,580
- Look at our classmate You Zhiqi...<br> - let me learn it from him.

238
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,410
- Look at him...<br>- Full of nonsense.

239
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,020
Brother You.

240
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,160
<i> (Never let you go)</i>

241
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,360
Are you planning to join the production of Never Let You Go?

242
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,230
I'll be working n their music production.

243
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,340
This story is about a person with Nyctophobia who overcomes this own fears.<br> (T/N: Nyctophobia is extreme fear of dark)

244
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,590
- A story about Nyctophobia?<br> - That's right.

245
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,660
It's a representative story.

246
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,720
Have you thought of doing the acting role?

247
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,240
I've already announced halting all my activities.

248
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,090
If I do that I'll break my own promises.

249
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:53,090
Comrade You Zhiqi, you cannot be affected by those few words.

250
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:58,350
In my opinion, if "Never let you go" becomes a TV series,

251
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,710
and you be the lead, it'll be smashing.

252
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,160
Hello?

253
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,260
- Hello? Dong Dong. <br> - What's the matter?

254
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,730
Do you think I'm treating you well?

255
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,500
I think pretty well.

256
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,630
Are you dedicating your time on "Almost Famous" lately?

257
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,670
That's right. I've been tweaking the script.

258
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,310
If that's the case, can you write me an important role on

259
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,560
the TV version of "Almost Famous"?

260
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,480
For that, I cannot make the decision. Director Mi has the say on that.

261
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,530
For that...

262
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,890
I'm just joking, you blockhead.

263
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,070
<i> for this, you need to put it on top of here.</i>

264
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,430
- Hello.<br> - Hello.

265
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,740
I would like to see Mi Dongnan, Director Mi.

266
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,990
Have you had an appointment?

267
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,450
But I'm a student from Starry Arts Academy.

268
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:25,960
I'm sorry, we've a lot of student like you who wants to get into Director Mi's production.

269
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,260
You should leave, please don't bother him.

270
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,570
But I just need to see him quickly. Really fast.

271
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,350
- Just briefly, really fast.<br> - Miss.

272
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,620
- Just briefly.<br> - Miss you can't.

273
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,630
- Director Mi, I just want to meet you briefly!<br> - Can you make an appointment first.

274
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,430
My name is Qu Shiyun!

275
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,190
Wait.

276
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,570
- Director Mi. <br> - What's the matter?

277
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,530
This student said she wants to meet you.

278
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,160
Director Mi. Hello. My name is Qu Shiyun.

279
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,370
I'm student from Starry Arts Academy. I debut at age 8, I've acted in many projects.

280
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,780
Can you give me an opportunity?

281
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,590
- Qu Shiyun<br> - That's right!

282
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,020
- Come in. <br> - Thank you, Director Mi.

283
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,900
Qu Shiyun.

284
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,140
That's right, Director Mi. I'm Qu Shiyun and I want to play a role at the "Almost Famous" production.

285
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,350
The reason why is not because I'm an outstanding student from the musical department.

286
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,690
But I also have a lot of acting experience.

287
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,550
Can you give me an opportunity to prove myself?

288
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,310
I heard this script was based on your real life story.

289
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,280
That's right, Director Mi. Since 8 years old,

290
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,010
my mom sent me to TV drama productions.

291
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,370
he said kids from poor family should earn money sooner.

292
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,300
You should start acting sooner, earn some money.

293
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,380
Since then, I moved from one project to another project.

294
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,720
Eventually I started to like performing.

295
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,270
That's why I insist on doing it all these years.

296
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,100
Unfortunately, no one knows how much sacrifices I've gone through.

297
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,920
Director Mi, I'm really really love acting.

298
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,720
I also want to become a good actor.

299
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,870
I've already sent my personal information and also my video clips to your company emails.

300
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,050
Can you review my performance and give me a chance?

301
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:12,990
Your sincerity has moved me, I can see you're a very hard working kid.

302
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,690
How about this? I promise you that I'll check your email.

303
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,820
If your performance can moved me,

304
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,280
my assistant will reach out to you.

305
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,000
Thank you, Director Mi!

306
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,730
Cheng Ming,

307
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,690
why did you give up being the second female lead in the movie last time?

308
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,780
I was pretty torn at first too.

309
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,540
But I thought it through.

310
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,250
I can always try for more movie opportunities in the future.

311
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,490
But the graduation show only happens this once.

312
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,500
Plus, I've already prepared 4 years for it.

313
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,690
Being a musical actress is my real dream.

314
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,060
So, you definitely want the female lead in the graduation show then?

315
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,940
Of course. In sophomore year, I didn't get the female lead role.

316
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,130
This time, I want to prove myself.

317
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,430
Chen Ming, I'll accompany you.

318
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,430
You Zhiqi, how's everything going for you?

319
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,640
It is what it is. It's not like I've never been cancelled before.

320
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,640
Just like your lyrics,

321
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,220
"This endless solitude is all for tomorrow"

322
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,100
"I have no fear of the future or the present"

323
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,120
Wei Feng, you're sounding more and more like a teacher.

324
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,870
What are your plans?

325
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,960
My biggest dream is to be the best music producer.

326
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,900
You?

327
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,770
I...

328
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,350
Of course I want to stay at Xingyu and teach.

329
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,390
Teaching and educating people like Professor Li Shuangbai, and have students everywhere.

330
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,960
Nice. Wei Feng wants to teach and educate people.

331
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,390
You Zhiqi wants to be the best music producer.

332
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,790
For me, I'll first do my best with the graduation show.

333
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,060
I wish for all of our dreams to come true.

334
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,890
<i>- Let's go.</i><br>- Our dreams become our reality.

335
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,480
Yali, I brought some special food for you today.

336
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,420
You'lll definitely be surprised.

337
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,090
Yali, what's the matter?

338
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,270
Something troubling you?

339
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:30,950
These are new recipes I've learned to make a nutritious meal set for you.

340
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,780
Why don't you try it?

341
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,030
Give me feedback on what I can do better?

342
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,390
Yali, slow down. Don't choke on it.

343
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,170
See, you need some water.

344
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,560
Here, have some water.

345
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,230
I originally thought

346
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,370
if I got into a foreign school,

347
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,620
then I could escape my mom.

348
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,290
But I got rejected by the British ballet school.

349
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,030
All the my hard work is now done in vain.

350
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,120
Zhang Yiyong,

351
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,090
I've failed.

352
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,020
Actually

353
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,410
It's okay, I understand.

354
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,750
No matter what, I'll always be with you.

355
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,890
<i>Amy's situation, what's your thoughts?</i>

356
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,450
<i> I think Ellie has taken good care of her all these years. I'm afraid </i>

357
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,830
<i> reconciling with my current identity </i>

358
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,190
<i> will cause trouble for her. </i>

359
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,300
<i> She hasn't told our child all these years. </i>

360
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,620
<i> She doesn't want me and Amy to know each other. </i>

361
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:02,020
<i>(Dear Yali Fang...)</i>

362
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:22,840
<i>(Hello, Miss Qu. This is President Mi's assistant. See you tomorrow, 10 am, at his office.)</i>

363
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,220
Come in.

364
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,910
President Mi, Qu Shiyun is here.

365
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,060
President Mi, hello.

366
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,700
Shiyun? Come in.

367
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,940
I saw the recording of your acting.

368
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,660
I really like it.

369
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,680
Thank you, President Mi.

370
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,660
I want to hold a position in the television adaptation of "Almost Famous" for you.

371
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,260
Thank you for this opportunity, President Mi! I won't let you down.

372
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,530
Additionally, I need a favor from you.

373
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,560
President Mi, go ahead. As long as I can help, I'll do my best.

374
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,990
Is there a girl name Amy in your dorm?

375
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,110
That's right.

376
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,960
President Mi, why are you looking for her?

377
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,440
It's like this.

378
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,870
The company is preparing a movie about street dance.

379
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,660
I heard she's a good dancer and her image matches the role pretty well.

380
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,070
Amy's really good at street dancing. You guys made the right choice.

381
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,380
- Looks like you're pretty close to her? <br> - Yes, all of us in the dorm are close.

382
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,430
Then can you help me something?

383
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,650
Regarding her academics and living situation,

384
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,820
I want you to secretly tell me everything without her knowing.

385
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,410
Why can't we let her know?

386
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:53,180
You guys can also talk to her directly. I'll give you her contact.

387
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,570
Its like this

388
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,110
This project is still in the beginning phases of planning.

389
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,400
So the evaluation of actors is a secret.

390
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,170
So they can't know.

391
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,010
I promise I'll fulfill the mission.

392
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,670
<i> (Education Building) </i>

393
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:29,300
♫ <i> Whether it’s for a passing moment or my everlasting future </i> ♫

♫ <i> I will shine endlessly </i> ♫

398
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,030
- This is your new arrangement? <br> - Yes.

399
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,820
What do you think about this song as the main soundtrack for "Almost Famous"?

400
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,430
I think it's perfect. It really matches the artistic concept of Ding Dongdong's script.

401
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,420
Plus, the new arrangement you made is so good.

402
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,220
Yes.This song's potential and tension doesn't just stop here.

403
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,740
I've already thought of a lot of ways it can be arranged.

404
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,200
Based on the scene, I'll try out different changes.

405
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,130
I think this song will be great as the main soundtrack.

406
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,310
You Zhiqi, you're too talented.

407
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,530
Since I'm arranging the song, then I'll make it the best.

408
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,000
Alright, then I'll work hard with you.

409
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,020
Wei Feng, why are you here?

410
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,890
I was passing by and hear you rehearsing inside so I wanted to come in and see.

411
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,730
But I never thought that you two are actually showing off your affection.

412
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:58,210
You should quickly listen to his new song. What do you tihnk?

413
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,930
This part of the melody is really beautiful. But what about the other parts?

414
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,860
Later on?

415
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,870
Later on, I want to add some harmonies.

416
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,030
And then in the other parts, I'll add some variation.

417
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,090
I'll add some violin,

418
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,860
piano.

419
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,000
If you can...

420
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,150
Enter.

421
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,530
Director Mi, you called for me?

422
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,010
Help me pick out a gift for a young woman.

423
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,620
Is it a gift for a girlfriend?

424
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,610
A junior.

425
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,900
I want four.

426
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,570
Help me choose something good.

427
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,980
Then, who will receive the gift?

428
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,090
Qu Shiyun

429
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,820
Each for the four people in the dormitory.

430
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,820
Go on.

431
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,260
Boss, how many times have we gone around <br>this confusing school? Where on earth is she?

432
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,410
Let's look again.

433
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,130
What on earth is the relationship between <br> Director Mi and Qu Shiyun?

434
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,900
How is Director Mi suddenly involved with <br>this female college student?

435
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,370
It's not what you're thinking.<br>Director Mi said it's for a junior.

436
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,630
A junior...

437
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,440
All this time, Director Mi has been looking for his daughter

438
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,970
I bet these gifts are for his daughter.

439
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,180
Daughter...<br>So that means that Qi Shiyun is Director Mi's daughter?

440
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,110
Last time, I saw them in the office talking really happily.

441
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:50,810
I'm guessing that they haven't known each other for long.

442
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,730
It's over there.

443
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,540
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

444
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,190
May I ask

445
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:04,080
if student Qu Shiyun is here today?

446
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,270
No. She didn't come for the audition today.

447
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,840
Did her room mates come today?

448
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,620
They didn't come too. Why are you looking for them?

449
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,330
These are gifts for her and her room mates from Qu Shiyun's father.

450
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,230
Since they are not here and I couldn't contact her on the phone,

451
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,460
please receive these on their behalf.

452
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,720
- Okay. <br>- Thank you.

453
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,290
Please deliver this to Miss Qu Shiyun.

454
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,960
-We'll be leaving first. <br>-Okay. Bye.

455
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,060
This is simply inhumane.

456
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,660
Look at this.

457
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,620
Since Qu Shiyun is President Mi's daughter,

458
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,430
she's definitely the female lead in "Almost Famous".

459
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,570
I felt strange from the start. Why would President Mi be willing to invest so much in our graduation showcase?

460
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,200
That's right. There's a catch behind the scene.

461
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,350
Look at these.

462
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,710
Who's thinking of me?

463
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,600
What are you doing, Ding Dongdong? Your class has lots of secrets.

464
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,920
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?

465
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,010
Does everyone know that You Zhiqi is a celebrity?

466
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,520
Is this even a secret? Even the cleaning lady knows about this.

467
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,380
I was referring to Qu Shiyun.

468
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,170
Qu Shiyun?

469
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,220
What about her?

470
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,870
Stop pretending. You really don't know?

471
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,330
My girlfriend just called me. President Mi, the investor in our graduation showcase,

472
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,480
just dispatched several staff to deliver gifts to her.

473
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,720
They personally said that the gifts were for his daughter.

474
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,100
Are you crazy? How could Qu Shiyun possibly be President Mi's daughter?

475
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,740
They don't even have the same family name.

476
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,430
Who doesn't know about rich and influential families?

477
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,720
Which rich and influential family doesn't has any children with unknown background?

478
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,480
The staff of President Mi explained very clearly. Besides,

479
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,720
if it weren't for Qu Shiyun, would President Mi invest in your graduation showcase?

480
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,110
You are not the only one who's graduating. Same for your class too. Why would he?

481
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,250
Ding Dongdong, you really stepped on dog shit and became lucky,

482
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,000
Can you stop spouting nonsense?

483
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,160
- Still reluctant to admit?<br>- Please leave.

484
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,610
Go and ask if you still don't believe me.

485
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,590
- What should we have for dinner?<br>- Let's have spicy hotpot.

486
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,620
- Isn't that Qu Shiyun?<br>- Yes.

487
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,840
So, she's a heiress.

488
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,580
Whatever she wants to film, her father will invest in it.

489
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:51,920
Of course. Why would anyone want to invest in your academy's graduation drama?

490
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,480
Why are you here?

491
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,200
Because of you, President Mi invested in "Almost Famous", right?

492
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,190
- What?<br>- I said,

493
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,620
President Mi invested in "Almost Famous" because of you, right?

494
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,280
Ding Dongdong, what do you mean by this?

495
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,530
I merely want to clarify the reason.

496
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,210
Whatever his reason is, it's okay if this is the result. Right?

497
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:21,260
If he really invested because of you, I will keep thinking that

498
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,790
I don't have any creative ability.

499
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,920
How could you not have this?

500
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,360
- What has the selection to do with me?<br>- Of course, there is.

501
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,680
Because I wrote the script.

502
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,690
Ding Dongdong, just have confidence that you have a good script.

503
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,650
Won't this do?

504
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,330
Self confidence? I have this.

505
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,630
Of course, I have this.

506
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,970
And then, what do you want to say?

507
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,250
Forget it. I can't explain this for the moment.

508
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,810
<i>(Create Registration Information for Royal Academy of Dance)</i>

509
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,620
Hey DongDong, where have you gone? We haven't seen you the entire day.

510
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,570
DongDong.DongDong.

511
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,570
Brother You.

512
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,240
What's wrong with you both today?

513
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,480
One has gone stupid from reading books. The other is deaf.

514
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,950
Fine. I lost. I will stay out of this.

515
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,960
Have fun.

516
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,130
The schoolmates who delivered these said these are from Qu Shiyun's father.

517
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,950
President Mi Dongnam sent these.

518
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,980
With Qu Shiyun's personality,

519
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:57,140
why didn't I hear her mentioned about her father?

520
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,390
The cruz of this matter is these gifts.

521
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,980
Qu Shiyun, are these gifts from your father?

522
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,360
My Dad?

523
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,030
How come we haven't heard you mention this before?

524
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:29,690
I didn't expect you would have such a good father.

525
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,850
It's fine if you like it.

526
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,860
I like it.

527
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,820
- I want this.<br>- I want the one in blue.
