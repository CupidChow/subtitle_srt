20
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,040
When Brother You comes back, you'll have to tidy up everything!

His company makes sure that he gets to live a good life. Why will he come back?

Brother You! You are back!

Why does this dormitory looks like in such a condition?

-He did it.<br>-He did it.

Doesn't matter who did it. Quickly make it the way it was before.

-Hello?<br>-Cheng Ming, where are you?

38
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,860
I have come back to our dormitory. Let's go and eat together.

39
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,540
But right now I am not in the campus.

40
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,530
I am going to meet an agent for an interview.

41
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,540
Agent? Who?

42
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,230
He isn't an imposter, right?

43
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,830
Isn't it the last year of college? All our classmates have been to interviews whereas I haven't.

44
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,090
Now, with so difficulty one agent contacted me. So, I will certainly got to meet him.

45
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,980
Don't worry! I can sense if there is any wrongdoing.

46
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,360
How about I accompany you?

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,780
You don't need to. I am not a fool.

48
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,670
You quickly set up your dorm room. Everything must certainly be messed up.

49
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,660
I'll call you after my interview is done.

50
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,170

Dong Nan, what have you thought about Amy?

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,660
I think Ai Li has raised her very well for these many years.

55
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,980
Didn't you also say that she is very talented and sincere?

56
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,310
I am afraid that my current social status

57
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,720
will on the contrary only cause trouble for her.

58
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,050
Just mentioning again but you also know Ai Li's temperament.

59
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,250
That year, she just said and left.

60
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,950
For all these years, even she didn't tell Amy anything.

61
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,360
Actually, she doesn't want me and Amy to know each other.

62
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,600
You believe that is alright to not admit and break up familial flesh-and-blood ties.

63
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,910
But sooner or later you will have to confront it. Think properly about it.

64
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,570
Amy also really wants to meet you.

65
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,550
-Hello Cheng Ming!<br>-I am Si Tuying.

66
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,500
Everyone calls me Sister Ying. You can also call me that.

69
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,620
And participate for around six months in a training session for Broadway performers.

70
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,520
A training session for Broadway performers?

71
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,140
Yes, a training session for Broadway performers

72
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,380
Our classes are all in English and we have closed master classes.

73
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,540
Outstanding graduates will also become Broadway signed actors.

74
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,350
However, we do collect a tuition for training costs.

75
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,820
We will also purchase the roundtrip plane tickets together,

I'll give you a reply by tomorrow. Is it alright?

79
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,560
Sister Ying, I'll leave now.

80
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,500
Alright.

81
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,700
This Cheng Ming is a bit troublesome.

82
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,340
Looks like she didn't believe it all.

83
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,010
However, have faith in me. I will certainly fix up this girl.

You're done. How was the interview?

117
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,080
I didn't even get to finish introducing myself when the director left to make a phone call.

118
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,540
They want me to record a demo video. I don't even know if the director will watch it.

119
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,030
They'll surely look at it. Let's go back and wait there, okay?

120
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,780
Let's go.

- You Zhiqi! <br> - Cheng Ming!

You're ears are showing.

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,650
- Then, help me fix it. <br> - Let's go.

124
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,400
How was your meeting with the agent today?

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,730
After the interview, she arranged for us to meet again tomorrow.

126
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,190
So, I think the interview was pretty successful.

127
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,420
That good?

128
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,020
After I finished the interview, I bumped into Qu Shiyun. She was there to interview too.

129
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
She wanted me to go with her.

130
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,750
It was called...something like... Director Lin. Sounded like it was a big project.

131
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,540
Director Lin's work?

132
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,490
- Then, she won't get it. <br> - Why?

133
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,530
Because Director Lin does intense work, taking over 6 months to make his choices.

134
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,810
Every selection he makes is based his own impressions.

135
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,260
All the roles he chooses fits the person themselves.

136
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,850
He's that amazing?

137
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,130
When I was waiting for her today, someone came out to ask me whether I was there to interview.

138
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,150
At that moment, I was rehearsing a song and he spooked me.

139
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,630
You rehearse wherever you are.

140
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,970
Why didn't you go for that interview?

141
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,990
If you had, who knows, maybe the role would be yours.

142
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,170
- So you have to go see that agent again tomorrow? <br> - Yes.

143
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,830
But I don't think she's that reliable.

144
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,950
She said she'd take me to America to attend some...

145
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,230
Broadway theatrical performance training.

146
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,590
Broadway training course?

147
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,190
I don't know. She's called Situ Ying. Have you ever heard of her?

148
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,830
I think she seems like a liar.

149
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,110
But I still want to go; what if it's true?

150
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,240
That's no good.

151
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,520
I'll go with you tomorrow.

152
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,940
But, tomorrow, I've got a meeting to do some work with a producer. Never mind.

153
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,220
Let's do this. I'll put off that meeting and go with you.

154
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,390
Aiyo, You Zhiqi. You need to trust me.

155
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,510
I'm just afraid you'll be cheated and get scammed for some money.

156
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,390
I won't. Just relax and go have your discussions with the producer.

157
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,130
I just hope that the two of us can both become better and better.

158
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,820
So, you can't put off your own work because of me.

159
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,760
I am looking forward to seeing the gloriously radiant You Zhiqi.

160
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,650
Let's go.

161
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,250
Have you thought about this, Cheng Ming?

162
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,580
You need to know that this a rare opportunity.

163
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,000
I admire you very much; so I've kept this opportunity especially for you.

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,970
Sister Ying, I think that this matter

165
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,130
- must be... <br> - You're a student right now.

166
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,320
Opportunities for you right now are extremely important.

167
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,860
In order to express my good faith, I've brought the contract.

168
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,790
<i> (Peach Entertainment Film and Television Production Company) <br> (Artist Contract) </i>

169
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,690
So you're Sister Ying, right?

170
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,290
You You.

171
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,280
What are you doing here?

172
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,210
Isn't your greatest expertise in deceiving these kinds of inexperienced young girls

173
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,640
into signing a contract? Then, you take all of them and turn one of them into a star.

174
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,330
And you don't care about their special talents; just give them all makeovers so they're changed beyond recognition.

175
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,180
What?

176
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,970
Now you've become to lie to them about taking them to study abroad on Broadway?

177
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,350
I'm talking to an artist? What business is that of yours?

178
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,140
What I utterly detest is this kind of liar who messes around and pollutes our profession.

179
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,710
Fortunately, this one is a friend of mine.

180
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,920
You're looking for trouble.

181
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,190
I have no idea what you're saying. Cheng Ming,

182
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,090
I'm very sincere about this. I hope you will consider it carefully.

183
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,990
When you've decided, give me a call, okay?

184
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,410
You were almost cheated. She's a famous liar.

185
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,300
Sister You You, what are you doing here?

186
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,770
Didn't you tell You Zhiqi about this matter?

187
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,500
Today, there is a small budget moving looking for a music composer. He went to discuss that matter.

188
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,560
But he was worried about you. So, he asked me to come take a look.

189
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,240
Actually, I understood what was going on.

190
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,250
But being on Broadway is a dream of mine, so I still wanted to come and check it out.

191
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,940
You're not foolish. Fortunately, you didn't sign with her.

192
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,010
Otherwise, You Zhiqi would have gone crazy.

193
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,740
I'll answer this call.

194
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,220
Hello.

195
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,050
What? Director Lin chose me!?

196
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,310
- Director Lin. <br> - You You.

197
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,050
What are you doing here?

198
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,410
Haven't I brought this actress you've been looking for?

199
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,510
She's one of yours, You You?

200
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,980
We've been looking at masses of people from all over the country; we haven't been able to nail down the 2nd lead.

201
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,810
Why have you been hiding her?

202
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,580
I I hadn't bumped into her that day, I'd be dying of worry.

203
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,330
Director Lin, she's not my artist. She's my friend.

204
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:10,130
No need to quibble about whether she's your client. You've brought her today, so she's yours.

205
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,200
Young lady, what have you acted in?

206
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,010
I haven't acted in anything.

207
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,720
Nothing? Don't be nervous.

208
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,880
What I'm looking for is a blank piece of paper. We're looking for a 2nd female lead.

209
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,310
She's a music lover; someone who's obsessed with it.

210
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,400
Fortunately, that day I heard you singing. You gave me exactly that feeling.

211
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,150
Exactly what I've been looking for.

212
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,660
You aren't thanking Director Lin for giving you this opportunity.

213
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,630
Thank you, Director Lin.

214
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,030
That's settled then.

215
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,730
If there's nothing hindering this, Cheng Ming, you can immediately become one of our team.

216
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,210
Next week, we'll begin closed-door rehearsals.

217
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,050
Because in this piece, there are a lot of singing and dancing scenes.

218
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,760
Before that, you can become familiar with the role and prepare for it.

219
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,060
Director, what is the time period closed door rehearsals?

220
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,780
Right away.

221
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,950
- Approximately...for 6 months. <br> - Half a year?

222
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,240
- Half a year...is a little... <br> - Cheng Ming.

223
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,090
What are you talking about?

224
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,830
- Director Lin, can I thing about this? <br> - Okay.

225
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,820
You can think about it.

226
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,500
Cheng Ming, what are you thinking?

227
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,710
You need to take more time to consider this? This is a chance so many people can only dream of.

228
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,130
For a new person to be able to work on Director Lin's production is a huge leap upwards.

229
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,460
I know. But...I'm going to be in the graduate production very soon.

230
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,610
Wait Graduate Beijing opera?

231
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,570
I want to be in the graduate Beijing Opera. We're about to start rehearsing.

232
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,080
Cheng Ming, do you know how brutal this profession is?

233
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,290
So many people dream of getting a role as 3rd or 4th lead, much less this special, rare opportunity.

234
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,080
Even less so being the 2nd lead for Director Lin.

235
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,560
- I know, but I... <br> - Do you really?

236
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,180
Every year there are countless arts school students graduating. They'll remain unknown their whole lives because they don't get this kind of opportunity.

237
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,590
You must be every more aware of this than me, right?

238
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,690
Now, you've encountered such good fortune.

239
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:02,080
In our industry, how many would do anything to have this kind of opportunity? Do you understand that?

240
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,330
I do.

241
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,230
Sister You You, just let me think about it.

242
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,020
I can only give you 2 days. You must give Director Lin your answer day after tomorrow.

243
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,890
Once you've made a decision, there won't be any way to back out.

244
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,620
- Okay. <br> - Let's go.

245
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,850
You and You Zhiqi really were born with this same type of thinking.

246
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,430
<i> (Student Apartment) </i>

247
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,760
- Mom. <br> - Lili, what's so important?

248
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,670
Sit.

249
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,830
Li Li, your dad's already met with the leader of Haima troupe for you.

250
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,180
The leader already agreed

251
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,380
and said for you to join right after you graduate.

252
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,170
- You can be a leading lady. <br>- Mom.

253
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,050
Why did you decide for me and not ask for my opinion first?

254
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,660
What I do is for your sake.

255
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,180
You never ask me what I think. I'm clearly starting at the same point as all of my classmates.

256
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,200
I'm not worse than anyone.

257
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,040
But you always make me stand out using these methods. Have you every considered what I think?

258
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,060
Can you use feelings to make a living?

259
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,470
Li Li, in the future, you're going to be the female protagonist of a large production.

260
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,320
This is the most realistic.

261
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,690
I don't want to join Haima.

262
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,250
I also don't want to be a female lead like this.

263
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,260
We're about to put on the graduation play.

264
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,040
I want to use my own efforts

265
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,960
to earn a good role.

266
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,570
Have your studies made you stupid, Fang Yali?

267
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,350
Do you know how much effort your dad put into this?

268
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,070
You can get into Haima and be the female lead. Why think about a graduation play?

269
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,820
Besides, if you want to act,

270
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,700
just have your dad recruit some friends and put on a show.

271
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,470
You'll still be the female lead, right?

272
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,170
Mom, do you know what I want?

273
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,230
You can stop making decisions for me.

274
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,470
I've had arrangements to have dinner with my friends. You can leave.

275
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,130
Fang Yali! Why don't you know what's good for you?

276
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,630
You're making me angry!

277
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,050
Why are you here?

278
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,790
Why do you look upset, Little White Rabbit?

279
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,450
You You already told me.

280
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,690
I'm stunned.

281
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,480
How did this opportunity fall onto my head?

282
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,890
Qu Shiyun called me just now and got so angry she cried.

283
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,540
I don't know how to face her.

284
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,000
Plus, do you know they're about to start half a year of private training?

285
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,730
It'll start immediately.

286
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,520
Rehearsals for our big show are about to start.

287
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,700
But I want to go.

288
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,080
I've completely given up the graduation show.

289
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,230
I know what you're struggling with.

290
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,130
Then what do you think I should choose?

291
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,340
Cheng Ming, what is your dream?

292
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,030
Where your heart is, that's where your dream is!

293
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,340
What are you doing? You look like an advertiser.

294
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,130
By the way, did today go smoothly for you?

295
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,270
At the start, it wasn't going smoothly.

296
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,930
Because of my different past identifies and reasons,

297
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,130
they don't really believe me. But!

298
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,590
I played them one of my songs and everything worked out.

299
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,860
Plus, a production team like them doesn't have much funding.

300
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,920
They can only use people like me.

301
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,820
What type of people are like you?

302
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,020
Our You Zhiqi is the best! Am I right?

303
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,170
Let me take this call.

304
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,800
Hello, Amy.

305
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,080
I...

306
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,860
All right, okay. I'll be right there.

307
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:06,070
Oh no, Amy told me to go to the diner. They prepared a celebration feast for me.

308
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,920
But Qu Shiyun will be there too.

309
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,620
What do I do?

310
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,480
We're gathering tonight for something special.

311
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,260
Cheng Ming got selected for a great role.

312
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,800
That's right, Cheng Ming. Congratulations!

313
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,600
You can surprise our top idol, You Zhiqi.

314
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,730
Congratulations, Cheng Ming.

315
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,840
Thank you.

316
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,060
Cheng Ming, you're so lucky.

317
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,490
I actually get to witness this movie-like plot.

318
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,370
Actually...

319
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,790
Before, when we did underground dance battles,

320
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:48,090
there would often be those dance god show off there skills at critical times.

321
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,330
It's normal. Today you win, tomorrow I win.

322
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,810
I think having a good attitude on this career path

323
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,190
is also an important lesson for you to learn.

324
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,170
Eat. Take care of your health.

325
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,320
As an actress, you need to maintain a confident mindset.

326
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,560
Cheng Ming,

327
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,640
now that you've gotten this great opportunity,

328
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,460
why does it feel like you're not happy about ti?

329
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,640
It's like this. First,

330
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,340
regarding this matter to Qu Shiyun,

331
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,690
I'm really sorry.

332
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,270
Second, I really

333
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,680
don't want to give up the graduation show.

334
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,120
What? What do you mean?

335
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,140
According to my knowledge, Director Lin's shows require half a year of private training.

336
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,540
If you join, then you won't be able to participate in the graduation show.

337
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,460
What's there to struggle about?

338
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,710
Of course, you need to film Director Lin's drama.

339
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,110
What are you thinking?

340
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,510
I also think Director Lin's show is more important. The opportunity is hard to come by.

341
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,570
Who knows? Maybe you'll make your debut.

342
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,680
I've thought it through, Cheng Ming.

343
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,850
Since you got the opportunity,

344
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,240
then you should make the best of it.

345
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,000
Think of me and give it your best.

346
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,620
If you don't do well, then you'll do me wrong.

347
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,060
Come on, come on, what's with the sad atmosphere?

348
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,350
No matter what, what happened today is a good thing.

349
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,900
We should wish our superstar Cheng Ming

350
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,780
a successful debut in advance. Here, cheers!

351
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,330
- Cheers! <br>- Here, here. <br>- Cheers.

352
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,870
- You can do it!<br>- Best of luck!

353
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,950
Since everyone's here today, I'm happy.

354
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,790
So I'll share a rap I haven't sung in a while.

355
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,950
I'm going to start. Don't laugh at me.

356
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,500
Hey! Yo! Everyone is here and happy, Wei Feng isn't here.

357
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,800
Cheng Ming lives in melancholy, looking out the window.

358
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,950
You Zhiqi looks at Cheng Ming with excitement.

359
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,220
Qu Shiyun's not in the mood to eat.

360
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,490
Zhang Yiyong is currently serving food to Fang Yali.

361
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,010
It's a good script.

362
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,690
Professor, I love it.

363
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,920
I hope you hurry and refer me to meet them. I want to invest in them.

364
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,290
Plus, I want to see their graduation show.

365
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,120
It's all about youngsters chasing their dreams.

366
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,650
This script

367
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,310
makes me think of when I was young.

368
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,510
I want to have this film.

369
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,860
You're so impatient.

370
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,950
I'll arrange it for you. The child is good.

371
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,580
His name is Ding Dongdong. You must guide him well.

372
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,440
Rest assured, professor. You just worry about setting things up.

373
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,460
When I see potential, I get impatient.

374
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,470
Dongnan,

375
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,010
about Amy,

376
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,570
what are your thoughts?

377
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,150
After all, she's worked so hard looking for you all these years.

378
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,380
She's about to graduate,

379
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,220
you don't intent to come and watch?

380
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,160
- Professor Li. <br> - Wei Feng?

381
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,860
What's the matter? Come in.

382
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,810
There are still come questions about the admission information that I wanted to check with you.

383
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,360
Professor, since you have some work to do, I'll take my leave.

384
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,180
Don't be in a rush to leave. Let me introduce you.

385
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,310
This is Wei Feng, Amy's friend.

386
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,610
Hello.

387
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,170
Wei Feng, this is Mi Dongnan.

388
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,190
He's my student and Amy's father.

389
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,080
I know you've been helping Amy look for him.

390
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,450
Since you met, you should have a good chat.

391
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,460
Go ahead and ask what you want to ask.

392
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,510
Amy has been looking for you for four years.

393
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,930
Why don't you want to meet her?

394
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,300
Because of Amy's mom.

395
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,350
When she decided to go abroad that year,

396
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,760
I was a poor rascal at that time.

397
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,810
I didn't have the capability to give her the life she deserves.

398
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,320
Do you think now is a good time to disturb their lives?

399
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,090
But Amy has always wanted to see you.

400
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,030
As her father, shouldn't you give her an explanation?

401
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,190
All these years, I've actually been monitoring them.

402
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,850
It just...

403
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,690
without Amy's mother's agreement,

404
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,370
I can't just insert myself into her life.

405
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,720
All right, all done.

406
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,920
Daughter,

407
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,820
I made all these dishes,

408
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,320
are all your favorites.

409
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,070
Dad, your cooking skills is awesome.

410
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,640
Have some soup.

411
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,690
- You've worked hard. <br>- It's nothing.

412
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,470
Take a look,

413
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,380
doesn't our daughter look skinner now?

414
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,030
You're being silly, she's gain some weight.

415
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,270
- Did she? <br>- Tell us.

416
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,850
Why did you suddenly come back home?

417
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,360
What else? She's just coming to visit her home.

418
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,980
I gave birth to her, I can tell.

419
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,490
Since she's entered the house she has been very anxious.

420
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,360
Ming Ming, did You Zhiqi do something...

421
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,750
He dares?

422
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,280
If he dares to bully our Ming Ming, I'll go to the school right now and give him a good beating!

423
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,830
And then afterwards you won't have to be with him.

424
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,700
Dad, Mom, I came back to discuss something with you.

425
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,770
What? Tell me.

426
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,680
It is that Director Lin is casting for 'A Moment of time'. Did you knew about this?

427
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,750
It is all over the internet!

428
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,680
This Director Lin is someone who I admire a lot.

429
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,500
I have seen all his films. My girl, what is it?

430
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,870
This is very comical. The casting

431
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,660
must already be done.

432
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,080
I went for an interview.

433
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,920
Did you get turned down?

434
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,470
I passed.

435
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,200
You passed?

436
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,390
She passed it.

437
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,730
- What? <br>- I got the second female lead.

438
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,990
Did you hear? Did you hear her?

439
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,170
Our daughter is amazing!

440
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,800
My girl, when later on you will join the group,

441
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,510
I'll come to meet the actors and also click a photo with Director Lin.

442
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,900
Isn't it great? I'll finally get to meet my idol.

443
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,570
What are you saying? Didn't you think properly?

444
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,780
She is studying musical theater. How can she act?

445
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,270
Director Lin is amazing! I have seen all his works.

446
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,500
-But right now she is just a student.<br>-Child actors also work and grow up this way.

447
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,120
Mom! Dad!

448
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,600
Please don't quarrel! Mom!

449
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,050
Don't quarrel!

450
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,790
I haven't yet decided if I should or shouldn't do it.

451
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,300
If I go then I'll have to give up on performing in the Chinese Opera prepared for our graduation.

452
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,530
So right now even I am very confused.

453
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,900
I don't know what to choose.

454
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,270
From the bottom of my heart I hope that you can go.

455
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,350
Now, you have grown up.

456
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,550
You can make your own decisions.

457
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,220
There is a saying,

458
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,910
Live life like a chess piece and go down without any regrets.

459
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,890
No matter what you choose,

460
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,060
we both will always support you.

461
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,650
Finally, you gave a good reply.

462
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,790
I agree with your father.

463
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,430
Before, I didn't let you take the art entrance exams.

464
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,620
It was just because I was afraid that it would interfere with your good future prospects.

465
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,660
But as these years passed by

466
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,560
I saw that you are pursuing this with determination.

467
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,520
So I have decided

468
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,390
that in the future I won't meddle in your life.

469
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,080
About what was being said just now, don't take it to your heart since

470
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,880
I believe in you.

471
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,570
Dad! Mom!

472
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,850
Thank you!

473
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,090
Why are you being so polite to us?!

474
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,330
So very polite!

475
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,530
-Here, eat this.<br>-Here, eat more!

476
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,460
-Alright!<br>-I'll give you.

477
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,410
Now that you are back home, you must eat a lot! I'll be very happy to see you become healthy.

478
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,910
Here.

479
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,190
Professor Li, what are you doing here?

480
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,770
I saw that the lights were on so came in to check.

481
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,360
Why are you here all alone?

482
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,160
I think that it very quiet when all alone.

483
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,120
Are you bothered by anything?

484
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,500
I got a role as the second female lead in one of Director Lin's films.

485
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,930
But on the other side is the Chinese Opera which all of my classmates have sincerely prepared for our graduation.

486
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:47,400
They all will feel that I cherish more this opportunity of acting in the film.

487
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,280
But I think that the Chinese Opera which we are performing for graduation is also very important.

488
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,490
Right now, I don't know what to do.

489
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,450
Cheng Ming,

490
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,810
There will be many times

491
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,940
when you will find yourself at a crucial point in your life.

492
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Right now your are faced a decision to

493
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,450
find a path that is suitable for you.

494
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,390
From the students who I have taught in these years,

495
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,040
there were some

496
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,720
similar to you who got an opportunity in the industry.

497
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,540
Some became very famous,

498
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,400
some

499
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,560
struggled at the bottom.

500
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,300
Because they didn't have time to practice their skills,

501
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,070
they had to leave musical stage

502
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,720
and couldn't find an opportunity to perform on stage.

503
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,380
But if you choose this opera,

504
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,430
you will become an opera performer

505
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,900
and will also complete your studies.

506
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,990
You should think about this carefully.

507
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:49,190
Which it is that you want to do the most.

508
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,480
Thank you Professor Li! I know what I should choose.

509
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,210
Cheng Ming!

510
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,840
-Professor Li, you are also here.<br>-Yes,

511
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,820
I was just on my way back when I saw Cheng Ming sitting here. So I just came here to talk to her.

512
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,970
I was just thinking about how to comfort you.

513
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,280
But looks like you have already found your answer.

514
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,890
Now I already know what I have to do.
