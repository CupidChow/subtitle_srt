1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,850
(Kang Tae Oh)

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,920
(Kim Se Jeong)

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,520
(Lee Sin Young)

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,390
(Hong Su Zu)

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,060
(Jin Goo)

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,630
(Nam Gi Ae)

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,370
(And Kim Nam Hee)

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,049
(Moon River)

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,380
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,680
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,790
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,760
This is a rare tea, a gift from my father.

13
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,300
Royal Mother!

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,670
Royal Mother!

15
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,300
Is anyone out there? Summon the Royal Physician now!

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Royal Mother!

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,510
The traitor, Crown Princess Gang...

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,710
who assassinated the Queen, is to be deposed...

19
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,450
and demoted to the status of a commoner.

20
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,260
So, Your Highness,

21
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,500
you must not be swayed by pity or curiosity.

22
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,070
What do you mean by that?

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,270
You have a long and an arduous road ahead.

24
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,710
Take care on your journey.

25
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,130
Why are you here?

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,930
Because I missed you.

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,430
I no longer wish to see you, Your Royal Highness.

28
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,340
I despise the royals that killed mine, the palace,

29
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,270
and you, Your Royal Highness, who will become its master.

30
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,510
So,

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,680
never come here again.

32
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,620
Do you really mean that?

33
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,000
I do.

34
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,500
Then I will give it all up.

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,510
Yes.

36
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,440
That is a wise decision.

37
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,480
This worthless title of Crown Prince...

38
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,220
I have no desire or ambition for it whatsoever.

39
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,590
If there is one thing I have ever truly desired,

40
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,760
it is you and you alone.

41
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,930
So please,

42
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,500
you must remain my heart's one desire.

43
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,100
Please...

44
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,010
do not abandon me.

45
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,510
Yeon Wol.

46
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,050
Please leave.

47
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,950
No!

48
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,190
I will come back, and I will follow you anywhere.

49
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,590
We will, no matter what,

50
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,530
be together!

51
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,870
I am told you are looking after the Crown Princess.

52
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,309
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,980
She is a traitor who killed the Queen.

54
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,350
By taking care of a criminal like her,

55
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,480
you could lose your life as well. Do you know that?

56
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,220
I do not care.

57
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,690
I made a promise to protect Her Highness...

58
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,420
to her older brother.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,030
In two days,

60
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,570
the Crown Princess will be...

61
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,140
sentenced to death by poison in the late afternoon by my command.

62
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,140
Why are you telling me this?

63
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,580
Deliver this letter to the Crown Princess.

64
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,680
This is a letter from His Majesty.

66
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,450
A Crown Prince has but two paths in life.

67
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,060
To ascend the throne, or to die.

68
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,130
The Crown Prince plans to abandon everything to run away with you.

69
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,930
So, for the Prince's sake, you must let the world believe you are dead.

70
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,740
Go far away, and live the rest of your life as if you were dead.

71
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,110
His Majesty will sentence you to death by poison.

72
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,580
You must flee at once, Your Highness.

73
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,980
Why would I run away?

74
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,350
I am innocent.

75
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,720
If I run, it will be an admission that I killed the Royal Mother.

76
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
But...

77
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,020
I did not.

78
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,390
I know.

79
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,600
But who is going to believe you now?

80
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,670
If I run away,

81
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,180
His Royal Highness will stop at nothing to find me.

82
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,750
A Crown Prince looking for the wife who assassinated his own mother.

83
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,720
How could he possibly survive?

84
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,230
Your Highness.

85
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,460
For now, just think about yourself.

86
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,010
Fine.

87
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,340
I will think only of myself.

88
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,550
Can you arrange where I will go...

89
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,080
and how I will get there?

90
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Yes, Your Highness.

91
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,820
As long as His Royal Highness is safe, I can be at peace.

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,430
Who are you?

93
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,899
You fell into the water,

94
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,670
and it seems you have lost your memory.

95
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,910
Your name is Park Dal,

96
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,210
and I am your aunt.

97
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,110
Park...

98
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Dal...

99
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,250
That is me.

100
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,890
Hong Nan...

101
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,060
Why did you deceive me?

102
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,130
Why would you do that?

103
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Wait.

104
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,870
Go get my brother and his wife.

105
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,970
Hurry! Go get them!

106
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,780
Okay.

107
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,000
Have your memories...

108
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,670
returned?

109
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,780
In bits and pieces...

110
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,980
Just fragments.

111
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,720
So does that mean...

112
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,020
I am really Gang Yeon Wol?

113
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,660
Yes.

114
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,130
I know you are confused,

115
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,160
but you must accept it, Your Highness.

116
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,200
It is not about whether I accept it or not.

117
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,940
In the memories of Park Dal that you told me about five years ago,

118
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,470
I do not recognize a single face,

119
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,580
But the faces in the memories flooding back to me are so vivid.

120
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,750
I know that these are my real memories,

121
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
and that I...

122
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,690
am Gang Yeon Wol.

123
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,590
My head gets that,

124
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,359
but those are just memories.

125
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
I have been Park Dal my whole life.

126
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,800
I am so confused. I cannot tell what is real anymore.

127
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,310
Your Highness, of course you are confused.

128
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,470
But we are out of time.

129
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,110
You have to run.

130
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,510
Run? What do you mean?

131
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,950
His Majesty plans to have you declared dead again.

132
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,190
Declared dead?

133
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,260
He is going to set fire to the royal quarters...

134
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,600
and prepare a similar body to be found inside.

135
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,170
You will be officially recorded...

136
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,830
as having died in the blaze.

137
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,300
As if drowning was not enough,

138
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,640
now you expect me to live my life afraid of fire too?

139
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,879
And I am supposed to live like that...

140
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
after shattering His Highness' heart again?

141
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,580
No, I cannot do that! I have to go to the palace!

142
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,920
You cannot! Brother, stop her!

143
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,220
Why are you all doing this?

144
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,990
Your Highness, please. Just give up.

145
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,600
You have to leave.

146
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,000
I know it is hard now, but this will all pass.

147
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,440
Time will keep moving, and it heals all wounds.

148
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,940
Brother, take Her Highness.

149
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
Stop crying.

150
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,490
They said you will die if you go back now.

151
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,430
If I just leave like this,

152
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,370
what about His Royal Highness?

153
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,900
For the last five years,

154
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,670
I have made him live in a nightmare.

155
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,740
And you want me to put him back in that nightmare again?

156
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,110
I cannot do that.

157
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,250
I just cannot.

158
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,490
- I just cannot do it. - Goodness.

159
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,290
Does it pain you that much?

160
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,060
Goodness.

161
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,630
You cannot just turn off feelings for someone.

162
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,770
Time heals all wounds.

163
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,100
But that is only if you let time pass.

164
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,280
How can you heal if you keep reliving that day?

165
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,580
Your Highness.

166
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,030
- What do you think you are doing? - I am sorry, Hong Nan.

167
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,070
Go on, Dal!

168
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,569
Today is the day for lovers.

169
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,340
We will be your bridge to him.

170
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,010
What are you waiting for? The bridge will be gone!

171
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,980
- Go on, hurry! - Go!

172
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,180
No!

173
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,850
- Your Highness! - Go on!

174
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,250
- Let me go! - Go.

175
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,750
I am a crow! Go!

176
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,660
- Your Highness! - Go on!

177
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,490
- Go! - Your Highness!

178
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,700
- Dal! - Go on!

179
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,270
Your Highness!

180
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Your Highness!

181
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,240
Do you two have any idea what you have just done?

182
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,480
Your emotions got the better of you and sent Dal to her death!

183
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,349
She would rather die. We had no choice.

184
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,120
If she feels that way, she must go.

185
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,380
How can you act so detached?

186
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,350
I know you are not her birth parents,

187
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,260
- but you raised her for five years! - But, Hong Nan!

188
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,260
It is her life, is it not?

189
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,230
A parent can die for their child,

190
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,730
but they cannot live their child's life for them.

191
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
That is right.

192
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,670
You are still hung up on a promise you made to your lost love.

193
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,110
Imagine Dal leaving a living love.

194
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,480
- Brother. - We know from experience.

195
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,310
- Some loves are worth dying for. - Exactly.

196
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,620
What can we do? They are so in love.

197
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,350
It makes them blind to everything else.

198
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,390
What a fool.

199
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Me?

200
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,100
Not you.

201
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,130
That foolish girl.

202
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,830
Why did she have to leave?

203
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,670
Why did she have to die?

204
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,240
She must have been so lost...

205
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,210
and then some.

206
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,780
Who are you talking about?

207
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,650
Gang Yeon Wol.

208
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Right.

209
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,360
I am done overthinking it.

210
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,460
His Royal Highness is fighting a war every single day.

211
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,300
He must be torn apart over that secret pact.

212
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,240
I cannot just sit here in a daze because some memories are back.

213
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,010
Your Highness. I do not understand a single word you are saying.

214
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,350
You do not have to. It is all nonsense anyway.

215
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,619
First, I must go to the throne hall.

216
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,020
Wait. Your Highness.

217
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,020
You cannot just go see His Majesty whenever you please.

218
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,290
- You must be summoned first... - He is going to summon me anyway.

219
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,100
This just saves us some time. From now on, it is an emergency.

220
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,970
Wait...

221
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,640
All right.

222
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,110
As a matter of fact, I was about to send for you.

223
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,840
What were you thinking coming back here?

224
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,940
Did they not tell you who you are?

225
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,450
They told me.

226
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,280
- Most of my memory has returned. - Then you should have run away.

227
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,590
- Why would you come back? - Why would I run away?

228
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,260
The Left State Councilor will stop at nothing to kill you.

229
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,230
Yes, you are right, Your Majesty.

230
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,760
The Left State Councilor wants me dead regardless of my title.

231
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,370
He is desperate enough to bring a false witness before the King,

232
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,140
and his men are all over the country.

233
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,640
If he is already set on killing me,

234
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,610
would it not be easier for him to do it outside the palace?

235
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,150
But...

236
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,580
it is only a matter of time before he learns who you really are.

237
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,119
Exactly. Running away now...

238
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,720
is admitting I am the Crown Princess.

239
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,490
Why would I give him that kind of leverage?

240
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,620
After that humiliation at the interrogation ground,

241
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,830
he cannot use a witness to prove who I am anymore.

242
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,830
He needs hard evidence to prove that I am the Crown Princess,

243
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,400
and where would he ever find that?

244
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,900
The Left State Councilor...

245
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,270
is a terrifying man.

246
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,370
He will stop at nothing to kill you.

247
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,310
Then the Crown Prince...

248
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,610
will risk his life to protect you,

249
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,920
and I still remain incompetent and powerless as ever,

250
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,250
unable to protect either of you.

251
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,390
Nothing has changed since five years ago.

252
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,590
Nothing has changed at all.

253
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,860
No.

254
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,000
I have changed.

255
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,880
I am not the same Yeon Wol who quietly vanished five years ago.

256
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,850
Whether I have my memories back or not,

257
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,820
I am going to stay right by His Royal Highness's side...

258
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,450
and spend the rest of my life with him.

259
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,790
I am Park Dal now.

260
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,100
I am not leaving...

261
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,930
His Highness' side, ever.

262
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
As much as I care for His Royal Highness...

263
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,880
No, even more than that.

264
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,880
I know you want to protect him too, Your Majesty.

265
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,650
Do not let fear make you think only of His Highness' physical safety.

266
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,890
For once...

267
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,290
Just this once,

268
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,200
please think about how His Highness feels.

269
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,670
Please?

270
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,110
For the past five years,

271
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,939
His Highness has been tormented by guilt,

272
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,350
living every single day in his own personal nightmare.

273
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,120
His Highness has only just started to breathe again.

274
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,450
Will you send him back to despair to drown all over again,

275
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,860
Royal Father?

276
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,730
(Chapter 11: There Is No Paradise in Running Away)

277
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Ever since he was captured at Jemulpo,

278
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,410
he has done nothing but drink.

279
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,620
Are you just going to keep this up?

280
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,090
I do not know...

281
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,290
how else to be.

282
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Snap out of it!

283
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,390
Give it here.

284
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,330
No. You are already drunk.

285
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,930
What good would sobering up do me?

286
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,880
U Hui is confined to the Detached Palace, is she not?

287
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,950
By rule, a royal consort is to remain in the Detached Palace.

288
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,320
That is right.

289
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,450
The palace has always been one giant prison, after all.

290
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,820
I told our Royal Father to abdicate the throne.

291
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,630
Abdicate?

292
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,789
The Left State Councilor's only hold on Father...

293
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,130
is because of the secret pact.

294
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,600
If he admits the coup had no just cause...

295
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,130
and abdicates the throne to you,

296
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,299
you, as the Late King's true heir,

297
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,940
will have the authority to punish the Left State Councilor.

298
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,210
You want me...

299
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,710
to sit on the throne?

300
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,679
The bloody throne that killed my mother...

301
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,620
and got me exiled?

302
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
And then what?

303
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,220
Who would I have left by my side?

304
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,430
After casting you and His Majesty out,

305
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,130
and stand by and watch U Hui, branded a traitor's daughter,

306
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,330
why should I have to live on, sitting on that agonizing throne?

307
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,240
If that is the price,

308
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,970
I would rather not have revenge at all.

309
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Un.

310
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,510
Look at this mess the Left State Councilor has caused.

311
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,480
If it were not for him, everyone would be happy.

312
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
The Left State Councilor...

313
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,620
Can we not just kill him?

314
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,960
If it were that easy, I would have done it long ago.

315
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,260
The Left State Councilor is surrounded by his personal guards,

316
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,860
and in the palace, the Royal Guard protects him, not my Royal Father.

317
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,170
And his own martial arts skill is formidable.

318
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,100
Honestly, he is a legend among the military cadets.

319
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,010
Exactly.

320
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,410
Things would be so simple if he were just gone.

321
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,780
Just wait.

322
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,710
If you despise the thought of taking the throne that much,

323
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,950
- I will find another way. - Is there another way?

324
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,650
Gang,

325
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,690
do not do anything. Just...

326
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,130
stay out of it.

327
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,610
Your Highness.

328
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,580
I am fine.

329
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,080
You are not fine. You have been acting odd all day.

330
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,050
Maybe you have heatstroke?

331
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,250
I guess so.

332
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,860
It has not rained,

333
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,190
and the sun is so strong.

334
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,160
I must have heatstroke.

335
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
This will not do.

336
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,970
Please sit and rest for a bit.

337
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,109
Your Highness, I will get you some cool water.

338
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,410
Please just sit here for a moment.

339
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,180
I have missed you, my love.

340
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,390
Your Highness, here is your water.

341
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Yeon Sim.

342
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,130
Yes?

343
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,160
Today,

344
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,330
my mind has been a total mess,

345
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,340
and I could not make sense of anything.

346
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,270
I know. That is why you should drink this.

347
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
But...

348
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,350
there is one thing I know for sure now.

349
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,120
I have to see His Royal Highness right now.

350
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,390
Oh, gosh! Wait!

351
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,110
Dal. What are you doing here?

352
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,150
No!

353
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,060
I will come back, and I will follow you anywhere.

354
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,320
We will, no matter what,

355
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,330
be together!

356
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,190
I am here so we can be together.

357
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,510
Please do not tell His Highness that my memory has returned.

358
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,750
He is already going through so much as it is.

359
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,580
I do not want to give him more reason to worry.

360
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,490
And I know I have no right to ask,

361
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,660
but please look after my family.

362
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,900
Head Eunuch Park.

363
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,740
Disguise reliable Royal Guards as servants at Unjeong Palace...

364
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,450
and have them protect the Crown Princess's family.

365
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,850
The Left State Councilor must not get his hands on her family.

366
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,160
Then will you keep the Crown Princess in the palace?

367
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,990
If I fail to protect her again,

368
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,830
my son, Gang, will be broken.

369
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,800
The kids have changed in the past five years,

370
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,410
so I must change as well as the adult.

371
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,890
His Majesty...

372
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,490
sent the Royal Guards to Unjeong Palace?

373
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,160
Yes. The Royal Concubine's family is staying at Unjeong Palace,

374
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,900
and Hong Nan, a gisaeng from Eunwol Pavilion,

375
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,200
is said to be the Royal Concubine's aunt.

376
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,800
I did not report it as I was unsure,

377
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,170
but her neighbors said something odd before they died.

378
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,169
They said the Royal Concubine suddenly appeared in Boryeong...

379
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,640
in winter five years ago,

380
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,740
and that she is not, in fact, Lord Heo's wife's niece.

381
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,940
They claim it is all true.

382
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,450
Why are you only telling me this now?

383
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,780
At the time, I thought they lied to save their own skin.

384
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,480
I deserve death.

385
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,950
Round up the Royal Concubine's family and bring them to me.

386
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,019
Forgive me, sir, but Unjeong Palace...

387
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,060
was His Majesty's private residence.

388
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,760
We cannot enter without authorization.

389
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,600
I will find a way.

390
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,140
It seems His Majesty...

391
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,610
still lets his personal feelings get in the way.

392
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,320
All right, time for bed.

393
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,740
What are you doing?

394
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,340
What is it? Can I not look at my own husband?

395
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,410
Is there a problem with that?

396
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,440
No, I mean, I like it,

397
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,980
but you are making me shy.

398
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,920
It is just a little embarrassing, that is all.

399
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
It is making me blush.

400
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,340
Even if you are shy, bear with me. I am making up for lost time.

401
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Making up for what?

402
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Wait...

403
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,040
From now on,

404
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
I am...

405
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,580
going to stick to you like glue, Your Highness.

406
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,350
I am never letting you go.

407
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,030
Is this a signal for tonight?

408
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Maybe tonight...

409
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,870
Stuck like glue...

410
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,540
You little fox.

411
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,540
You can just fall asleep after all that?

412
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,050
I am not a fox...

413
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,350
Then who are you?

414
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,180
What does it matter...

415
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
what I am?

416
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,320
I am just stuck on you.

417
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Stuck on you...

418
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,200
Household Man.

419
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,370
Household Man!

420
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,950
Oh, my, has it gotten so late?

421
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,660
Household Man!

422
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,620
The wind is blowing.

423
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,490
I suppose it has been for a while.

424
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,660
The wind always blows.

425
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,800
That is nothing new.

426
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,130
I suppose you are right.

427
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,140
And yet, even the wind that always blows,

428
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,610
the very air I breathe...

429
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,540
It all feels different to me now.

430
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,610
I cannot remember the last time I could breathe so easily.

431
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,929
Your Highness, what shall I do about the former Chief Royal Secretary...

432
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,170
and the former Chief Court Lady's niece?

433
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,910
Oh, right. With everything going on, I had completely forgotten.

434
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,879
First, exile the former Chief Royal Secretary, and...

435
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,910
Your Royal Highness!

436
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,980
- Goodness. - Gosh.

437
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,650
Dal.

438
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,420
What are you doing here?

439
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,550
I was waiting for you to catch you on your way, Your Highness.

440
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,590
You did not have to. I would have come to you.

441
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,690
You startled me.

442
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,830
I know you are busy with your official duties.

443
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,000
Rather than sit in my room, I wanted to steal a moment with you.

444
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,630
What has gotten into you since yesterday?

445
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,440
Not that I am complaining, of course. Have you eaten?

446
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,410
- Not yet. - Should we go get a bite to eat?

447
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,210
Your Highness.

448
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,649
You were giving your orders on the former Chief Royal Secretary...

449
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,080
and the former Chief Court Lady's niece.

450
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,650
- Please continue. - Right.

451
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,889
Exile the former Chief Royal Secretary,

452
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,890
and make Jo Mi Geum, the sinner, a slave on the island.

453
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:54,760
- Have the Guards tighten security. - Yes, Your Highness.

454
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,060
Your Royal Highness.

455
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,100
If they are sent to separate places of exile,

456
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,370
does that mean they will never see each other again?

457
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,400
I would assume so, yes.

458
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,980
Your Royal Highness, could you do just one thing for me?

459
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
One thing?

460
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,390
Mi Geum.

461
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,820
Mi Geum.

462
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,490
Why did you do that?

463
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,730
You should have just turned me in.

464
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,530
I would rather die than let you die.

465
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,400
Then how am I supposed to live? Mi Geum.

466
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,710
Mi Geum...

467
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,710
- Goodness. Now that is true love. - Mi Geum...

468
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,450
Hey, are you crying?

469
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,350
That is not true love.

470
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,930
What love traps the one left behind in a living nightmare forever?

471
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,300
That is why...

472
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,430
I will never, ever die.

473
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,370
I will not go down without a fight.

474
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,470
Never.

475
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,260
You are right. Let us live.

476
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,560
Let us both live a long life.

477
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,510
My lord, it is your household man.

478
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,510
Come in.

479
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,480
My goodness, what is all this?

480
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,280
Can you not tell just by looking?

481
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,350
They are pinwheels.

482
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,889
No, I mean, why use this expensive colored paper...

483
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,790
to make so many useless pinwheels?

484
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,430
"Useless," you say?

485
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
Do you know...

486
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,040
what I heard more than anything when I was at the palace?

487
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,410
"The child who will be the death of his father."

488
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,940
"The child of the prophecy."

489
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,180
If the Royal Mother were to give birth to a son,

490
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,350
the Royal Father would die.

491
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,880
The Royal Family would fall.

492
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,620
Well, that was the prophecy.

493
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,590
In the end,

494
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,290
it came true, just as it was foretold.

495
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,130
So that means...

496
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,300
I was someone who should have never been born in the first place.

497
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,430
Just like these pinwheels,

498
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,440
I was useless.

499
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,670
Do not say such ridiculous things.

500
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,910
And just have this to sober up and get some sleep.

501
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,040
You are still drunk. That is why you are having ridiculous thoughts.

502
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,610
That is what I like about you.

503
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,620
Yes, my lord.

504
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,849
I like you too, my lord, so drink up.

505
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,650
Drink this, and live a long life.

506
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,130
Your Highness. Please just have one bite.

507
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,840
Are you really trying to starve yourself to death?

508
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,140
Do not worry.

509
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,570
I have no intention of pathetically starving myself to death.

510
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,580
Then why did you stop eating?

511
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,580
Because dying from indigestion is absurd.

512
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,580
How can you be joking right now?

513
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,680
If I were to speak seriously,

514
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,190
- you would probably end up crying. - Why do you say such scary things?

515
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,290
There has been no word from Deok Chun, has there?

516
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,800
No, Your Highness.

517
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,030
He said he was leaving the capital, remember?

518
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,440
But I need to see Deok Chun.

519
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,370
What?

520
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,110
What is going on outside?

521
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,050
Oh, my.

522
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,720
What? What is all that?

523
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,970
I mean, what kind of madman would put these pinwheels at the palace?

524
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,400
- Oh, my. - What is all this?

525
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:43,910
Your Highness.

526
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,170
I will orchestrate your father's downfall,

527
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,640
and all you have to do is hold this ring.

528
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,620
The wind will always blow, so just breathe easy...

529
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,080
and smile often.

530
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,720
You deserve to be happy,

531
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,220
my precious,

532
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,120
my dear U Hui.

533
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,830
U Hui!

534
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Kim U Hui!

535
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,710
Is that not Grand Prince Je Un?

536
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,080
I love you!

537
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,740
I love you, Kim U Hui!

538
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,680
- Seize him! He is over there! - Get him!

539
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,930
What are we going to do?

540
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,300
I think he has really lost his mind.

541
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,470
What was that?

542
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,070
Grand Prince Je Un?

543
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,410
Yes, it was unmistakably him.

544
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,140
I came at once,

545
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,680
fearing what he might do next.

546
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,780
I fear he may have lost his mind.

547
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,350
If he has not lost his mind,

548
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,690
then he must have a death wish.

549
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,870
- Something feels off. - I know, right?

550
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,269
If he were sane, he would not dare say that...

551
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,870
in front of the Detached Palace.

552
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,970
Of course not.

553
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,210
It is not like him at all.

554
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,550
What on earth could he be thinking?

555
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,820
Are you finished, Your Royal Highness?

556
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,050
Yes. Take this royal edict to the Royal Investigation Office,

557
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,219
and have the former Chief Royal Secretary and that court lady...

558
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,560
Your Royal Highness!

559
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,590
What is it now? What?

560
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,660
Grand Prince Je Un made a scene in front of the Detached Palace.

561
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,600
A scene? What kind?

562
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,740
He was shouting the Crown Princess Consort's name over and over,

563
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:25,740
screamed, "I love you," and made a huge scene.

564
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,380
Seriously, what on earth is wrong with him?

565
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,110
Does he have a death wish or something?

566
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,550
Look at this mess the Left State Councilor has caused.

567
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,650
If it were not for him, everyone would be happy.

568
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,620
The Left State Councilor...

569
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,760
Can we not just kill him?

570
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,960
Gang, do not do anything. Just...

571
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,130
stay out of it.

572
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,610
Left State Councilor!

573
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:57,830
Who goes there?

574
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,010
Stand back.

575
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,410
If any of you interfere in this fight,

576
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,850
I will cut you down myself.

577
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,610
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

578
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,120
I thought you had lost your mind,

579
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,090
but it seems you have simply lost your will to live.

580
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,920
That is because...

581
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,530
you took away my reason for living.

582
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,010
You have quite the romantic streak.

583
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:17,880
Your escape,

584
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,920
the scene at the Detached Palace,

585
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,450
and your last wish just now.

586
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,260
I am not finished.

587
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,870
The more I think about it,

588
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,580
the more I am convinced I must kill you.

589
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,270
- My lord! - Stay back.

590
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,440
Die.

591
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:22,780
Die!

592
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,080
Die!

593
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,520
- Je Un! - Grand Prince!

594
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,860
- Let go! Let me go! - Get Je Un out of here!

595
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,500
- Yes, Your Royal Highness! - I said, let go!

596
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,840
Let me go. Let go!

597
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,010
Left State Councilor!

598
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,540
Left State Councilor!

599
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,640
Left State Councilor!

600
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,580
Let go! Let go of me!

601
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,250
- My lord. - Left State Councilor...

602
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,150
Left State Councilor!

603
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,090
Left State Councilor!

604
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,840
Though it was not my intention,

605
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,500
I now owe you my life.

606
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,420
Why did you go easy on him?

607
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,220
I guess...

608
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,590
my blade hesitated.

609
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,970
So, shall we pretend today never happened either?

610
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,870
I would appreciate that.

611
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,440
The more secrets we share,

612
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,780
the closer we become, Your Royal Highness.

613
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,380
Just like...

614
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,450
His Majesty and I.

615
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,250
Speaking of which,

616
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,520
if I were to die,

617
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,290
someone else will release the secret pact.

618
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,930
I just thought you should know.

619
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,560
I appreciate the information.

620
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,950
- Let go of me! - Please calm down, my lord.

621
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,820
- Please! - No, you cannot.

622
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,780
- Just let me... - You cannot, my lord.

623
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,760
Did you not know killing the Left State Councilor meant execution?

624
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:49,730
Do you think I came here without knowing that?

625
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,930
Why did you stop me? Why?

626
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:02,570
So this is the brilliant plan you made after drinking for days?

627
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,640
To kill the Left State Councilor and die along with him?

628
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:08,710
Yes.

629
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,910
Everyone knows this fight is over when the Left State Councilor dies.

630
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,180
If only he dies!

631
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:20,260
The abdication stops, and U Hui will not be a traitor's daughter!

632
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,060
Then what about me?

633
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,730
And the woman you love?

634
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,200
How is Kim U Hui supposed to live?

635
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,470
I...

636
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,210
I want to live too.

637
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,610
I want to live a happy life with U Hui. But...

638
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,620
there is no other way, is there?

639
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:58,730
Je Un.

640
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,460
If a path is blocked, we will force it open.

641
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,400
If there is no path, we will make one.

642
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,540
You would rather die than ascend the throne,

643
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,370
and I would rather die than let you die,

644
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,180
So, let us...

645
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,740
find another way.

646
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,950
Let us survive this.

647
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,490
Let us live, Je Un.

648
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:43,640
If you give the order, we will go and capture Grand Prince Je Un.

649
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:45,770
I let him go.

650
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,410
Why do you always show such mercy to Grand Prince Je Un?

651
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,180
Bring me a drink.

652
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,020
Here you are.

653
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:09,260
But I thought you never touched alcohol?

654
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,600
You may leave now.

655
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,400
Yes, my lord.

656
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,680
Am I not...

657
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,290
fighting a losing battle?

658
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:15,760
What? Even if he was blinded by rage,

659
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,100
what was he thinking, going to the Left State Councilor's house alone?

660
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,530
He went there to die.

661
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:24,110
That Grand Prince Je Un really needs a good scolding.

662
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,910
He has no regard for his own life.

663
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,380
I am the one who should be scolded.

664
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,010
Me and my Royal Father.

665
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,879
You are blaming yourself again.

666
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,520
No, I am not. It is damage control.

667
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,790
It seems our path is blocked,

668
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,320
so I am going to force it open.

669
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,420
Do you have a plan?

670
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,730
The Left State Councilor said his death releases the secret pact.

671
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:48,760
So he gave it to someone else for safekeeping.

672
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,930
You have anyone in mind?

673
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:52,330
Choraengi Mask.

674
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,040
Kim Deok Chun.

675
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,140
She is the most likely suspect.

676
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:58,840
Who is Kim Deok Chun?

677
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,480
She was the daughter of a slave in the Left State Councilor's home.

678
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,480
She was a female Royal Physician.

679
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,650
So she was right under our noses this whole time.

680
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,850
So the Left State Councilor must have given Kim Deok Chun something.

681
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,860
But is Choraengi Mask not in hiding?

682
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,660
Then we will find her.

683
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,460
We got through a collapsed cave. We are capable of anything.

684
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:23,570
I will start by digging into the Cheonghye Merchant Guild.

685
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,300
The Cheonghye Merchant Guild?

686
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:30,110
Did Choraengi Mask use that guild to import the Jimjo feed?

687
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,410
Since it is a merchant guild,

688
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,510
we can just find them through the Hanyang Merchant Guild.

689
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:40,480
As Head Merchant, he knows all guilds inside and out.

690
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,130
Come to the Royal Office of Attire by tomorrow afternoon.

691
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,530
I am looking for a way to defeat the Left State Councilor.

692
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,570
Is that what you call a disguise?

693
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,110
Gosh, you!

694
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:14,150
Have you lost your mind? I know you want the tiger, but this?

695
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:17,520
If you go into the tiger's den alone on a suicide mission,

696
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,590
what are the rest of us going to do?

697
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,920
What?

698
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,190
When His Highness told me about it yesterday,

699
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,330
my heart just dropped. Did you know that?

700
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,570
I am sorry to have worried you, Your Highness.

701
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,670
Do not dare die.

702
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,510
No matter how cruel and twisted this world gets,

703
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:41,510
do not just give in and die.

704
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,880
When you are dead, you cannot remember those you love,

705
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,250
and those who remember you can no longer hold you.

706
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,650
What a terrible waste that would be.

707
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,560
And so unfair.

708
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
So...

709
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,770
do not throw it all away.

710
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,810
Let us stay alive.

711
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,410
Okay?

712
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,380
Hold it right there.

713
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,520
- Gang. - Your Royal Highness.

714
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,430
Are you just going to keep staring?

715
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,470
Do not mind me. I am just...

716
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,670
a sitting sticky rice cake. Just think of me that way.

717
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,840
I see.

718
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:52,010
Would not a sitting sticky rice cake be even more distracting?

719
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,290
So,

720
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:02,660
what about the thing I asked you to check?

721
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,030
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

722
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:06,960
According to the Head Merchant,

723
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,700
the Cheonghye Guild was made by the men from The Nameless...

724
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,900
as a front for smuggling.

725
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,100
The Nameless?

726
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,240
Yes. They are called The Nameless because they have no name...

727
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,410
and also because they shun the light.

728
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:21,109
Your Highness, they use loan-sharking for human trafficking,

729
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,579
do all kinds of smuggling, and counterfeit coins.

730
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,410
They will do anything for money.

731
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,780
- They are just vile scoundrels. - They are lower than animals.

732
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,990
Then how are scoundrels like that still at large?

733
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:33,860
According to the Head Merchant,

734
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,220
the Left State Councilor is apparently their backer.

735
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,830
The Left State Councilor?

736
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,600
In fact, they have already ruined the market economy,

737
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,530
so the Head Merchant wanted to teach them a lesson,

738
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,900
but even for a man as powerful as the Head Merchant,

739
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,400
the Police Bureau will not listen to him. This clearly...

740
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,940
means their backer must be someone equal to the Left State Councilor.

741
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:55,540
Back off. Unless you want to lose your heads.

742
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,280
They either have a death wish,

743
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,080
or they follow orders without question.

744
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,990
Do you suspect something?

745
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,300
Shin Won, do you remember what the Sinjusa assassins were wearing?

746
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,440
Yes.

747
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:26,370
Now that you mention it, the Left State Councilor's men at Jemulpo...

748
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,910
and Sinjusa assassins wore the same clothes, did they not?

749
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,880
My thoughts exactly.

750
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,050
The Choraengi Mask wore the same outfits too.

751
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,920
It means the Crown Princess Consort must know something.

752
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,549
The Detached Palace is too guarded.

753
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,890
We cannot reach the Crown Princess Consort, can we?

754
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,630
That is the problem.

755
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,570
I will do it.

756
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,900
Getting to the Crown Princess Consort,

757
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:54,640
I will do it.

758
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,970
Do you have a plan?

759
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,880
If one road is blocked, there is always another way around.

760
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,860
Your Majesty. Did you rest well last night?

761
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,590
What is it now?

762
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,860
It is a surprise that you came to pay your respects.

763
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,070
Since I...

764
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,270
started living in the palace,

765
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,970
I have found the life of a royal woman to be terribly dull.

766
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,970
So naturally, you came to mind, Your Majesty.

767
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,210
You must want something from me.

768
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,580
Your Majesty, that i hurtful.

769
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:40,110
How can you twist my pure intentions like that?

770
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,450
Search your heart.

771
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,090
Have you ever once...

772
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,160
come to me out of the goodness of your heart?

773
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,570
Gosh. They do not just let anyone be the Queen Dowager, right?

774
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:00,600
Your insight is incredible, as always.

775
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,310
Gosh, you and your flattery.

776
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:06,870
All right, then.

777
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,880
Since you are here, let us hear it.

778
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:12,910
How will you amuse me today?

779
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,920
You know I used to be a peddler, right?

780
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,990
From my travels all over the eight provinces,

781
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,620
I have collected a lot of juicy stories.

782
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,529
Do not dare.

783
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:28,830
How dare you bring vulgar stories into the palace?

784
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:34,740
So, the physician, her husband, and that homewrecker... I mean,

785
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,840
they went to the mistress's family home?

786
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:40,110
Yes. The physician, bold as brass, said,

787
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,910
"Your daughter has been sleeping with my husband."

788
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,550
And then,

789
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:48,820
the mistress slapped the physician across the face.

790
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,620
My goodness.

791
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,690
The shameless hussy! And the husband?

792
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,330
What did the husband do?

793
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,860
He grabbed the physician by the hand,

794
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,030
and as he was dragging her out, he yelled,

795
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:10,270
"Is it a crime to be in love?"

796
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:12,440
Can you believe the nerve?

797
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:14,840
That worthless scoundrel!

798
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,850
So there was this good-for-nothing freeloader,

799
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:24,289
who fell for his wife's best friend, whom she had taken in!

800
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:25,290
Her friend?

801
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:26,749
After he kicked out his devoted wife,

802
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,259
her sister saw them getting groceries at the market,

803
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,760
being all lovey-dovey.

804
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,290
When the wife's sister saw that, she would just see red, would she not?

805
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:34,800
She certainly would.

806
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:38,600
So she went to confront them, and the mistress dared to say,

807
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,640
"Have some class." So the sister totally snapped.

808
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,240
"Class?"

809
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:49,680
"This is my class!" Then she grabbed her hair...

810
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:53,780
and started yanking her head left and right.

811
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,250
- Left, right. - That is the way!

812
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:01,090
Left.

813
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,460
Right.

814
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,400
Becoming a supportive wife...

815
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:18,910
is so darn hard.

816
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,550
What?

817
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:26,910
Ye Na is Seon Jeong's daughter?

818
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:28,450
Yes.

819
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:34,460
Now that it is out that Ye Na is Seon Jeong's daughter,

820
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:39,460
maybe it is time you did me that favor.

821
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:47,300
My patience has run out. That is why you are here.

822
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,440
You are to be the Crown Princess of this nation.

823
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:53,070
And yet, you act so thoughtlessly?

824
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,410
Is this how your father raised you?

825
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:59,180
Crown Princess Consort, you need to reflect on your conduct.

826
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,140
- I need to ask you something first. - Do not worry.

827
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,180
Grand Prince Je Un is safe.

828
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,210
But how did you know I was going to ask about him?

829
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:35,020
They say only one who has been in love can recognize it.

830
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:38,090
The feeling of being madly in love but forced to be apart...

831
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,650
You think I would not understand that?

832
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:44,190
All right, let us get down to business.

833
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,900
The assassins operating at Sinjusa.

834
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,100
Are they part of The Nameless?

835
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,870
And the Choraengi Mask, Kim Deok Chun.

836
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:59,570
- Is she one of them too? - How do you know that?

837
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,909
We are short on time. Let us get to the point.

838
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,480
Where is their base?

839
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:05,810
I only know what Deok Chun told me, so I am not sure,

840
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,950
but I heard they have branches in all four corners of the country.

841
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,650
I think I might have heard something about a mountain fortress.

842
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,350
A mountain fortress.

843
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,560
Anything else unusual about them?

844
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:21,600
Like when Choraengi Mask went there, maybe it took a few days,

845
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,970
or maybe she often bought something. Anything like that.

846
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,699
She would often bring her sick mother...

847
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,500
chestnut honey and some liquor.

848
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:31,470
Chestnut honey?

849
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:34,710
What kind of liquor?

850
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,710
I think it might have been pine needle wine.

851
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:45,450
Is it songyeopju?

852
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,050
Could it be Yangju?

853
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,459
- What? - Yangju chestnuts...

854
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:52,360
are famous enough to be offered as royal tribute.

855
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,960
Songyeopju is the signature liquor of the Yeosan Song clan in Yangju.

856
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,700
I guess I should tell them to search Yangju first.

857
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:06,310
If you find Deok Chun, please tell her to come see me.

858
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,510
Tell her I have something urgent to discuss about her mother.

859
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,450
Forgive me. We still have not gotten the Royal Concubine's family...

860
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,550
out of Unjeong Palace.

861
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:20,320
What about the head of Eunwol Pavilion?

862
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,459
We have not made contact with them.

863
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,390
Hong Nan was in hiding.

864
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:29,300
So why would she suddenly appear at Eunwol Pavilion?

865
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,630
I will capture Eunwol Pavilion's head at once.

866
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:43,010
There were dozens of assassins at Sinjusa alone.

867
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:45,610
This organization must be massive.

868
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,220
If they have branches across all eight provinces,

869
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,080
this is no small-scale operation.

870
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,790
There must be hundreds of them, at least.

871
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:57,430
The Nameless. A group so large is basically a private army.

872
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,430
This is treason.

873
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,600
According to this letter from Dal,

874
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,830
the Choraengi Mask is in Yangju,

875
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,800
and The Nameless are in a mountain fortress.

876
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:09,270
Let us search the nearby mountains. We are bound to find something.

877
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,940
Should I grab a map on the way, then?

878
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,240
I saw a stall selling them on our way here.

879
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,919
- What can I help you find? - We are headed to the mountains.

880
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,650
- The mountains? Which ones? - Hey.

881
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,519
- It is right here. - Those mountains.

882
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,890
- Let us see. - It is marked plain as day.

883
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,700
- Here we go. This should do. - How much for this?

884
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,730
His Majesty?

885
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,909
If she rashly escapes, it could give...

886
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:49,340
the Left State Councilor the pretext he needs,

887
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,180
so for now, I intend to keep the Royal Concubine here.

888
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,920
From the moment you brought the royal guards to Unjeong Palace,

889
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,690
it shows...

890
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,250
that you are worried, Your Majesty.

891
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:05,630
You have only ever cared about His Highness.

892
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,960
You never thought of Her Highness, the Crown Princess.

893
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,300
And now, because you are worried His Royal Highness might get hurt,

894
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,370
are you going to send Her Highness to her death all over again?

895
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,570
Yes.

896
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,840
Just as you said, my son is my only concern.

897
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,050
However, the Crown Princess is his only concern.

898
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,150
Therefore, the Crown Princess...

899
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,720
No.

900
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,590
Protecting the Royal Concubine...

901
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,290
is how I protect...

902
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,700
the Crown Prince, my son.

903
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:50,070
Gang.

904
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:52,210
What...

905
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:56,610
What in the world are you talking about?

906
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,350
What do you mean the Royal Concubine...

907
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,190
is the Crown Princess?

908
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,560
- It is just... - Tell me what happened!

909
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,860
I am so sorry.

910
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,080
Five years ago,

911
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:32,550
afraid she might bring you harm, Your Highness,

912
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,480
she threw herself into the river.

913
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,190
She lost all her memories then.

914
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:43,720
Right now, Her Highness herself...

915
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,160
knows who she is.

916
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,560
I am going to stick to you like glue, Your Highness.

917
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:53,330
I am never letting you go.

918
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,290
Your Highness!

919
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:26,569
- Your Highness! - Where is the Royal Concubine?

920
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:27,940
She should be in the Royal Kitchen.

921
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,540
Your Highness.

922
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:42,280
She went to the Eastern Palace, saying she had something for you.

923
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:47,660
Your Highness.

924
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:51,389
- Where is the Royal Concubine? - She left...

925
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:52,930
to her quarters after waiting, Your Highness.

926
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,350
When I opened my eyes,

927
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,790
my mind was completely blank,

928
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,220
but my memory was just a black void.

929
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,760
A life where I do not have to run anymore.

930
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,590
A life where I can settle down...

931
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,700
and make a real family of my own.

932
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,829
Leave Hanyang this instant.

933
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:06,330
This is the price someone as lowly as you...

934
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,240
has to pay for having a face like yours.

935
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,970
That is why you are so angry, is it not?

936
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,710
Because someone as lowly as myself...

937
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,280
looks like the Crown Princess.

938
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,380
Because of me, that precious woman...

939
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:27,550
On those small feet,

940
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,930
she walked such a long and difficult road back to me.

941
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:39,070
All because of me.

942
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,040
All because of me.

943
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,640
Your Highness.

944
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:22,940
Your Highness, is something the matter?

945
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,690
They say if you catch a falling flower petal...

946
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,030
Do you know what happens if you catch a falling flower petal?

947
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:06,420
I...

948
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,420
must have caught two.

949
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:18,230
After all, my first love and I...

950
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:24,770
ended up married twice.

951
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,220
I...

952
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,490
I am so sorry.

953
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,490
I am so sorry.

954
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:49,360
For far too long,

955
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,600
I left you all alone.

956
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,810
I am so sorry.

957
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:07,010
At a time like this,

958
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:12,290
you should not be on your knees. You should be holding me.

959
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:27,370
Like you will never let go.

960
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:51,790
I am sorry.

961
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:14,620
(Moon River)

962
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,040
What if we just ran away?

963
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:42,710
- A letter was outside your room. - Identify yourself, Your Highness.

964
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,750
What can His Royal Highness possibly do?

965
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,350
Harboring a traitor is a grave offense.

966
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,550
Stop the execution!

967
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:55,560
The Royal Concubine... No, Deposed Crown Princess Gang...

968
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:57,520
is hereby sentenced to death by hanging.

969
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:18,050
(Moon River)
