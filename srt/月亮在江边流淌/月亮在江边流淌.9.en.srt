1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,850
(Kang Tae Oh)

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,920
(Kim Se Jeong)

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,520
(Lee Sin Young)

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,390
(Hong Su Zu)

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,060
(Jin Goo)

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,630
(Nam Gi Ae)

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,370
(And Kim Nam Hee)

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,049
(Moon River)

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,380
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,680
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,020
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,190
How could I ever be angry with you?

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,730
You are the sole exception to all my anger.

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,400
I meant to tell you after my revenge was complete.

15
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,100
But you are having such foolish thoughts,

16
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,340
so I have no choice but to tell you now.

17
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,710
That I...

18
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,720
I am very deeply...

19
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,730
in love...

20
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,130
with you, Park Dal.

21
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,340
Me too.

22
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,510
Wait. You found the Jimjo in Mount Inwang Cave?

23
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,380
It was right under our noses. Goodness.

24
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,580
Tell me about it.

25
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,490
So, since you have found its habitat,

26
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,420
does that mean you can get the Left State Councilor?

27
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,730
The Choraengi Mask set off a bomb,

28
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,730
and it wiped out all traces of the Jimjo.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,860
Did you not say the Chief Court Lady was the one in the Choraengi Mask?

30
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,170
It turns out there was another one.

31
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,370
What? Then why did you not catch him?

32
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,270
He knew the cave's layout well, shook off 12 of our men,

33
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,210
then he blew himself up inside.

34
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,710
So, what do we do now?

35
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,080
The Choraengi Mask is dead,

36
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,850
and the cave collapsed.

37
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,450
And because of me,

38
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,220
the Jimjo is gone forever.

39
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Gosh.

40
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,090
You have to make me seem pathetic, do you not?

41
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,500
Every time I save you,

42
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,230
just say I was amazing or that you have fallen for me.

43
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,030
That would be enough.

44
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,900
You are not wrong, but...

45
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,310
You just stop there.

46
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,210
For my part,

47
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,120
I will just be grateful you are alive, and we will leave it at that.

48
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Okay?

49
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,660
- How is your back? - It is all better now.

50
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,960
Good. That is all that matters.

51
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,630
Let us get some sleep.

52
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,070
Gosh...

53
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,310
Gosh...

54
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,580
Are you trying to squeeze the life out of me?

55
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,380
Why are you hugging me so tight?

56
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
You have no idea...

57
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,420
what my lonely nights have been like.

58
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,190
Say what you will, I will not let go. So hug me back tight.

59
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,780
The Crown Prince's Concubine used the chick to lure its mother,

60
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,080
and His Royal Highness killed the Jimjo himself?

61
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,380
Because of one woman,

62
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,850
five years of hard work went down the drain.

63
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,559
- Sir? - Take the carcass,

64
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,090
and clean up the scene well.

65
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,530
A young Jimjo's venom is too weak to serve as evidence.

67
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,970
Now that the Jimjo and all traces of it are gone,

68
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,839
the truth of what happened in the Gyesa Year...

69
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,410
will remain a secret forever.

70
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,080
(Chapter Nine: Curiosity, There Are No Secrets)

71
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,360
Gosh.

72
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,530
It is disturbing Dal's sleep.

73
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,670
Hey, you punk!

74
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,820
- Go get that thing. - "That thing"?

75
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,120
No...

76
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,340
Royal Mother! Why are you...

77
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,740
Royal Mother! What is happening?

78
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,680
Royal Mother

79
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,710
Royal Mother.

80
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
I am back in my own body now.

81
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
So why do I keep dreaming about the Crown Princess?

82
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,650
What?

83
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,920
Now that the Jimjo is dead...

84
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,420
and the Mount Inwang Cave lies in ruins,

85
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,850
what do you plan to do?

86
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,890
The Jimjo will be dismissed as a tragic omen.

87
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,960
The people are in an uproar over this monstrous bird,

88
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,500
so you should hold an exorcism rite to appease them.

89
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,840
An exorcism rite?

90
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,940
So the Jimjo is a curse sent from the skies?

91
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,470
Otherwise,

92
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,710
someone dared send a Jimjo into Your Majesty's palace.

93
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,920
Are you suggesting this is an act of treason?

94
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,690
So whoever sent the Jimjo is a traitor?

95
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,160
So that is it.

96
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,860
The reason he made me release the Jimjo myself.

97
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,240
The Book of Rites is clear.

98
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,000
According to it,

99
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,739
A monarch in mourning should not rejoice,

100
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,080
and one should not hold celebrations during a time of mourning.

101
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,780
The Left State Councilor's point is a valid one.

102
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,210
We will hold an exorcism rite,

103
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,780
and I will suspend the Royal Wedding.

104
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,890
What? What are you talking about? The Royal Wedding is in five days.

105
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,759
How can you suspend the wedding?

106
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,860
He is right, Your Highness. Comparing the Jimjo...

107
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,960
to a monarch in mourning is not appropriate.

108
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,770
Even past kings postponed feasts for hail, drought, or poor harvests.

109
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
So holding the Royal Wedding...

110
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,840
in the face of an omen like this...

111
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,880
would be utterly absurd, would it not?

112
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,950
Now that I have stopped the wedding using the omen as an excuse,

113
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,519
the Left State Councilor will soon claim...

114
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,719
the Jimjo was a man-made disaster...

115
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,890
and try to find someone to take the fall.

116
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,830
Yes, he will likely pin it on the former Chief Court Lady Jo.

117
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,260
The Jimjo's cave on Mount Inwang...

118
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,200
is connected to Jo's brewery.

119
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,430
That brewery once belonged to the Left State Councilor.

120
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,840
But this deed lists someone else as the seller.

121
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,640
So, I should find this person?

122
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,580
Find proof the Left State Councilor sold the brewery to this man.

123
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,710
And after I find him, what is next?

124
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,210
After that,

125
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,890
be happy.

126
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,019
Once the Left State Councilor is arrested,

127
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,790
the Royal Wedding will be canceled.

128
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,630
That is when you must run away with the Crown Princess Consort.

129
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,360
- Gang. - Live well, wherever you go.

130
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,670
Do not be in pain anymore,

131
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,000
and do not be lonely.

132
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,910
What will you do now?

133
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,220
We fell for the Crown Prince's trap.

134
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,619
The Crown Prince and his concubine are so obviously in love,

135
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,050
the whole palace can tell.

136
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,020
And now with the wedding postponed, what if the concubine gets pregnant?

137
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,730
Would that not be a total disaster?

138
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Our Crown Prince...

139
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,700
has matured a great deal in the meantime.

140
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,270
This is hardly the time to stand around admiring him!

141
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,670
However,

142
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,470
a tree that grows higher than the ceiling...

143
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,840
must be chopped down.

144
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,750
I should be going now.

145
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,830
Come on.

146
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,500
Gang, how can you be so careless with my wedding gift?

147
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,100
- Wedding gift? - Yes.

148
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,370
U Hui trusts me with her life.

149
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,940
I cannot give her a grand affair, but we should have a ceremony.

150
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,080
A ceremony? Is that really what matters?

151
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Gang.

152
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,980
When you buy a house, do you sign a deed or not?

153
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,280
When you buy land, do you register the title or not?

154
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,450
We were talking weddings. Why bring up houses and land now?

155
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,760
That is what a wedding is all about.

156
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,790
It is declaring ourselves husband and wife...

157
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,460
before all the deities of the skies and earth.

158
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,660
It means no one can tear us apart. It is a thumbprint on a contract.

159
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,470
- That is what it is all about? - Yes.

160
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,410
- Really? - Yes.

161
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,910
Really?

162
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,960
Have you been waiting long?

163
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,230
I just got here myself.

164
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,300
What is that you have there?

165
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,970
Oh, Gang gave me his word.

166
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,370
When this is all finished, we will leave together.

167
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,000
I got this for you.

168
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,140
I hope you like it.

169
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,210
You do not like it?

170
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,080
If I cared for riches and jewels, I would have stayed where I was.

171
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,550
If I only wanted you for your title, I would have left a long time ago.

172
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,690
Next time, instead of a wedding gift,

173
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,090
bring me my father's downfall.

174
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,930
I cannot leave right away either.

175
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,340
Because the one who most wants the Left State Councilor's downfall...

176
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,440
- is me. - Do you have a plan?

177
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,409
I am looking for the man who sold the brewery...

178
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,040
to the former Chief Court Lady.

179
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,810
Was it not my father who sold the brewery?

180
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,679
Before selling it to her,

181
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,690
he sold it to someone named Yun Gye Sim.

182
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,620
Does that name sound familiar?

183
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,660
No, I do not know.

184
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,000
I see. I did not expect it to be that easy.

185
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,600
Either way, I will prove that the Left State Councilor...

186
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,440
is the master of the Jimjo.

187
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,170
But...

188
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,370
are you sure you will be all right with this?

189
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,580
He is still your father, after all. Are you sure you are okay?

190
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,850
He has never once considered me his daughter,

191
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
so it is nothing for me to abandon him as my father.

192
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
That is a heartbreaking thing to say.

193
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,700
Just wait a little longer. I will come for you soon.

194
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,670
Brother, friend, father, and husband...

195
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,010
I will be all of those things for you.

196
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,000
What? A hundred pairs of flower shoes?

197
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,600
Are these shoes for a centipede or something?

198
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,340
What are you talking about, you punk?

199
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,680
Enough with the smart remarks,

200
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,880
and bring me some paper and a brush.

201
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,490
I have a special order for you.

202
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,960
There we go.

203
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,430
Take a look.

204
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,030
- Wait, is this... - Yes, as you can see...

205
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,740
Is this not the number eight from the West?

206
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,709
How would you know Western numbers, Your Highness?

207
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,410
What? A number?

208
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,510
What is this fly in the middle?

209
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,010
It is a flower.

210
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,150
A skewer?

211
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,490
Oh, a silkworm cocoon!

212
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,560
Not a silkworm cocoon, a flower!

213
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,830
Look! A flower in the middle. These two rings.

214
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,930
A double ring with a flower design, you idiot.

215
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,870
- Is it not? - It is!

216
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,910
I just do not get...

217
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,210
why he keeps drawing such things and acting so proud.

218
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,780
Maybe because he was spoiled rotten?

219
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,020
This will be a gift for my Royal Concubine,

220
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,820
so tell the finest artisan to do their absolute best work.

221
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,790
So dazzling.

222
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,230
So dazzling.

223
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
So dazzling.

224
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,210
You ㅁre that happy?

225
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,140
No.

226
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,380
It is the umbrella that is beautiful.

227
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,750
The umbrella is just like a flower.

228
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,750
I feel like I have seen this flower somewhere.

229
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,080
What was it called again?

230
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,750
Then, should you not do something to thank His Royal Highness?

231
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,890
Thank him?

232
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,960
He is the Crown Prince. What could he possibly need?

233
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,700
Besides, he is no ordinary Crown Prince.

234
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,500
He even has his own wardrobe room at the Royal Office of Attire.

235
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
For someone like that, it is the thought that counts.

236
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,140
The thought?

237
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,810
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

238
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,650
Royal Concubine. What brings you here, Your Highness?

239
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,720
It is just that...

240
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,020
I am trying to make something.

241
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,520
Do you know what food His Royal Highness enjoys?

242
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,210
Hey, wait a second.

243
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,110
What happened to your hands?

244
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,110
It is nothing. I just scraped it a little.

245
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Goodness!

246
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,490
- It is hot. - You said it was just a scrape.

247
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,230
Five of your ten fingers are all wrapped up in bandages?

248
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,230
This is unacceptable. I am calling the Royal Physician.

249
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,469
- Is there anyone? - It is fine!

250
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,930
Do not make such a fuss.

251
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,000
- Hurry up and try it. - What do you mean it is nothing?

252
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,910
To think you went to so much trouble making this...

253
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,809
- It is just heartbreaking. - Come on.

254
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,680
But you have done so much for me,

255
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,910
and you have saved me so many times,

256
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,080
so I wanted to do something for you, and I worked hard.

257
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,579
But you keep scolding me. Forget it.

258
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,920
- Do not eat it. - No.

259
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,250
Is that what this was about?

260
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,220
And I had no idea.

261
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,790
All right.

262
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,700
Let me taste the pumpkin porridge you sacrificed five fingers for.

263
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,280
How is it? Is it any good?

264
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,810
I did not get to taste-test it while I was making it.

265
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
It is delicious.

266
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,350
Really?

267
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,250
That is a relief. It is my first time making it.

268
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Hold on a second.

269
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,720
It is a shame to eat this porridge all by myself.

270
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,560
What do you think about sharing some with Shin Won and Se Dol?

271
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,200
As if I would not think of that. I already gave them each a bowl.

272
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,340
That was delicious.

273
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,710
It is so delicious that I am sad to be on the last bite.

274
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,510
You wish there was more?

275
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,650
Good thing I saved a portion for myself.

276
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,450
For me, just watching you enjoy it is enough to make me full.

277
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,960
But just because the wedding is off, does not mean it is completely over.

278
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,730
What happens to Grand Prince Je Un and the Crown Prince Consort?

279
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Your Royal Highness.

280
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
Your Royal Highness?

281
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Yes?

282
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,010
Why are you in a cold sweat like that?

283
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,480
It is just hot in here.

284
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,920
But your hands and earlobes are ice-cold.

285
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,560
Then it is because I am cold.

286
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,060
Make up your mind. Are you hot or are you cold?

287
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,590
Well, it is...

288
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,700
You ate two bowls of that vile stuff?

289
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,330
How could you finish that thing?

290
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,030
Even Mangdeok would not touch it.

291
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
That "vile stuff" you are referring to...

292
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,440
Is it the pumpkin porridge I gave you?

293
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
And to think I went out of my way to prepare bowls for both of you.

294
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,510
What were you thinking?

295
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,280
Why does Dal have to be a good cook on top of everything else?

296
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,850
It is not like she entered the palace to be our cook.

297
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,020
It was delicious.

298
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,359
Then you should have said something. Why force it down like an idiot?

299
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,190
So what if I am a bit of an idiot?

300
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,160
As long as it made you happy, that is all that matters.

301
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
It was delicious.

302
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,230
You are not quite better yet, are you?

303
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,440
- Follow me. - What? Where are you taking me?

304
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,900
In the middle of the day?

305
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,970
Do not follow us.

306
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,410
- Go on. - It is completely blocked up.

307
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,550
You did not have to get sick over that. Gosh.

308
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,480
Doing pointless things is what romance is.

309
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,090
Romance? Give me a break.

310
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,390
It is the middle of the day,

311
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,430
and a couple is sitting side by side in a private room.

312
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,870
Plus, they are holding hands and caressing their fingers.

313
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,900
This is what you call romance, is it not?

314
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,200
This is not for some impure reason.

315
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
It is purely for therapeutic purposes.

316
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,680
They say you will not get sick if your body stays warm.

317
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,510
If being warm is so good for you,

318
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,950
we should not just be holding hands.

319
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,590
Maybe we should try something else.

320
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,390
I was already planning on it.

321
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,630
Close your eyes. You might be surprised.

322
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,030
What? I have to close my eyes?

323
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,470
Fine. Do whatever you want.

324
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,740
All right.

325
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,220
Just trust the best healer from Boryeong.

326
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,620
What?

327
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
No, do not.

328
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,620
There we go.

329
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,460
- You are doing great. - No!

330
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,490
Did you call for me?

331
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,200
I did not.

332
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,940
But just now, I heard "Se Dol."

333
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,080
Were you not the one who called me?

334
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,610
I said I did not. Now go get me a wet towel.

335
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,050
Why am I always the one to see this? This is so frustrating.

336
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,040
Your Royal Highness. Are you still pouting?

337
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,840
I am not pouting.

338
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,250
You certainly sound like you are.

339
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,110
I said I am not.

340
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,090
Okay. I am sorry for teasing you.

341
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,560
I have apologized. Come here so we can clean your hand.

342
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,759
Hey, what are you doing?

343
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,130
Why are you dunking your hands when they are hurt?

344
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,060
It will get infected. Gosh.

345
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,020
Goodness.

346
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,300
I have been eating well and on time, so I cannot be collapsing already.

347
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,640
What?

348
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,579
- Oh, no. What is going on? - Calm down.

349
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,409
- Did we switch bodies again? - My body... Why is it over there?

350
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,450
What do we do?

351
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,380
- Your Royal Highness. - Your Royal Highness.

352
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,590
- Who do I look like to you? - Tell me who you see right now.

353
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,130
Well...

354
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,529
Your Highness and the Royal Concubine...

355
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,630
Darn! So...

356
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,370
So you are saying you see me as Dal, and you see her as me?

357
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,780
What in the...

358
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,520
Oh, come on. Not this "I am you, you are me" stuff.

359
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,850
There you go, playing your games again.

360
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,690
Is this your first time dating or something?

361
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,750
Why are you making such a fuss?

362
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,460
Are you trying to make fun of this lonely old eunuch?

363
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,960
Lonely eunuch? What nonsense.

364
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,260
Well, then, we will let you two enjoy yourselves.

365
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,900
My lady, the Left State Councilor has come for you.

366
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,010
Left State Councilor, what brings you all the way here?

367
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,880
Last night, you took...

368
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,850
the Jimjo chick from the prison to lure its mother.

369
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,420
We have received this testimony.

370
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,490
You will have to come with us for questioning.

371
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,629
As I recall, the Royal Concubine is under...

372
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,860
the Crown Prince's Palace's authority.

373
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,860
By what authority do you presume to take her?

374
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
The fate of the nation is at stake.

375
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,900
Please grant us your permission, Your Royal Highness.

376
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,370
I have nothing to be ashamed of, so of course I will go.

377
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,410
Let us go.

378
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,880
I will be back soon, so please do not worry.

379
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,560
How did you know of the Secret Prison and the Jimjo chick?

380
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,930
The former Chief Court Lady tried to force an infertility drug on me.

381
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,970
She had me abducted and taken to the Secret Prison.

382
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,500
That is when I found out.

383
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,040
About both the Secret Prison and the Jimjo chick.

384
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,810
If you do not believe me, ask the Queen Dowager yourself.

385
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,010
By the way, I wonder if the Queen Dowager...

386
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,750
has heard the rumors circulating about the Jimjo Poison.

387
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,750
She is using the Queen Dowager's backing...

388
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,990
to dig into the Gyesa Year Incident?

389
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,930
Then,

390
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,700
why did you lure the mother with its young?

391
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,400
As rumors of the Jimjo are causing unrest among the people,

392
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,340
is it not wise to catch the creature and expose who is behind this?

393
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,280
Is that not why you are investigating me now?

394
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,310
To find the master of the Jimjo...

395
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,150
who might just be a traitor.

396
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,200
Thank you for indulging my discourtesy.

397
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,860
Thanks to you,

398
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,030
I now have a new lead, the former Chief Court Lady.

399
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,240
I will now begin my investigation.

400
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,210
How do you intend to investigate someone who is already dead?

401
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,680
She must have had an accomplice.

402
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,250
The mastermind behind it all,

403
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,380
who could very well be a traitor.

404
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,160
Good grief.

405
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,700
How did it go? Are you all right?

406
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,200
The Left State Councilor is doing just what I wanted.

407
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,300
He said he is going to investigate the Chief Court Lady.

408
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,010
Am I supposed to be glad that our bodies switched?

409
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,310
Glad?

410
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,110
How could swapping bodies possibly be a good thing?

411
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,950
Why did we have to swap again?

412
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,560
And I am stuck in these uncomfortable clothes again.

413
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,730
- What good are these legs... - River.

414
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,790
If I cannot even use them properly?

415
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:30,830
Rain.

416
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
A basin?

417
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,640
Our bodies...

418
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,040
I am back in my own body.

419
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,750
I think water has something to do with it.

420
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,049
Why did we swap bodies again?

421
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,290
You are too loud, so please be quiet. I am trying to think.

422
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,460
Dal. If you were in my shoes, could you possibly be quiet?

423
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,930
We kissed once, and we switched. We slept embraced for one night,

424
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,300
and the next day, we swapped.

425
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,100
I am a healthy man, you know!

426
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,870
What was with you?

427
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,240
This really stings. You were not fine at all.

428
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
Blood?

429
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,900
What is wrong?

430
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,970
What are you doing now?

431
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,280
Hold on.

432
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,790
Dal.

433
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,220
It is okay.

434
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,900
What? Am I back?

435
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,940
You are so adorable!

436
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,110
See? It was blood and water.

437
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,020
You and I both get a cut,

438
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,249
and it gets washed with water.

439
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,390
Ta-da! That is how we switch bodies.

440
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,530
You silly girl. Why clap with your cut hand?

441
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,390
I am just so happy! We finally know how to switch bodies.

442
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,730
Are you not happy too?

443
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,900
Hey.

444
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,640
Your hand. That must hurt.

445
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,310
Really, it is nothing.

446
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,280
It is not a big deal.

447
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,980
How is it not a big deal? Of course it is.

448
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,120
Think about it.

449
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,520
If you get hurt like this,

450
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,990
I will spend all day worrying about you,

451
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,460
and if I am worrying about you,

452
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,260
I will not be able to focus on my royal duties,

453
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,330
and if that happens, the nation will fall into ruin.

454
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,630
Is that what you want? To see the nation fall?

455
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:01,370
Do you want to rewrite history or something?

456
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,210
Gosh, these lovely fingers...

457
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,790
I hear you were neighbors who were close to Park Dal.

458
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,190
Go to Hanyang and say exactly what I tell you.

459
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,930
Do that, and no harm will come to you.

460
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,179
I...

461
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,250
I really do not know anything.

462
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,420
I swear.

463
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,290
You will have to know.

464
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,860
Also,

465
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,560
you will have to do exactly as I say.

466
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,260
That is the only way the Chief Royal Secretary will live.

467
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,500
Last night, the niece of the former Chief Court Lady Jo...

468
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,810
confessed to releasing the Jimjo.

469
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,780
In the Mount Inwang Cave, connected to Jo's brewery,

470
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,680
they supposedly raised the Jimjo.

471
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,550
Have you inspected the cave?

472
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,580
It was blown up and is now blocked,

473
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,790
but we discovered a tunnel that runs from the brewery...

474
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,820
to the foot of Mount Inwang.

475
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,390
So you are saying...

476
00:36:28,391 --> 00:36:31,130
the Chief Court Lady was the one behind the Jimjo?

477
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,230
It would appear so.

478
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,570
Then...

479
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,100
let us conclude the Jimjo case...

480
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,370
and resume the Royal Wedding, Your Highness.

481
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,610
Not yet.

482
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,210
She may have been plotting treason.

483
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,480
A thorough investigation is required,

484
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,350
so please grant me...

485
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,950
a little more time.

486
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,850
Left State Councilor.

487
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,420
Left State Councilor.

488
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,030
Do as you see fit, Left State Councilor.

489
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,500
The Left State Councilor is stalling for time.

490
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,030
I wonder what he is up to.

491
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,170
Have you found the body of the man in the Choraengi Mask?

492
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,810
They still have not cleared the cave entrance.

493
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,040
It seems it will take more time.

494
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,850
That might be for the best. We need more time anyway.

495
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,350
Do not worry, Your Royal Highness. Just as you intended,

496
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,780
everything is going according to plan.

497
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,490
Right. I am just worrying for nothing.

498
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,890
Your Royal Highness.

499
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,420
It is I, Cha Eun Woo.

500
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,559
As you commanded, Your Highness,

501
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,860
I have tasked Joseon's finest artisan.

502
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,200
I am certain you will be pleased with the result.

503
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,500
Excellent.

504
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,240
It is made exactly like the drawing I did that day. Right?

505
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,990
Why the simple white robe, all of a sudden?

506
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:07,360
For the same reason you are wearing a green top and a red skirt.

507
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,860
I was just about to ask about that.

508
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,960
Why this outfit all of a sudden? Is this a "personal color analysis"?

509
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,070
- No. - Then what?

510
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,199
Why did you insist I had to wear this...

511
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,300
and make such a big deal about it?

512
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,670
It is a bribe.

513
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,880
I need to...

514
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,050
ask your permission for something.

515
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,950
What are you trying to say?

516
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,780
A bribe, and now you need my permission?

517
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,160
My lord.

518
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,560
What?

519
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,730
What is all this?

520
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,350
What is all of this?

521
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,670
Other than straw shoes, I want one in flower shoes.

522
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,640
But a life where I wear flower shoes...

523
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,670
and walk at a leisurely pace.

524
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,670
That is the life I want.

525
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,810
Flower shoes? I will buy you over a hundred pairs of them.

526
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,910
I will buy you enough to fill an entire room.

527
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,800
Why is this one all by itself in the middle?

528
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,570
Inside your dream,

529
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,970
I have placed my own.

530
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,000
Is this a bribe too?

531
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,100
Well,

532
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,200
this is not a bribe.

533
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,780
It is a wedding gift.

534
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,300
Right now, I am...

535
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,040
proposing to you.

536
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,190
Not as the Crown Prince,

537
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,190
but as a man,

538
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,590
I am asking the woman I love...

539
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,160
to be my one...

540
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,700
and only partner.

541
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,270
I am asking for your hand.

542
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,310
Will you...

543
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,150
be my wife?

544
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,920
As Lee Gang and Park Dal wish to become husband and wife,

545
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,720
we declare it before all the deities of the skies and earth.

546
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,860
Please watch over this precious bond...

547
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,190
and help us to protect it.

548
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,080
Indeed. If she fails to find herself,

549
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,790
then both this flower of fate and red thread of fate...

550
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,560
will remain forever incomplete.

551
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,350
Are you that happy?

552
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,120
Gosh, you are awake?

553
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,760
With you touching my face like this,

554
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,690
- how could I possibly stay asleep? - It is just that...

555
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,900
I understand, though.

556
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:23,730
It must be hard to believe.

557
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,770
That the Crown Prince of this nation is completely and utterly yours.

558
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,940
Your heart must be bursting.

559
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,540
I get it.

560
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,780
It is all right.

561
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,390
What is wrong?

562
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:55,360
Can I just step outside the palace for a bit?

563
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,870
Where to?

564
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,130
So, let me get this straight.

565
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,640
First you were a eunuch, then a court lady,

566
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,970
then the Crown Prince, and now you are his concubine?

567
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,650
I do not even know anymore.

568
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,010
Every time I blink, something changes.

569
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,850
My head is about to explode.

570
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,690
Your Highness.

571
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,690
From now on, you must mind your words and deeds.

572
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,320
Mom, why are you talking so formally all of a sudden?

573
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,260
What is this? Are you already trying to suck up to her?

574
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,400
Are you trying to win her over alone now that she is a royal concubine?

575
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,900
My gosh.

576
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,340
Your Highness.

577
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,110
The sun is quite harsh. Please, do come inside.

578
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,110
Dad! Not you too!

579
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,710
Auntie, can you please do something about Mom and Dad?

580
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,980
Let us just go inside for now.

581
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:50,890
Unbelievable.

582
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,390
Dal.

583
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,120
No.

584
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,390
I need to speak with the Royal Concubine alone.

585
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,400
- All right, my lady. - All right, my lady.

586
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,409
Did you do something wrong? Why the bowed head?

587
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,510
Because I did not listen to you,

588
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,420
I have ended up here.

589
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,750
If you have taken the wrong path, you can always just get off it.

590
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,860
I will create an opportunity soon. Let us leave for Qing.

591
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,030
I am sorry.

592
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,630
Last night,

593
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,470
I spent my wedding night with His Royal Highness.

594
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,710
Now, I am going to stay by His Royal Highness's side,

595
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,280
by my husband's side.

596
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:52,150
You mean you formed a marital bond with the Crown Prince?

597
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,150
Yes.

598
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,720
So,

599
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,520
you should take my parents and leave Hanyang now.

600
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,930
You could be in danger if the Left State Councilor sees you.

601
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,030
That is what I came here to tell you today.

602
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:13,300
What?

603
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,740
Being the Crown Prince's concubine is a good thing, is it not?

604
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,770
Why the long face?

605
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,109
He is right.

606
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,940
A slave who fled Hanyang is now a Royal Concubine.

607
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,210
What could be better than this?

608
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,080
We do not have to be on the run anymore.

609
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,090
Goodness, I can finally sleep well at night.

610
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,290
Dal...

611
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,490
should not be in the palace.

612
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:39,760
So, what is that supposed to mean?

613
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,700
Excuse me for a moment.

614
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,800
Hey, where are you going? We are in the middle of talking.

615
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,270
(Eunwol Pavilion)

616
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,609
I asked to meet the Head Eunuch ages ago.

617
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,310
Why have I not heard back?

618
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,180
Did you even send the message?

619
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,220
I did. Several times.

620
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,520
But what can I do if there is no reply?

621
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,220
That is why...

622
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,420
I told you to just give me the message.

623
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:13,860
Gang.

624
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,670
Yeon Wol.

625
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,240
Tell him Hong Nan of Eunwol Pavilion...

626
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,470
is in Hanyang with Gang Yeon Wol.

627
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,680
Pass on that message.

628
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:36,220
The Jimjo's cave on Mount Inwang is connected to Jo's brewery.

629
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,720
Find proof the Left State Councilor sold the brewery to this man.

630
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:46,460
This house looks abandoned. Are you sure this is the place?

631
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,500
According to this deed,

632
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,470
the one who sold the brewery to the former Chief Court Lady lived here.

633
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,270
What is this?

634
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,770
What are you doing at an abandoned house?

635
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:00,880
How long has this house been empty?

636
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,850
About 5 or 6 years, I think?

637
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,049
Where did they go?

638
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,420
No idea. They skipped town at night.

639
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,620
Skipped town at night?

640
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:17,630
Of course. The Left State Councilor would not just let a key person go.

641
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,960
Here is the requested autopsy report on the snake hunter murder case.

642
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:26,569
What is the point of collecting more evidence on Jimjo poison?

643
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:27,970
We do not have a smoking gun.

644
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,670
But we must do something in the meantime.

645
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:52,630
What is it?

646
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,240
The location of the swollen red dot on each body...

647
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,410
The Fengfu point. The Philtrum point.

648
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,880
The Tiantu point.

649
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,180
They are all vital points.

650
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,580
If they are red dots,

651
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,050
does that mean acupuncture was performed?

652
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,820
Not by the Chief Court Lady...

653
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,290
but another person in the palace could have.

654
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,460
Someone who can perform acupuncture on vital points.

655
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,090
A female Royal Physician.

656
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,160
Choraengi Mask, who set off the bomb in the Jimjo cave that day,

657
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,430
seemed to know their way around that cave.

658
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,270
That means it was not their first or second time there.

659
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:40,510
Let us go. I must see for myself.

660
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,920
None of our female Royal Physicians have died recently. Why do you ask?

661
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:52,190
Have any of the female physicians suddenly disappeared?

662
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,690
Well, one left due to illness a few days ago, but...

663
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,800
You know how the Jimjo appeared in the palace a while ago?

664
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,970
She left the very next day.

665
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,670
Did you see her in person?

666
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,310
She said it was contagious, so she sent someone instead.

667
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,480
Bring me her records.

668
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,250
Drink up.

669
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,320
- Here, drink up. - So, why are you...

670
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,259
so curious about the owner of that empty house?

671
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,430
You see,

672
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,859
she ran off with my money.

673
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,800
That rotten scoundrel.

674
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,270
Looks like my lord just wasted his money on drinks.

675
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,840
How do you expect to catch a slave who was determined to run away?

676
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:46,910
A slave?

677
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,580
What? You lent her the money without even knowing that?

678
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:54,720
If an out-resident slave means to deceive you, you stand no chance.

679
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,180
Just give up.

680
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,590
He is a slave who escaped from the great Left State Councilor himself.

681
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,120
How could you possibly hope to catch them?

682
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,890
Wait, the Left State Councilor?

683
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,330
The owner of that empty house...

684
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,030
is an out-resident slave from the Left State Councilor's household?

685
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,270
Summon the royal guards at once, and send word to Je Un.

686
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,140
We must find the body in the Mount Inwang Cave.

687
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,340
- Yes, Your Highness. - That might not be necessary.

688
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,410
Gang.

689
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,009
Good. I was about to send for you.

690
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,680
I have identified the Choraengi Mask.

691
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,080
We have to find the body in the cave.

692
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:26,919
The Choraengi Mask's identity?

693
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,420
But did you not say it was the Chief Court Lady?

694
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,450
She was a Royal Physician named Kim Deok Chun.

695
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,920
Before the Left State Councilor frames the Chief Cour Lady's niece,

696
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,390
we have to find her body.

697
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,190
But what is her connection to the Left State Councilor?

698
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:39,690
I found out the physician's mother...

699
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,160
was an out-resident slave for the Left State Councilor.

700
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:47,800
Could her name be Yun Gye Sim?

701
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,940
How would you know about that?

702
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,040
She is the one who sold the brewery to the former Chief Court Lady.

703
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,170
- Let us go. - Yes, Your Highness.

704
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,180
All right. Thank you for your hard work.

705
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:39,650
The body of the Choraengi Mask must be somewhere here.

706
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,360
- Find the body. - Yes, Your Highness.

707
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,970
They are the Royal Concubine's neighbors from Boryeong.

708
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,970
Prepare my official robes.

709
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:59,110
I must go to the palace.

710
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,750
It seems His Royal Highness has, for quite some time,

711
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,980
been consumed by revenge.

712
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,150
He was digging into the Gyesa Year Incident.

713
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,520
I intend to ensure this ends with the Chief Court Lady,

714
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:16,220
but thanks to His Royal Highness escalating the matter,

715
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:22,030
it seems we will need another offering.

716
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,230
An offering?

717
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,800
The Royal Concubine...

718
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,470
The Royal Concubine?

719
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,710
Many people witnessed her using the Jimjo chick to lure its mother.

720
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,290
How could you try to take everything...

721
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,430
from the Crown Prince?

722
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:58,130
Your Majesty.

723
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,300
Is it not a stretch to say the Royal Concubine masterminded the omen?

724
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,340
She would have no motive to do such a thing.

725
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,750
The Royal Concubine has no motive,

726
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:19,950
but the deposed Crown Princess certainly does.

727
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,859
Do you know how the Royal Concubine...

728
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,730
won the Queen Dowager's favor?

729
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,070
I have heard rumors she resembles the deposed Crown Princess,

730
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:40,510
but who would believe such a tale?

731
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,580
Do not worry.

732
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:48,820
I have paid witnesses who will claim she is the deposed Crown Princess.

733
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,900
What have you been so lost in thought about?

734
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:17,580
Yeon Sim.

735
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:22,820
About the late Queen. The Crown Prince's mother.

736
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:28,320
Did she die from drinking poisoned tea?

737
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,430
Yes.

738
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:34,630
They say that is why the Crown Princess was deposed.

739
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,560
For poisoning the Queen.

740
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:38,400
The Crown Princess?

741
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,370
Royal Mother.

742
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,170
Royal Mother.

743
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,040
What was the evidence?

744
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:50,280
They said poison was found somewhere in her quarters.

745
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:54,380
Was it her drawer? Or her bedding?

746
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
A pillow?

747
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:59,290
Yes. That is right. It was inside her pillow.

748
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,820
Why ask if you already know everything?

749
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,659
- You are right. - Royal Concubine,

750
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,230
come forth and receive the Royal Order!

751
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,170
Why on earth are you taking her to the Royal Investigation Office?

752
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,870
Testimony says she is the mastermind of the Jimjo incident.

753
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:20,610
- That is completely absurd! - It is a Royal Order.

754
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,640
You must come with us.

755
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:25,310
Your Highness.

756
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,120
Go tell the Crown Prince.

757
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,720
Hurry.

758
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,430
Your Royal Highness.

759
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,900
Well, did you find anything?

760
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,240
We have searched everywhere, but there is no body.

761
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:54,940
Could she have been fast enough to escape through the entrance?

762
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:57,780
The bomb went off while she was still inside the cave.

763
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:01,250
No matter how fast they are, at most they have gone is around 3m.

764
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:06,350
Then what? Did she grow wings? Or disappear into the earth?

765
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:07,960
Gosh.

766
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,160
Around 3m?

767
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,330
There! Get them!

768
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,650
What is it?

769
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,950
If she did not fly up to the sky or disappear into the ground,

770
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,190
she must have escaped.

771
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:41,760
There must be a hidden passage.

772
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:43,690
Find that passage.

773
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,830
My lady!

774
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:53,600
- Where is His Royal Highness now? - I do not know either.

775
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,670
For this to happen to the Royal Concubine, of all times...

776
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:39,240
I knew it. The Choraengi Mask is alive.

777
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,750
It is harder than you would think, choosing where you belong.

778
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,690
The Crown Prince is looking for your mother.

779
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,730
It is only a matter of time before they find out who you are.

780
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,260
You must leave.

781
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,230
Do not worry about your mother.

782
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,220
It seems this is the first time you are seeing her, Your Majesty.

783
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,989
She resembles the deposed Crown Princess,

784
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:28,320
but this is the Royal Concubine, Park Dal.

785
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:33,390
The niece of the former Chief Court Lady Jo...

786
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,900
has identified you as the mastermind behind the Jimjo incident.

787
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,240
- Will you confess? - Your Majesty.

788
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:46,340
How could I be the mastermind of the Jimjo incident?

789
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,440
I have no reason to do such a thing.

790
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:54,280
She said she had to avenge what happened five years ago...

791
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:59,920
- and to free the Jimjo Birds. - What in the world?

792
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,360
I truly do not understand why you are doing this to me.

793
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:08,000
Your Majesty, I was not in the palace five years ago.

794
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,970
So what could I be avenging?

795
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,630
That is because the Royal Concubine...

796
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:15,700
is the supposedly deceased...

797
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,650
Crown Princess Gang.

798
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:29,280
I am... Who?

799
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,530
Search every inch of this place.

800
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:02,150
Your Majesty.

801
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,590
There is another witness.

802
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,930
You two? How are you here?

803
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:15,400
Your Majesty, Park Dal is not Lord Hong's wife's niece.

804
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,229
Five years ago in winter,

805
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:21,170
a family from Hanyang arrived suddenly.

806
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,570
Five years ago? What are you talking about?

807
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,309
Why are you lying too?

808
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,580
I have lived in Boryeong since age five!

809
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:31,780
If you want to know about the lies, go ask your parents.

810
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,050
I am seriously going to lose my mind.

811
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,180
She has the same face as the deposed Crown Princess.

812
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,220
The winter the deposed Crown Princess vanished...

813
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:41,860
is when she suddenly appeared in Boryeong.

814
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,760
Do you truly believe that is a coincidence?

815
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:49,860
Your Majesty.

816
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,700
Please deliver your verdict.

817
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:01,340
Your Majesty.

818
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:08,520
If the Royal Concubine is the Deposed Crown Princess Gang,

819
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,990
then she is a traitor who fled, defying a Royal Order.

820
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,290
The rightful punishment is beheading.

821
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,790
Proceed with the interrogation.

822
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,760
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

823
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:44,690
So, where are we? It looks like some kind of house.

824
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,100
If I prove the Jimjo's habitat is linked to the Left State Councilor,

825
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:30,160
he will be finished for treason.

826
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,450
- Gang, this place is... - Yes.

827
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:55,220
Yes. We have finally found it.

828
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:00,860
Your Majesty.

829
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,640
Her feet are smooth, without a single callus.

830
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,170
Those are not the feet of someone who has walked mountain trails.

831
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,040
There was another Choraengi Mask.

832
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,680
He must have known the layout of the Mount Inwang Cave...

833
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:19,250
because he evaded a dozen men and blew himself up inside.

834
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,850
Not only was he not wearing a Choraengi Mask,

835
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:24,520
but she has never even been to the Mount Inwang Cave.

836
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:25,790
Let go of me.

837
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,520
Let go!

838
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:29,620
Hey, you.

839
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:33,330
I am asking what you have against me to treat me like this.

840
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,530
Are you accusing me of ordering you...

841
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,830
to raise Jimjo Birds in the cave beside the smithy...

842
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:41,100
in the village at the foot of Mount Bukak?

843
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:43,070
Yes.

844
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:45,070
You explicitly told me to raise the Jimjo Birds...

845
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,270
in the cave beside the smithy...

846
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,340
in the village at the foot of Mount Bukak.

847
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,150
You clearly said...

848
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,810
it was in the cave beside the smithy...

849
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:55,420
in the village at the foot of Mount Bukak.

850
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,520
Is that what you said?

851
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:05,030
I thought I heard it was a cave by the brewery below Mount Inwang.

852
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:08,630
- That is what I heard as well. - Really?

853
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:14,870
Did everyone see that? This woman is lying.

854
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,710
The story about raising Jimjo Birds is a complete lie,

855
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:20,240
so how can you believe her? Am I wrong?

856
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:33,620
It is too late. We will stop for today.

857
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,730
The interrogation will resume at first light.

858
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,090
- Yes, Your Majesty! - Yes, Your Majesty!

859
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:41,900
His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince, has arrived!

860
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:16,830
Your Majesty.

861
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,570
If you are here for the Royal Concubine, you have come in vain.

862
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,200
The interrogation is over for today.

863
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:26,310
I am not here for her. I am here for the Left State Councilor.

864
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,280
What are you...

865
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,210
Left State Councilor Kim Han Chul is behind the Jimjo incident.

866
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:41,420
Do you have proof?

867
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,519
I found a secret passage that connects...

868
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,790
the Mount Inwang Cave...

869
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:46,760
to the Left State Councilor's home.

870
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,100
Well, now.

871
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:01,510
Are you all as shocked as I am? Because I am utterly shocked.

872
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,810
You see, I simply...

873
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:08,380
followed a tunnel leading from the Jimjo cave,

874
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,720
and what do you know? It led to the Left State Councilor's!

875
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:13,620
Goodness.

876
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:19,030
What are you staring at?

877
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:23,000
Hey, you punk! Lower your eyes!

878
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,930
You do not seem to get what is happening.

879
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,399
Your master is no longer the Left State Councilor.

880
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,469
He is now a traitor.

881
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:29,540
And I should gouge your eyes out.

882
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,410
- Prince Lee Un, where are you? - You had better...

883
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,800
You pulled it off.

884
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,200
Of course I did.

885
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:01,000
I am just that good.

886
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:45,610
The Crown Prince's Concubine.

887
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,880
No.

888
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:52,120
Kill the Crown Princess.

889
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:57,090
(Moon River)

890
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:14,139
The day your father is arrested,

891
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,110
pack light and meet me at the greenhouse.

892
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,840
We are going to run away together.

893
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:21,150
Why do I keep having this dream? What is this memory?

894
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,050
How nice.

895
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:26,450
