00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,850
(Kang Tae Oh)

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,920
(Kim Se Jeong)

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,520
(Lee Sin Young)

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,390
(Hong Su Zu)

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,060
(Jin Goo)

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,630
(Nam Gi Ae)

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,370
(And Kim Nam Hee)

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,050
(Moon River)

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,020
Please kill me!

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,020
Gladly.

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,720
I will kill every last one of you!

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,630
The Queen Dowager has arrived!

13
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,030
You dared to conspire against the Royal Relatives...

14
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,570
and bring harm to the Crown Prince.

15
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,910
- Arrest this traitor. - Harming His Royal Highness was...

16
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,840
the fault of my subordinate.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,880
And I had proof of the affair.

18
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,880
That love letter... The Crown Prince wrote it to Park Dal.

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,550
- What are you doing? Seize her now. - Arrest her immediately!

20
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,690
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,090
I have been wronged.

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,560
Your Majesty, I have been wronged!

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,200
Your Majesty, I have been wronged.

24
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,460
The letter you brought as proof of an affair...

25
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,390
was confirmed that it was written by His Highness, the Crown Prince.

26
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,860
So what brings you here now?

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,370
There is no place in this place for you, Grand Prince Je Un.

28
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,900
Therefore, you must leave.

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,010
Did you not know? I already live outside the palace.

30
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,980
Then, I shall return to my home.

31
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,559
Left State Councillor. Please give me one more chance.

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,960
I will not fail you this time!

33
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,299
- My lord! - Careless words...

34
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,530
can bring great harm.

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,600
(Chapter Eight: Silence is Golden)

36
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,080
Your Royal Highness, let a court lady do that.

37
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,880
I will do it myself.

38
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,350
I will do it.

39
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,280
And what should I do with Court Lady Park's things?

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,920
Get rid of them.

41
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,860
- She will not need them anymore. - What do you mean?

42
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,600
Then should I get rid of this scent pouch too?

43
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,370
Leave that.

44
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,840
It is evidence that the man behind the Choraengi Mask dropped.

45
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,840
But this scent pouch...

46
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,210
Last year,

47
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,879
His Majesty gave these to palace staff...

48
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,180
to celebrate Queen Dowager's birthday.

49
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,780
How could the man behind the Choraengi Mask have one?

50
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,720
What? Palace staff?

51
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,920
This is the entry and exit log...

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,720
of the palace staff's from the last six months.

53
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,230
But why did you have me bring this?

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,230
We could have just inspected all of the staff's scent pouches.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,130
This scent pouch is his?

56
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,740
Scent pouches are typically used by women.

57
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,710
The Choraengi Mask?

58
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
A sack?

59
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,220
Five.

60
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,160
One.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,060
Once every five days.

62
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,830
You traded poisonous insects with the Choraengi Mask.

63
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,240
Is that correct?

64
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,310
Find a court lady...

65
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,510
who left between 9pm and 1am every 5 days.

66
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,740
This...

67
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,210
You want me to search through all of this?

68
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,650
This is tyranny and an abuse of power.

69
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,950
It is not an abuse of power when the Crown Prince does it.

70
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,390
Besides,

71
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,120
you would rather be looking through this log...

72
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,690
than at your name in the death book, would you not?

73
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,700
(Jo Myeong Im)

74
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,770
(Jo Myeong Im)

75
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,610
Over the past 3 months, once every 5 days,

76
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,120
only one person left regularly at 9pm or 1am.

77
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,560
Where is the Chief Court Lady now?

78
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,440
This was found in the Chief Court Lady's quarters.

79
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
So the Chief Court Lady really was the Choraengi Mask.

80
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,520
The Left State Councillor's blade...

81
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,620
knows no hesitation.

82
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,960
Tell the Police Bureau to watch the snake catchers.

83
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,630
He will need to procure food for the Jimjo,

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,830
so he will be looking for new catchers.

85
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,070
If we move on them without reason,

86
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,870
the Left State Councillor will not approve.

87
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,410
Yes, that is too rash. If you could please reconsider...

88
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,480
There is...

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,710
There is no time.

90
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,620
I must end this before the Left State Councillor harms Dal.

91
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,920
I have to do something!

92
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,500
It is mine.

93
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,140
It is mine.

94
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,030
This...

95
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,300
I received this before I entered the palace.

96
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,300
This one thing...

97
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,340
is mine.

98
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Dal.

99
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,710
Dal, are you all right? Dal.

100
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,380
Dal, are you all right?

101
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,390
This will not do. I will go get the Royal Physician.

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,070
Why am I here?

103
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,200
Have we not switched back?

104
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,640
Here, calm down and look. It is my face.

105
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,820
But...

106
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,260
how did we switch back then?

107
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,960
I am not sure either.

108
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,030
When I came to after being whipped, we had already switched back.

109
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,270
When we switched bodies before, we were not whipped.

110
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,410
Still, it is a relief...

111
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,250
that we have switched back.

112
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,680
How can you be smiling right now?

113
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,350
What do you want me to do?

114
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,420
- I had to save you. - Who asked you to save me?

115
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,890
Since I got tangled up with you, I have not had a moment's peace.

116
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,230
And do you have any idea how many times I nearly died?

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,500
I cannot stand to see you like this by my side.

118
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,010
In any case,

119
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
we agreed I would leave once we switched back.

120
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,610
Who said you could leave?

121
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,980
I am going to make you my concubine.

122
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,820
I have to keep you in my sight.

123
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,630
I need to keep you close so I know you are safe.

124
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,660
From now on,

125
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,560
I will be your shield,

126
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,070
and you will hide behind me.

127
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,640
Until that shield is broken.

128
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,150
I told you to stay at my chambers. Why did you insist on coming here?

129
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,050
You were just dying for your silk bed, were you not?

130
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,160
Now that you have switched back, you can enjoy it all you want.

131
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,360
As if there is only one silk bed in this whole palace.

132
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,730
Here. I hope this eases your pain, even just a little.

133
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,640
You are in no condition to be up. Lie down. I will leave you to rest.

134
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,950
Actually...

135
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Yes? What is it?

136
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,260
- Is there something you need? - No, that is not it.

137
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,390
It is just something I was wondering.

138
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
It is about...

139
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,930
that Four Frames of Life painting.

140
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,900
What?

141
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:03,630
Why did you put it in that love letter?

142
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,870
You know,

143
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,540
the one that goes, "The night is dark, and the moon is bright."

144
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,980
Or whatever. That one.

145
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,820
In a letter so cheesy,

146
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,350
why did you tuck in a drawing...

147
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,290
of the two of us?

148
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,630
That is...

149
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,830
The thing is...

150
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,820
The Left State Councillor will make bolder attempts to harm Dal.

151
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,390
Instead of a hasty confession,

152
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,920
taking down the Left State Councillor must come first.

153
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,330
There was nowhere else to put it.

154
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,100
Then I guess...

155
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,739
you are making me a Royal Concubine...

156
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,840
because there is nowhere else for me.

157
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,609
You must stay by my side until I find evidence...

158
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,180
and take down the Left State Councillor.

159
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,580
You were hurt because of me,

160
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,750
so I have to take responsibility.

161
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,530
What am I, bruised fruit?

162
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,670
Or a cracked pot?

163
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,870
And what is all this about making me a concubine because I got hurt?

164
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,780
And what about "until I take down the Left State Councillor" part?

165
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,180
Once you are done with him, will you just toss me aside too?

166
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,750
And I thought maybe his heart...

167
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,590
was for me, not the Crown Princess.

168
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,160
Talk about counting my chickens before they hatched.

169
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,330
It really stings.

170
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,070
Goodness.

171
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,940
Why on earth am I hurting inside and out?

172
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
This is just miserable.

173
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,280
A Royal Concubine?

174
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,919
Do you think the Left State Councillor will just sit by...

175
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,520
if you bring in a concubine before the Royal Wedding?

176
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,190
I am no longer afraid of the Left State Councillor.

177
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,590
He would kill his own people without a second thought.

178
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,430
I must protect Dal.

179
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,030
This time, I swear...

180
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,770
I will protect her at all costs.

181
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,640
Please help me.

182
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,350
Father.

183
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,520
Your Majesty.

184
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,830
What parent can ever win against their child?

185
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,180
I hereby appoint Park Dal...

186
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,950
as Crown Prince's Concubine of the Junior Fifth Rank.

187
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,730
From this day forward, this girl will be attending to you.

188
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,040
I am Yeon Sim of the Hong clan. I will serve you devotedly.

189
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,410
Thank you. I'm counting on you too.

190
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,110
You must address her informally. To do otherwise is against protocol.

191
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,880
But we have only just met.

192
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,280
How can you say that when I brought your former roommate?

193
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,990
I see.

194
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,130
Right, right.

195
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,660
But...

196
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,330
why are you suddenly speaking with an accent?

197
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,230
It is just...

198
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,900
Your Royal Highness.

199
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,080
Well,

200
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,110
did you sleep well?

201
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,410
Yes.

202
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,980
I did.

203
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,820
You have...

204
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,430
put your hair up.

205
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,390
Oh, my hair...

206
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
Yes.

207
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,000
Does it look strange?

208
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,940
No, it is just...

209
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,780
It looks good on you.

210
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,790
Your Royal Highness.

211
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,330
- What is it? - Hurry.

212
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,930
What is all the fuss about? What is it?

213
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,880
- Your Royal Highness. - What has happened here?

214
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,710
Poisonous insects were found in the jar, Your Highness.

215
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,819
They are from the medicinal food merchants,

216
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,650
so perhaps there was a mix-up.

217
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,550
I will launch an investigation at once.

218
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,190
Cheonghye Merchant Guild?

219
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,060
Who manages the deliveries from the merchant guilds?

220
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,930
The previous Chief Court Lady was in charge of it.

221
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,530
Where are you going?

222
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,700
If its food has appeared, then the creature must be here too.

223
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,610
Do you have any idea where it could be?

224
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,650
A place known only to the Chief Court Lady.

225
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,750
Somewhere dark and damp within the palace.

226
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,320
No way. This tiny little thing is the Jimjo?

227
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,160
It is a fledgling.

228
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,700
- We have to find the mother. - Now we have found its young,

229
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,400
will this not be enough to implicate the Left State Councillor?

230
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,340
The log, the feather from her room, and now this secret cell.

231
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,340
It all fits a little too perfectly that she is the owner of the Jimjo.

232
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,580
That is true.

233
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,150
There is no evidence linking her to the Left State Councillor.

234
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,480
This Jimjo chick...

235
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,950
is a taunt and a warning from the Left State Councillor.

236
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,450
So he planned to use her as a scapegoat from the beginning.

237
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,560
What is more,

238
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,990
it is a warning to stop digging into the Gyesa Year Incident.

239
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,570
As you commanded, I have made sure all the evidence...

240
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,980
points to the Chief Court Lady as the owner.

241
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,110
The entry log, the feather in her quarters,

242
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,080
and the Jimjo's food have all been planted.

243
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,090
By now,

244
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,990
our dear Crown Prince must be quite confused.

245
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,200
But is it really okay for the Crown Prince to have found the Jimjo?

246
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,270
Since the Jimjo was found inside the palace,

247
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,600
he will not be so quick to reveal its existence.

248
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
More importantly,

249
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,640
I ordered you to kill everyone involved with my Jimjo.

250
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,210
How does the Crown Prince know about you?

251
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,650
Why is he checking snake catchers?

252
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,020
Did a dead man start talking? Is that it?

253
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,400
Is someone I had killed still alive? Is that what happened?

254
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,760
Please kill me.

255
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,100
Do not disappoint me again.

256
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,510
Your mother deserves to be free, does she not?

257
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,240
Yes, Your Excellency.

258
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,810
A Jimjo chick was found inside the palace.

259
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,390
Do you know a way to use the chick to find its mother?

260
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,750
How could a Jimjo chick have come from the palace?

261
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,330
- Why are you looking at me? - Only you speak Qing, Highness.

262
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,900
What makes you think I can speak their language?

263
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,570
Gang. You understand the Qing language?

264
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,700
Well...

265
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,570
I picked some up here and there.

266
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,810
Hey, last time we met, I noticed you can speak Joseon,

267
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,450
so just speak in Joseon.

268
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,420
Why must I yield to you as the Crown Prince? I have my pride.

269
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,820
Your Royal Highness, he might change his mind anytime.

270
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,690
You should set aside your pride for now...

271
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,490
and get the information we need first.

272
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,300
- No, I mean... - The chick...

273
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,800
- The chick? - It cannot kill people.

274
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,799
That is why its mother protects it.

275
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,900
I see.

276
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,440
Its venom is weak, so the mother protects it.

277
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,580
Is he talking about maternal instinct?

278
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,610
A long time ago, a chick was sold far away.

279
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,820
Its mother found it and brought it back home.

280
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,850
Home? You mean...

281
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,990
It would return to the place it was confined?

282
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,340
A homing instinct?

283
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,880
You said it was sold far away. How far exactly?

284
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,490
The next village over.

285
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,690
About 8km.

286
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,560
About 8km?

287
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,060
What is it, Your Highness?

288
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,730
For the mother to fetch its chick from 8km away,

289
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,400
it must have heard the chick's cries and come for it.

290
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,000
Which means...

291
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,010
the chick should be able to hear its mother's cries too.

292
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,850
For now, our best bet is to use the chick to find its mother.

293
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,020
Since adult Jimjo birds are large and usually kept in mountain caves,

294
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,650
we will search the nearby mountains...

295
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,930
Wait a moment.

296
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,600
I need to speak with her.

297
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,600
You promised to send Dal away when your bodies switched.

298
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,170
But now she is a Royal Concubine?

299
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,740
Did I not tell you? I told you you could not protect Dal!

300
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,550
Something has felt off all along.

301
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,949
The fact that you planned to flee to Qing when I, the Crown Prince,

302
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,720
promised I would protect Dal.

303
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,659
You believed that absurd tale about our bodies switching.

304
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,720
And now,

305
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,030
your desperate attempts to keep me and Dal apart.

306
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,140
Just like with the Crown Princess five years ago,

307
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,780
do you want to lose Dal to the Left State Councillor as well?

308
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,080
I am begging you, let Dal go.

309
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,450
Dal...

310
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,160
said she is tired of living on the run.

311
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,460
And I will protect her this time, no matter what.

312
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,070
Both Dal and her dreams.

313
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,140
A Crown Prince's concubine?

314
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,680
With the Royal Wedding just days away,

315
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,980
he is taking a concubine?

316
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,450
He defies you, Left State Councillor!

317
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,590
How can you be so calm? What if she bears him a son?

318
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,760
Is there anyone more troublesome...

319
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,760
than the firstborn son of a Royal Concubine?

320
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,300
Just wait and see.

321
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,640
After all, there is no stronger leash than a weakness.

322
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,880
- Your Highness! Left State... - Unbelievable.

323
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,879
He has tossed propriety to the dogs, has he not?

324
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,180
Your Royal Highness, this is not about propriety now.

325
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,049
It is the Left State Councillor.

326
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,390
With Concubine Park... He is...

327
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,860
We meet again, Lady Park.

328
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,100
Left State Councillor. What brings you all the way here?

329
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,570
I came to apologise for my rudeness during the recent interrogation...

330
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,440
and to congratulate you on becoming a Royal Concubine.

331
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,900
And for a few other reasons.

332
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,710
- I also had something to confirm. - Confirm what?

333
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,380
That is all right.

334
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,020
I have already confirmed what I needed to.

335
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,860
Your Royal Highness.

336
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,470
What brings you here all of a sudden?

337
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,410
To what do we owe the honour, Your Royal Highness?

338
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,449
A state councillor meeting the Royal Concubine alone...

339
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,619
in broad daylight...

340
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,850
I was worried it might cause talk, so I came.

341
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,850
I am moved by Your Royal Highness's concern for me,

342
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,960
I could weep.

343
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,760
Lady Park, you may leave us.

344
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Pardon?

345
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,540
Yes, Your Highness.

346
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,930
Then I, too, shall take my leave.

347
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,300
But, Your Royal Highness.

348
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,830
Why take on another weakness with that soft heart of yours?

349
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,970
What do you...

350
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:11,010
A person's greatest weakness is love.

351
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,640
Did I not tell you so?

352
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,080
I shall take my leave.

353
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,920
I lost the Crown Princess, and with her, my laughter and love.

354
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,520
This concubine appointment is a matter of responsibility.

355
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,430
As you know, Lady Park saved my life at Sinjusa.

356
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,000
She is the one who saved my life and was harmed because of me.

357
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,100
How could I possibly turn my back on her?

358
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,780
It seems you thought you found a way to protect her from me,

359
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,410
but instead, you have only been exposed.

360
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,820
I am talking about your affection, which you concealed with this lie.

361
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,470
What were you thinking, going to him because he summoned you?

362
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,910
Have you already forgotten why you became a concubine?

363
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,250
How could I forget? You remind me every chance you get.

364
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,850
Fine.

365
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,590
I will just hole up in this pavilion so I do not get in your way.

366
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,930
Just bear with it for a little longer.

367
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,300
I am slowly making progress.

368
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,300
You just met with the boy from Qing, did you not?

369
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,140
What did he say? Is he still refusing to talk?

370
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,110
It seems the chick and its mother communicate over long distances.

371
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,580
Since the birds are originally from the high mountains,

372
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,880
it is a plausible theory. The hunters died within three days.

373
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,120
The bird must be within a three-day round trip from the capital.

374
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,390
Then it is highly likely it is inside the capital.

375
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,719
He hid it for five years,

376
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,690
so it is somewhere tied to the Left State Councillor.

377
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,760
I will narrow down the locations and use the chick to find its mother.

378
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,460
Once I capture the Jimjo alive...

379
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,800
and prove its habitat is linked to the Left State Councillor,

380
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,900
he will be finished for treason.

381
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,110
- Great. What should I do? - Nothing!

382
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,640
Now that I have my body back, this revenge is mine and mine alone.

383
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,910
Forget half. You are not even getting a sliver.

384
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,350
So, from now on, stay out of the Gyesa Year Incident.

385
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,520
If you were not going to let me in on it,

386
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,290
then why did you explain the plan in such detail?

387
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,850
It was not a plan. It was an explanation.

388
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,190
That I will finish my revenge myself without your help...

389
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,830
and take down the Left State Councillor.

390
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,660
Because I...

391
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,200
have staked my life on this revenge.

392
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,710
If you give your life for someone who is already dead,

393
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,950
you will just end up with two dead people.

394
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,650
The living are meant to live.

395
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,420
Idiot.

396
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,860
The Crown Prince's Concubine will be the Deposed Crown Princess.

397
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,230
But many have already seen her body. How can we...

398
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,400
What they saw was a corpse, decayed beyond recognition.

399
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,510
Public opinion is more powerful than evidence.

400
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,750
People lose their lives over false accusations of adultery,

401
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,620
and a poisoning can be twisted into a curse.

402
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:45,260
So why would they not believe someone dead is now alive?

403
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,730
I will reach the concubine's neighbours in Boryeong.

404
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,130
Here are the mountains within three days of the capital.

405
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,210
They must have hidden it somewhere difficult to find.

406
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,740
- The chick can lead us to its mom. - Yes.

407
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,410
Still, we have come a long way.

408
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,020
When you think about it, it is thanks to Prince Je Un's book.

409
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,950
My apologies, Your Highness.

410
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,990
Do not be.

411
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,990
It is not like you are wrong.

412
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,400
I am glad you know Choraengi Mask is the Chief Court Lady.

413
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,030
I have felt awful this whole time that I could not be of any help.

414
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,800
Why are you not calling me out?

415
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,540
You should ask why I took everything and then ignored our promise.

416
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,210
You should be yelling at me, calling me a coward and a jerk.

417
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,620
Your silence makes me want to fight with you for no reason.

418
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,950
What are you talking about?

419
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,520
The Choraengi Mask's identity and that the Jimjo is alive...

420
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,890
I discovered all of that thanks to the book you wrote.

421
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,730
I got something out of it too, so we are even for you deceiving me.

422
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,200
And since we made a promise,

423
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,900
I will guarantee the Crown Princess Consort's safety.

424
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,040
- Thank you, Gang! - Get off me. That is disgusting.

425
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,010
This is what brothers do.

426
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,280
By the way, what is going on?

427
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,180
What is this about Dal becoming the Crown Prince's Concubine?

428
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,020
I am doing it to protect her.

429
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,659
I will prove that the Left State Councillor...

430
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,930
is the master of the Jimjo.

431
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,730
When I do, you take the Crown Princess Consort... No.

432
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,230
Take your woman's hand and run away.

433
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,580
Protect your love.

434
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,000
When I said you were horrible, I lied.

435
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,100
And when I said I was over you,

436
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,540
that was a lie.

437
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,710
- Why all of a sudden? - Left State Councillor will fall.

438
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,310
And you will be dragged down with him.

439
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,950
- My father will not fall. - He will.

440
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,360
When he does, I will take your hand and we will run away together.

441
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,030
That day will never come.

442
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,260
It will. It most certainly will.

443
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,370
We will be happy. We must be. So please,

444
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,270
trust me and just wait a little longer.

445
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,390
Consummate our marriage?

446
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,070
Why are they suddenly washing me?

447
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,140
Do I smell or something?

448
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,970
Do I?

449
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,410
You are to spend the night with the Crown Prince.

450
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,550
What? You mean sleep with him?

451
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,860
Yes.

452
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,830
Wait, hold on. I am not physically ready...

453
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,129
I mean, I am not mentally prepared,

454
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,230
and I just... Oh, I cannot.

455
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,300
This is so mortifying.

456
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,450
How are you feeling?

457
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,320
- Are you feeling okay? - Yes, well...

458
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,350
Yes, well...

459
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,220
Well, yes.

460
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Good.

461
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,890
That is a relief.

462
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,800
Hey, what are you doing with the tie?

463
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,340
It is time for bed. It is late.

464
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,130
What are you waiting for? Put out the light.

465
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Yes.

466
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,170
I will turn it off.

467
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,140
Gosh, this is not going to work.

468
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Are you in pain?

469
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,810
Your back?

470
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,410
No, I am fine. It is nothing.

471
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
You are clearly not fine.

472
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,220
Goodness.

473
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
Here is some medicine.

474
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,530
I will not look, so go on and apply it.

475
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,940
Gosh.

476
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,210
Thank you.

477
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,610
- Do not look. - I am not looking.

478
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,340
Gosh.

479
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,450
Goodness.

480
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,420
My gosh.

481
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,890
Are you done?

482
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,930
Hold on. It is on my back.

483
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,670
You see, applying something to one's own back,

484
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,800
it is not easy, anatomically. One, two...

485
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,770
This is so distracting.

486
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,780
Gosh, that hurts.

487
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,180
You said you would not look!

488
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,220
Calm down and hold still.

489
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,980
Give me the ointment.

490
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,130
I am just treating your wound, so do not get any funny ideas.

491
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,570
What? Who said I was?

492
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,390
The Queen Dowager.

493
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,830
With a girl in this much pain,

494
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,960
what does she expect me to do?

495
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,100
It is not like I am an animal.

496
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,570
Turns out I am the animal here. It was me.

497
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,270
What was that?

498
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,740
Nothing!

499
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,200
I hate this. I really do.

500
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,050
Did you hear the snake catcher family was recently wiped out?

501
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,950
- They say it was the Jimjo Poison. - So I heard.

502
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,990
It is terrifying. How is anyone supposed to live?

503
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,450
I am telling you, a new Crown Princess is coming.

504
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,890
Queen Jangjeong's vengeful spirit is running rampant.

505
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,020
A woman determined to end the Royal Family's line...

506
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,860
- We were just getting some soup... - No.

507
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,859
It is not a curse. It is the Jimjo Poison.

508
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,170
Good grief, were you not listening?

509
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,599
Curse or poison, it is a bad omen.

510
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,940
Something so horrid to happen right before the Royal Wedding.

511
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,440
Whose fault do you think it is? The new Crown Princess's, of course.

512
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,740
For goodness' sake.

513
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,180
Your Highness. Please do not mind such petty rumours.

514
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,490
Let them gossip all they want. You will be the Crown Princess soon.

515
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,820
The Chief Court Lady died recently, did she not?

516
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,630
Pardon?

517
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,030
Yes.

518
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,830
But why bring up the Chief Court Lady all of a sudden?

519
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
No reason.

520
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,770
I just thought maybe I would not become the Crown Princess...

521
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,540
after all.

522
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
Are we...

523
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,590
close enough to be holding hands?

524
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,920
This is a hand held in farewell.

525
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,420
Please, call off this Royal Wedding.

526
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,960
This whole scenario feels awfully familiar.

527
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,860
If I say no,

528
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,670
are you going to shoot me again?

529
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,240
It really hurt, by the way.

530
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,140
Getting shot.

531
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,310
If you knew everything, why did you not punish me?

532
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,580
Because if you got hurt, Je Un would not be able to go on.

533
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,780
I am glad you are alive.

534
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,520
What is this? A sudden change of heart?

535
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,960
Because Prince Je Un needs at least one family member...

536
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,590
like you, Your Royal Highness.

537
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,930
I followed my ambitions, so I have no regrets.

538
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,800
And I intend to keep doing so.

539
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,410
I will give you the crucial evidence you need to bring down my father.

540
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,010
Give me your word.

541
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,210
If I tell you where the Jimjo is,

542
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,350
you must guarantee that Prince Je Un and I...

543
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,920
will be able to escape and live in safety.

544
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,190
Where is it?

545
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,760
The Jimjo.

546
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,020
This Jimjo is how I seized control of Joseon.

547
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,960
But you know what?

548
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,960
The Jimjo's true value...

549
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,970
is not in its poison, but in its secrecy.

550
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,170
Once its existence is known, it is no better than any poison.

551
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,340
But now, rumours of the Jimjo Poison are spreading among the people.

552
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,210
Did you use the Jimjo Poison on the snake catchers?

553
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,780
Now that I have been exposed,

554
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,390
I feared a Police Bureau inquiry would lead to the guild,

555
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,490
so I made their deaths mysterious...

556
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,890
The Jimjo Poison...

557
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,090
should have only been used for the Gyesa Year Incident.

558
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,400
The Gyesa Year Incident was meant to remain a rumour forever.

559
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:34,640
But you have ruined everything.

560
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,710
Please kill me.

561
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,550
I will be the one to decide when you die.

562
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:53,590
Seal off every secret passage connected to this place.

563
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,590
And if the Crown Prince manages to find his way here,

564
00:45:58,430 --> 00:45:59,430
eliminate him.

565
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,470
The Crown Prince...

566
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,770
You are ordering me to kill him?

567
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,850
It is a beautiful day, is it not?

568
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,690
- Yes. - Heard of the new royal concubine?

569
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,830
So what if she got the title?

570
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,500
I heard His Royal Highness has only visited her once.

571
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,930
Still, I am jealous she gets to be a royal concubine.

572
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,669
Jealous? She is just a replacement.

573
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,540
Exactly. To replace the last one.

574
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,340
The nerve of those girls.

575
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,940
Just ignore them.

576
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,050
You see a chicken a lot more often than a pheasant, right?

577
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,970
My lady, why are you out here? You should be inside.

578
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,980
There is a distillery at the foot of Mount Inwang.

579
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,890
It belonged to my father for a long time,

580
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,220
but one day, he gave ownership to the former Chief Court Lady.

581
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,360
And shortly after that,

582
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,930
the Gyesa Year Incident took place.

583
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,570
(The distillery)

584
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:45,730
The distillery.

585
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,680
This way.

586
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,160
This is a regular cave, is it not? If it is not here,

587
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,290
how could a Jimjo possibly live in that tiny house?

588
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:20,800
There is something to this distillery. Otherwise,

589
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,329
the Chief Court Lady's deed and this secret passage...

590
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:23,570
would not make any sense.

591
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,570
And how do you explain the fledgling's frantic cries?

592
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,940
- A rat! - Will you keep it down?

593
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,190
Do you hear that?

594
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,060
The sound of chains.

595
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,300
There is definitely something in here.

596
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,530
- The sound is getting louder. - I know.

597
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,580
Darn it.

598
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,550
Why did you bring that?

599
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,590
We are facing the monster Jimjo. Was I supposed to come empty-handed?

600
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,160
Darn.

601
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:56,190
Gosh.

602
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,530
(Yeon Wol, I will avenge you)

603
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,700
This one thing...

604
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,030
is mine.

605
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,040
What about Dal?

606
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:25,550
Where is Dal?

607
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,920
I thought she said she would wait. Did she leave already?

608
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:33,150
- Did she go to the Jimjo chick? - What?

609
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,190
Why would Dal go there?

610
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,890
- Right. It was a secret. - Spit it out!

611
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,930
The thing is...

612
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,700
Lady Park wanted to help with the Gyesa Year Incident.

613
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,600
So she guards the chick every day from the Left State Councillor.

614
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,670
Your Highness!

615
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,149
- Hey. - Yes?

616
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:02,950
What were you thinking?

617
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,290
How could you let Dal come here all by herself?

618
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,890
What if the Left State Councillor had actually sent his men after her?

619
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,430
No, of course I tried to stop her.

620
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:14,860
Wait, but...

621
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:16,870
If she did not come here,

622
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,170
then why did she just leave?

623
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,440
Why did you put ointment on my wounds?

624
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:29,950
I hope it would hurt a little less.

625
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,520
Why did you shield me?

626
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:34,850
From now on,

627
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,920
I will be your shield,

628
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,390
and you will hide behind me.

629
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,760
And yet, all you have left for me is a sense of duty.

630
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,690
This concubine appointment is a matter of responsibility.

631
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,530
She is the one who saved my life and was harmed because of me.

632
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,660
How could I possibly turn my back on her?

633
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,250
Is this feeling a sickness too?

634
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,550
The more I fall for him,

635
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,220
the more of a coward I become.

636
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,120
How pathetic.

637
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,640
What? You might as well just faint.

638
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,170
If I passed out, you would just leave me behind.

639
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,810
I am tempted to leave you behind even if you do not.

640
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:38,550
You will guard this place every day so Dal is never left alone here.

641
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,980
- Got it? - You want me to...

642
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,320
guard this place? This place that is crawling with rats? Me?

643
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,220
To the rats, you are the scary one, you idiot.

644
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,260
That is why they are all scurrying away from you.

645
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,030
Rats?

646
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,900
Rats!

647
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
Rats.

648
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,550
It was not a wall.

649
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,510
It was a door all along.

650
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:06,770
Come out.

651
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,600
Who is there?

652
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,840
It is the Choraengi Mask.

653
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,110
Destroy this place,

654
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:28,320
and make the Crown Prince himself release the Jimjo.

655
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,620
Seize him!

656
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,930
Your Royal Highness.

657
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,000
It is explosive!

658
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,240
Yoon Se Dol!

659
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,610
Get out!

660
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,580
It's the Jimjo! Go after it!

661
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,880
Yes, Your Highness!

662
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,450
- Go after it! - Yes, Your Highness!

663
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,990
That is toward the palace.

664
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,800
Its maternal instinct is strong. It must be going to its chick.

665
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,570
We have to get to the palace immediately.

666
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,739
Lady Park wanted to help with the Gyesa Year Incident.

667
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,670
So she guards the chick every day from the Left State Councillor.

668
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,540
Dal.

669
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,440
Dal.

670
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,630
The Jimjo's tracks...

671
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,870
are all gone.

672
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,070
There is no other way now.

673
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,910
We must capture the Jimjo alive.

674
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:53,530
What is that?

675
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,900
What's that?

676
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,860
Look! Over there! What is that?

677
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,130
What is that?

678
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:28,600
- What is all this commotion? - Your Majesty, look over there...

679
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:33,300
My goodness, what in the world is that?

680
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,200
I am not sure, Your Majesty.

681
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,080
A Jimjo?

682
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,780
Your Majesty, it is dangerous! Please get to safety.

683
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,390
- Your Majesty. Hurry! - Yes. Get Her Majesty to safety.

684
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,660
- Yes! - This way.

685
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,560
Why is the Jimjo here?

686
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,070
The chick?

687
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:47,640
- Get the flaming arrows ready! - Yes, sir!

688
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:49,580
Once I capture the Jimjo alive...

689
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,110
and prove its habitat is linked to the Left State Councillor,

690
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,520
he will be finished for treason.

691
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,350
I have staked my life on this revenge.

692
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,020
If it dies here,

693
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,090
we cannot prove the Left State Councillor is behind this.

694
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,190
We have to capture it alive. I cannot let that happen.

695
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,130
We must capture it alive.

696
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:11,600
Lady Park, you should not get involved. Please get to safety.

697
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,870
I will take full responsibility.

698
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,440
I will lure the bird. Evacuate the court ladies first.

699
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:20,810
Then, have the Royal Guard go to the square and prepare the ropes.

700
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:23,410
It must be captured alive.

701
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,680
- Go. - Yes, my lady.

702
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,950
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

703
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,420
Yes, we will move to Injeongjeon Hall.

704
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,590
- To the Injeongjeon Hall! - Yes, sir!

705
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,970
Your Royal Highness, Lady Park...

706
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,080
Dal, do not do anything.

707
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,210
Please, do not do anything reckless.

708
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,270
I am sorry.

709
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:26,710
It is here!

710
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,440
Your chick is right here!

711
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,720
Gosh!

712
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,260
Lady Park, get back!

713
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,339
Take it! Do not let it escape!

714
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,470
- Do not let it escape! - Yes, sir!

715
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,380
Your Royal Highness.

716
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:50,990
I am alive.

717
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:55,460
What, you think you have nine lives? That death will just spare you?

718
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,560
What in the world were you thinking?

719
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,400
But I...

720
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,730
I was just...

721
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,540
trying to help you.

722
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,040
I told you not to help! I told you repeatedly to stay out.

723
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,970
Why do you keep interfering with my revenge?

724
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:16,180
You nearly ruined everything!

725
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:23,280
It is because I know how much this revenge means to you.

726
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:27,690
How could I just stand by and do nothing?

727
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,620
Your Royal Highness.

728
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:26,910
Jimjo poison.

729
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,180
It has a clear, odourless, tasteless oil.

730
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,620
From the oil gland in its wattle.

731
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:07,960
If it dies...

732
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,340
It is all over.

733
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:26,710
It is all over.

734
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:30,780
Everything...

735
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:33,350
is over.

736
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,750
Because of me.

737
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:43,160
It is all ruined because of me.

738
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,380
Gang Yeon Wol.

739
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,280
You are like the heavens,

740
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,350
and your heart...

741
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:41,650
I will hold it forever, with no regrets.

742
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:47,190
You must...

743
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,520
fly free...

744
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,490
and rest in peace.

745
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,730
Gosh.

746
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:00,290
Why are you sleeping out here?

747
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,400
No reason.

748
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,370
I just could not bring myself...

749
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,510
to sleep soundly.

750
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,040
I am so sorry.

751
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,810
I have ruined everything.

752
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,850
The most important thing to you, Your Highness,

753
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,490
was avenging the Crown Princess.

754
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:28,320
And now, because of me, it is all ruined.

755
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:31,990
What are you talking about?

756
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,130
I protected what was most important.

757
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,100
But the Jimjo is dead, so your revenge is ruined, is it not?

758
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:39,870
For that revenge...

759
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,140
I heard you were even willing to risk your life.

760
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,980
Revenge was the only way...

761
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,450
I could atone to the Crown Princess.

762
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,180
Filled with so much hatred and guilt,

763
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:59,550
I could not come to you.

764
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:04,390
But if you had died,

765
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,390
I would have had nowhere left to go.

766
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I just...

767
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:16,270
I thought...

768
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:19,610
you must be furious with me.

769
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:23,110
So furious you would never want to see me again.

770
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:27,580
I thought that all day, so I just...

771
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:31,020
The fault is not yours. It is mine.

772
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,090
I was angry at myself for always...

773
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,560
putting you in harm's way.

774
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,840
How could I ever be angry with you?

775
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,380
You are the sole exception to all my anger.

776
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,950
I meant to tell you after my revenge was complete.

777
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,520
But you are having such foolish thoughts,

778
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,890
so I have no choice but to tell you now.

779
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:14,290
That I...

780
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,170
I am very deeply...

781
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,480
in love...

782
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:34,820
with you, Park Dal.

783
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:46,030
Me too.

784
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:37,700
(Moon River)

785
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:55,560
I am not going to let you go, even if you talk my ear off.

786
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,560
So you hold on to me tight too.

787
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:00,090
The Crown Prince and his Concubine are so lovey-dovey.

788
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:04,200
The entire palace is buzzing. And if she were to conceive...

789
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,230
Who do I look like to you now?

790
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,170
And I... who do you see before you now?

791
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,570
Because of one woman,

792
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,410
five years of hard work have crumbled to dust.

793
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:16,040
A fledgling Jimjo's toxin is weak.

794
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,410
It cannot become a true Jimjo.

795
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,680
It seems another sacrifice will be required.

796
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:45,040
(Moon River)
