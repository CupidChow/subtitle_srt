1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,850
(Kang Tae Oh)

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,920
(Kim Se Jeong)

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,520
(Lee Sin Young)

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,390
(Hong Su Zu)

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,060
(Jin Goo)

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,630
(Nam Gi Ae)

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,370
(And Kim Nam Hee)

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,049
(Moon River)

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,350
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,680
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,020
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,620
So that makes you Heungbu, the good guy,

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,360
and a swallow never abandons Heungbu.

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,560
I did not catch you.

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,870
You caught me.

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,070
You are the one who came running to my side.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,440
So you have to save me.

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,480
Protect me with everything you have.

19
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,350
That is an order.

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,810
It is his.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,220
This darn jade ring for gat.

22
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,820
It is His Royal Highness' ring.

23
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,120
We do not have time for this.

24
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,730
We must get this news to His Majesty at once.

25
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,330
The Crown Prince is alive. This complicates things.

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Yeo Ri.

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,240
Where is the Chief Royal Secretary?

28
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,240
This is delicious!

29
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,479
All right. Enough eating.

30
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,750
- Come here! - What are you doing?

31
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,289
What do you think you are doing? How dare you. Do you know who I am?

32
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,320
Neither of us has clean hands here.

33
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,090
Send the court lady out.

34
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,230
How did you...

35
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,780
You killed the Crown Prince?

36
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,420
Would you believe it if you were me?

37
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,020
You are going to have to.

38
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,690
Because my father is looking for a scapegoat to offer up in my place.

39
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,989
But why me? I have done nothing.

40
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,160
You are Grand Prince Je Un's maternal first cousin.

41
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,160
And you tried to back him to replace the Crown Prince, did you not?

42
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,500
What is it that you want?

43
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Put Grand Prince Je Un on the throne.

44
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,770
And by his side...

45
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,610
is where I will be.

46
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,210
What do you need me to do?

47
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,509
The Left State Councilor's daughter tried to make...

48
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,250
Grand Prince Je Un the Crown Prince?

49
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,819
Yes, Your Highness. Since the Crown Prince is alive,

50
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,350
she wants me to take care of the loose ends.

51
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,390
Your Highness, what should I do?

52
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,660
I see now.

53
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,830
That explains everything.

54
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,860
Pardon?

55
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:22,270
Follow the Left State Council's daughter's plan only halfway.

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,070
It seems Grand Prince Je Un is fated to die by another's hand.

57
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,990
Darn it.

58
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,960
The way I see it,

59
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,530
he saved my legs just to make me overwork.

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,100
There is no other explanation for it. Right?

61
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,270
Gosh!

62
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,400
Okay, let us try again.

63
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,780
We are almost there!

64
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,750
Goodness.

65
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,590
Wait, I do not think this man is asleep.

66
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,760
Goodness.

67
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,280
Huh!

68
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,010
Go!

69
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,320
Gosh, I am sorry.

70
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
You fool.

71
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,630
Why would you grab something so hot?

72
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,560
That was foolish.

73
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,050
Hey, I know you are not asleep. Get up. Hey.

74
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,550
Darn it.

75
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,220
She is Nolbu's wife, not the swallow.

76
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,360
That hurt.

77
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,730
(Chapter 4: A Swallow Does Not Just Repay Kindness)

78
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,120
Did you sleep well?

79
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,260
Yes.

80
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,130
Are you feeling any better?

81
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,670
- I should probably see a physician. - Is it that bad?

82
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,470
Let me see. I mean, I did my best to treat it.

83
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,120
- Thank you. - Sure.

84
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,890
Now, please take a look at her hand as well.

85
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,790
- Yes, my lord. - Me?

86
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,689
Gosh, it is okay. I am fine.

87
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,900
How can you say you are fine? Your palm is covered in blisters.

88
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,430
I am fine.

89
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,640
If you do not get treated, then neither will I.

90
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,870
- Hey. Take this off. - Yes, my lord.

91
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,269
- Gosh, do not do that. - Take it off this instant.

92
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,270
All right.

93
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,540
- Here. - Okay.

94
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,310
So stubborn.

95
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,450
You should have gotten it treated sooner.

96
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,100
Come on, open your eyes.

97
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,969
My lord.

98
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,970
Aide Cha of Hanyang Guild is here.

99
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,770
Aide Cha?

100
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,610
His Royal Highness sent a letter?

101
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,010
So Gang was alive.

102
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,219
I definitely gave Eunuch Yoon the letter.

103
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,290
But I have not been able to see him since that day.

104
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,420
And the Royal Army has no intention of making a move.

105
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,390
They have even restricted my access to the palace.

106
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,960
Someone is keeping His Highness from returning.

107
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,000
All right. I will go myself.

108
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,430
Should you not inform His Majesty first?

109
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,370
We cannot trust anyone in the palace right now.

110
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,670
I will go quietly and bring His Highness back.

111
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,510
My lady!

112
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,350
My lady. This is bad.

113
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,050
Grand Prince Je Un...

114
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
What about him?

115
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,710
A letter from His Royal Highness was found at your residence.

116
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,810
What was your motive for hiding the letter?

117
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,950
I was about to ask you the same thing.

118
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,580
Why would a letter I have never seen...

119
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,790
turn up at my home?

120
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,560
So you are saying you did not know His Royal Highness was alive?

121
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,360
I knew. That is why...

122
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,660
I sent men to rescue His Royal Highness.

123
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,300
How do we know if you sent those men to save His Royal Highness...

124
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,600
or to harm him?

125
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,370
Why would I try to harm my brother now?

126
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,780
You are...

127
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,380
the late king's legitimate eldest son.

128
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,190
If Queen Jangjeong had not been falsely accused of adultery...

129
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,190
and if the late king had not left a will forbidding you...

130
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,160
from ever inheriting the throne,

131
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,170
you would have been the one to rightfully take the throne.

132
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,970
I have never once entertained such a thought.

133
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,810
But would the Queen Dowager believe that?

134
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,340
That is not true!

135
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,550
If Grand Prince Je Un intended to harm His Royal Highness,

136
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,119
would he have sent Left Flank Guard,

137
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,720
a man who has served His Highness his entire life?

138
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,020
I will go quietly and bring His Highness back.

139
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,960
- Gosh, are you all right? - Hey.

140
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,600
Are you awake?

141
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,100
I will go.

142
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,470
If you make a move,

143
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,140
everyone in the palace will find out.

144
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,280
He is putting you in a compromising position.

145
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,280
What have I done?

146
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,379
When a guard who protects His Highness fails to fulfill his duty,

147
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,620
he must face severe punishment. You know that, do you not?

148
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,490
Sometimes, he must face death too.

149
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,690
Yet,

150
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,830
you just helped such a traitor escape.

151
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,110
If this is about Grand Prince Je Un, then go back to your room.

152
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,950
Nothing is going to change.

153
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,120
I admit defeat.

154
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,050
But do you know something?

155
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,690
Amateurs always choose...

156
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,160
self-destruction.

157
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,259
If so much as a hair of Grand Prince Je Un is injured,

158
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,890
I will take it straight to the Royal Investigation Office.

159
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,660
Do you think I would leave your legs to run on?

160
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,130
Break them, and I will crawl.

161
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,840
So if you want to stop me,

162
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,240
you will have to break my neck first.

163
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,870
Do you think I cannot?

164
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,210
- Is there anyone outside? - Yes, sir.

165
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,380
Did you look for me?

166
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,919
Lock up U Hui in her room...

167
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,789
and do not let her take a single step outside...

168
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,819
until the Royal Wedding.

169
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,850
Father.

170
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,190
Forgive me, my lady.

171
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,600
Do not lay a hand on me.

172
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,530
I will bite my tongue off and die.

173
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,190
What is it this time?

174
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,230
My goodness.

175
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,470
Let me see.

176
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,370
It is him.

177
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,210
Come on down, my lord.

178
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,650
Who are you?

179
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,850
Who sent you?

180
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,850
We took their money, so we must see the job through, right?

181
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,420
- What should we do, my lord? - Get down.

182
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,790
What?

183
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,860
It is too dangerous on the horse. Get down and just look forward.

184
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,160
Do not ever look back.

185
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,930
Okay.

186
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Here.

187
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,250
What should I do now, my lord?

188
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,990
My lord?

189
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,690
What is going on?

190
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,869
A man trying to save his own skin.

191
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,930
What a pathetic, cowardly sight.

192
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,500
Get over here!

193
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,370
Scum like you is not worth the air you breathe.

194
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,310
I know, right? Hey, give me that axe.

195
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,139
Would not someone who was betrayed...

196
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,850
be the best at swinging it?

197
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,779
I should not have saved him.

198
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,720
The Art of War states,

199
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,920
"Appear weak when you are strong."

200
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,360
Then again, my abilities are not exactly easy to hide.

201
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,200
And so, my strategy is this.

202
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,000
What is he saying?

203
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,070
Tackling it head-on.

204
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,440
- Are you okay? - Yes.

205
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,610
This way!

206
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,710
What do we do?

207
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,900
I will create a diversion, so you run.

208
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,540
Please stay alive this time.

209
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,210
Please.

210
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,960
I am pretty tough too, okay?

211
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,150
Goodness!

212
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,200
Oh, my!

213
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,230
- What? - Take this!

214
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,650
Hey.

215
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,390
No!

216
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,730
Goodness.

217
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,470
My lord!

218
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,510
Please save me!

219
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Shin Won.

220
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,170
My lord.

221
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,910
Please forgive us. Goodness.

222
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,150
You were alive.

223
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,590
Thank you.

224
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,960
Thank you for being alive.

225
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,960
Your Highness, more importantly, Grand Prince Je Un is in danger.

226
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,070
What about Grand Prince Je Un?

227
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,470
The Crown Prince is alive.

228
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,280
We will deal with Grand Prince Je Un...

229
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,749
after the Crown Prince returns.

230
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,550
And you are certain His Royal Highness can return?

231
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,620
They tried to assassinate His Royal Highness.

232
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,820
Desperate people fear nothing.

233
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,760
They will not hold back.

234
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,960
Do you really believe Grand Prince Je Un...

235
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,960
tried to kill the Crown Prince?

236
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,970
The truth does not matter.

237
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,140
What matters is that His Royal Highness is alive,

238
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,080
and that he must return safely.

239
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,550
The same prince you tried to protect...

240
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,580
by sacrificing everyone you loved, Your Majesty.

241
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,120
Do as you wish, Left State Councilor.

242
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,700
As you command, Your Majesty.

243
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,860
The Left State Councilor has acted.

244
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,630
That means he will not spare Grand Prince Je Un.

245
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,730
The problem is...

246
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,170
he is not the only one who wants Grand Prince Je Un dead.

247
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,040
What do you mean by that?

248
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,880
All the better.

249
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,210
Neither the Crown Prince...

250
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,380
nor legitimate Grand Prince Je Un is here.

251
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,960
If His Majesty dies now with no clear successor...

252
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,990
The right to name the next heir falls to the Queen Dowager.

253
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,229
Once Je Un is exiled...

254
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,430
and while the Left State Councilor's attention is on him,

255
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,200
she will poison my father.

256
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,369
Because Her Highness has never once forgotten...

257
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,700
the Gyesa Year incident.

258
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,669
Left State Councilor cannot exile Grand Prince Je Un right away...

259
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,240
since people are watching.

260
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,810
He will get rid of Je Un before I arrive.

261
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,280
Within the 6 to 7 days it will take...

262
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,750
to reach Hanyang from Yeongdeok.

263
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,610
When did you send the letter?

264
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,980
Today is the fifth day.

265
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,090
It will be the sixth day soon.

266
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,919
Even at full speed, it will take two days.

267
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,359
You cannot make it in your condition.

268
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Besides...

269
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,359
My men are ambushing all land routes...

270
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,100
from Yeongdeok to Hanyang.

271
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,270
You will never make it back to Hanyang.

272
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,070
You still do not get it, do you?

273
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,409
Hey, the land routes may be blocked, but what about the waterways?

274
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,910
The shipping lanes have not closed, have they?

275
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,950
What do you mean? Is there a way for us to go by boat?

276
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,450
Follow me.

277
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,490
I have got a fantastic swallow hidden nearby.

278
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,860
- No, really. I cannot be in debt. - No, it is fine.

279
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,000
When did you...

280
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,029
Apparently, that peddler saved the life...

281
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,830
the supervisor of the tax grain ships.

282
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,840
In return, they will provide us with a tax grain ship.

283
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,470
We should arrive at Mapo Ferry by tomorrow morning.

284
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,910
Then I will bring everything I can...

285
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,910
I owe Dal a great debt.

286
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,020
Will you have her accompany us to Hanyang?

287
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,450
She saved the Crown Prince many times.

288
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,520
Naturally, she must be rewarded.

289
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,990
Could you not just send a reward to her in Boryeong later?

290
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,760
Hey. If it was not for her, would we even have this ship?

291
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,570
Besides, when it comes to rewards,

292
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,540
you cannot just send money.

293
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,940
Shin Won, why are you so cold?

294
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,120
Thank you.

295
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,660
As you wish, Your Royal Highness.

296
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,900
Were you laughing at me?

297
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,810
You need more beating, do you not?

298
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,669
No, it was not that.

299
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,580
I was not laughing. It is so cold that I started to cough.

300
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,050
It was this, and you must have misunderstood.

301
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,220
Hold on.

302
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,960
These clothes look quite fine.

303
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,790
Staring will not make the boat go any faster, you know.

304
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
Come on, have a seat.

305
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,830
Let me change your bandage.

306
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,110
Grand Prince Je Un was arrested for treason.

307
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,520
The Grand Prince? Wait, hold on.

308
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
Treason?

309
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,690
Does that not mean his life is in danger?

310
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,790
I must go to him.

311
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,460
I am the only one who can save him.

312
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,390
But...

313
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,900
I am scared that it might be too late.

314
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,640
You know there is a saying.

315
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,010
- The more urgent it is... - Take the long way?

316
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,310
Why take the long way in a hurry? The more haste, the better the plan.

317
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,820
As soon as we reach Mapo Ferry, you should...

318
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,230
tighten this bandage.

319
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,230
Steel your heart and go straight ahead.

320
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Okay?

321
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,400
Fine. I will go straight there and come right back,

322
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,670
so wait at the Hanyang Merchant Guild.

323
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,880
Do not fly off to Gangnam.

324
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,240
Gangnam? What does that have to do with it?

325
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,340
You said you were a swallow.

326
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,350
A loyal swallow who does not abandon Heungbu.

327
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,250
Just you wait.

328
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,850
You will be the one getting the gourd.

329
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,060
An absolutely enormous one, at that.

330
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,920
Just do not be too shocked when you receive it.

331
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,700
Do not worry. I am a woman with material desires.

332
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,680
The moon is beautiful tonight.

333
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,320
It really is.

334
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:37,090
It is not even a full moon, but it is still beautiful.

335
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,770
My lord.

336
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,110
I will follow you.

337
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,060
Who are you looking for?

338
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,770
It is nothing.

339
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,780
Move, or I will slit my throat.

340
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,110
What are you all doing?

341
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,810
Do you not know my lady? She always follows through.

342
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,250
(Mapo Ferry)

343
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,600
I am sure those clothes looked different.

344
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,880
Go wait at the Hanyang Merchant Guild.

345
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,780
Okay.

346
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,090
Please be careful.

347
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,220
I will.

348
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,400
Come on, let us go.

349
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,299
Did you see Grand Prince Je Un being sent into exile...

350
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,600
at the market earlier?

351
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,439
They say he is being sent to an island near Yeongdeok.

352
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,880
Of course I saw.

353
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,810
What a terrible fate.

354
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,279
I must be at the palace before 11am.

355
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Before 11am?

356
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:52,879
His Majesty skips his morning meal.

357
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,620
He eats his breakfast at 11am.

358
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,919
He takes medicine 30 minutes later.

359
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,090
Then we must go there at once.

360
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,820
But Grand Prince Je Un is in danger too.

361
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,890
If he is exiled to an island, the Left State Councilor...

362
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,390
will deal with him on the ship.

363
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,200
Because that would be the cleanest way to do it.

364
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,629
If we are bringing the ruffians,

365
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,470
we cannot split up our men.

366
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,740
Your Highness. You have to make a choice.

367
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,200
Are the preparations complete?

368
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,470
Yes, sir. Grand Prince Je Un's ship will encounter a storm,

369
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,570
and it will be wrecked.

370
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,580
All the better.

371
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,250
Neither the Crown Prince...

372
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,280
nor legitimate Grand Prince Je Un is here.

373
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,460
If His Majesty dies now...

374
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,990
with no clear successor...

375
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,880
Your Majesty.

376
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,290
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince has returned!

377
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,060
Send him in at once!

378
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,530
Anyone can stop Father's poisoning,

379
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,770
but Grand Prince Je Un's exile can only be stopped by his decree.

380
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,640
Only I can do it.

381
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,540
This is the ring I sent with the letter,

382
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,740
so it will prove that I am alive.

383
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,510
You must go to the palace.

384
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,630
I will go to Je Un.

385
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,070
Gang.

386
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,540
Gang!

387
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:55,130
Your Majesty. Forgive me for being so late.

388
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,970
I have troubled your heart...

389
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,400
and thrown the people into chaos.

390
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,100
Please hold me accountable for my filial and loyal failures.

391
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,840
No. You came back alive. That is all that matters.

392
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,980
That is more than enough.

393
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,450
Also, the journey here was perilous and I nearly died many times,

394
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,420
but thanks to Grand Prince Je Un, I returned to the palace safely.

395
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,420
Please bestow a great reward upon Grand Prince Je Un.

396
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,690
Of course. It shall be done.

397
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,430
It was no coincidence.

398
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,130
The Crown Prince saw right through my desperation.

399
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,100
He pretended not to pay attention,

400
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,210
but he knew everything going on in the palace.

401
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,940
Right after Grand Prince Je Un was sent into exile,

402
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,580
he knew I would poison the king,

403
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,450
and when exactly he takes medicine.

404
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:48,320
He remembered it all.

405
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,020
The Crown Prince...

406
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,260
is a tiger.

407
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,400
The moment Left Flank Guard entered,

408
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,670
he instantly knew there was arsenic on this medicine bowl.

409
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,440
You must have told him.

410
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,470
Yes.

411
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,940
For the Queen Dowager,

412
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,850
today must be a day under divine favor.

413
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,110
What do you plan to do?

414
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,880
To fight the Left State Councilor,

415
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,420
I need the Queen Dowager's help.

416
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,120
But Your Majesty, they tried to poison you.

417
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,490
If you let this go, do you not think they will try again?

418
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,330
Keep it as an ace up your sleeve.

419
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:38,430
To keep power from the Queen Dowager when the Left State Councilor falls,

420
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,800
you need some leverage of your own.

421
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,380
I apologize, Gang.

422
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,610
Why are you taking the blame?

423
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:53,020
It was Chief Royal Secretary's fault, not yours.

424
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,870
Gang, do you trust me?

425
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,270
For all you know, I could be the one who tried to assassinate you.

426
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,140
I do trust you.

427
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,180
Because you are my family too.

428
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,480
I know who the real killer is.

429
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,480
I saw who shot me at the cliff.

430
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,690
- What do you mean? - Left State Councilor's daughter.

431
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,290
If it had not been for Dal,

432
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,960
I would be dead by now.

433
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,700
Dal?

434
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,070
Did you meet Dal at Sinjusa?

435
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,230
What?

436
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,940
Wait, how did you know that? That she went to Sinjusa?

437
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,180
I heard she would stop by before leaving.

438
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,820
Right, about Dal.

439
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,120
I told her to stay in Hanyang for a bit,

440
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,890
but she does not have anywhere to go.

441
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,160
Could she stay at your place for a while?

442
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,889
Dal is in Hanyang right now?

443
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,130
Yes, she is at the Hanyang Merchant Guild.

444
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,200
Why on earth would you send her there?

445
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,800
What if she gets spotted by the Head Merchant?

446
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,000
What about it?

447
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,270
Well, Gang.

448
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,139
The court ladies Queen Dowager keeps sending to your chambers.

449
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,839
They all come from the Head Merchant.

450
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,680
You said that Dal looks just like the Crown Princess, right?

451
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,420
If Queen Dowager finds out she also saved your life,

452
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,790
do you think she will just leave Dal alone?

453
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,730
Hey.

454
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,759
Hurry up and go.

455
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,330
Hurry up and bring Dal back.

456
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,600
Run! Hurry up and run!

457
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,210
Hey, I heard you were almost exiled. Are you okay?

458
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,310
As you can see.

459
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,680
That is a relief.

460
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,719
- Is the inspector doing okay? - Yes, he...

461
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,720
He was shot too. The journey was rough,

462
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,360
and he got into a few fights, so his wounds reopened.

463
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,260
He bled a lot.

464
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,899
I wonder if he ever got them treated properly.

465
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,959
- Well... - Oh, right.

466
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,700
And his meals? Is he eating properly?

467
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,640
He must be exhausted. He must eat well to regain strength.

468
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,770
He cannot be a picky eater if he wants to recover.

469
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,880
But he just has the face of a picky eater.

470
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,080
Hey, why have you not answered any of my questions?

471
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,550
You have been asking one question after another...

472
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,650
that I have not had a chance to get a word in.

473
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,590
- Was I? - Goodness.

474
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,590
It seems you have grown quite close to Gang in that short time.

475
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,630
I have to admit, I am a bit hurt you worry more about him...

476
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,160
than me.

477
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,570
What? Close? No way.

478
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,500
It is just about the money I am owed.

479
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,669
The inspector did promise to compensate me handsomely.

480
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,240
I need that money to pay you back, and everything, do I not?

481
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,110
If that is what you are worried about, do not be.

482
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,720
This will take care of everything.

483
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,460
All of that?

484
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,140
What is going to happen to me now?

485
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,720
The Crown Prince has returned.

486
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,590
Nothing will change.

487
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,320
Even if the Crown Prince dies again, and His Majesty dies,

488
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,330
still, nothing will change.

489
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,200
You will take the place I have designated for you.

490
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,300
As you said, I have no other choice but you.

491
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,740
But the throne is another matter.

492
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,640
If the king dies, I will just place another royal on the throne.

493
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,480
Then why is Grand Prince Je Un the only one who is not an option?

494
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,090
Because he is the son of the late king.

495
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,660
And Queen Jangjeong's son.

496
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,870
If you are worried about revenge, that fear is baseless.

497
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,340
Grand Prince Je Un was even ready to take the fall for my crime.

498
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,110
And the biggest reason now...

499
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,710
is you.

500
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,849
What proof do you have that Grand Prince Je Un...

501
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,450
will not seek revenge against me?

502
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,180
Is it not because you love him?

503
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,820
You killed the Crown Prince for Grand Prince Je Un,

504
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,060
and Grand Prince Je Un threw away his life for you.

505
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,960
See? This is how love makes people weak.

506
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,770
If he has you wrapped around his finger,

507
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,140
there is no guarantee you will not turn on me.

508
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,670
So, wake up...

509
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,180
from your foolish dreams.

510
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,760
What, she sent all this back?

511
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
Why?

512
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,600
She sent everything back...

513
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,770
except her travel costs to Hanyang.

514
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,899
Seriously, what kind of peddler does that?

515
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,470
She is a peddler, all right.

516
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,940
She only took silver.

517
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,810
Her math is spot on.

518
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,380
What do you want me to do with all these things?

519
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,750
Then...

520
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,349
prepare a gift chest with the smallest, priciest items.

521
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:04,319
Okay? Make sure it is not too ostentatious.

522
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,320
Yes, Your Highness.

523
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,630
Wait.

524
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,400
He asked that you please wear this outfit.

525
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,230
"You thought you could win my heart with just this?"

526
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,670
I thought you would say that.

527
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,140
I never dreamed you would be so moved by a mere set of clothes.

528
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,170
How could something this beautiful be "mere"?

529
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,079
Someone so lowly like me...

530
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,680
would be punished for wearing something like this.

531
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,720
You will be punished if you do not wear it.

532
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,160
You may not realize it, but you did something incredible.

533
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:19,960
So incredible that you will regret letting me off with just an outfit.

534
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,730
Wear them and come on out. I will see how it looks on you.

535
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,010
Again?

536
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:39,950
Why?

537
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,050
I am pleased you can recognize me...

538
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,690
by my footsteps alone.

539
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,400
Too much has been broken between us for such pleasantries.

540
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,460
That is why I am here. To put things right.

541
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,610
Why are you always climbing up so high?

542
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,180
Because my mother is in the skies.

543
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,020
Do you miss your mom?

544
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,120
Is that...

545
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,590
your dream?

546
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,830
My dream...

547
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:31,330
is to go back to the way things were.

548
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,730
Do not tell me.

549
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,140
Did you orchestrate all of this because of what I said back then?

550
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,940
I have never forgotten your dream.

551
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,580
And so it became my dream as well.

552
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,479
It is a dream because it can never come true.

553
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,510
It is time...

554
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,480
for you to wake up from that dream too.

555
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,290
I do not know if this suits me.

556
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:56,860
I cannot believe I get to wear something like this.

557
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,870
You must have a guest.

558
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,720
She is not a guest. She is my woman.

559
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,120
The woman who will be my family.

560
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,259
So, could you leave now?

561
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,830
As you can see, I have a prior engagement.

562
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,670
I have not torn up your contract.

563
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,980
Stop right there.

564
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,160
You seem to be under some sort of misunderstanding.

565
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,130
I am not someone you can order around.

566
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:14,040
A scholar-official's daughter cannot command a royal.

567
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,440
The only reason...

568
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,440
I ever obeyed you was because I loved you.

569
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,640
But now...

570
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,650
the man who loved you...

571
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,620
is dead.

572
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:54,680
I am sorry.

573
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,510
Are you okay?

574
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,680
I will manage.

575
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,150
You were first, were you not, my lord?

576
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,620
You loved her before the inspector, right?

577
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,660
What does it matter who came first at this point?

578
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,600
Why did you let her go?

579
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:19,170
To save her.

580
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,040
It is the only way for me and for her,

581
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,380
for both of us to survive.

582
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:31,450
So, will you help me?

583
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,450
After all, I still hold your contract.

584
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,120
Right.

585
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,860
It is not like a debtor has much of a choice.

586
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,730
I should obey.

587
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:14,990
Your Royal Highness, you look pleased.

588
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,530
Gosh. Pleased?

589
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,800
A man of virtue...

590
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,770
enjoys repaying kindness and showing benevolence.

591
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,100
It is something like that.

592
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:31,210
I pray that is your true heart.

593
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,680
You will have the Royal Wedding soon.

594
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,880
If they see you with a woman,

595
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,810
who looks exactly like the Crown Princess,

596
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,150
it will not just be that peddler who gets in danger.

597
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,150
The Left State Councilor will watch you even more closely.

598
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,890
I am repaying the one who saved me. Nothing more.

599
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,390
So this is the last time.

600
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,630
Today.

601
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,870
Today is the last day.

602
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,070
- It is so pretty. - It is, right?

603
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,940
The silver one is so pretty too.

604
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:27,460
My lord!

605
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:33,640
There she goes again.

606
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,000
Smiling so beautifully again.

607
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,420
Gosh, this hits the spot!

608
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,530
You seem more moved by this rice soup...

609
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,930
than by all the gifts I sent you.

610
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,269
This is not just any soup, is it? It saved my legs,

611
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,800
and it saved your life too.

612
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
You are right.

613
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,680
This soup really is something special.

614
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,090
Now that I have had the soup,

615
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,390
I guess this is goodbye, my lord.

616
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,160
Already?

617
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,770
I hear there will be fireworks later.

618
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,540
Why do you not you stay and watch it before you go?

619
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,240
- Fireworks? - Yes.

620
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:47,739
It is for the Crown Prince, who was missing but returned safely.

621
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,380
I heard there will be fireworks to celebrate it.

622
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,390
It is all right. I have seen all sorts of fireworks.

623
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:58,950
Even if you have,

624
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:04,830
it must be your first time seeing it in Hanyang, right?

625
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,840
Okay, fine. We will watch it together.

626
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,180
This hits the spot!

627
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Hold on.

628
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,840
Gosh, I got a scrape.

629
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,040
This is what I get for being so careful with it.

630
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,750
You wait over there for a moment.

631
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,780
- Where are you going? - It will just be a minute.

632
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,749
Shin Won and I will be right back. Sae Dol, you stand guard here.

633
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,560
- Got it? - My lord!

634
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,690
What was that about all of a sudden?

635
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,270
Which of these flower shoes would suit "autumn leaf" color type?

636
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,340
She will probably only wear them this one time.

637
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,170
Just pick any pair.

638
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,679
This is the last pair I will give her,

639
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,280
so the choice must be perfect.

640
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,880
The prettiest ones I can find. Right?

641
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,280
Why are you so cold-hearted?

642
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,020
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

643
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,500
Why are you fidgeting? You are like a puppy needing to poo.

644
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,760
Gosh! Do not mention...

645
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,500
dogs and poop in the same breath.

646
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,710
All right. You startled me.

647
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,609
I will be right back.

648
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,610
What? Oh, my.

649
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,380
What is wrong with them?

650
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:24,900
Hold on.

651
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:31,610
That woman looks familiar.

652
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:37,280
You never forget a pretty face, do you?

653
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,080
Gosh, she is gorgeous. What?

654
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,750
Is she not the peddler?

655
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:43,890
A peddler?

656
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,920
Yes, my lady...

657
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:47,820
No,

658
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,730
she is the girl who ruined Inspector Kim's family.

659
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,430
- I am sure it is her. - Is that so?

660
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,940
It has been a while.

661
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:06,410
Do I know you?

662
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,779
Minister Ja Gyeong would like to see you.

663
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,780
You wench!

664
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,950
How dare a lowly peddler like you...

665
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,960
wear red silk, a privilege reserved for nobility?

666
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:25,490
You dare defy The Laws of Morality and get away with it?

667
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,560
My deepest apologies. If you will just give me a moment,

668
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,830
I will change out of these clothes right away.

669
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:32,800
Do you think this can be resolved...

670
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,800
by simply changing your clothes?

671
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,610
Do you? I could have you beheaded on the spot...

672
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,879
to make an example of you for defying The Laws of Morality.

673
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,820
I have committed a crime worth death. Please forgive me this once,

674
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,120
and I will do anything. Please just spare my life.

675
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,990
That is right.

676
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:01,860
You will have to do whatever it takes.

677
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,240
Gosh, Minister Ja Gyeong, that obnoxious man.

678
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,080
Your Highness!

679
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,849
Your Highness!

680
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,980
I told you to stand guard. What are you doing here?

681
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,420
- What? Why? - He...

682
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,189
Spit it out!

683
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,960
He... Gosh. He...

684
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:29,490
He...

685
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,540
Poor that peddler.

686
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,370
Why did she get caught by Minister Ja Gyeong?

687
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,710
Why would she wear red silk? It is not fit for her status.

688
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,010
A peddler in red silk.

689
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,820
Is she not the peddler from earlier?

690
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,690
- How long have you followed me? - The entire time.

691
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,020
Now that I have caught you, go back.

692
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,790
I have somewhere to be.

693
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,830
Minister Ja Gyeong is my father's closest confidant.

694
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,500
Do not let yourself be a nuisance to my father any longer.

695
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,640
Let me go.

696
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,310
Are you really starting a family with a lowly peddler?

697
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:30,220
Why not? I once wanted to start a family...

698
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,020
with you too.

699
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,370
All right. Follow me.

700
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:01,980
No, not here. Let us take this home.

701
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,920
You crazy wench.

702
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,060
I have taken off all the precious silk meant for nobility.

703
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:15,330
Now, will you stoop to pick up my sin from the ground and punish me?

704
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,799
How can Minister of Personnel...

705
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,969
use The Laws of Morality to threaten a woman...

706
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,240
and try to take advantage of her?

707
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,710
Is it really appropriate for someone of your stature...

708
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:28,110
to sit in the halls of government and discuss politics?

709
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,540
You lunatic!

710
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,720
You must have a death wish, do you not?

711
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,750
I shall punish you now!

712
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,760
How dare you!

713
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,730
The audacity of one such as you!

714
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:50,730
My lord, you will be in trouble. Please put away your sword.

715
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,070
My goodness.

716
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,040
Your Royal Highness.

717
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,320
"Your Royal Highness?"

718
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,030
Move out of my way!

719
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:22,700
I do not even know where to begin.

720
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,600
When are you going to stop being so reckless?

721
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,440
- No, that is because I... - Why can you never wait?

722
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,180
When you are hurt or in any danger, you are supposed to stop and wait!

723
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,879
You should have called for help!

724
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,950
You should have waited until I could save you!

725
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,720
Why should I... My lord. No.

726
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,520
Why should I wait for Your Highness?

727
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,160
Why should you be the one to solve my problems?

728
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,730
Because it is not just about you!

729
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,970
Do you really think this is just about you?

730
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,770
I told you, you look just like my wife.

731
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:08,110
And that is why you wanted me to wear this outfit?

732
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,750
Is that what this was all about?

733
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,420
Using reward as your excuse,

734
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,250
Were you playing dress-up so I could look like your wife...

735
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:17,950
No.

736
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,960
Were you playing dress-up, using me as the Crown Princess' substitute?

737
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:24,790
What?

738
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,930
How dare you continue to speak so recklessly?

739
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,599
That is why you are so angry, is it not?

740
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,240
Because someone as lowly as myself...

741
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,710
looks like the Crown Princess.

742
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,140
Because I was humiliated with her face.

743
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,010
Are I not right?

744
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,520
Fine. You are right. Got it?

745
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,550
Since you know, do not get in danger with that face.

746
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,320
Do not be humiliated or stand out!

747
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,700
I am well aware that you are not my wife.

748
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:07,070
I will not be confused or shaken by it again.

749
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,470
So take this and never let me see you again.

750
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,260
What do you think you are doing?

751
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:30,930
It is mine now, is it not?

752
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:35,330
So I will do whatever I want with it.

753
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,840
Stop. That is an order!

754
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,350
What do you think you are doing?

755
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:56,620
You dare toss the Crown Prince's gift to the ground.

756
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,350
It is treason and an act of disloyalty.

757
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:03,590
Your Highness, will you let this traitor go unpunished?

758
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:05,660
Let go of the sword.

759
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,560
If you interfere, this will only escalate.

760
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,870
Please.

761
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,110
Please stop.

762
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,380
This blood is on you.

763
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,329
Your Highness.

764
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:13,360
I am being framed!

765
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,700
This was all orchestrated by the Left State Councilor.

766
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,829
He sent his own daughter to bring me down.

767
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,500
It was part of Left State Councilor's plan.

768
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:23,040
The Left State Councilor's daughter?

769
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,470
I see.

770
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,570
And what did she say?

771
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:29,410
She asked me to make her Crown Princess...

772
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,910
Grand Prince Je Un becomes Crown Prince.

773
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:35,180
She claimed she was the one who assassinated His Royal Highness.

774
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,450
And that His Royal Highness would never return.

775
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:42,120
Who else have you told this to?

776
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,360
I have never told anyone in such detail.

777
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,060
Then keep your mouth shut.

778
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,130
Do not speak of Grand Prince Je Un...

779
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,330
or the Left State Councilor's daughter again.

780
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,370
That is, if you want to live.

781
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,520
That stings.

782
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:32,570
Goodness.

783
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,340
My lord.

784
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:42,480
The wound on your neck does not seem too deep,

785
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,490
but the wound in your heart does.

786
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,660
I am fine.

787
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,800
My greed got the better of myself.

788
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,840
I tried to carry a burden far too heavy for myself,

789
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:03,540
so of course I buckled under the weight.

790
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:09,710
One silk dress and a pair of flower shoes...

791
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:12,380
How could that be too heavy a burden to bear?

792
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,450
He brought you down.

793
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,160
That is not true.

794
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:25,490
No wonder. I was happy, which does not suit me.

795
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:28,800
These were not suitable for me.

796
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,170
Flower shoes? Darn them.

797
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:33,030
They only got me scrapes.

798
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,200
Then...

799
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,970
these should be fine, right?

800
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:42,780
I can put them on myself.

801
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:47,350
I bought these straw sandals for you in a hurry on my way.

802
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,090
It is not that the flower shoes did not suit you.

803
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,290
Why did you threaten Chief Royal Secretary only?

804
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,660
You know the culprit, do you not?

805
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:02,460
Because I have figured out why.

806
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,370
That will be all for today. You are dismissed.

807
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,680
I am surrounded by disloyal subjects only.

808
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,650
I should be going as well.

809
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,620
It seems my lady has been injured.

810
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,990
With their words or their actions,

811
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,030
they all held the daggers back then.

812
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:08,630
Sometimes, a simple touch or a certain look...

813
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,800
can be the most sincere answer.

814
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,940
My desire for revenge also began with love.

815
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:22,710
If I trample Grand Prince Je Un's feelings just to get my own revenge,

816
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,710
I would only be causing him more pain.

817
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:27,010
But...

818
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,489
Rather than finding the source of the poison,

819
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:34,489
would it not be faster to find proof...

820
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:37,220
that the Left State Councilor's daughter tried to harm you?

821
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:39,830
It is never too late for revenge.

822
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:43,500
And the right path is more important than the fast one.

823
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,040
Is that not going too far?

824
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,279
Your Highness, please calm down first.

825
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,480
Let us head back to the palace.

826
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:04,650
Come on, how do you expect him to calm down that feeling so easily?

827
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:06,050
That feeling?

828
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,090
I am sure you feel awful. You were publicly shamed like that.

829
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:10,360
That is not what he is talking about.

830
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,430
No, he is right.

831
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,330
Se Dol, for once, you have said something sensible.

832
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,570
- Really? - I am absolutely livid right now.

833
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:22,400
I suppose I will never see her again.

834
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,770
So if I do not do it now, I will never get to settle it.

835
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:31,110
That is why I am going. To settle this anger.

836
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,120
Let us go. We have administered first aid,

837
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,190
so now we need to get you treated.

838
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,100
Change into these clothes.

839
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:53,370
What is this? You are still here, Your Highness?

840
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,100
Those clothes you have on.

841
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,070
That bright blue is terrible on you.

842
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:00,370
You are the "autumn leaf" color type.

843
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:03,779
Anyway, this color will suit you better.

844
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:04,850
Go on and get changed.

845
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,749
You followed us because of her clothes?

846
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,850
I did not "follow" you.

847
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,620
I was just passing by and saw you, so I stopped.

848
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,690
And then I realized something.

849
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:17,060
My feelings.

850
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:27,130
All right.

851
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,940
Thank you for this.

852
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,470
All right, I am all ears.

853
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:48,590
Okay, so tell me. What feelings are you talking about?

854
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,430
I feel so wronged.

855
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,770
As they say, the guilty party gets mad.

856
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:00,870
Fine.

857
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,539
So why do you feel so wronged, Your Royal Highness?

858
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:07,040
I never played dress-up, using you as Crown Princess' substitute.

859
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:09,280
I am infuriated to be misjudged...

860
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:12,180
over feelings I do not even have.

861
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:15,480
You should not be saying that.

862
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:16,880
At a time like this,

863
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,650
you should apologize.

864
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,990
You should admit you were wrong.

865
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,190
Are you telling me, the Crown Prince, to apologize?

866
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,700
Beg for forgiveness?

867
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,530
To a common peddler like you?

868
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:35,400
If you have done something wrong, you should apologize.

869
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,240
How can you not see that pride is more shameful than modesty?

870
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,440
There are no subjects who would love a royal family...

871
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,650
that does not care for its people.

872
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,650
Therefore, you must fear your people.

873
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,320
Love them first.

874
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:54,960
Do not just reign over them.

875
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,420
Rule them with reason and justice.

876
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:09,270
Since you have nothing more to say, I will take my leave.

877
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,910
The Four Pillars Letter has been sent.

878
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,280
In three months, you will be the new Crown Princess.

879
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:19,370
- What do you think you are doing? - And just who are you?

880
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,580
Who in the world are you?

881
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,750
I came to see you one last time,

882
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,020
so why do you keep me rooted?

883
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:34,150
Why are you putting down roots in my heart all over again?

884
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:57,120
When you think of it, the swallow does more than repay debts.

885
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:01,430
It rewards Heungbu...

886
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,100
and punishes Nolbu.

887
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,930
It is a shrewd merchant who never makes a loss.

888
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:10,270
That darn swallow must have made some kind of mistake.

889
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,809
With a heart as kind as mine,

890
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:14,340
there is no way I am the bad guy here.

891
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,309
Me, the oh-so-precious Crown Prince.

892
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,310
It is gone.

893
01:16:17,311 --> 01:16:18,679
- For my body to be switched... - Where did it go?

894
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:19,810
With this lowly peddler...

895
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,850
This is divine punishment!

896
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,490
(Moon River)

897
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,039
Has His Highness not been really strange lately?

898
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:53,910
My name is Lee Gang Doo, Your Royal Highness.

899
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,220
What in the world is going on?

900
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,689
How about we do it again like we did that day?

901
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:01,790
You mean, a kiss?

902
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,189
If the Left State Councilor sees her face...

903
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,289
that resembles the late Crown Princess...

904
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:05,560
What is to become of her?

905
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,130
He would kill her.

906
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:26,750
(Moon River)
