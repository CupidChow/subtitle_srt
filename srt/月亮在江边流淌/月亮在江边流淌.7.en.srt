1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,850
(Kang Tae Oh)

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,920
(Kim Se Jeong)

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,520
(Lee Sin Young)

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,390
(Hong Su Zu)

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,060
(Jin Goo)

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,630
(Nam Gi Ae)

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,370
(And Kim Nam Hee)

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,050
(Moon River)

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,350
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,650
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,020
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,250
You...

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,020
wear your flower shoes.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,490
I will be the one...

15
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,660
running barefoot.

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,430
What are you...

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
From now on,

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,680
I cannot look the other way anymore.

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,760
Your Royal Highness.

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,960
Your Royal Highness.

21
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,800
Your Royal Highness.

22
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,270
Oh, no. Please wake up.

23
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,310
- Your Royal Highness. - Your Royal Highness.

24
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,570
Hurry.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,110
Please examine her closely.

26
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,450
His pulse is normal, so you need not worry.

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,690
But over here...

28
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,560
What? What is it?

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,700
- It seems there is drug on it. - What? Drug?

30
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,730
If it is drug, could it be...

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,130
Poison?

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,170
She has simply fainted from exhaustion.

33
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,110
I understand. You may go now.

34
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,190
Are you awake now?

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,970
- How did I end up here? - What?

36
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,570
I was going to ask you the same thing when you got up.

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,740
What am I supposed to do if you cannot remember?

38
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,210
Explain. We were having fun, and then you suddenly stormed off.

39
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,520
Why were you out running at night just to collapse?

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,359
Let me go! No! Let go of me!

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,560
Let me go! Let go!

42
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,860
The Left State Councilor will surely harm Dal.

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,100
I can protect her somehow while our bodies are swapped,

44
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,130
but once we switch back...

45
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,700
Darn it.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What?

47
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,680
If you will not talk, then do not. Why suddenly curse?

48
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,580
Where are you going? You have not even recovered yet.

49
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,380
There is only one way.

50
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,220
Between protecting her and just standing by,

51
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,890
I must stand in between.

52
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,820
I have no choice but to stand there and be a coward.

53
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,330
This must be why our bodies switched.

54
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,960
So I would get hurt instead of you.

55
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,170
So I would experience all this humiliation myself.

56
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,000
I am never to escape the guilt I feel toward the Crown Princess.

57
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,110
You will never know how this feels, will you?

58
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,140
So...

59
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,950
when we switch back, leave without a moment's hesitation.

60
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,020
And never set foot in Hanyang again.

61
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,829
(Mangdeok)

62
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,930
Are you kidding me?

63
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,900
He thinks only he is feeling awful, while I am on top of the world?

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,300
So only his pride gets hurt? You think mine is still perfect?

65
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,170
Unbelievable.

66
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,210
This is lousy.

67
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,630
How utterly cowardly of me.

68
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,730
Even though I know I am the reason for all this danger,

69
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,770
and yet, all I have done is hurt her.

70
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,040
Can a girl get some sleep? What is your problem every night?

71
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,080
How insolent! How dare you...

72
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,420
I have to dodge the wooden pillow.

73
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,120
Dodging is the best option.

74
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,030
Why does it have to be the moon again?

75
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,180
Right.

76
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,280
Avoidance is the best strategy.

77
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,980
Hiding is the best strategy.

78
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,860
Good thing the Left State Councilor is out of the capital.

79
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,060
If he finds out we failed today,

80
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,000
I am a dead woman.

81
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,870
About that girl, Park Dal,

82
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,700
bring me whatever you can find on her.

83
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,190
Your Royal Highness. Queen Dowager is looking for you.

84
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,660
Tell her I am busy.

85
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,830
All she will do is lecture me about choosing a Royal Concubine.

86
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,529
She will slam the desk in the end.

87
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,260
What is it with these nobles...

88
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,000
and their obsession with slamming desks?

89
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,300
What did the desk ever do to them? Honestly.

90
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,470
An infertility potion?

91
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,080
So the Left State Councilor has finally crossed the line.

92
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,050
According to my spy with the Chief Court Lady,

93
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,250
Park Dal refused to drink the infertility potion to the end...

94
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,790
- and fought off ten court ladies. - She fought back?

95
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,390
The more I hear about her, the more I like her.

96
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,700
Yes. To be one of my people, one must have that kind of spirit.

97
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,370
It seems the Chief Court Lady is about to make another move.

98
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,870
What are your orders?

99
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,069
If the Crown Prince is not a fool,

100
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,640
he will know that appointing a Royal Concubine...

101
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,010
is his only shield.

102
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,320
If he gives me even the slightest excuse,

103
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,150
I am issuing the appointment on the spot.

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,660
This must be why our bodies switched.

105
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,730
So I would get hurt instead of you.

106
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,200
So I would experience all this humiliation myself.

107
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,480
I am never to escape the guilt I feel toward the Crown Princess.

108
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,850
I cannot eat with so many eyes on me.

109
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,190
One court lady may stay. The rest of you are dismissed.

110
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,330
Wait.

111
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,170
Where is Dal? Why is she...

112
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,509
Dal was sent to help prepare for your wedding...

113
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,980
at the Office of Royal Wedding Rites.

114
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,880
I am not eating.

115
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,020
Take it away.

116
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,730
Crown Prince.

117
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,780
Hide well or I will see your hair

118
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,150
Hide well or I will see your rear

119
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,420
Where are you hiding? Behind a tree there?

120
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,590
Hold in your laughter, if you dare

121
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,930
Hide well or I will see your hair

122
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,660
- Your Royal Highness! - Your Royal Highness!

123
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,080
Crown Prince.

124
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
What? His Majesty the King?

125
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,290
Then I must go at once.

126
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,060
Crown Prince.

127
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,160
Darn it. That little brat.

128
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,300
Announcing His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince.

129
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,460
(Chapter Seven: Hide-and-Seek)

130
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,199
It is not like I am going to eat him up.

131
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,500
Why is he avoiding me? Why?

132
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,429
- Well... - Why is Prince Je Un...

133
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,600
not getting better?

134
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,170
He is a nobleman with every comfort. Why is he not recovering?

135
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,340
Darn it.

136
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,940
What about the talks for the Gyesa Year Incident?

137
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,280
If you are that concerned, why not send the Royal Physician?

138
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,880
- I can do that? - Yes.

139
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,120
Why would he suddenly send the Royal Physician?

140
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,890
You do not think he has realized you are faking it, do you?

141
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,860
No, I do not think that is it.

142
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,200
But it is clear he wants to resolve the Gyesa Year Incident quickly.

143
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,240
In this situation, if he finds out about the boy from Qing...

144
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,040
He will charge full steam ahead. What else can we do but run for it?

145
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,540
That boy from Qing is running wild, demanding immediate revenge.

146
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,150
Do not follow me today. I need you to watch him closely.

147
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Yes, sir.

148
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,060
Please. If I can just hold out until the Royal Wedding,

149
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,800
I can stop U Hui from being enslaved.

150
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,230
Even if it makes me a coward, there is no other way.

151
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,510
I will be off then.

152
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,109
You cannot get out of it this time.

153
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,350
They say Prince Je Un is fully recovered.

154
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,950
Right. Who knows when our bodies will switch back?

155
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,090
I cannot just keep putting off my revenge.

156
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,020
All right.

157
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,630
Let us go.

158
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,180
There are no holes in the cover I created. Got it?

159
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,290
Tie this for me.

160
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,590
Hey, Eunuch Yoon.

161
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,200
Go tie His Royal Highness's hat string.

162
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,950
- Se Dol. - Yes?

163
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,020
Do you know what you call gold floating on water?

164
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,860
Why are you asking something so out of the blue?

165
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,059
- Exactly! - What is?

166
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,560
Gold floating on water. It is "out of the blue."

167
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,070
Gold floating... "Out of the blue." That is so lame.

168
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,440
You laughed, right You just laughed, right?

169
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,880
Something went down the wrong pipe.

170
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,700
It was not me. It was His Royal Highness.

171
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,940
Fine, it was me. So what?

172
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,940
What do you mean, "so what"?

173
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,010
We are running late. We need to go.

174
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,330
Why is Dal here?

175
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,399
From now on, Dal will be helping with the Gyesa Year Incident.

176
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,940
By any chance, is the reason Dal is here...

177
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,170
related to your feelings for her?

178
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,440
Feelings? Do not be ridiculous.

179
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,410
Me neither, you know.

180
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,120
Who said it did?

181
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,620
Why do you not stop prying and tell us your news from Qing?

182
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,330
I believe the Jimjo Birdy owner's son is alive.

183
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,070
This will be the one and only time I lie.

184
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,320
Based on his age, the burn scars, and how the old man from Qing...

185
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,420
suddenly moved after the fire in the Year of Imjin,

186
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,260
I suspect the old man's son is the son of the Jimjo's owner.

187
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,200
That makes sense.

188
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,170
Then why do we not bring him here right now?

189
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,569
This letter says he is missing.

190
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,600
It is going to take time to find him.

191
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,310
If we can just find this son,

192
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,010
this could all be resolved quite easily.

193
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,180
Perhaps...

194
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,280
we could even take down the Left State Councilor before the wedding.

195
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,190
Even though you clearly cannot stand me,

196
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,220
I guess you plan on canceling the Royal Wedding.

197
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,990
Is she the one in the Royal Wedding?

198
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,330
What?

199
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,900
No, I mean... Me.

200
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,770
I am talking about me.

201
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,800
I am the one who plans on calling off the Royal Wedding.

202
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,740
What do you mean you are not going through with the Royal Wedding?

203
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,810
It is just that, no matter how I look at it...

204
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,249
- it just does not make... - Gang.

205
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,280
Come on.

206
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,490
Are you not counting your chickens before they hatch?

207
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,220
You have to find the son of the Jimjo's owner...

208
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,019
and use his proof to catch the Left State Councilor.

209
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,490
That is the only way.

210
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,660
The Royal Wedding is in a month. Can you really do all that by then?

211
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,600
Why do you have to rain on our parade...

212
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,600
You lied to me? Why did you hide the fact that I am here?

213
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,310
- Let us go outside. We can talk... - What is he talking about?

214
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,310
What does he mean, you hid his existence?

215
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,480
Gang. You understand the Qing language?

216
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,150
Well...

217
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,890
I picked some up here and there.

218
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,050
Where is the man who raised the Jimjo?

219
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,590
Soon after selling the bird, a fire killed his entire family.

220
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,030
Apparently, all his Jimjo Birds were also destroyed in the blaze.

221
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,710
So he is the son of the bird's owner?

222
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,610
- That is... - Let me go.

223
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,720
You have some explaining to do.

224
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,030
I will explain. I can explain everything.

225
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,940
I am sure.

226
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,050
After all, what right does a man who betrayed us for a woman...

227
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,880
- have to say anything? - Dal!

228
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,580
Is it true? Did you betray us for the Crown Princess Consort?

229
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,890
Or is there another reason?

230
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,820
You knew?

231
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,629
His Royal Highness has known...

232
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,460
about you and the Crown Princess Consort for a long time.

233
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,960
Say something.

234
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,400
Just give me any excuse.

235
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,040
I have no excuse.

236
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,310
As of today,

237
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,450
you are now off the Gyesa Year Incident case.

238
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,820
Take this boy from Qing. Take him in for questioning.

239
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,690
Why would you order that, Lady Park?

240
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,230
Take the boy away.

241
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,930
Yes, Your Highness.

242
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,890
Wait a minute. I am going with you.

243
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,760
If the Left State Councilor learns of the Qing boy, he will kill him.

244
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,060
Send him to Unjeong Palace.

245
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,860
It was my private residence, so it should be a safe place.

246
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,970
Have them record the boy's statement and bring it to me.

247
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,140
And one more thing...

248
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,010
It is okay to cry. Why do you always hide everything?

249
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,680
You think I cannot tell how upset you are?

250
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,490
I do not have time to be sentimental.

251
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,790
The son of the Jimjo's owner is right in front of me.

252
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,190
My revenge is finally within reach.

253
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,060
Letting myself get swayed by some pathetic emotion...

254
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,930
That is just pathetic.

255
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Such a tough act.

256
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You are obviously hurt.

257
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,270
Your eyes and the tip of your nose are bright red.

258
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,410
So what if they are?

259
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,910
So what if I am upset? What do you want me to do about it?

260
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,750
I am not asking you to do anything.

261
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,460
What do you think you are doing?

262
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,160
Whenever I felt like this,

263
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,000
I wished someone would just hold me.

264
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,260
And since this is my body,

265
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,870
I thought you might be feeling the same way.

266
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,370
It is okay to lean on me.

267
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,440
We are already sharing a body.

268
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,650
It would be nice to share our hearts, do you not think?

269
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,600
If you hold me this tightly,

270
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,110
it feels like you are going to crush me.

271
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,580
Do not forget.

272
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,850
There is a line between you and me, even if it is invisible.

273
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,990
Do not cross it.

274
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,930
And if I do?

275
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,840
What will you do then?

276
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,510
You will live to regret it.

277
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,310
And there will be no turning back.

278
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,650
The boy from Qing will not talk.

279
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,990
He seems to think we are all in on it together.

280
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,590
Why is nothing ever easy?

281
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Let me get this straight.

282
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,000
You let them brand you a traitor and just kept your mouth shut?

283
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,370
Why did you go and make such a mess of it all?

284
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,010
You have ended up with nothing to show for it.

285
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,380
You should have either protected U Hui,

286
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,239
or gone all out and taken down the Left State Councilor...

287
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,680
to prove your loyalty!

288
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,050
There cannot be two good guys.

289
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,120
The good guy...

290
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,590
Even if I am not the good guy,

291
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,200
I do not have to be a complete jerk.

292
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,600
Get my official robes ready now.

293
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Yes.

294
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,010
What are you doing?

295
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,780
You have to hide it.

296
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,980
Bury it deep down.

297
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,350
Why would you reveal your lingering feelings?

298
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,310
Please send Dal out.

299
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,480
Just speak.

300
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,650
I have proof that the Left State Councilor still has the Jimjo.

301
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,950
You do? What is it?

302
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,060
Did you find out where the Jimjo is?

303
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,670
I was the one pressuring him, but you seem more worked up, Dal.

304
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,340
All right, go on. What is this proof?

305
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,120
The boy from Qing believes I lied, so he will not speak easily.

306
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,620
And even if he does,

307
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,120
we cannot be sure he is telling the truth.

308
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,570
In this book...

309
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,470
is everything the boy told me about the Jimjo.

310
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,070
But before I give it to you,

311
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,140
you must make me a promise.

312
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,050
Even if you take down the Left State Councilor,

313
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,520
you must spare U Hui's life.

314
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,900
Leave the book.

315
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,869
I will consider it and let you know.

316
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,870
I will only give it to you if you promise.

317
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,580
Between me, who has already lost someone precious,

318
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,050
and you, trying to protect someone, who do you think is more desperate?

319
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,589
I will give you my answer about the Crown Princess Consort...

320
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,990
after careful consideration.

321
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,890
So leave the book and go.

322
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,830
Hey, Prince Je Un.

323
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,040
Why did you even write that book?

324
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,340
What was the point if you were just going to betray us?

325
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,540
I just wanted to...

326
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,110
put it off.

327
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,980
If I defeat the Left State Councilor, U Hui becomes a slave.

328
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,750
But if I do nothing, Gang will be in danger.

329
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,060
I did not know what to do.

330
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,830
Then you should have just picked a side.

331
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,700
Either you should have begged His Highness for forgiveness,

332
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,930
or burned that book to stop this whole revenge plot.

333
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
What is this pathetic indecisiveness?

334
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,570
If I begged,

335
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,240
would that erase the fact that I betrayed my brother?

336
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,780
And if I burned the book,

337
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,880
could I take back the horrible things I said to U Hui?

338
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,320
I am always a coward.

339
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,860
And a coward cannot make a choice.

340
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,100
How utterly cowardly of me.

341
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,130
Even though I know I am the reason for all this danger,

342
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,010
and yet, all I have done is hurt her.

343
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,210
I wonder if cowardice runs in the family.

344
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,420
Why do I keep acting so pathetic?

345
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,140
Gosh, this writing is minuscule.

346
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,580
You can only write like this if you pour your heart into it.

347
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,320
A betrayer would not be this careful. Absolutely not.

348
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,760
Hey, now.

349
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,590
The line.

350
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,960
Fine. I get it. Okay.

351
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,030
There. See? A line.

352
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,240
I made a line. Happy now?

353
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,310
- Do you not dare cross that line. - Unbelievable.

354
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,280
So, did you find any new information in there?

355
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,920
The Jimjo Poison becomes harmless within three days of extraction.

356
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,290
The Left State Councilor gained power over Joseon...

357
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,320
with the Jimjo Bird.

358
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,760
He is not the kind of man who would throw away such a prize.

359
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,930
He definitely still has the Jimjo.

360
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,100
Actually,

361
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,240
back when I was almost enslaved over the incident in your chambers,

362
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,110
His Majesty said something to me.

363
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,340
Do not defy the Left State Councilor.

364
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,580
The Gyesa Year Incident is not over yet.

365
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,850
Come to think of it,

366
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,950
does that not mean the Jimjo is still alive?

367
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Then our objective has become clear.

368
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,760
We have to find the Jimjo and expose its owner.

369
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Then what?

370
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,769
We will prove the Gyesa Year Incident...

371
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,140
was a murder by Jimjo Poison,

372
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,840
and the owner is the real culprit behind it and a traitor.

373
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,840
Even if he is the Left State Councilor,

374
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,710
he will not be able to escape the charge of treason.

375
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,310
Then,

376
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,250
with the Gyesa Incident autopsies His Highness has gathered...

377
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,750
and all those other documents,

378
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,320
we just have to catch the Jimjo, right?

379
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,890
We need more conclusive evidence.

380
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,500
We must catch the Jimjo alive on the Left State Councilor's estate.

381
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,010
We should search his private estate then.

382
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,520
I did not think you would come, Ok.

383
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,860
It has been a long time, Left State Councilor.

384
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,830
Can you not speak casually to me like you used to?

385
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,180
I suppose...

386
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,250
I will never see the old you I once knew again.

387
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,820
It is I who has lost the younger brother I once cherished.

388
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,590
Why did you wish to see me today?

389
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,860
Dal of the Park family.

390
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,430
The girl from Boryeong who was a peddler.

391
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,930
She is my wife's niece.

392
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,400
How do you know of her, Your Excellency?

393
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
Strange, is it not?

394
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,040
As your wife's niece, you would think she is from a noble family.

395
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,280
And yet, she was a peddler, then an eunuch,

396
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,580
and now a court lady.

397
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,720
A court lady in the Crown Prince's chambers, no less.

398
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,520
In times like these,

399
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,090
what could be more frightening than wagging tongues?

400
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,900
I heard she lost her parents and took odd jobs to make ends meet.

401
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,860
You are not that close, I take it?

402
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,200
That used to be the case.

403
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,470
But I do not know if you are aware, Your Excellency,

404
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,180
but that girl, Dal, saved my daughter's life.

405
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,680
I have come to treat her like my own daughter,

406
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,380
and I have promised to protect her with my life.

407
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,290
And here I thought she was so fearless and impertinent.

408
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,160
Turns out she had someone in her corner.

409
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,460
If I...

410
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,330
were to harm that girl...

411
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,330
Then I...

412
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,230
will not stand idly by.

413
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,310
No wonder.

414
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,910
I was wondering why you agreed to meet me so easily.

415
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,350
You came here today to warn me, did you not?

416
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,490
In that case,

417
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,160
since I have said my piece,

418
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,490
I will take my leave now.

419
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,870
Listen, Han Chul.

420
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,610
Are you satisfied now?

421
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,510
Be satisfied with what you have, and stop here.

422
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,610
If you go any further,

423
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,380
even the deepest revenge becomes meaningless.

424
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,200
What revenge...

425
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,230
ever brings satisfaction?

426
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,900
(Dal's Quarters)

427
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,800
Look, it is not like...

428
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,080
- I am not taking his side, but... - Gosh.

429
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,980
Sounds like you are already not on my side.

430
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,320
If I am being honest,

431
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,290
you are not even guaranteeing the Crown Princess Consort's safety,

432
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,220
but you just keep taking all the information.

433
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,360
That is kind of a betrayal, is it not?

434
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,830
I have stopped at nothing to get this far.

435
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,140
You think a guilty conscience will hold me back?

436
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,470
I do not care if they call me a coward.

437
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,710
And I do not care if they call me dirty.

438
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,120
So what if you are a coward?

439
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,860
Who cares if you have to play a little dirty?

440
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,030
The bad guys do terrible things like it is nothing,

441
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,400
and all fate ever does is dump on us,

442
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,030
so how can anyone not stoop to their level?

443
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,040
How can you not feel beaten down?

444
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,210
So, it is okay.

445
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,340
Even if you have to be a coward or stoop low,

446
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,040
just lie low for a little while.

447
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,650
Even if the whole world turns on you,

448
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,250
the one taking all the heat right now...

449
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
is me.

450
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,600
There she goes again, mercilessly breaking down my walls.

451
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,070
What? What was that?

452
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,370
The line.

453
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,510
Gosh. Sure.

454
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:23,110
What is next? You want me to just wait outside?

455
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,410
Get away.

456
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,050
As far as you can.

457
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,030
Come on, Mangdeok. Time for dinner.

458
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,370
Are you not the cutest?

459
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,940
Gosh. A dog's life is the best life.

460
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,040
You eat meat that most commoners can only dream of. Right?

461
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,310
You seem to have a lot of complaints about the country.

462
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,150
No, I am just jealous, that is all.

463
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:04,250
He just hangs out in this big palace and have someone feed him.

464
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,790
Is that not a better life than what most people have?

465
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,590
Gosh.

466
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,130
If only someone would bring me my meals regularly...

467
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
"A dog's life"?

468
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,769
Are you saying I have a dog's life?

469
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:24,840
No.

470
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,940
Not you. I was talking about the Jimjo. The Jimjo Bird.

471
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,509
The Left State Councilor owns it, right?

472
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,250
He would not just let it roam free.

473
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,950
So if it is caged up, how does it get fed?

474
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,950
Nice try changing the subject. Why ask something so obvious?

475
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,630
(The Left State Councilor's man bought a Jimjo...)

476
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,700
(and started a fire at the owner's house.)

477
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,800
(He was wearing a mask.)

478
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,700
The Jimjo's keeper?

479
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,770
(Cheonghye Merchant Guild)

480
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,510
These from the Cheonghye Guild are precious and restorative,

481
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,650
so I will store them separately myself.

482
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,290
(Honey supplied by Cheonghye Merchant Guild)

483
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,380
Your Royal Highness.

484
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,350
It is a great honor to have you grace my humble home.

485
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,680
Where does one obtain poisonous insects?

486
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,720
Common folks cannot catch them. Only specialized hunters can.

487
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,560
Then we must first meet the hunters in the capital city.

488
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,989
What? Are you just going to walk up and ask them,

489
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,530
"Hey, do you feed the Jimjo?"

490
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,000
Or ask if they know the man in the mask?

491
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
Then...

492
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,030
what do we do?

493
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,070
I just so happen...

494
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,170
to have an expert catcher, a swallow, up my sleeve.

495
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,840
Right. Yes.

496
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,810
But how do you know who I am?

497
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,279
He looks familiar.

498
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,580
You saw him at the Royal Office of Attire, Your Highness.

499
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,850
He can identify Jimjo Poison.

500
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,750
Where on earth would you find a poison like that?

501
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,720
Unless you are talking about Jimjo Poison.

502
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,660
Right. The acupuncture physician? I remember now.

503
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,460
Lady, you claimed to have found him. How can you only remember now?

504
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,030
Right, so...

505
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:36,070
His Royal Highness just remembered, not me.

506
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,340
Oh, it is all coming back to me now.

507
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,010
But I thought we came to see the snake catchers.

508
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,950
Physicians and snake catchers have always been close.

509
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,350
Now, this gentleman... No,

510
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,120
This person will be a big help. You will get valuable information.

511
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,230
- What? - Lady.

512
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,840
Come on, let us do this!

513
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,570
Why me?

514
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,910
No way!

515
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,410
If we are seen with snake catchers, the Left State Councilor will know.

516
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,680
You are under less scrutiny, so you are perfect for the job.

517
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,320
Come on, wait for me!

518
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,589
- Do you know him? - Do you?

519
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,230
I do not know. I have no idea!

520
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,530
We do not know him.

521
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,670
Again?

522
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,570
Go on.

523
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,280
Look here. Do you know what this is?

524
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,120
This is another dead end...

525
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,050
Take a closer look. A really good look.

526
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,820
Here. You do not recognize him?

527
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,290
I do not know. I really do not.

528
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,920
Fine, just go.

529
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,660
Go on, fly away.

530
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,790
Nobody recognizes him anyway.

531
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,690
Go away!

532
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,700
Go!

533
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,610
Please give me one more chance.

534
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,450
I found it in Park Dal's quarters.

535
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,090
I thought it might be a love letter...

536
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,130
So, it is a love letter to Grand Prince Un.

537
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,100
But there is no mention of Grand Prince Un.

538
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,940
The apple does not fall far from the tree.

539
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,010
Both you and your niece.

540
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,380
Court ladies in love.

541
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,150
I will do it.

542
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,650
I will do anything.

543
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,150
Please just spare Mi Geum.

544
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,820
I will make sure that girl take the infertility drug this time.

545
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,130
Get rid of her.

546
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,730
You said you just had something to confirm...

547
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,500
and that I only had to give her the infertility drug.

548
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,330
A past memory made me soft for a moment,

549
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,500
but if you let the past hold you back,

550
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,240
you can never move forward.

551
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,110
That face that looks too much like the Deposed Crown Princess.

552
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:38,750
It unnerves me.

553
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,050
How can two families be wiped out on the same day?

554
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,220
Their old mother who cannot speak. How will she survive on her own?

555
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,360
Tell me about it.

556
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:02,270
Judging by the lack of reaction from the silver needle,

557
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,970
I do not believe it is poison.

558
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,040
If it was not poison, then how could two families die at the same time?

559
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:11,780
With poison, the body is usually bloated or black from decay...

560
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:12,850
No reaction to silver.

561
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,480
And the body is not turning black or decaying.

562
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,790
It is Jimjo Poison.

563
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,720
In this case, the investigation should...

564
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,159
No break-in or poison was found.

565
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,960
Should we not rule it as death by unknown causes?

566
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,460
Death by unknown causes?

567
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,100
I need to write the report. Move the bodies to the Bureau.

568
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,160
Darn it.

569
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,430
Yes, sir.

570
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,180
Excuse me.

571
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,650
By any chance,

572
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,120
have you seen this man?

573
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,700
I am not here to harm you.

574
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,530
I am here to help you.

575
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:07,570
This man...

576
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,010
is the one who killed your family, is he not?

577
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,750
I am looking for him too. His leader...

578
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,380
killed my family too.

579
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,220
So, please, will you tell me...

580
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,520
everything you know about him,

581
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,460
so I can catch him and get my revenge...

582
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,730
and get justice for you?

583
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,160
This scent pouch...

584
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,560
is his?

585
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,520
What was that? His Majesty is looking for me?

586
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,420
There is no getting out of it today.

587
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:43,500
- What did the desk ever do to you? - What was that?

588
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,900
Pardon?

589
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,270
It is nothing.

590
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,010
So, why did you summon me?

591
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:55,980
The Chief Court Lady kidnapped Park Dal,

592
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,450
and you still have not learned your lesson?

593
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,620
I am sorry?

594
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:06,190
- Kidnapped? - That girl was prepared to die...

595
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,660
fighting the infertility drug. Have you no shame, Crown Prince?

596
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,700
But over here, it seems there is drug on it.

597
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,230
No, wait.

598
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:18,870
Then that time...

599
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,670
Do not tell me you did not know.

600
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
No.

601
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,980
I had no idea.

602
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,750
I...

603
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,420
I knew absolutely nothing.

604
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,600
- Spare some change for an offering. - Not interested.

605
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,440
You seem to have bad karma. If no offering, how about a beating?

606
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:57,970
What are you talking about?

607
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,880
What?

608
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,910
Hey! What are you two doing here?

609
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,720
You little brat! What are you doing here?

610
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,890
- Stay still, will you? - What's this?

611
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:15,020
- Why is this coming off? - Duck your head. This is flimsy.

612
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:17,790
Let us talk somewhere private. All three of us are fugitives here.

613
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,860
Right. This way.

614
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:21,960
Wait. Hey, hold on. Where are you taking me?

615
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:25,300
- What is going on? - Dal! You are not hurt, are you?

616
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:26,570
Are you hurt anywhere?

617
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,910
Physically, I am fine, but...

618
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,440
Give it back.

619
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,180
You did not happen to meet anyone or remember anything, did you?

620
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,180
I met a bunch of people,

621
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,780
but nothing in particular comes to mind.

622
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,690
Why?

623
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,160
Good enough.

624
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,160
Tie her up.

625
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,930
- Right. - Tie me up? What for?

626
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,630
Why? Why are you tying me up? What is this? Let go!

627
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:58,230
Untie me this instant!

628
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,500
I have to go to the Palace!

629
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,270
You are not going to the palace but to the skies.

630
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,210
The skies? That is ridiculous! What are you talking about?

631
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,780
I am asking you nicely. Now, untie me!

632
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,750
- Dal, want to take a little nap? - Sleep? Are you kidding me?

633
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:15,120
How much of this should I give her?

634
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,960
Should I give her the whole thing?

635
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:27,930
- No. A corpse cannot get on a boat. - I see.

636
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,130
A corpse?

637
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,700
Send word to the palace!

638
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,970
Summon His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince!

639
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,580
Dal, how do you know His Royal Highness?

640
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,420
- You really met His Royal Highness? - I did. I mean, yes.

641
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,280
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is my backer,

642
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,320
so there is no need for me to escape to the skies.

643
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,560
The scar.

644
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,030
When did it disappear?

645
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,600
What was that?

646
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:12,040
- Hey, do not touch it. - I did not. Gosh.

647
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,280
- What? - What?

648
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:18,480
And who might this be? I missed you all so much.

649
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,620
- Your Royal Highness! - Your Royal Highness!

650
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,790
My goodness, what are you doing?

651
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,950
Get up. Come on.

652
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,790
It is me. Mom, Dad, it is your daughter, Dal.

653
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,960
What? No, you are not Dal,

654
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,600
and you are not our daughter.

655
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,900
- He is a man. - Right.

656
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,970
So here is what happened.

657
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,680
You!

658
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,750
Wait a minute.

659
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,350
You?

660
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,920
So, let me get this straight.

661
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,220
The Crown Prince grabbed the scar on Dal's wrist,

662
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:01,520
there was a flash of light, you fell into the water,

663
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:02,890
and you two swapped bodies?

664
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,160
What is this, some kind of folktale?

665
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,830
What is next? You will say you hatched from an egg?

666
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,900
Of course.

667
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,629
I am surprised a dragon did not appear,

668
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,870
and I did not sprout wings.

669
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:14,970
Goodness.

670
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,410
That smart mouth definitely belongs to our daughter.

671
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,440
No, a person can pick up someone else's way of talking.

672
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,080
Pick it up? What is it, the plague?

673
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:25,650
But now that I look closely,

674
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,850
that subtle glimmer in his eyes...

675
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,650
is our daughter's eyes.

676
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,460
Have you lost your mind? Your Royal Highness, please kill me!

677
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,060
We are deeply sorry, Your Royal Highness.

678
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,660
That is the mark of a sealed red thread of fate.

679
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,900
If the read thread of fate, which was forcibly severed,

680
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,540
should stir upon finding its true partner again,

681
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,270
then even I will be powerless to stop it.

682
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,080
I have committed a grave offense.

683
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,880
Everyone, leave us.

684
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,890
Your Royal Highness, please stay and speak with me.

685
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:11,990
Close it.

686
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:16,060
- Your Highness! - Your Highness! No, we just...

687
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,940
Come now, this way.

688
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,740
Your Royal Highness.

689
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,940
Now, speak.

690
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,240
There is more to Dal's scar, is there not?

691
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,710
A long time ago,

692
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,910
Dal once fell into the water.

693
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,320
A red scar suddenly appeared on her wrist then.

694
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,390
After that, she lost her memory,

695
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,290
and I have thought it peculiar ever since.

696
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,290
The water?

697
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,690
There is definitely something about the water, then.

698
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,230
What else?

699
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,230
Was there anything else unusual? Tell me everything you know.

700
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,770
You want us to switch back, do you not?

701
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,110
All I know...

702
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,180
is everything I have told you.

703
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,890
My mom and dad may have run away,

704
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,700
but they are by no means bad people.

705
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,530
You know that old saying, right?

706
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,800
"Falling in love is not a crime."

707
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,040
There is that load of nonsense, anyway.

708
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,110
Some love can be a crime.

709
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,940
It is a sin, but still...

710
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,110
I saved your life, and...

711
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:39,979
The fact that our bodies even switched...

712
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,550
This cannot be some ordinary fate.

713
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,790
So for my sake, could you...

714
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,160
Are you worried I will harm your family?

715
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:52,630
- You locked them in Unjeong Palace. - Locked them?

716
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,760
I am protecting them.

717
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:58,030
The Left State Councilor knows about your family's inn,

718
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,400
I worried he might take them hostage to threaten you.

719
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,270
I had no idea. Gosh, I was worried for nothing.

720
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,480
But why the long face?

721
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,680
The snake hunters and their families...

722
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,420
were killed with the Jimjo Poison.

723
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,450
It is so cruel.

724
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,420
How are those left behind supposed to go on?

725
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,060
It is all my fault.

726
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,330
If I had not gone poking around, they would still be alive.

727
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,300
How is that your fault, Your Royal Highness?

728
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,400
Someone else did the killing.

729
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:37,010
I hate how I always let things slip through my fingers.

730
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,310
Even those I am sworn to protect,

731
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,710
I could not protect a single one of them.

732
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,280
You protected me.

733
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,459
The Chief Court Lady almost forced me...

734
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,670
to drink that infertility potion,

735
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,570
but you protected me, Your Royal Highness.

736
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,139
I could have been dragged and killed,

737
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,570
but you fought to the very end...

738
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,070
and protected me.

739
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,610
How did you find out about that?

740
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,480
I had hoped you would never find out.

741
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,750
The Queen Dowager told me everything.

742
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:27,420
You should have let me drink it. Why did you fight them over it?

743
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,060
What if something happened to you? How could I possibly go on?

744
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,560
What do you think that was? Some sweet drink?

745
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,530
If you drank that, what about your dreams?

746
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,530
Wearing flower shoes and settling down...

747
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,870
with your own family...

748
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,570
What would happen to all of that?

749
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:46,310
You fought...

750
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,080
- just for that? - How can that be just anything?

751
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,120
They are your dreams.

752
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,120
Why are you doing this to me?

753
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,390
I was just going to live my life...

754
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,190
with my hair turning white, and my memories fading to black,

755
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,630
living like a cold winter's night.

756
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:14,270
You just had to shower me with flower petals.

757
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,510
Why did you shower me with flower petals?

758
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,880
Because you keep doing this, Your Highness...

759
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,380
Because you keep doing this...

760
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,050
You make my heart weak.

761
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,320
The feelings I tried hard to swallow now feel so painful and unfair.

762
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,890
And so I want to be comforted.

763
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,830
And I want it to be you, Your Royal Highness.

764
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:48,040
You are making me hope for the impossible!

765
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,040
Hope for what?

766
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,640
Do you like me, Your Royal Highness?

767
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,610
Your Royal Highness.

768
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,990
Forgive my impertinence, but I am here to arrest Park Dal.

769
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,560
Wait a minute.

770
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:49,200
Wait, on what charge are you arresting her?

771
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:51,970
Regardless of the grounds,

772
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:55,170
you dare arrest a court lady before the Crown Prince?

773
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,970
Is that how you show contempt for your superior?

774
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:01,610
How could I dare commit such an act of disloyalty?

775
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:05,010
I am merely carrying out His Majesty's order.

776
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,780
An order from His Majesty?

777
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,049
Grand Prince Je Un had an affair...

778
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,420
with the court lady from the Crown Prince's chambers?

779
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:16,060
We found evidence in her quarters, Your Majesty.

780
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,430
- What evidence? - Does the evidence matter?

781
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,870
What matters is not what the evidence is,

782
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:26,700
but how we are to punish them.

783
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,770
You have already made up your mind, have you not?

784
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:37,180
My only wish is for the safety of Your Majesty and the Crown Prince

785
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:39,980
An illicit affair?

786
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,220
What is this absurd frame-up?

787
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,649
Is it not true you stayed at the Grand Prince Je Un's home...

788
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,090
before entering the palace?

789
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:51,760
A witness also saw you at his home late at night recently.

790
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:52,989
That was because I was running an errand...

791
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,100
- for the Crown Prince. - You wench!

792
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,600
How dare you bring the Crown Prince into this?

793
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:00,230
Then I suppose this...

794
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,770
was also written by His Royal Highness?

795
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:11,180
You recognize it. Your love letter to Grand Prince Je Un.

796
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,680
Grand Prince Je Un...

797
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,380
Are you kidding me?

798
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,190
Does this look like a love letter to Grand Prince Je Un?

799
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:26,560
- You think this only affects me? - Do not worry.

800
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,360
The Grand Prince is under interrogation as we speak.

801
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,110
Goodness.

802
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:41,610
Left State Councilor, do you have a crush on me?

803
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,850
Why are you so obsessed with me?

804
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,880
Indeed. I cannot look away from you. Grand Prince Je Un.

805
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,890
People become so predictable the moment they get power.

806
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:00,930
Toward the Royal Mother and toward me as well.

807
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:13,370
Come on.

808
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,740
There is a limit to how far you can push this.

809
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,810
You call this a love letter?

810
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,080
And on top of that, you claim it is for the Grand Prince?

811
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,250
This is completely absurd.

812
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:26,819
In the letter, they name themselves.

813
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,760
Grand Prince Je Un and Dal of the Park family.

814
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,960
What? What are they?

815
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:35,500
"The night is dark, the moon bright. Why is my heart as hazy as a cloud?"

816
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,370
You are telling me this one line is proof of an affair?

817
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,870
So if you cannot find any real dirt on them,

818
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,400
you will just invent some to tear them down?

819
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,640
A report was filed,

820
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:49,010
and a love letter was discovered in Park Dal's quarters.

821
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,180
This is a matter concerning the court ladies,

822
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:56,220
so it is only right to handle it according to their code of conduct.

823
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,920
Fine. Leave the letter and go.

824
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,360
- But, Your Highness... - Why the hesitation?

825
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,600
Are you afraid I might dispose of the letter?

826
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,110
I will just say that I wrote the letter.

827
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:20,840
It is in your handwriting, after all.

828
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,940
If you claim you wrote that letter,

829
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:26,410
the Queen Dowager's faction will use it to make you a concubine.

830
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,880
And if you were to refuse,

831
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,420
she would charge you with the crime...

832
01:02:29,421 --> 01:02:30,819
of refusing the Crown Prince's favor...

833
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:33,150
and threaten to have you beheaded.

834
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,390
Seriously? Beheaded over a scrap of paper?

835
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:40,390
That is the way of the palace.

836
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,330
A place where life and death hang on a single piece of paper.

837
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,370
A ruthless place.

838
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:52,170
So,

839
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,640
do not do anything.

840
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:57,810
Neither I nor Grand Prince Je Un will ever admit to it.

841
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:02,580
If we both deny it to the very end, what can they possibly do?

842
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:07,820
They tried to take and sterilize me. You expect me to let that go?

843
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:10,460
I have to do something.

844
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:13,960
If I am forced to marry and take a concubine I do not love,

845
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:15,430
what about how I feel?

846
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,920
I will be on my way.

847
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,750
Please promise me something.

848
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:42,090
Your Royal Highness, you cannot protect Dal.

849
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,230
When you return to your own body, without any hesitation,

850
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,330
and without any lingering regrets, let Dal go.

851
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:04,210
My feelings for you cannot be allowed to hold you down.

852
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,220
I must hide them deep inside.

853
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,650
Without leaving a single trace.

854
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,590
So that not even my shadow gives me away.

855
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,440
This must be why our bodies switched.

856
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,140
So I would get hurt instead of you.

857
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:34,240
So I would experience all this humiliation myself.

858
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,180
I am never to escape the guilt I feel toward the Crown Princess.

859
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,259
You think this was just a reminder...

860
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,390
of your guilt about the late Crown Princess?

861
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:00,270
I know you are the Crown Prince and think the world is all about you.

862
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:03,570
But I am the main character of my own life, you know.

863
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,480
Do not use someone's life as a prop for your drama, Your Highness!

864
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,840
What is with this sudden outburst?

865
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,810
You want to know why I protect you, Your Highness?

866
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:14,620
It is because protecting you is how I protect my own body.

867
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,620
I could not take care of my own body,

868
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,120
and you could not care for others.

869
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,390
So the skies gave us this punishment to learn from each other. Got it?

870
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,439
- Se Dol. - Yes?

871
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,509
Do you know where the diaries or love letters I wrote...

872
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,780
to the late Crown Princess are?

873
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,210
If that is what you are looking for, they should be over here.

874
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,720
- What? - This way.

875
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:55,920
Right under my nose.

876
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,260
Is this some kind of safe?

877
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:02,860
Why are you asking me? You put it there, Your Highness.

878
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:17,180
What? What is that?

879
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,420
What?

880
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,630
- No... - Is this not mine now?

881
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,030
So I will do whatever I want with it.

882
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,630
Wait, why is this here?

883
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:43,900
You are the one who picked it up. Why ask me, Your Royal Highness?

884
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:53,880
Here is the diary you wrote to the late Crown Princess.

885
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,420
But why are you suddenly looking for this?

886
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,820
That love letter they claim is proof of Dal's affair,

887
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:00,450
I wrote it.

888
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,660
Why so surprised? I probably wrote it to the Crown Princess,

889
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,400
not Dal.

890
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:13,430
If I show them this,

891
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,170
I should be able to clear Dal's name.

892
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:18,770
If you say you wrote that love letter, Your Royal Highness,

893
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,940
do you think the Queen Dowager will buy it?

894
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,580
She will find a way to twist this and make Dal a royal concubine.

895
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,250
We have to put out the most urgent fire first.

896
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,780
Sleep eludes me.

897
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:39,620
I thought it was my bedding that was uncomfortable,

898
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,720
but it must be my heart.

899
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,030
The night is dark, and the moon is bright,

900
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:50,760
so why, as if shrouded in clouds, is my heart so bleak?

901
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,000
I am not myself,

902
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,370
and you are not yourself.

903
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:03,940
And in the empty space, a dull longing stretches, settles.

904
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,550
Will finding what I have lost be enough?

905
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,380
Will returning to my rightful place be enough?

906
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,890
Only then...

907
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:16,920
will I finally find peace?

908
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,870
Maybe this feeling...

909
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,170
is not for the Crown Princess...

910
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,040
but for me.

911
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:40,350
What is the meaning of this?

912
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:44,920
How could Prince Un's love letter be found in Park Dal's quarters?

913
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,490
Do you think I spared her life for this?

914
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,630
For the sin of daring to insult and betray me,

915
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:57,400
- I will make her pay dearly for it! - I wrote that letter.

916
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:04,970
You are saying you wrote a love letter to that girl?

917
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:06,610
Pardon me?

918
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,380
It was not a love letter. It was just a poem.

919
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,890
So, though you fancied her enough to write her a poem,

920
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,320
she rejected your royal favor?

921
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:22,459
She would charge you with the crime...

922
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:23,490
of refusing the Crown Prince's favor...

923
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,930
and threaten to have you beheaded.

924
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,460
Answer me, Crown Prince!

925
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:31,670
Dal never refused.

926
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:34,640
In that case,

927
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:39,470
are you planning to take Park Dal as your Royal Concubine?

928
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:44,950
Yes.

929
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:49,280
I will take Dal as my Royal Concubine.

930
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,720
Court Lady Yoon!

931
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,790
Yes, Your Highness!

932
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,790
Have Park Dal released at once.

933
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,500
I am issuing a decree to make her a Royal Concubine.

934
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,100
About that...

935
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:10,000
The Chief Court Lady ordered Park Dal to be flogged.

936
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,070
Flogged, you say?

937
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:13,840
Right now...

938
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,280
- Your Highness! - Stop this at once!

939
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:40,030
Your Royal Highness!

940
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:43,330
Your Royal Highness.

941
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Your Royal Highness.

942
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,200
Please pull yourself together.

943
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,140
Your Royal Highness...

944
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,290
My body...

945
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:08,860
I am back in my own body.

946
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,360
Yes.

947
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:13,330
We are back.

948
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,300
We are back.

949
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,640
Dal!

950
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,400
Dal!

951
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,170
Dal!

952
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:49,900
Please kill me.

953
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,740
Gladly.

954
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,670
I will kill every last one of you!

955
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:08,620
(Moon River)

956
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:27,230
From now on, I will be your shield. You just hide behind me.

957
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,199
Do not give your heart to the Crown Prince.

958
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,010
To survive and be loved, win his.

959
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:34,740
Are you telling me to kill the Crown Prince?

960
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,810
There is a distillery at the foot of Mount Inwang.

961
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:41,180
Why would you burden your soft heart with yet another weakness?

962
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,980
- Goodness! - Dal!

963
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:54,730
Since you came rushing here so frantically,

964
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,360
it left me no choice but to banish Grand Prince Je Un.

965
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:13,750
They say the art of bonsai is in the pruning.

966
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:19,490
To keep it from growing twisted or wild,

967
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:23,120
it must allow its branches to be cut to conform and survive.

968
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,660
You always told me, Father,

969
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:32,600
that I should be the flower blooming at the highest peak in Joseon.

970
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,440
I am here to yield.

971
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:45,610
As you have always wished, Father, I will live like that flower.

972
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,890
So, please spare Grand Prince Je Un's life.

973
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,260
(Moon River)
