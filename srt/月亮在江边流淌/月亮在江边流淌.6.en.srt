(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,020
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,170
- What? It is just a kid? - Let go! Let go, you murderer!

13
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,240
So you are the Jimjo merchant's son.

14
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,550
You were nowhere to be found when I was looking.

15
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,950
Why now, of all times?

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,950
If only you had shown up two months later.

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,189
- Household man. - Yes, my lord.

18
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,090
Goodness, hold still!

19
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,030
Open up! Open the door! Let me out!

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,030
Prepare my official robes at once.

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,299
Pardon? It is long before the morning drum rings.

22
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,400
What?

23
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,109
That is it for sleep tonight.

24
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,840
I will go to the palace as soon as the drum rings.

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,450
If I may ask, sir, what happened?

26
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,010
It seems Jimjo is still with the Left State Councillor.

27
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,250
Do not stray too far.

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,900
Shoo.

29
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,640
It is gone. The honeybee.

30
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,910
I said, it is gone.

31
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,960
I must be losing my mind.

32
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,930
I have completely lost it.

33
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,560
(Chapter Six: One Body and Soul, Gang Is Dal)

34
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,060
My lady... No.

35
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,530
I mean, Your Highness. Do you ever sleep?

36
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,070
Why are you out walking at dawn every day?

37
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,220
My congratulations on becoming the Crown Princess Consort...

38
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,200
You say that while you are still trembling.

39
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,210
Your Royal Wedding is imminent.

40
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,920
You must put the past behind you and live happily with His Highness.

41
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,350
Unless we have the wedding, I could remain his consort for years...

42
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,020
and still not truly be his wife.

43
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,520
What are you talking about?

44
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,330
Then why did you come to the palace at all?

45
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,270
So if you use that gun to avoid entering the palace,

46
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,440
are you saying you will abandon Grand Prince Je Un?

47
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,500
Because I had no other choice.

48
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,780
Are you going to use me as an excuse again?

49
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,680
You seem to be mistaken, so allow me to set you straight.

50
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,820
You were never in love with me.

51
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,050
Then what was it that I felt?

52
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,220
What we had all those years...

53
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,390
What was it?

54
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,860
Pity. Admiration.

55
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,070
Just pathetic foolishness, mistaking it for love.

56
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,600
If you call that love,

57
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,640
is that not an insult to love itself?

58
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,510
If you are no longer swayed by me, then how about this?

59
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,420
The Crown Prince took that peddler on as a eunuch.

60
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,290
How can a woman become a eunuch?

61
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,160
Where is she? Where is Dal right now?

62
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,830
You are so worried with that look on your face.

63
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,330
That is why I made up my mind.

64
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,930
Whether the Crown Prince gets hurt, she gets hurt, or they both do,

65
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,840
it will all be...

66
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,210
your fault, Grand Prince.

67
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,579
Your Highness, any further delay,

68
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,090
and you will be late for the assembly.

69
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,160
I am coming in, Your Highness.

70
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,590
What? Her Highness, the Crown Princess!

71
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,660
- Announce me. - Do not.

72
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,830
Grand Prince Je Un.

73
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,300
- Announce me. - I said, do not announce her!

74
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,570
You have not even had the Royal Wedding yet.

75
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,640
How dare you enter his quarters unannounced?

76
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,310
Since I have already broken protocol,

77
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,110
- why do I not break a few more? - What?

78
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,000
Gosh, it is so loud.

79
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,640
Why? What?

80
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,660
No. That is... It is not that. It is just...

81
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,160
Escort Her Highness out.

82
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,830
- But... - We should go, Your Highness.

83
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,930
Oh, my gosh. What in the world is happening?

84
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,600
Everyone, leave us.

85
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,040
Say a word and you will be punished. Do you understand?

86
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,280
Yes, sir. We understand.

87
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,110
Hurry along.

88
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,320
- Hey! What are you doing here? - What did you do to my body?

89
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,919
Done something? Please!

90
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,319
If I had, I would not feel so wronged.

91
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,360
Hey, and another thing,

92
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,160
- Oh, my. - This is my body you are in!

93
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,770
Do you think this is the time for an "I am you, you are me" chat?

94
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,040
The Chief Court Lady's niece and the Crown Princess saw it all.

95
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,240
To anyone watching,

96
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,510
it was like an affair between men, Your Highness.

97
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,080
Darn it.

98
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,990
Please...

99
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,230
just do not do anything.

100
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,640
Things were already going well.

101
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,550
- Why did the Crown Princess see it? - What should we do?

102
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,880
Will this not put that girl, Dal, in danger?

103
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,290
In my 50 years at the palace, I have learned one thing.

104
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,760
It is more important to avoid risk...

105
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,830
than to seize an opportunity.

106
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,599
It would be a different story if the Crown Prince...

107
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,930
made her his concubine.

108
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,370
For now, the best thing to do is stay out of it.

109
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,140
You are wise, as always, Your Majesty.

110
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,210
Learn from me while massaging.

111
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,380
Oh, right.

112
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,150
But at least the Crown Princess...

113
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,390
knows I am a woman.

114
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,290
That is what makes it even scarier.

115
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,830
A woman who shot the Crown Prince is capable of anything.

116
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,870
What are you talking about? A gun?

117
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,800
The Crown Princess is the one who shot you in the chest?

118
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,600
Did I forget to mention that?

119
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,350
But still, the two of you have made up, right?

120
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,250
She is not going to try and shoot me, is she?

121
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,890
She might.

122
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,650
Be careful. It is your body on the line now.

123
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,460
Mom, Dad...

124
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,200
I am a goner.

125
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,970
Your unfilial daughter...

126
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,730
is going on ahead.

127
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,380
Your Highness, what has you thinking so deeply?

128
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,339
The Royal Wedding is in under 50 days.

129
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,680
You are not having doubts, are you?

130
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,280
You are not planning something, are you?

131
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,420
Do not worry.

132
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,790
It will not be me making a move. The Chief Court Lady's niece will.

133
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
The Chief Court Lady's niece?

134
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,730
Is she not one of the Left State Councillor's people?

135
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,630
Then why would she start a rumour that would harm His Highness?

136
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,640
Because she, much like me,

137
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,140
- is a fool. - That is right. I had three!

138
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,880
- Did you hear the rumour? - What? What rumour?

139
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,150
- Swear you will not tell anyone. - Okay.

140
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,350
Last night...

141
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,820
The Crown Prince and his new eunuch...

142
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,389
- I heard they slept together. - Really?

143
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,630
- Yes! - That is insane!

144
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,170
Why bother with these romance novels when real life is so much juicier?

145
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,230
I know, right?

146
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,570
My goodness.

147
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,870
- Gosh, this is boring now. - Because reality is much juicier.

148
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,140
Unbelievable.

149
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,810
Your Highness.

150
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,680
A message arrived from your family's estate.

151
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,250
It is about Grand Prince Je Un...

152
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,580
What about Grand Prince Je Un?

153
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,840
What do you think you are doing?

154
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,750
I am taking it all back.

155
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,190
The warmth I gave you, the peace, the devotion. All of it.

156
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,050
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

157
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,160
I told you not to do anything. And yet...

158
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,630
You had to start a rumour about His Highness and Dal.

159
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,600
What is so funny?

160
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,470
- Is there something on my face? - No.

161
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,870
There is nothing on it.

162
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,080
Actually, you have some rice by your mouth.

163
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,280
Did you know?

164
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,190
U Hui, you said my face was clean.

165
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,890
If you say nothing is there, then nothing is there.

166
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,990
But if you say there is,

167
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,690
then that is when it appeared.

168
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,670
You still do not know me?

169
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,369
Did you think I would take the throne...

170
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,810
if you dethroned my brother?

171
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,940
I suppose you are right.

172
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,509
I do not know anything anymore.

173
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,110
No, you do.

174
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,050
You know what I want. What I desperately long for.

175
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,720
The one who was not in love...

176
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,420
was you, Grand Prince, not me.

177
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,490
What kind of man...

178
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,490
would want the woman he loves to become another's,

179
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,830
and desire it so desperately?

180
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,970
Fine.

181
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,240
It was just youthful foolishness.

182
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,670
Let us go our separate ways now.

183
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,280
Very well.

184
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,350
I will give you exactly what you want, Grand Prince.

185
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,650
I will become the Crown Princess.

186
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,180
I will become the Queen. And I will be Queen Dowager someday.

187
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,220
I intend to rightfully take every single one of those steps.

188
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,090
However, I might just speed up the timeline a bit.

189
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,200
If the King and the Crown Prince both die,

190
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,600
- the throne is yours, Grand Prince. - You...

191
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,769
Then, as King and Queen Dowager,

192
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,040
we will greet each other each morning,

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,440
we will have to see each other's faces.

194
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,940
Just as we once promised,

195
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,110
with gray hair and wrinkled faces,

196
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,280
we will grow old together.

197
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,750
And for me, that will be enough.

198
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:24,960
From now on,

199
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,930
let us never see each other again.

200
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Please.

201
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Now,

202
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,510
I find you repulsive.

203
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,600
If even this place grows cold,

204
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,670
where do I go now?

205
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,150
His Majesty and the Left State Councillor...

206
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,880
will try to resolve this by finding you, Dal.

207
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,550
Get me out of the palace.

208
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,520
I will hide at Grand Prince Je Un's for the time being.

209
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,620
Not even the Left State Councillor...

210
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,860
can search a Grand Prince's home without just cause.

211
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,800
But you think the Queen Dowager...

212
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,770
will just sit by and do nothing?

213
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,470
If it gets out she brought you here, she will be in trouble too.

214
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,370
So she will not make a move for now.

215
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,380
I will go to Boryeong and get your family to safety.

216
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
While I am gone,

217
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,620
hang in there.

218
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,610
Your Majesty!

219
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,340
Depose the Crown Prince for his affairs with men,

220
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,640
and restore the moral foundation of this nation!

221
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,680
- Restore it! - Restore it!

222
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,180
Your Majesty!

223
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,090
To say the Crown Prince had affairs with men...

224
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,920
Who dares utter such a horrendous accusation?

225
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,930
The eunuch who involved His Highness in this scandal...

226
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,630
entered the palace under a false identity.

227
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,830
The guards are already searching for him.

228
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:45,000
Once he is captured, His Highness should execute him...

229
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,040
to put this scandal to rest.

230
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,370
Go ahead and do that.

231
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,440
Find every person who spread this rumour immediately...

232
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,050
and bring me the eunuch who dragged the Crown Prince into this!

233
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,850
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

234
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,300
- Innkeeper! - Yes, sir.

235
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,560
Have you seen this person?

236
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,870
- I do not think so. - Take a good look.

237
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,850
Have you seen this man?

238
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,150
No, I have not.

239
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,040
He was the one who always said, "The Crown Prince does not beg."

240
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,110
So why is he really acting this way now?

241
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,350
This is pathetic.

242
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,720
To think I am reduced to begging.

243
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,770
Whoever is in charge up there ought to have a conscience.

244
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,270
If they had any conscience at all, they would not do this to me.

245
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,770
You have already taken everything from me.

246
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,770
My mother, my wife, and even my own body.

247
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,910
So please, just this once...

248
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,380
grant my prayer.

249
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,620
If you do, I will stop cursing you,

250
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,990
and I will not resent you anymore.

251
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,390
At least protect...

252
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Dal's body.

253
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,370
Please.

254
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,480
Please save me, my lord.

255
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,190
I know this puts you in danger too, but...

256
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Dal...

257
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,390
Please just...

258
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
save me.

259
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,430
You are the one who saved my daughter's life.

260
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,430
How could I possibly turn my back on you?

261
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,840
Tell me. How can I help you?

262
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,740
Please use this to help my family find refuge,

263
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,610
and please take me in.

264
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,190
I will be counting on you, my lord.

265
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,790
You are not even stopping to eat, or to see your family.

266
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,930
Now that they know I have left the palace,

267
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,300
the Left State Councillor will be investigating me.

268
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,000
If someone were to see me with the innkeeper's family,

269
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,540
they could all be in grave danger.

270
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,440
I must hurry before I stay too long and get caught.

271
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,270
From what I saw, your feet are in bad shape.

272
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,010
Dal...

273
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,820
How did she ever endure this?

274
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,290
That a life on the run...

275
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,330
could be this arduous...

276
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,630
and lonely.

277
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,000
I had no idea.

278
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,970
What do you mean by that, sir?

279
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,170
Did you say Dal is your wife's niece?

280
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,540
It is what Dal asked of me.

281
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,980
I fear that Dal is in danger,

282
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,810
so I must take her under my protection.

283
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,620
So you must all close up the inn and go into hiding for a while.

284
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,920
What do you mean Dal is in danger? Where is she right now?

285
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,190
I cannot explain.

286
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,060
I will not move a single step until you explain everything.

287
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,860
You will have to kill me to make me move.

288
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,800
So please, tell me!

289
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,840
Hey, what is all this? You cannot just say that suddenly.

290
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,640
That Dal is not our daughter anymore?

291
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,409
She may not be my birth daughter,

292
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,440
but we have raised her for five years.

293
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,280
And now, without any proper explanation,

294
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,310
how can you just take someone's daughter away like that?

295
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,280
There is no time to explain. It is better if you do not know.

296
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,490
From now on,

297
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,360
you two must go your own way.

298
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,130
Did we ever ask you for money?

299
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,000
Who do you think you are? The Almighty?

300
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,530
You may have been the one who brought Dal into our family,

301
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,270
- but we say when this family ends. - That is right!

302
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,040
Dal went to the capital!

303
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,810
I intend to take her and leave Joseon.

304
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,150
That could put both of you in danger.

305
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,210
I cannot explain everything,

306
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,949
but Dal's secret is far bigger and more dangerous...

307
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,350
than being a runaway slave!

308
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,550
So what if it is?

309
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,630
Remember what you said when you first gave Dal to us?

310
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,700
You told us to live as a family of three so we would look normal.

311
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,000
My husband felt sorry for me, as if he were adding to my burdens,

312
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,200
but I was happy.

313
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,640
It felt like I finally had permission to live a normal life.

314
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,150
That is why I am going to continue being Dal's mother.

315
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,720
Even if it gets dangerous,

316
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,890
that is the life I have chosen!

317
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,920
She is right.

318
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,590
We are experts at making our own lives difficult.

319
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,990
We bring it all on ourselves.

320
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,700
So whether we go to weave sandals or weave more trouble,

321
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,270
we will be so ridiculously happy that it makes other people jealous.

322
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,770
So take us with you!

323
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,410
Come on, lead the way! You said our daughter's in danger!

324
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,610
Your Excellency.

325
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,380
We have the court lady who spread the rumour.

326
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,980
Kill her.

327
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,150
The thing is,

328
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,350
she is the Chief Court Lady's niece.

329
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,390
- Who is behind this? - No one. It is just a silly rumour.

330
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,190
And it is not as if she was telling a complete lie.

331
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,500
What are your orders?

332
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,800
The Chief Court Lady has outlived her usefulness.

333
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,780
Auntie.

334
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,110
Why on earth?

335
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,550
What possessed you to do something like that?

336
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,420
What did you possibly think you were doing?

337
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,890
Because it is unfair!

338
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,690
The Crown Princess Consort tried to kill the Crown Prince,

339
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,890
and she sent those ruffians after him.

340
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,630
Even the Queen Dowager knew and gave the order,

341
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,870
so why is the Chief Royal Secretary only one exiled?

342
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,170
Why is he the only one who was exiled?

343
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,110
You...

344
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,740
- Do not tell me... - It is true.

345
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,650
He is the man I love.

346
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,280
He is my lover.

347
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,790
My lord!

348
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,960
Please, I am begging you. Spare my niece's life.

349
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,530
I thought you would be useful to me for a long time to come.

350
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,990
What a shame.

351
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Dal of the Park Clan...

352
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,630
I have brought information about that peddler.

353
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,630
Now that the Crown Prince has lost interest in her,

354
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,870
what good is that girl to me?

355
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,310
Why do you suppose His Highness suddenly lost interest?

356
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,810
Overnight,

357
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,580
a eunuch who looks like the deposed Crown Princess...

358
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,850
suddenly appears out of nowhere?

359
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,020
Have you still not caught that eunuch?

360
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,960
We are searching for him, Your Majesty.

361
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,190
But when he is caught, what do you plan to do?

362
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,100
Will you have him executed?

363
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,860
He must be executed, of course.

364
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,500
Take the Royal Command,

365
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,570
Your Royal Highness.

366
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:41,970
Sorry?

367
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,280
Hand over the eunuch, Your Royal Highness.

368
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,150
What is the meaning of this?

369
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,520
Are you saying the Crown Prince is hiding the eunuch?

370
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,030
Forgive me.

371
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,500
- Please kill me, Your Highness. - Please kill me, Your Highness.

372
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,700
It is all right.

373
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,830
Left Flank Guard, bring me a sword.

374
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,869
What?

375
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,900
A sword? Why?

376
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,210
For daring to spill tea on your royal robe,

377
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,480
you must punish this act of disloyalty.

378
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,910
But she only spilled a cup of tea.

379
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,720
- How is that disloyal? - Bring me...

380
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
the sword.

381
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Bring it.

382
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Your Majesty!

383
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,279
Do you think she will be safe forever...

384
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,050
just because you protect her now?

385
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,420
I have to protect her for now.

386
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,720
Is that not the only way to ensure her future?

387
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,390
So then,

388
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,920
Park Dal...

389
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,760
Are you hiding that girl as well, Your Highness?

390
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,060
Did you think I would not find out?

391
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,870
That the eunuch... No.
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

392
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,370
That the woman is Park Dal.

393
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,310
What is the meaning of all this?

394
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,380
A woman?

395
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,780
Did the Left State Councillor tell the truth?

396
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,230
Is anyone there?

397
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,370
Why is no one around?

398
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,240
Hey!

399
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,270
I will be in touch.

400
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,850
Gosh.

401
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,650
Hey, watch it. Gosh.

402
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,620
Hey, come on!

403
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
How dare you just grab a lady's wrist like that?

404
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,329
You are on the run. You cannot be out there.

405
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,000
What if you get caught?

406
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,660
What are you, a master of disguise?

407
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,900
One minute you are a woman, then a man, a peddler, and a eunuch.

408
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,740
Because the Queen Dowager caught me, I did not have a choice...

409
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,510
Never mind.

410
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,210
Anyway, why were you at the Crown Prince's quarters that early?

411
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,510
Do not tell me that man from Qing just now...

412
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,150
was he a messenger with news about the Jimjo Poison?

413
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,090
How do you know about that?

414
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,930
Did my brother really tell you all of that?

415
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,530
Oh, right. Well...

416
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:59,070
Yes. The Gyesa Year Incident, the Jimjo Poison, and all the rest.

417
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,500
I know more about it than anyone, so you can just tell me.

418
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,110
So, was there any news from Qing?

419
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,050
Why would I trust you with something so important?

420
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,820
I will speak to my brother directly, so stop prying.

421
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,920
No, it is no use telling him. Why will you not...

422
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,590
Then again...

423
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,660
What good would it do for me to hear it now? I am a fugitive.

424
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,970
What are you still doing here? Get out.

425
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,240
- Hey, this is my house. - You know my situation full well.

426
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,540
Let me just hide out here with you for a while, all right?

427
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,280
Dal. Do you want to hide behind me forever?

428
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,090
Are you cursing me to be a fugitive for the rest of my life?

429
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,890
You might as well go hire a shaman and put a proper curse on me.

430
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,690
No. Stay by my side.

431
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,630
Marry me.

432
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,760
What nonsense are you spewing?

433
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,570
If you marry me,

434
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,170
the Left State Councillor will stop seeing you as a threat.

435
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Fine.

436
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,370
You know my situation, so I will be blunt.

437
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,410
As long as you are in the picture,

438
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,650
I am worried he will either abandon his revenge,

439
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,990
or break off the Royal Wedding out of resentment for U Hui.

440
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,019
It is a win-win. You will be safe,

441
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,260
and I will ensure the Royal Wedding succeeds.

442
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,190
Think about it.

443
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,430
Listen here, Grand Prince.

444
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,970
Snap out of it.

445
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,440
I can protect myself.

446
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,860
The Crown Prince must still suffer from his accident's aftereffects.

447
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,090
I trust you will understand, Left State Councillor.

448
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,800
If this is indeed about His Highness's poor health,

449
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,540
I would support him a thousand times over,

450
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
but if, on the off chance,

451
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,810
His Highness has other intentions...

452
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,210
What guarantee is there...

453
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,180
something like the Gyesa Incident from years ago...

454
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,350
will not happen again?

455
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
Left State Councillor.

456
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,680
Looking for this?

457
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,590
My father is still using you, I see.

458
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,659
Even though he must know you helped me...

459
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,990
try to kill the Crown Prince.

460
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,690
And that you gave me his letter.

461
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,900
He is really something, is he not?

462
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,500
He never discards anyone useful, no matter the risk.

463
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,740
Not you. Not me.

464
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,070
Not even the Jimjo.

465
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,250
Hand her over.

466
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,090
If I do,

467
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,560
she will be killed.

468
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,090
If you are that concerned, I will make her a government slave...

469
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,430
and spare her life.

470
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,730
I cannot let that happen.

471
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,170
Gang.

472
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,440
Do not defy the Left State Councillor.

473
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,040
The Gyesa Year Incident is not over yet.

474
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,280
Think of the Queen and my father-in-law who died for you,

475
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,420
and your wife, the Crown Princess.

476
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,020
You would give up revenge and your future over a mere eunuch?

477
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,490
Revenge?

478
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,500
That is why I killed Her Majesty, the Queen,

479
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,770
and framed the former Crown Princess for the crime.

480
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,269
That is why...

481
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,770
you chose death instead of getting revenge.

482
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,710
How pathetic.

483
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,160
Keep it as an ace up your sleeve.

484
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,360
When the Left State Councillor falls,

485
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,199
To keep power from the Queen Dowager when the Left State Councillor falls,

486
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,500
you need some leverage of your own.

487
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,770
Forgive me...

488
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,030
for using this now, Father.

489
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,270
Come out for a second.

490
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,910
What are you talking about?

491
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,710
No.

492
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,210
You have to go to the interrogation chamber.

493
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,450
If they punish you in front of all the ministers,

494
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,690
our scandal will die down.

495
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,720
His Majesty has already shown leniency,

496
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,819
so if you go now, he will just enslave you,

497
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,860
and that will be the end of it.

498
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,830
I know you will suffer for now, Your Highness,

499
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,100
but there is no other way.

500
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,970
But I swear I will switch you back. Okay?

501
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,710
I was a slave to begin with, so if I become one again,

502
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,140
it is no big deal to me.

503
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,280
I rode day and night between Boryeong and Hanyang,

504
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,590
afraid I would be caught if I stopped. But even so,

505
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,220
my heart ached more than my body did.

506
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,230
This is how you have had to live. But...

507
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,100
how can you say you were not wronged?

508
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,860
Why are you being such a fool?

509
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,940
Then what am I supposed to do?

510
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
They said if you did not bring me back,

511
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,470
if you defied the Left State Councillor,

512
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,080
your revenge for the Crown Princess...

513
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,580
and your entire future would be ruined.

514
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,650
I know how you must feel every single day when you wake.

515
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,090
I know because I have lived that dream of yours.

516
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,760
So how could I stand in the way of your future?

517
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,870
Do not cry...

518
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,470
with that face.

519
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,860
I said, do not cry.

520
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,460
I will handle this.

521
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,830
So stop.

522
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,470
- Okay? - What do you mean?

523
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,610
How are you going to handle it?

524
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,950
A dogfight.

525
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,400
Why are you here?

526
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,030
What are you doing?

527
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,940
I am here to take you to the Left State Councillor.

528
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,140
What did you say?

529
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,720
The resemblance is uncanny.

530
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,390
What did I do that was so wrong?

531
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:14,320
You are a woman that entered the palace posing as a eunuch.

532
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,260
By the National Code, it is a crime of deceiving the Royal Court,

533
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,200
punishable by over 100 floggings, exile, and hard labour.

534
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,030
The law is certainly thorough, is it not?

535
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,340
Fine. The law must be obeyed.

536
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,570
Within these hallowed palace walls,

537
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,580
I have committed a great deception.

538
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,279
Since I will likely be beaten to death anyway,

539
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,880
may I ask one question?

540
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,750
What of a nobleman who forces himself on a woman he harassed?

541
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,120
What punishment does he receive?

542
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,030
What does the Great Ming Code of the National Code say about that?

543
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,730
What does it say about that in there?

544
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,370
According to the Great Ming Code, that is the crime of lewdness.

545
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,970
If one forcibly harasses a woman or causes her sexual humiliation,

546
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,310
he is punishable by 50 to 80 lashes or 80 to 100 floggings.

547
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,480
Furthermore, a noble can be exiled or stripped of his position.

548
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,920
If he is royalty or a high official, he could even be put to death.

549
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,160
The Minister of Justice cannot even recall a simple law.

550
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,690
Oh, my. Is that right?

551
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,160
Then allow me to make an accusation.

552
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,530
The Minister of Personnel over there harassed me before Donhwamun Gate,

553
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,670
and he untied the sash of my blouse. I trust that poses no problem?

554
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,180
What? That is absolute nonsense!

555
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,280
Wait. You are that peddler!

556
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,690
How are you going to handle it?

557
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,460
A dogfight.

558
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,130
I saw it.

559
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,870
I saw it! With my own two eyes!

560
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,600
Left State Councillor, that is not it. I mean...

561
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,900
So the Minister of Personnel is quite the lecher.

562
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,770
- So shameless. - Says who, Minister of War?

563
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,440
So the man in charge of provisions can just embezzle them?

564
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,109
You call that honourable?

565
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,120
Your potbelly is from the rations.

566
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,279
What are you talking about?

567
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,920
Minister of Finance is the one who stole them.

568
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,860
I merely sold exemptions for military service...

569
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:31,690
Why are you singling me out? Am I the only scoundrel here?

570
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:36,470
I hear the Mayor of the Capital gambles away all his bribe money.

571
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,999
You think gambling is a problem?

572
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,770
It is better than taking bribes and handing them out to shamans.

573
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,610
When Chief Scholar acts like this, it is a disgrace to our principles!

574
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,510
Hey, that is...

575
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,920
Are you all quite finished?

576
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,130
Let he who is without sin among you cast the first stone.

577
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:11,030
I guess she has a point.

578
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:15,370
Indeed. This nation's vermin must be caught.

579
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,880
I will expose every corrupt minister and see them punished.

580
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,880
- Left State Councillor! - Left State Councillor!

581
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,150
However, Your Highness.

582
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,080
For today, let us first punish Park Dal.

583
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,760
If you are that concerned, I will make her a government slave...

584
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,930
and spare her life.

585
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,800
But 100 floggings is a death sentence.

586
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,130
Instead, I will have her sent far away.

587
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,040
Let us settle this by exiling her to Jeju as a government slave.

588
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,470
Jeju? A government slave?

589
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,339
This is better for you too.

590
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,140
You are soon to become the King's in-law.

591
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,449
If that girl is flogged to death,

592
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,610
people will gossip about the Crown Princess Consort.

593
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,080
Spare your daughter the humiliation.

594
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,520
Your Highness, what do you mean? Jeju? A government slave?

595
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,390
Give the order, Your Highness.

596
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,560
You need to punish her yourself for the rumour to die down.

597
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Your Highness.

598
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,660
Do not defy the Left State Councillor.

599
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,300
Think of the Queen and my father-in-law who died for you,

600
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,400
and your wife, the Crown Princess.

601
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,480
Park...

602
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,280
Park Dal...

603
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,320
is to be exiled to Jeju...

604
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,850
- as a government slave... - Announcing the Queen Dowager.

605
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,780
Release this girl.

606
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,910
With respect, Your Majesty, this matter does not concern you.

607
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:07,250
On the contrary. This is very much my concern.

608
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,050
This girl is under my protection.

609
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,220
Give that to me!

610
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,830
What do you think you are doing?

611
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,230
I have watched over His Highness since the day he was born.

612
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,040
If someone died because of him, he could never live with himself.

613
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,110
He does not have it in him to be that cruel.

614
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Let go of it!

615
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:37,150
Go to the Queen Dowager with this, and make sure you survive.

616
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,550
So His Highness does not have to carry that burden.

617
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,440
Please save me, Your Majesty.

618
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,110
I was the one who brought Park Dal into the palace as a eunuch.

619
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:08,940
As a reward for saving His Highness at Sinjusa,

620
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,950
I intended to make her a court lady,

621
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,380
but I recalled the court ladies...

622
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,150
wrongly cast out by the Chief Court Lady.

623
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,560
This girl, who so resembles the deposed Crown Princess...

624
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,930
It was clear she would be cast out, so I made a small arrangement.

625
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,560
How...

626
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:31,530
could a royal elder so brazenly break palace laws?

627
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The laws?

628
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,170
Very well.

629
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,940
That day, your daughter, before she was even wed,

630
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,280
entered the Crown Prince's chambers without being announced.

631
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,650
Then by those laws, your daughter, as well as the corrupt officials...

632
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,050
should all be punished, should they not?

633
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:56,190
Perhaps we should examine each offence...

634
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,090
and make an issue of every single one?

635
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,450
Your Majesty, I can never repay you for saving my life.

636
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,850
As you should be.

637
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:25,390
I have brought you in as a court lady for now,

638
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,860
but you are to make her your royal concubine soon.

639
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,760
Pardon?

640
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,230
A royal concubine?

641
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,000
That is preposterous.

642
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,900
Preposterous? What on earth are you saying?

643
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:41,640
I have not even married the Crown Princess yet.

644
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,940
How can I possibly take a concubine before the wedding?

645
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,180
Besides, this girl is merely a court lady.

646
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,650
I fear I will incur His Majesty's wrath.

647
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,680
For a man to be so full of fear...

648
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,050
Was losing one Crown Princess not enough for you?

649
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,390
Do you plan to let this girl die by the Left State Councillor too?

650
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,390
I pity the late Crown Princess.

651
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,400
To think she loved such a coward, only to die.

652
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,570
Your Majesty, you have said more than enough.

653
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:20,210
I may be an old woman pushed aside, but I am still...

654
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,580
the head of the Inner Court of this nation.

655
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:26,450
You will do as I say!

656
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,210
Do you want to give it a try?

657
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:02,680
It makes you feel all bubbly inside.

658
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:13,960
What are you talking about?

659
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,459
Are you saying it was not U Hui who started the rumours...

660
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,530
about His Majesty?

661
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,990
No, why are you suddenly bringing up the Crown Princess Consort?

662
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,329
It was the Chief Court Lady's niece.

663
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,470
Lady U Hui's maid, Yeo Ri, told me.

664
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,030
Please give me that.

665
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,340
From now on, let us never see each other again.

666
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,810
Now, I find you repulsive.

667
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,620
What have I done?

668
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,370
The Queen Dowager is just too much.

669
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,970
She demands the concubine position as if you were saving it for her.

670
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:07,280
Because that is why she saved my life.

671
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,879
The Left Flank Guard said...

672
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,280
you threatened her with evidence of treason.

673
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,590
Is there more to it? Come on. What did you say?

674
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:25,460
Did you really think your threats would scare me?

675
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,960
I had nothing to do with it.

676
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,160
All I have to do is deny it, and that is that.

677
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,970
If Your Majesty denies it, the world may be fooled.

678
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:37,240
But you cannot fool yourself, can you, Your Majesty?

679
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,340
I am not threatening you, Your Majesty.

680
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,840
I am proving my usefulness to you.

681
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,710
Do not just see this medicine bowl.

682
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,080
See me, the one who brought it.

683
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:53,190
For you to be in possession of something this important...

684
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,860
means you have grown much closer to the Crown Prince. Is that it?

685
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,400
Yes.

686
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,070
Did the Crown Prince say so?

687
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,100
Did he say he has feelings for you?

688
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,610
He has not said it in so many words,

689
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,480
but His Highness the Crown Prince...

690
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,880
definitely loves Park Dal.

691
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:19,920
That he loves her.

692
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,850
That the Crown Prince loves Park Dal.

693
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,060
She said he likes her enough to trust her with my secrets.

694
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,430
And that they have even slept together?

695
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,700
So why will he not make her his concubine?

696
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,770
Perhaps it is because of that.

697
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:49,240
- That? - Young people play "push and pull."

698
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,450
Why on earth would they be pulling a rope?

699
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,250
Not a real rope. It is an emotional push and pull.

700
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,390
They pretend to push the other away, but when they feel them slipping,

701
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:01,660
they subtly pull them back in. A lover's game of push and pull.

702
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,430
I did it to survive, okay? Just to survive.

703
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,960
When your life is on the line, you will do anything.

704
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:10,330
Hey, I am not judging.

705
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,130
You either like them or you do not.

706
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,300
Why all this wishy-washy nonsense?

707
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,239
Kids these days, honestly.

708
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,880
It is because they have never had to struggle.

709
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,150
Wait, so if I do not become a concubine,

710
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,550
the Queen Dowager will...

711
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,650
She might kill you.

712
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:35,890
I see.

713
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,100
And here I thought I was the one who needed consoling.

714
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:44,799
Between the Crown Princess Consort, the Left State Councillor,

715
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,370
and the Queen Dowager.

716
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,100
Talk about a minefield.

717
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,040
And right now, I am the one who has to dodge them.

718
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,280
Your Highness.

719
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,049
Do not go ahead with this Royal Wedding.

720
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,280
Do not worry.

721
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,590
We will probably be back in our bodies before the wedding.

722
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,760
We have to be back before then.

723
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:11,930
Even if we switch back, do not go through with this marriage!

724
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,460
What are you saying?

725
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:19,330
Marrying the woman who shot you makes no sense,

726
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,540
and it is absurd that I am in danger because of it.

727
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,040
The whole thing is absurd, so call off the Royal Wedding.

728
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,580
If I call off this marriage,

729
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,550
the Left State Councillor will have me killed.

730
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:36,890
You know what they say.

731
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,660
They say the best defence is a good offence.

732
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,030
You must take him out before he takes you out.

733
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,730
Why are you suddenly staring like that?

734
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,670
The Gyesa Year Incident, Your Highness's revenge.

735
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,100
I want in on it.

736
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,670
Since your body is mine right now,

737
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:01,240
that means half of this revenge is mine as well.

738
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:10,890
As you ordered, I looked into the girl, Park Dal.

739
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,290
The Park family's inn in Boryeong has closed down,

740
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,460
and the innkeeper and the family have vanished without a trace.

741
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,130
Is this the Crown Prince's doing?

742
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:19,490
Well,

743
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,330
it seems Lord Heo Ok was behind it.

744
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:24,900
Ok was? Why?

745
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,770
Apparently, Park Dal is Lord Heo's niece by marriage.

746
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,140
After losing her parents, she was struggling to get by,

747
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,310
so Lord Heo set her up as a peddler at the Boryeong inn.

748
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,500
What is the meaning of this?

749
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,300
Thank you, my lord.

750
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:59,870
We must keep him in a gilded cage until he is old enough.

751
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,300
I will take my leave.

752
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,420
There is something I need to confirm,

753
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,590
so I will need you to take care of something for me.

754
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,500
I really wish you would not go. It is too dangerous.

755
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,040
Come on, we have no idea when we will get our bodies back.

756
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,470
And I cannot just sit on my hands and wait.

757
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,010
But still.

758
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,550
By the way, why take revenge at a courtesan house?

759
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,750
The Crown Prince, a fool who frequents courtesan houses.

760
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,590
What better cover is there to fool the Left State Councillor?

761
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,490
Gosh, my hands just will not listen to me.

762
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,690
Oh, there you go.

763
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,000
There are no holes...

764
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:06,740
in the cover I created. Got it?

765
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,270
Honestly, you are so clumsy.

766
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,640
There. All done.

767
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,420
What is it?

768
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,020
What?

769
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,720
Watch the corner behind you.

770
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,060
Your Highness.

771
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,300
Your Highness.

772
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,640
Your Highness... You gave me such a fright.

773
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,910
Why am I always the one to see this? Why me?

774
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,770
It is so annoying!

775
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,980
- So frustrating! - Se Dol.

776
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,749
It is not what it looks like.

777
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,610
Se Dol.

778
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,720
Of all the times for that jerk to walk in...

779
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,620
Your Highness.

780
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:34,420
I do not think we can go out today.

781
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:35,760
What are you talking about?

782
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,430
Grand Prince Je Un is apparently sick.

783
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,530
My lord, you cannot avoid this forever.

784
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,370
The Royal Wedding is less than 50 days away,

785
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,370
so do you not think it will be fine if I just wait until then?

786
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,820
But why is Grand Prince Je Un seeking revenge?

787
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,390
Especially when he is in love with the Crown Princess Consort?

788
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,219
The Left State Councillor spread a rumour that Je Un's mother,

789
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,690
who died after being falsely accused of adultery,

790
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:12,930
that her vengeful spirit caused the Gyesa Year Incident.

791
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:14,830
All to cover up the death by Jimjo Poison.

792
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,330
That scumbag went after his family?

793
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,700
Goodness.

794
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,670
Poor Grand Prince Je Un. How devastated he must be.

795
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,439
Hey, have you ever felt that bad for me...

796
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,610
and what I have been through?

797
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,940
Is his pain all that matters? What about mine?

798
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,350
I do. Every single night. In my dreams.

799
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,160
But a life where I wear silk shoes...

800
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,060
and walk at a leisurely pace.

801
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:48,360
That is the life I want.

802
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:58,670
Welcome.

803
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,010
This one...

804
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,950
This one is pretty too. I will take this one and this one.

805
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:22,830
- You look so beautiful dressed up. - Totally.

806
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:27,500
Goodness. What is this?

807
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:31,310
When I am all dressed up like this,

808
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,410
I look like a young lady from a noble family.

809
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,680
How beautiful.

810
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:39,610
Take a good look.

811
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,360
See just how lovely you are.

812
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,530
And how precious you are.

813
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,870
So from now on,

814
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,940
all that talk of being a slave and putting others first.

815
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,710
Do not think like that. Got it?

816
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,720
Oh, my goodness.

817
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:19,050
You look so beautiful today. You should have a portrait painted.

818
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,689
My brother is painting out front.

819
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,790
You have no idea how good he is.

820
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,460
And since you bought so many clothes today,

821
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:28,860
just for you, I will give you 30 percent off.

822
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,400
It is not like it is free or anything.

823
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:38,770
- It is fine. Let us just go. - No, let us do it.

824
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,910
I do look pretty today, you know.

825
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:43,910
Great! Right this way.

826
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,980
(Four Frames of Life)

827
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,420
What are you two doing?

828
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,520
- What? - Scooch in a little closer now.

829
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:58,430
Can we not just...

830
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:00,330
Just draw us like this.

831
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,170
Come on, now. The paper is too small for that.

832
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:06,530
What does the size of the paper have to do with anything?

833
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,040
He said the paper is too small.

834
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,670
What can you do?

835
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,579
Right? If the paper is small...

836
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,610
Since the paper is small...

837
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:24,090
All right, I am starting now. This will be quick.

838
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,530
Okay, second pose.

839
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:43,470
My goodness, you two...

840
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,670
are quite awkward.

841
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,410
Here I go.

842
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,380
Hold still.

843
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:56,750
How about a big smile for pose three from you, my lady?

844
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:59,590
Me? I am not usually one to get nervous.

845
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:02,160
- Okay. - He meant me.

846
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,660
What are you on about? Come on, big smile!

847
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,630
Oh, my, so pretty.

848
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,930
You are even prettier when you smile.

849
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:16,140
All right, for the last one, big smiles from both of you!

850
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,420
How pretty.

851
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,820
It is a spitting image of you.

852
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,660
Gosh, excuse me.

853
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:42,200
Such a nice scent. It is a delight to the nose.

854
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:46,500
- You are being so dramatic. - Smell it and tell me I am wrong.

855
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:02,420
You were not being dramatic.

856
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:05,420
I... I know, right?

857
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,460
Gosh. What kind of incense smells this good?

858
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,900
Gosh.

859
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:16,560
That scent is a killer.

860
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,970
You are not selling anything harmful, are you?

861
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,470
No, of course not.

862
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,970
It is just an occupational hazard for an incense maker.

863
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:27,340
From smelling strong incense and inhaling smoke every day,

864
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:29,510
it is bound to ruin one's lungs.

865
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:35,050
But why would you keep doing this, even if it is ruining your health?

866
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:37,080
Are you struggling that much financially?

867
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:41,420
No. Who would risk their last breath just to put food on the table?

868
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:43,360
We do it simply because we love it.

869
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,790
My wife stays because she loves the incense,

870
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,800
and I stay by her side because I love her.

871
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:55,500
We have lived this way for 40 years now.

872
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,240
A husband protects his wife's dream. What else is he to do?

873
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,040
He protects them because he loves her.

874
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,780
What other choice is there?

875
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:20,490
What is this?

876
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,030
It is so pretty.

877
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,100
Hey, look at this.

878
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:48,520
Come on. That is from the ground. It is filthy.

879
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,530
- Filthy? It is beautiful. - Beautiful, my foot.

880
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,330
Spring may melt the snow away, but flower petals...

881
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,570
have to be cleaned up by people.

882
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:03,070
It all costs money and manpower.

883
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,110
What has gotten into you?

884
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:09,110
But seeing the petals piled up makes me happy.

885
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:13,050
The petals are piling up, not you. Why are you happy?

886
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,580
Like mighty oaks from little acorns, happiness grows from little piles.

887
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:21,190
"Gently piling up" sounds like small blessings piling up...

888
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,259
like a promise of happiness.

889
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:24,690
Does it not feel that way to you?

890
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,220
My dear.

891
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:21,120
They say this scent is supposed to help you sleep.

892
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,680
I wanted to thank you for everything.

893
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:43,170
You head back to the palace first.

894
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,750
What were you doing?

895
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,450
I was listening to the sound of the snow falling.

896
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,490
Gently piling up.

897
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:36,520
It is as if little blessings are piling up like snow.

898
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,490
Does it not feel like a promise of happiness?

899
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,770
Here, give me your hand.

900
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,680
Here.

901
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:03,120
Your small blessing for today.

902
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,760
It is so beautiful.

903
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,570
Truly.

904
01:08:25,570 --> 01:08:27,840
I smiled at another woman.

905
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:31,080
I even dared to feel happy.

906
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:34,010
How shameless of me.

907
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:42,360
Please just blame it on how much she looks like you...

908
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,760
and find it in your heart to forgive me.

909
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,220
What is this?

910
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,120
Why are you doing this?

911
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:19,390
Untie me!

912
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:21,800
Do not waste your strength.

913
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,100
The drug has not worn off yet.

914
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:26,170
Was it the Left State Councillor?

915
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,440
The Left State Councillor ordered you to kill me?

916
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,410
I wish that were the case,

917
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,140
but he needs something confirmed.

918
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,980
Today, I will only leave a subtle mark.

919
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,050
This medicine will make you barren.

920
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:44,080
Your only use is to conceive the Grand Heir.

921
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:48,590
Once you are of no use, the Queen Dowager will kill you.

922
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,660
No! Let me go!

923
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:57,260
Let me go! No! Let go of me!

924
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:00,200
Let me go! Let go!

925
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:07,910
Flower shoes on the likes of you?

926
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,740
Burn them.

927
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:18,790
"Dream" is...

928
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,820
too grand a word for it.

929
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:23,960
Other than straw shoes,

930
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,290
I want one in silk shoes.

931
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:30,160
Where I do not have to run anymore. A life where I can settle down...

932
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,300
and make a real family of my own.

933
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:40,410
How dare you...

934
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,080
How dare you!

935
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,730
What are you standing around for? Seize her!

936
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:11,440
You wretched girl!

937
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:21,550
That wench...

938
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,260
That vicious wench.

939
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:39,370
She put her bare hands into the brazier...

940
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,040
for a pair of flower shoes.

941
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,200
Not here.

942
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,570
If I am going to collapse,

943
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,940
I have to do it somewhere safe.

944
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:33,090
Even a street hustler's shell game is not this confusing.

945
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:34,890
One moment, he is a warm spring breeze,

946
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,990
and the next, an icy gust of wind.

947
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,960
It is just not fair for me. Am I wrong?

948
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,659
Are you tired of me too?

949
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,330
Are you giving me the cold shoulder now?

950
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:45,800
Where are you going? I am not finished!

951
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:48,100
Mangdeok.

952
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,370
Mangdeok!

953
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,340
Mangdeok!

954
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,580
Mangdeok!

955
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,680
Mangdeok.

956
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,020
Where are you going?

957
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,759
Mangdeok.

958
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,830
You startled me.

959
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,000
Your Highness?

960
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,840
Your Highness!

961
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:27,210
What on earth happened to you?

962
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:28,980
Why are you not wearing your flower shoes...

963
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:30,780
but clutching them like a treasure?

964
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:33,910
Goodness.

965
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:36,020
And you are barefoot.

966
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:37,520
For goodness' sake.

967
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,690
And what happened to your hands?

968
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,760
Was not wearing flower shoes your dream?

969
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,800
Why are you suddenly going on about the flower shoes?

970
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:58,510
A husband protects his wife's dream. What else is he to do?

971
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:00,370
He protects them because he loves her.

972
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:02,640
What other choice is there?

973
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:05,150
You...

974
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:07,750
wear your flower shoes.

975
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,350
I will be the one...

976
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:13,590
running barefoot.

977
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,390
What are you...

978
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,030
From now on,

979
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,940
I cannot look the other way anymore.

980
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:43,880
Your Highness.

981
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:47,090
Your Highness.

982
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,290
Your Highness.

983
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,530
This girl now inhabits my body,

984
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:02,800
and in my heart,

985
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:07,070
the moon flows.

986
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:19,290
(Moon River)

987
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,470
What am I going to do? Please wake up!

988
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:41,240
This must be why we switched bodies. So I would be hurt instead of you.

989
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:44,079
Her uncanny resemblance of the deceased Crown Princess.

990
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,180
It is unsettling.

991
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,450
- Get rid of her. - His Highness cannot protect Dal.

992
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:53,720
From now on, I am your shield. And you will hide behind me.

993
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:57,820
When you keep acting like this, you make me hope for the impossible.

994
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,560
Your Highness, do you have feelings for me?

995
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:20,480
(Moon River)
