1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,850
(Kang Tae Oh)

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,920
(Kim Se Jeong)

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,520
(Lee Sin Young)

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,390
(Hong Su Zu)

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,060
(Jin Goo)

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,630
(Nam Gi Ae)

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,370
(And Kim Nam Hee)

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,049
(Moon River)

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,380
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

10
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,680
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,020
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

12
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,270
You have done well.

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,280
At dawn, I will interrogate the Left State Councilor myself.

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,040
So you should return to the palace as well.

15
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,880
As you command, Your Majesty.

16
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,050
The Royal Concubine must have been very frightened.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,020
No, I am all right.

18
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,930
Your Royal Highness, why the long face?

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,800
It is all over now,

20
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,900
but I am worried that you still seem so upset.

21
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,100
His Majesty must have mixed feelings as well.

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,580
After all, he lost my mother because of the Left State Councilor.

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,650
Royal Mother

24
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,610
Royal Mother

25
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,590
Your Highness.

26
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,790
- I have been having these dreams. - Your Highness.

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,630
What are your orders regarding this woman?

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,970
You must leave before my father has you killed.

29
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,640
Do not worry about your mother.

30
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
Just save yourself.

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,710
My mother's life is in the Left State Councilor's hands,

32
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,380
so I am not going anywhere.

33
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,890
I am sorry.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,030
I apologize on my father's behalf.

35
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,130
There is no need for that.

36
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,370
- Not that pot. The other one. - Right.

37
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,380
The Left State Councilor is jailed,

38
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,810
and the Royal Investigation Office will investigate him.

39
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,550
What has you so deep in thought?

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,390
I wonder what started this tragedy.

41
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,090
What drove the Left State Councilor to be so relentlessly evil?

42
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,390
I am just curious.

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,560
You know the saying.

44
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,500
Good people cannot fathom true evil,

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,200
and evil people cannot fathom true goodness.

46
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,470
There is a four-character idiom for it. "Good, evil..."

47
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,280
My lord, you will never understand a man like him, not ever.

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,410
We should get going. We are running out of time.

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Let us go.

50
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,150
Get this out of the way.

51
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,310
The Crown Prince's Concubine.

52
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,580
No.

53
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,790
Kill the Crown Princess.

54
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,460
(Chapter 10: The Calm Before the Storm)

55
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,390
The Left State Councilor has been arrested.

56
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,960
I will take our men to the Royal Investigation Office.

57
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,860
- We have no orders from him. - But...

58
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,270
We have no orders from him.

59
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,810
Have you forgotten that we only act on his orders?

60
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,510
My apologies.

61
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,150
Leave me. I am busy.

62
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,320
Do you think you can just borrow money and not pay it back?

63
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,190
Even Buddha has no mercy for wicked men like you.

64
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,130
But I already paid back the principal!

65
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,970
You only paid back the principal.

66
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,400
- Who is going to pay the interest? - Darn it!

67
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,540
Just kill me, you thief!

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,240
People have this misconception.

69
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,350
They think since life is precious, it must be valuable.

70
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,650
- You lot will never earn a dime. - You...

71
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,260
Sell the older one as a slave and the younger one as a eunuch.

72
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,230
No! You cannot, you jerk! No!

73
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,000
Your Highness, there is terrible news.

74
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,629
The Left State Councilor...

75
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,739
has been jailed at the Royal Investigation Office.

76
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,740
My father?

77
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,270
Evidence was found at his residence, proving he is the Jimjo's master.

78
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,780
Since the Jimjo attacked the palace, this is...

79
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,380
considered an act of treason.

80
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,710
What should we do, Your Highness?

81
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,320
- If it is treason... - Then Your Highness could also...

82
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,750
be placed in confinement or even arrested.

83
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,160
I have to go to the Royal Investigation Office.

84
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,340
- I need to see my father in person. - Yes. I will handle it discreetly.

85
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,950
Your Highness. This is not the way to the Royal Investigation Office.

86
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,830
I think there is a pebble in my shoe. With my position,

87
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,460
I cannot very well take it out in the middle of the road.

88
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,930
Of course, Your Highness.

89
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Yeo Ri.

90
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,850
Yes, Your Highness?

91
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,750
What are you doing?

92
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,120
- Let go of me! Goodness. - Please hold still.

93
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,190
Your Highness!

94
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,400
The patrol will be here soon, so just stay put for a moment.

95
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,870
I am so sorry, my lady.

96
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
I am sorry as well.

97
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,550
The day your father is arrested,

98
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,190
pack light and meet me at the greenhouse.

99
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,530
That day, we are going to run away together.

100
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
U Hui.

101
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,070
You have been through so much.

102
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,110
- Here... - Go ahead.

103
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
Hurry.

104
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,910
You two can catch up later,

105
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
but change into your disguises first.

106
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Right.

107
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,030
Well...

108
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,360
Yeo Ri, are you finished changing yet?

109
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,100
We are. He is certainly in a hurry.

110
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,370
You seem upset you will not be able to visit the greenhouse anymore.

111
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,440
After all, you always did love this greenhouse.

112
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,610
It was you I loved.

113
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,350
Gosh.

114
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,160
You can do that later. Let us go. We have a long journey ahead.

115
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,490
Let us go.

116
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,100
Who forced you to a false confession?

117
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,640
Grant my request, and I will tell you.

118
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,740
I will even testify.

119
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,039
Your lie almost killed the Royal Concubine,

120
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,050
and you dare to make demands?

121
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,310
How dare you?

122
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
First off, what is your request?

123
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,490
If you promise to spare the life of the former Chief Royal Secretary,

124
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,330
I will tell you everything. Please save the Chief Royal Secretary.

125
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,730
The former Chief Royal Secretary?

126
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,960
You mean Han Seok Won, who was sent into exile?

127
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,170
Do not tell me...

128
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,770
You and that official...

129
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,800
are lovers?

130
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,140
If that is your concern, do not worry.

131
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,510
The Left State Councilor is arrested at the Royal Investigation Office.

132
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,010
You think the Left State Councilor would do it himself?

133
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,979
His underlings have their orders.

134
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,350
They will be the ones to kill the Chief Royal Secretary.

135
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,500
What are you going to do?

136
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,470
She is a criminal who endangered you.

137
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,400
Why should I grant her wish?

138
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,540
But she only did it to save her lover.

139
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,610
If her own lover is so precious, she should know others' are too.

140
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,610
I am so furious at the Left State Councilor's actions.

141
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,120
The Left State Councilor acts as if he is the Almighty...

142
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,720
or the Buddha,

143
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,350
preying on people's weaknesses and toying with their feelings this way.

144
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,620
How can anyone think straight when they are in his palm?

145
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,140
Are you really just going to let this happen?

146
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,380
You always find a way to make me feel ashamed of myself.

147
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,980
Send former Secretary Han Seok Won to the Royal Investigation Office...

148
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,220
and guard him closely.

149
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,319
Announce the reopening of the Sinjusa case as well.

150
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,420
Yes, Your Highness.

151
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,230
Oh, my.

152
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Right now?

153
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,300
I guess I am just hungry.

154
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,210
You are hungry?

155
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,440
You should go get something to eat...

156
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,510
Wait a minute.

157
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,780
They have not fed you yet?

158
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,350
- Why those jerks... - I did eat, but...

159
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,120
Your Highness, you did not feed us either.

160
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,750
We were in no condition to eat, were we?

161
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,990
The situation was extremely unusual and urgent.

162
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,489
- Is that not right? - I am fine, Your Highness.

163
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,990
I am used to such harsh treatment.

164
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,870
Honestly. Why would you do that?

165
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,740
Generosity comes from great wealth, loyalty from a full stomach. Right?

166
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,270
This will not do. I will treat you to great rice soup,

167
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,140
so my two loyal subjects, follow me.

168
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,980
Rice soup sounds delicious.

169
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,090
Hey, buy me some too!

170
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,090
I am hungry too.

171
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,630
What?

172
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,729
Grand Prince Je Un and the Crown Princess Consort left?

173
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,800
All of a sudden?

174
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,930
It all happened so suddenly.

175
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,370
They did not even get to say goodbye to me.

176
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
Gang.

177
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,140
I will leave right after the Left State Councilor's arrest.

178
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,080
What? Why so suddenly?

179
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,710
Surely, you understand.

180
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,680
If the Left State Councilor is arrested for treason,

181
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,920
U Hui will be arrested as well. There is no time.

182
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,430
Where will you go? Do you even have a plan?

183
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,300
Yes, I plan to go to Qing.

184
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,930
I heard a merchant ship is leaving for Qing from Jemulpo tomorrow.

185
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,640
But still, how could he leave without a word?

186
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,770
Gosh.

187
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,670
What is this?

188
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,580
Are you seriously putting down your spoon...

189
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,080
in front of me because another man left?

190
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,380
After all the time we spent together,

191
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,280
he left without a word.

192
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,690
I just feel so empty inside. I have lost my appetite.

193
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,120
Please. Just how close did you two get?

194
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,790
Hey, pick up your spoon now.

195
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,430
She finished the whole bowl.

196
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,160
Yes, she scraped the bowl clean.

197
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,630
I thought you lost your appetite.

198
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Oh, gosh.

199
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,180
(Royal Investigation Office)

200
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,600
Left State Councilor!

201
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,500
What brings you here at this hour?

202
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,440
I deserve to die. The Crown Princess Consort...

203
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,510
has fled.

204
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,810
Send out my men and find U Hui.

205
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,880
Distribute her sketch to all the taverns and inns.

206
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,760
Block all roads leading to the ports and the border.

207
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Under no circumstances...

208
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,290
is anyone else to find out.

209
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,730
Yes, my lord.

210
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Gosh!

211
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,120
I am so exhausted. I cannot go on.

212
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,390
Yeo Ri, one might think you are the young lady.

213
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,430
How are you more exhausted than the Left State Councilor's daughter?

214
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,770
What, were you raised like a princess?

215
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,470
Actually,

216
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,070
it is better to serve a rich family. I have never really had it rough.

217
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,280
I served the Left State Councilor, and then I became a court lady.

218
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,910
So what kind of hardship could I have possibly known?

219
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,680
For crying out loud. You would think my lord was...

220
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,650
just some low-ranking official. My lord is royalty!

221
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,080
He is a Grand Prince!

222
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,390
Exactly.

223
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,150
Grand Prince Je Un and his precious lady...

224
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,890
hit it off, and now we are the ones suffering for it, are we not?

225
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,400
For someone so tired, you sure have a loud mouth, Yeo Ri.

226
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Am I wrong?

227
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,130
Well, it is getting too late,

228
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,570
so let us stay at that inn.

229
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,799
- Yes, my lord. - Yes.

230
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,140
Please be careful.

231
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,810
Watch your step.

232
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,140
- Let me carry your... - No!

233
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,650
Just come on! Darn it.

234
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,650
Unbelievable. Such a young thing, talking back so defiantly.

235
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,550
U Hui.

236
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,860
U Hui, are you asleep?

237
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,530
U Hui.

238
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,930
Are you all right?

239
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,400
Wait a minute.

240
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,770
Are you laughing right now?

241
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,710
What a relief.

242
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,680
The pain tells me this is not a dream.

243
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,320
- What is this? - What?

244
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,850
There is nothing there.

245
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,840
Why do you have soot all over your face?

246
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Oh, right.

247
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,770
I must have gotten it on my face while boiling water earlier.

248
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,209
You boiled the water yourself?

249
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,210
Yes.

250
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,250
The innkeeper seemed to be asleep.

251
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,650
Please. I will do that.

252
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,850
I do not want you to.

253
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,330
But why the sudden hot compress?

254
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,070
Because you were limping.

255
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,710
You noticed?

256
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,880
I tried so hard to hide it.

257
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,020
Do not hide things from me.

258
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,420
When you suffer in silence,

259
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
that is what hurts me the most.

260
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,660
I told you, did I not? I would be your brother, your friend,

261
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,800
your father, and your man.

262
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,600
That is why I am here.

263
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,600
So with me,

264
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,710
if you are angry, you can show it.

265
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,380
If you feel like crying,

266
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,480
you can cry in my arms.

267
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,710
So please,

268
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,150
do not ever hold back again.

269
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,860
I will even heat up the cauldron water for you tomorrow morning.

270
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
But...

271
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,370
- you lit a fire in the furnace? - I did.

272
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,610
- In the middle of summer? - Yes.

273
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
Why?

274
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,780
King Yeomra, it is so hot!

275
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,190
It is so hot.

276
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,350
Goodness.

277
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,430
Gosh! It is way too hot.

278
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,130
I cannot stand the fires of the fiery pit.

279
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Sleep warm.

280
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,060
Please take me to the palace.

281
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,990
Please save me.

282
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,420
Why do I keep having such dreams?

283
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,319
Five years ago in winter,

284
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,390
a family from Hanyang arrived suddenly.

285
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,960
Who are you?

286
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,590
You fell into the water,

287
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,300
and it seems you have lost your memory.

288
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,830
The moment I woke up after losing my memory...

289
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,370
was five winters ago.

290
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
Then...

291
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,180
what is this memory?

292
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Well done.

293
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,080
Did you sleep well, my lady?

294
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,110
I dreamed I was a pig sizzling on a cauldron lid.

295
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,080
I am telling you, I thought my back was completely cooked.

296
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,320
I met King Yeomra in the fires of the fiery pit.

297
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,520
My back was killing me, I am serious.

298
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,360
Where is the innkeeper? Innkeeper!

299
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,090
Why are the floors burning hot in the middle of summer?

300
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,230
You will miss Joseon's heated floors once we leave,

301
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,870
so think of this as one last fond memory.

302
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,870
Come on, U Hui. Let us go.

303
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,850
- We should get going. - But my back is killing me.

304
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,010
Just come on, hurry up.

305
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,149
Now that it has been revealed...

306
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,480
that the Left State Councilor is the master of the Jimjo,

307
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,449
soon he will be exposed as the culprit...

308
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,620
of the Gyesa Year Incident, right?

309
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,120
The bodies of those killed with Jimjo poison...

310
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,790
show the same symptoms as those who died in the Gyesa Year.

311
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,600
It will be easier to get to the bottom of the incident now.

312
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,130
You did well.

313
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,370
You have really been through so much.

314
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,140
This is just the beginning.

315
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,170
Now, I have to expose...

316
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,910
every single evil thing the Left State Councilor has done.

317
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Lift your arms for me.

318
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,220
On a day as important as this,

319
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,020
you must look dignified, Your Royal Highness. All right?

320
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,020
Your attire must be impeccable.

321
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
Goodness.

322
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,070
I need strength more than I need dignity.

323
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,370
What is the matter? It is not even time for the Morning Assembly yet.

324
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,340
Let us just stay like this for a moment.

325
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,610
Let me draw some strength from you.

326
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,480
Gosh.

327
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,310
That is nice.

328
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,290
Your Royal Highness, may I enter for a moment?

329
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,360
No, you cannot. Do not come in.

330
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,290
- His Majesty is looking for you. - What?

331
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,060
What do you mean? It is time for the Morning Assembly.

332
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Right now?

333
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,950
Your Royal Highness.

334
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,690
I trust you had a peaceful night.

335
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
No.

336
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,860
Left State Councilor. What are you doing here?

337
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,660
After a misunderstanding was cleared,

338
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,430
His Majesty the King personally granted my release.

339
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,770
That is impossible.

340
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,840
Why would he do such a thing?

341
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,540
You should hear it from His Majesty yourself.

342
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,990
What is the meaning of this?

343
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,220
We have proof that the Left State Councilor is the Jimjo's master.

344
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,590
So how could you possibly set him free?

345
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,260
The Left State Councilor...

346
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,600
possesses a secret pact that I wrote with my own hand.

347
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,000
A secret pact? What kind of pact is it?

348
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,970
In the Gyesa Year,

349
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,040
the Left State Councilor came to see me.

350
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,210
(Gyesa Year)

351
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,210
(After the former king's death)

352
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,590
This poison is colorless, odorless, and tasteless.

353
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,220
It also does not react to silver.

354
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,730
What is more,

355
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,460
the bodies of those killed by it do not decay or turn black,

356
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,130
nor do they bloat.

357
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,670
At most,

358
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,210
they might vomit a little blood.

359
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
Then...

360
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,860
is that the poison that assassinated the King and the Firstborn Prince?

361
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,030
Yes.

362
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,560
Have you found the killer?

363
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,730
Who is it?

364
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,770
Who would dare commit such a monstrous crime?

365
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It was me.

366
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,840
What are you saying?

367
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,380
Not just the Late King and the Firstborn Prince,

368
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,850
but the Queen Dowager's two brothers who recently died as well.

369
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,990
I killed them all.

370
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,190
I have already done the dirty work.

371
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,990
So you, Prince Geumseong,

372
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,090
all you have to do is prepare to take the throne.

373
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Are you telling me...

374
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,030
you poisoned my own brother?

375
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,110
I will go to the Royal Investigation Office right now,

376
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,480
and I will expose every one of your wicked crimes.

377
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,380
There is no need for that.

378
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,120
The Royal Investigation Office is already on their way here.

379
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,890
I hid this very poison...

380
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,750
right here in your home.

381
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,290
That pathetic poison...

382
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,190
All I have to do is find it first and tell the Office the truth!

383
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,360
How will you find a poison...

384
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,560
when you do not even know...

385
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,730
what you are looking for?

386
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,780
The choice is yours.

387
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,420
Be escorted by the Royal Investigation Office's men...

388
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,720
to the throne,

389
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,420
or be surrounded by them...

390
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,390
and be branded a traitor.

391
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
How dare you!

392
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,600
- Have you no fear of the skies? - I have no fear of the skies!

393
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,200
I have already resigned myself to the fiery pit anyway.

394
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,060
You must protect what is yours.

395
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,210
I, Lee Hui, Prince Geumseong,

396
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,580
shall appoint Kim Han Chul, the Minister of War,

397
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,390
as the Left State Councilor...

398
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,260
and a meritorious subject of the Gyesa Year coup.

399
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,660
This I do solemnly promise.

400
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,350
To protect my family,

401
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,290
I became a monstrous king who killed his brother and nephew.

402
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,060
He said one pact would solve it all, making him a coup contributor.

403
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,690
Since I was going to take the throne anyway,

404
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,930
I thought it would all end with just one signature.

405
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,200
But that was just the beginning.

406
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,000
I must become the King's in-law.

407
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,370
Give me the Crown Prince.

408
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,140
You want me to depose the Crown Princess?

409
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,510
- How could you... - Your Majesty has already...

410
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,050
acknowledged the Gyesa Year incident...

411
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,880
as a coup, have you not?

412
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,620
Your Majesty and I...

413
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,690
are already in the same boat.

414
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,730
One by one, I gave things away.

415
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,470
- Royal Father! - Your Majesty.

416
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,640
Your Majesty.

417
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,310
Your Majesty.

418
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,380
Your Majesty.

419
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,750
Until I lost everything.

420
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,330
You said I just had to make your daughter the Crown Princess.

421
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,200
So why? Why?

422
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,610
Why...

423
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,810
did you have to kill the Queen as well?

424
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,110
I could not come up with a proper way...

425
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,450
to depose the Crown Princess.

426
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,220
This was your plan all along, was it not?

427
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,590
To kill everyone who could help me and the Crown Prince,

428
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,130
and turn us into puppets that you alone could control.

429
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,300
Power...

430
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,700
is not something one shares.

431
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,670
So, what are you going to do about it?

432
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,670
With those feeble fists of yours,

433
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,980
are you going to behead me?

434
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,910
Or...

435
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,450
will you reveal the secret pact...

436
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,920
and prove that the coup was illegitimate...

437
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,750
all by yourself?

438
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,870
That is right, Your Majesty.

439
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,570
There is nothing...

440
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,270
you can do.

441
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,410
So just stay right where you are.

442
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,710
Do that, and you might just keep your life.

443
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,630
I was a prisoner of that secret pact.

444
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,900
For years, my life was a living nightmare.

445
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,610
They took everything from me.

446
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,670
But you are the one thing I managed to protect.

447
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,780
So, Gang...

448
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,250
You must survive.

449
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,910
Live, even if you have to be disgraced and cowardly.

450
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,220
It was not enough that Mother and the Crown Princess...

451
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,830
were driven to their deaths.

452
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,060
Now, I will never be able to clear their names.

453
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,000
I have to let them remain unjustly accused forever.

454
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,670
And you are telling me to live?

455
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,670
Can you even call that living?

456
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,080
I wanted to take down the Left State Councilor...

457
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,080
and go back to the way things were...

458
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,250
with you, Father.

459
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,660
But now,

460
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,230
I do not think we can ever go back to how things were.

461
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,650
The Crown Princess Consort fled?

462
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,260
Yes. I heard the court maids gossiping...

463
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,720
with my own two ears.

464
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,660
- Let us go to the Detached Palace. - Yes, Your Majesty.

465
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,570
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

466
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,240
Am I not allowed here?

467
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,300
Open the door.

468
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,769
It is just that the Crown Princess Consort...

469
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,140
is in no condition to receive Your Grace.

470
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Why not?

471
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,250
Did she escape in the night?

472
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,790
Your Majesty, how can you even suggest such a thing?

473
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,050
Open this door!

474
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,750
Your Majesty.

475
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,660
- Get out of my way! - Your Majesty!

476
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,340
Despite his power, the Left State Councilor...

477
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,110
failed when it came to his own daughter.

478
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,310
Call off the Royal Wedding at once,

479
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,320
and punish the Left State Councilor.

480
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,650
Why do you hesitate?

481
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,489
The Crown Princess Consort...

482
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,920
was not to go outside the Detached Palace,

483
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,090
and yet, she has escaped.

484
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,260
Rumors are spreading among the staff that she eloped in the night.

485
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,370
Are you really just going to let this slide?

486
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,000
Nothing is certain yet.

487
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,470
I will act after we investigate further...

488
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,270
I will not beat around the bush.

489
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:36,080
The Late King, the Firstborn Prince, and all who died in the Gyesa Year.

490
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,220
Did you kill them all, Your Majesty?

491
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,419
Your Majesty! How can you say such a treasonous thing?

492
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,990
The Late King was in perfect health, and he had the Firstborn Prince.

493
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,660
There was no way you could have taken the throne.

494
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,100
And yet,

495
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,700
how is it that an opportunity that should never have arisen...

496
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,630
went to you?

497
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,640
And why is the Left State Councilor now holding all the power?

498
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,740
How come the Left State Councilor...

499
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,680
is already a free man...

500
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,820
when he was arrested only a few hours ago?

501
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,960
If that secret pact is revealed,

502
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,760
His Majesty will be killed.

503
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,970
And it is all my fault.

504
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,140
My father signed that pact to protect me.

505
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,310
The Crown Princess and Royal Mother died because of me.

506
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,420
But you did not know.

507
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,930
You did not know a single thing.

508
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,430
So why are you blaming yourself?

509
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,030
How can I ever atone for this?

510
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,040
How can I possibly repay this crime?

511
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,070
You are right.

512
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,970
You have to repay them.

513
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,280
Not with penance,

514
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,010
but with revenge.

515
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,450
Revenge?

516
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,050
Because the coup was a success,

517
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,850
the Gyesa Year incident is no longer a treason,

518
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,190
nor is it the Left State Councilor's weakness.

519
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,730
Unless my Royal Father abdicates in favor of Grand Prince Je Un...

520
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,660
and reveals the pact himself.

521
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,700
There is no other way to bring down the Left State Councilor.

522
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,900
Besides, Grand Prince Je Un has already left.

523
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,870
We cannot just drag him back and force him onto the throne.

524
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,480
Even if we could, Je Un is the type to just walk away.

525
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
But...

526
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,519
the Crown Princess Consort ran away,

527
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,990
so is that not a crime in its own right?

528
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,490
Normally, that would be considered treason.

529
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,700
Wait a minute.

530
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,700
Why is the Left State Councilor so calm?

531
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,970
Exactly.

532
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,070
He was released last night. He must know she has fled by now.

533
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,570
The Left State Councilor will never give up...

534
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:18,940
being the King's in-law.

535
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,410
He will bring her back no matter what,

536
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,410
and there is no way he will leave Grand Prince Je Un alone.

537
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,350
If the Left State Councilor catches him...

538
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,150
or if the Queen Dowager finds out,

539
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,490
Grand Prince Je Un will be in deep trouble when he is caught.

540
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,029
- Come take a look over here. - Hello, there.

541
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,430
Do you have any fish?

542
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,200
- We have fresh ones in the back. - Are you okay?

543
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,270
I am fine.

544
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,010
This one is really nice and plump.

545
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,870
They are delicious! Come and take a look.

546
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,470
Your Highness!

547
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,740
We are here to escort you.

548
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,980
What are you doing here?

549
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,950
You never move without an order from my father.

550
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,450
I gave the order.

551
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,160
I have come to retrieve what is mine.

552
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,000
It is time you handed her over.

553
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,930
- U Hui does not belong to you. - Yes. She is mine.

554
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,410
My most useful possession.

555
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,950
I will not allow anyone to use her as a pawn.

556
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,090
- Seize him! - Household Man.

557
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,540
No!

558
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,190
- No! - Darn it.

559
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,550
- Grand Prince! - My lady!

560
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,790
My lord...

561
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,240
You are nothing like the Late King, Grand Prince Je Un.

562
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,840
The Late King was never this recklessly brave.

563
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,250
He had many things he held more dear...

564
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,920
than your mother.

565
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,690
He was quite the coward too.

566
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,960
As if assassinating my Royal Father was not enough,

567
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:57,760
now you dare insult his honor as well!

568
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:01,860
Honor? Did the Late King ever have any to begin with?

569
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,800
Left State Councilor!

570
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,000
Left State Councilor!

571
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,670
Going after family is a low blow, is it not?

572
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,650
And going after a royal is high treason.

573
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,720
Back off. Unless you want to lose your heads.

574
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:48,280
You are too bold for a cornered man, Left State Councilor.

575
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,980
Do I seem cornered to you?

576
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,019
The Crown Princess Consort eloped at night with a man.

577
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,780
I would say that is a big problem.

578
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,190
It is all over for you.

579
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,620
The palace must have realized by now...

580
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,390
the Crown Princess Consort has run away.

581
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,360
Even if you drag her back, can she still become the Crown Princess?

582
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,730
Even if you go back, both you and your daughter...

583
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,030
will just be throwing your lives away.

584
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,470
Throwing our lives away?

585
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,110
So can you not just let them be happy together?

586
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,810
She is your daughter, after all.

587
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
That is precisely why...

588
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,450
I cannot tolerate this.

589
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,260
The fact that something of mine...

590
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,730
dared to turn its blade on me.

591
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,800
U Hui.

592
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,870
If my daughter were to die here,

593
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,410
no one would know...

594
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,280
whether she eloped...

595
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,380
- or if Prince Je Un kidnapped her. - Left State Councilor!

596
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,750
You know very well...

597
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,390
that I still wield that much power, do you not?

598
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,590
The Left State Councilor...

599
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,590
possesses a secret pact that I wrote with my own hand.

600
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,820
I...

601
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,650
will be the one to accept punishment.

602
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,820
Gang.

603
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,130
I will take the punishment.

604
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,600
U Hui must not die.

605
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,840
She cannot die because of me.

606
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,310
Please...

607
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,440
just put down the sword.

608
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,690
Do you really wish...

609
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,630
for blood to be spilled here?

610
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,630
Whether I live or die,

611
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,470
both sides stand to lose something precious.

612
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:31,340
Let us put this behind us and call a truce for now.

613
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:32,870
U Hui.

614
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,380
What do you say?

615
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,160
We will do as she says.

616
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,800
Escort the Crown Princess Consort.

617
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,040
U Hui.

618
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,770
I suppose what you held in your hands...

619
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,140
was not the key to my father's downfall...

620
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,950
but simply a foolish dream.

621
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,580
U Hui...

622
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
U Hui.

623
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,280
The Left State Councilor...

624
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,710
How was he released?

625
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,450
Why on earth was he let go?

626
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,020
I will explain everything.

627
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,930
So, you are saying...

628
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,970
the Gyesa Year incident was a coup,

629
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,770
and since it succeeded,

630
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,240
the Left State Councilor is free of any crime or weakness.

631
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,540
Is that what you are telling me?

632
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,010
I am so sorry.

633
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,080
He may have been coerced,

634
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,290
but it was cowardice for our Royal Father to ignore...

635
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,650
the Left State Councilor's crimes...

636
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,020
and a great sin against you.

637
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,890
How could that be your fault?

638
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,300
It is just that...

639
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,770
I cannot bring myself to say that it is all okay today.

640
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,640
I told her not to hold back anymore,

641
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,210
but U Hui could not show any anger in the end.

642
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,610
She could not even cry in my arms.

643
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,720
She just held it all in as she left.

644
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:19,370
Why are you so obsessed with becoming the King's in-law?

645
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,880
You already have everything.

646
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,650
So why do you covet that position so desperately?

647
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,320
I am just curious.

648
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,320
Because I want to be powerful.

649
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,820
How much more powerful?

650
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,260
To allow anyone to be more powerful than me...

651
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,060
is to be prepared to give up everything I have.

652
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,460
I wanted power,

653
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,370
so I placed first in the military service examination.

654
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,870
Even when I thought I had become powerful enough,

655
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,840
I was still weak in the presence of the King.

656
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,740
And even that powerful King...

657
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,340
was rendered powerless by the Queen's Family.

658
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,850
So you decided to become one of the Queen's Family?

659
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,550
To become the most powerful of all?

660
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:03,920
Power...

661
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,790
is harder to keep than it is to seize.

662
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,300
So, it is time to wake up from this foolish dream...

663
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,200
and live like a flower.

664
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,900
You will take root in this palace.

665
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,210
You will bloom when I tell you to, and you will wither on my command.

666
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,740
If you do just that,

667
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,580
that will be a life well-lived.

668
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,299
Bar the gates to the Detached Palace...

669
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,500
and confine the Crown Princess Consort until the Royal Wedding.

670
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,229
If Crown Princess Consort ever steps foot outside...

671
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,570
the Detached Palace,

672
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,640
for every step she takes,

673
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,940
one of the palace's court attendants will be beheaded.

674
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,710
Yes, Left State Councilor.

675
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:16,630
Grand Prince Je Un must be heartbroken.

676
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:23,000
I did not even know my Royal Father made such a secret pact,

677
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:27,040
and I was running my mouth about us getting revenge together.

678
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,940
I must look like a complete fool.

679
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,680
But you did not know. Why are you blaming yourself again?

680
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,980
I want to take down the Left State Councilor,

681
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,050
but I just do not know how.

682
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,740
You need to get a grip.

683
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,010
Open your eyes and see who your real enemy is.

684
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,710
See exactly where you need to aim your bow.

685
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,310
Do not get bogged down by all this useless guilt...

686
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,850
and let it eat you up inside.

687
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,350
You must be strong.

688
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:23,260
If the path is blocked, you force your way through.

689
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,860
And if there is no path, who cares? Just build a new one.

690
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,000
And most importantly, do not ever forget...

691
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,800
that I, your swallow, will always be by your side.

692
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,640
Right?

693
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,610
Do you understand?

694
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,050
And who said you could just grab the Crown Prince's face like that?

695
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,990
My apologies.

696
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,560
But did you not say I was the exception?

697
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,960
What, are you a mind reader now?

698
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,670
You know exactly what I am thinking without me saying a word.

699
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,370
Mind reading?

700
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,240
That is right.

701
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:16,950
Go on then. Keep reading my mind.

702
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,180
Mind reading.

703
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,040
Your Royal Highness. I heard you were feeling unwell.

704
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,910
Are you fully recovered now?

705
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,710
Yes, more or less.

706
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,509
Your Highness, as the misunderstanding...

707
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,810
with the Left State Councilor has been cleared,

708
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,880
it is time to close the case on the Jimjo incident.

709
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,650
The Jimjo...

710
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,860
was raised by the former Chief Court Lady Jo alone.

711
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,530
As for her niece who framed the Royal Concubine,

712
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,730
she will be exiled and made a government slave.

713
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,200
And with that, the Jimjo incident...

714
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:12,970
is hereby closed.

715
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,640
- Yes, Your Royal Highness! - Yes, Your Royal Highness!

716
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,580
Your Royal Highness, this prolonged drought...

717
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,180
is causing our people immense suffering.

718
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,120
This drought persists because yin and yang are unbalanced.

719
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,580
Proceeding with the Royal Wedding without delay...

720
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,720
is the correct course of action.

721
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,360
Yes, Your Highness.

722
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:37,630
The Royal Wedding must go on to stabilize ancestors and state.

723
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:41,230
And appease the skies.

724
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,079
They say a puppy will not fear a tiger.

725
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,249
And that fits him perfectly.

726
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,580
I knew he would tuck his tail and run.

727
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,490
How dare he arrest the Left State Councilor?

728
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,390
You can rest easy now.

729
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,560
The Royal Wedding is right around the corner.

730
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:18,170
This is a day to celebrate your win. Why are you so quiet?

731
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,140
We should at least go to Eunwol Pavilion.

732
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,469
Goodness. Why is it always...

733
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:26,510
the courtesan house with you, Minister Ja Gyeong?

734
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:30,010
Do you think I am suggesting it for no reason?

735
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,350
The other day, at Eunwol Pavilion,

736
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,620
I saw Hong Nan.

737
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,890
- The gisaeng from Eunwol Pavilion? - Yes.

738
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,060
Did she not suddenly disappear a few years ago?

739
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:44,090
See? I knew you would be interested.

740
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:46,490
Maybe she got kicked out of her concubine's position.

741
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:50,230
- She was back at Eunwol Pavilion. - A concubine?

742
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,030
Were she and the late deposed Crown Princess's brother...

743
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,000
not madly in love with each other?

744
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:59,310
After he died, she sold everything, left the registry, and vanished.

745
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,980
What? She turned down my offer for some worthless guy?

746
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,550
Unbelievable.

747
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,050
Wait.

748
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,180
Did you just say the deposed Crown Princess's brother?

749
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,220
Yes.

750
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,750
What is it?

751
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,260
This could be...

752
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,790
something much bigger.

753
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,600
Something that gives us leverage over the Crown Prince.

754
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,330
Something huge.

755
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,810
Find out all you can about a gisaeng from Eunwol Pavilion named Hong Nan,

756
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,280
and find out where she's staying.

757
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:35,810
Yes, sir.

758
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,480
Do you have something to report?

759
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,620
It is about the Royal Concubine's neighbors from Boryeong.

760
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,920
- I have taken care of them. - Good.

761
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,330
You may go.

762
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,870
If...

763
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,370
the Royal Concubine is actually the deposed Crown Princess,

764
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,340
then there is only one person who could have gotten her out.

765
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,380
This is absurd.

766
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,210
The Crown Princess Consort ran away.

767
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,250
Her whole family should face annihilation for this.

768
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,620
And you are telling me there will be a Royal Wedding?

769
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,649
The King has confined the Crown Princess Consort...

770
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,150
to the Detached Palace until the Royal Wedding.

771
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,290
He also ordered her to be cut off from all outside contact.

772
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,129
By law, the Crown Princess Consort is not allowed to leave...

773
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:29,160
the Detached Palace to begin with.

774
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:32,770
Are you trying to deceive me? What is the meaning of this?

775
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:35,070
Your Majesty, you seem to have misunderstood.

776
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,040
The Crown Princess Consort did not run away.

777
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,810
She collapsed.

778
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:44,480
And she just had to collapse outside of the Detached Palace?

779
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,950
- For that long? - When her father was arrested,

780
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,220
I let her go, fearing she would be sick with worry over her father.

781
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,620
She collapsed in shock on the way, recovering at a private house.

782
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:57,129
The story must have been distorted.

783
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,490
You create a problem to fix it?

784
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,430
It was you who ordered the Left State Councilor's arrest,

785
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,330
was it not?

786
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:07,600
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

787
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,570
What in the world is going on?

788
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,410
Why are His Majesty and you...

789
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,850
so helpless against the Left State Councilor?

790
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,010
What kind of leverage does he have on you...

791
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,990
that makes you continue with this absurd charade?

792
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,190
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

793
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,130
If you will just keep repeating "forgive me" like a parrot,

794
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,030
then get out.

795
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:38,570
Then,

796
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,540
I shall take my leave.

797
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,710
Crown Prince.

798
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,280
We have both lost people, have we not?

799
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,490
People we held dear.

800
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,690
Are you going to let fear paralyze you...

801
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,860
and walk right back into...

802
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:09,500
that fiery pit again?

803
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:34,960
The Left State Councilor...

804
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,460
Why on earth was he let go?

805
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,900
I was a prisoner of that secret pact.

806
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,930
For years, my life was a living nightmare.

807
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:50,040
Royal Mother! What is happening?

808
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,010
Royal Mother.

809
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,550
We have both lost people, have we not?

810
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,950
People we held dear.

811
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:07,290
Are you going to let fear paralyze you...

812
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:09,160
and walk right back into...

813
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,530
that fiery pit again?

814
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,270
You must be strong.

815
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:21,440
If your path is blocked,

816
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,240
you force your way through.

817
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:27,740
And if there is no path, who cares? Just build a new one.

818
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,290
Abdicate the throne to Grand Prince Je Un.

819
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:44,130
Then, Your Majesty, you must reveal the secret pact yourself.

820
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,830
Do you have any idea what will happen if I do?

821
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,930
It would not be an abdication. You would be dethroned.

822
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,900
And not just Your Majesty, but I, too,

823
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,170
will be dragged down into the abyss.

824
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,140
You know that, and you still dare say such a thing?

825
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:58,869
You think I like having the Left State Councilor around?

826
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,210
If he falls,

827
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,810
then I, who led a coup without just cause,

828
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,580
and you will have no one left to protect us.

829
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,850
They will all be scrambling to tear us down.

830
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:12,420
If Je Un takes the throne, he will claim to avenge the Late King.

831
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:14,420
Which means he will have to kill both you and me.

832
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:18,590
So you will just sit there, weighing the consequences,

833
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,060
and do absolutely nothing?

834
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,530
Did you not say it yourself, Your Majesty?

835
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,900
That you have been living in a nightmare since that day.

836
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,970
Anything has to be better than nightmare, right?

837
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,970
We should return what we took unjustly...

838
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:34,580
and take back what was stolen from us.

839
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:38,480
I will prove you signed the pact under duress,

840
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:41,020
and I will destroy the Left State Councilor!

841
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,420
This reckless path you are on.

842
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,890
Is it because of the Royal Concubine?

843
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,790
I am doing this for myself.

844
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,700
I failed to protect my mother, and the Crown Princess.

845
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,060
If I...

846
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,900
lose the woman I love again,

847
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,800
I will die.

848
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,910
My mind is made up. So,

849
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,480
I ask that you make yours, Your Majesty.

850
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:22,190
If the Crown Prince confronts the Left State Councilor,

851
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,689
the Left State Councilor will target the Royal Concubine first,

852
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:27,760
seeing her as his weakness.

853
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,930
That is the kind of man he is.

854
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,200
I must see Hong Nan.

855
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,750
The Crown Princess, whom I thought dead,

856
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,290
has returned as the Royal Concubine.

857
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,160
Was this your doing?

858
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,690
Her Highness...

859
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,560
threw herself into the icy water five years ago.

860
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:06,330
She lost all of her memories then.

861
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,500
So I...

862
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,470
made everyone believe she was dead.

863
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,610
She lost her memories?

864
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:16,410
Why would the Crown Princess make such a choice?

865
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,950
- I distinctly... - You gave her a letter.

866
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,649
A letter to fake her death and flee...

867
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,520
the day before she would be poisoned.

868
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,389
You knew exactly how the Crown Prince...

869
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:28,020
and the Crown Princess felt for one another,

870
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:31,630
yet what you gave her that day was not a letter.

871
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:35,130
It was to ease your pathetic guilt. And that...

872
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,070
was a death sentence,

873
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:42,500
- not a chance to live! - You insolent wench! How dare you?

874
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,240
Fine. Since I am already insolent, I will say what I have to say.

875
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,580
Did you truly wish for Her Highness to escape...

876
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,180
and live on safely?

877
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,280
Or were you just hoping she would take her own life for you?

878
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,360
Your Majesty.

879
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,960
This time,

880
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,930
you must save Her Highness.

881
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,400
It has been ages since we had meat!

882
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,610
Eat up.

883
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,440
Hong Nan.

884
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,280
Come have a bite.

885
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,110
I am fine, thank you.

886
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,080
More importantly, after you eat, you need to pack your things.

887
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,820
We are leaving for Qing.

888
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:41,160
Technically speaking, to the Crown Prince,

889
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,260
we are his parents-in-law.

890
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,670
Sorry to bring this up while we are eating.

891
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:48,569
When you buy a house, you get the outhouse too.

892
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:49,970
They just took our Dal,

893
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:53,940
and now they are exiling us to Qing. That is not right.

894
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:56,380
- Just eat. - All right.

895
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:58,510
Well...

896
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,780
But why?

897
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:04,150
Is it because we are a runaway court lady and eunuch?

898
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:07,190
Are we a burden to Dal?

899
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:09,720
Dal is coming with us.

900
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,330
What?

901
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:14,030
Are you still half asleep?

902
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,630
She is the Royal Concubine. Why would she go to Qing?

903
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:27,510
The truth is, Dal...

904
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,510
is the supposedly...

905
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,750
the deceased Crown Princess.

906
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:37,990
My goodness.

907
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,230
I heard that your family...

908
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,740
is staying at Unjeong Palace.

909
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,570
My apologies, Your Majesty.

910
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:59,610
I did not summon you here to reprimand you.

911
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:02,280
However, it is against palace protocol,

912
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,910
so I will arrange a separate residence for them.

913
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,150
Go and discuss it with your family.

914
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

915
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,650
However, we must be mindful of prying eyes,

916
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,420
so be discreet.

917
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:15,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

918
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,290
Then I shall take my leave.

919
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:26,330
My dear.

920
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:34,510
In a commoner's home,

921
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,180
is that not what they call a daughter-in-law?

922
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,980
I just wanted to call you that once.

923
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,750
You may go.

924
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,660
For your thoughtfulness,

925
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:58,830
I am sincerely grateful.

926
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,360
The Crown Prince's Concubine.

927
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,130
No.

928
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,230
Kill the Crown Princess.

929
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,870
Set fire to the Royal Concubine's quarters...

930
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,670
and place a body of a similar build inside.

931
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:44,210
I must make the Crown Princess dead to the world once more.

932
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,910
Welcome, Your Highness, the Crown Princess.

933
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:16,940
Goodness. My apologies. Welcome, Royal Concubine.

934
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,450
It is all right.

935
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,350
But do I really look that much like her?

936
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,920
Why is everyone so shocked when they see me?

937
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,390
With a mole on your nose, you would be her spitting image.

938
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:33,230
A mole?

939
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,100
Once every 3 months, for 15 minutes,

940
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,970
you must cover the mole on your nose.

941
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:45,310
No one should ever recognize you.

942
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,980
Hong Nan has stepped out for a moment,

943
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,550
so please come inside for now.

944
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:54,980
- The sun is scorching. Come. - Sure.

945
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:14,800
Are you upset about...

946
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,970
what the servant said earlier?

947
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:19,370
No.

948
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,840
What do you mean, "no"? It is written all over your face.

949
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,850
I told you, I am not.

950
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,660
Yeon Sim, I bet your first love is going to come true.

951
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:39,860
Are you praying for my execution?

952
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,730
If a court lady's first love comes true, she loses her head.

953
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:45,600
Gosh. That is not what I meant.

954
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:48,870
In that case, may you live a long and single life.

955
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:52,610
- Is that meant to be a blessing? - Of course it is.

956
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,710
But what do flower petals have to do with first love, anyway?

957
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,680
You do not know?

958
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:02,720
- Catch a petal, your first love... - Do you know the saying?

959
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,090
If you happen to catch a falling flower petal,

960
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:08,819
do you know what happens?

961
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,560
If you catch a falling petal,

962
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,260
your first love will come true.

963
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:35,850
This one thing...

964
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,750
is mine.

965
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:55,470
Mangdeok.

966
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:02,910
Your Highness.

967
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:14,890
Come here.

968
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,520
Gently piling up.

969
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,290
It is as if little blessings are piling up like snow.

970
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,800
Does it not feel like a promise of happiness?

971
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:34,370
My lord!

972
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,950
Your small blessing for today.

973
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,250
It is so beautiful.

974
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,690
It truly is.

975
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,170
Your Highness. Are you all right?

976
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:02,800
You are the sole exception.

977
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:06,440
This one thing...

978
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:09,180
is mine.

979
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:17,920
Your Highness.

980
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:19,450
Your Highness.

981
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,730
The King will order you poison. You must flee now, Your Highness!

982
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:34,570
Hong Nan...

983
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:41,110
Why did you deceive me?

984
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:50,620
Why?

985
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,530
(Moon River)

986
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:24,250
Have your memories returned?

987
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,020
The memories are back, but I am completely lost.

988
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,989
You want me to overthrow you and His Majesty...

989
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,760
and take the throne for myself?

990
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:34,560
Look at this mess the Left State Councilor has caused.

991
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,899
The Left State Councilor is a scary man.

992
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,830
He will harm the Crown Princess, no matter what.

993
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,730
What are you talking about?

994
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,740
There is no time. You have to escape.

995
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,569
I despise the royals who killed my family.

996
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:46,940
And I despise you too, Your Highness.

997
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:50,240
I never want to see you again, Your Highness.

998
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:11,000
(Moon River)
