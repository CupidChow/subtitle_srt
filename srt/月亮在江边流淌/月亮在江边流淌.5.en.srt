1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,850
(Kang Tae Oh)

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,920
(Kim Se Jeong)

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,520
(Lee Sin Young)

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,390
(Hong Su Zu)

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,060
(Jin Goo)

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,630
(Nam Gi Ae)

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,370
(And Kim Nam Hee)

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,050
(Moon River)

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,350
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,720
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,050
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

12
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,310
The red string of fate, once forcibly severed,

13
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,480
has found its match and begun to thrash wildly.

14
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,010
It is out of my hands now.

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
You two...

16
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,850
will just have to navigate this cruel fate yourselves.

17
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,990
(Chapter Five: Walk a Mile in My Shoes)

18
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,510
Are you awake? You fainted when you fell into the water.

19
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,850
The Royal Physician stopped by. He said you are going to be fine.

20
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,280
The Royal Physician is the Left State Councillor's man,

21
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,790
so he might report things he should not.

22
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,960
Good. Go get Shin Won and Se Dol for me.

23
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,690
I have to go to the palace.

24
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,460
Why would you go to the palace?

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,170
Wait. Why are you suddenly so informal?

26
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,800
Give you an inch, and you take a mile, right?

27
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,980
What did you dress me in?

28
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,550
Wait.

29
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
It is gone.

30
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,490
It cannot be. How can it be gone? What...

31
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,000
This... It is gone. Where did it go?

32
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,200
Why? Where... Where did it go?

33
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,040
Where did it go? No, that is impossible.

34
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,510
No, hold on.

35
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,110
This...

36
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,709
What is it? Did you lose something? Is it important?

37
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,879
More than important.

38
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,580
The fate of the 500-year-old royals depends on it.

39
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,050
No, this has to be a dream. Right?

40
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,249
- Lee Gang, snap out of it. - You cannot possibly have that.

41
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,289
I will get you a new one... No.

42
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,049
- No, why? - I will get you a better one,

43
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,089
- so calm down. - Calm down?

44
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,420
You think you would be calm in my shoes?

45
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,830
It is gone. Not just anything. My manhood is gone.

46
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,560
And what is this?

47
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,669
- I have no idea what you mean. - Why? What is this?

48
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,400
- Why are these... - Dal, are you all right?

49
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,300
I am the one who fell in the water, so why are you the one acting crazy?

50
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,400
Who are you calling Dal?

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,240
Why is her face...

52
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,050
here?

53
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,290
My face.

54
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,720
Where did my face go?

55
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,600
What in the world?

56
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,550
Why is this here?

57
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,920
A rash, Your Highness? Shall I call the Royal Physician?

58
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,050
Let me take a look first.

59
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,620
Hey, where do you think you are looking?

60
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,340
That...

61
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,110
That...

62
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,580
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

63
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,520
- Your Highness. - What is it?

64
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Your Highness.

65
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,720
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

66
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,390
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

67
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,110
How could he try to cut it with his own hands?

68
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,880
- Please kill me, Your Highness. - Kill you? For what?

69
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,220
Forgive my impertinence, Your Highness.

70
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,560
What?

71
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,260
What is this? Why are you holding me bridal-style?

72
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,300
Because if I am not careful, you might actually turn into one.

73
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,070
Put...

74
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,570
Put me down!

75
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,990
What?

76
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,230
What?

77
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,830
Wait, what is this?

78
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,470
Why do I have that guy's face?

79
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,530
You mean you are Gang?

80
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,390
The Crown Prince?

81
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,260
Yes.

82
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,230
I know it is hard to believe, but it is true.

83
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,930
So, you must take me to the palace at once.

84
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,139
Of course, the Crown Prince must be in a palace.

85
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,140
In that case,

86
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,040
shall I take you to the Crown Prince's quarters?

87
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,180
Yes.

88
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,480
I knew you would believe me. We must hurry to the palace.

89
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,690
Dal. How badly are you hurt?

90
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,560
- You do not have a fever. - How dare you, you insolent fool.

91
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,060
Is this how you abuse your royal status?

92
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,360
Harassing women in broad daylight by touching their foreheads?

93
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,130
Darn it.

94
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,070
That, I almost said.

95
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,710
It feels like I have already heard every insult,

96
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,740
but I must be imagining things.

97
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,680
Whatever.

98
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,080
Where are you going?

99
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,320
Dal.

100
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,900
Instead of poking me with all these needles,

101
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,600
I need to get out of the palace.

102
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,840
His Majesty has ordered you to be confined.

103
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,510
Confined?

104
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,280
- What does that mean? - Your Highness, are you in pain?

105
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,450
How did you fall in the water? You hate it.

106
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,820
You should have been more careful.

107
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,750
Something also seems a bit off with you.

108
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,190
His Majesty has ordered you not to take a single step...

109
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,660
outside of your quarters.

110
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
Then, my body...

111
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,800
No, I mean Dal.

112
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,930
Bring me that girl, Dal.

113
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,370
See the moon? Your Highness, when you recover,

114
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,439
I will arrange for a magnificent moon-viewing for you.

115
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,480
Goodness.

116
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,650
No, not the moon!

117
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,819
Dal, the person, with four limbs.

118
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,949
Bring me my body!

119
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,050
Goodness.

120
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,460
This is the last needle. You must remain calm, Your Highness.

121
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,160
Why is everything forbidden?

122
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,300
Oh, my.

123
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,860
Wait.

124
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,299
Where are you putting that?

125
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,470
On the affected area.

126
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,670
The affected area?

127
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,810
On my head?

128
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,439
What do you think I am?

129
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,010
Am I a human pincushion to you?

130
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,910
Gosh.

131
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,950
As soon as the Crown Prince awoke,

132
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,790
he kept asking for someone named Dal?

133
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,590
Yes.

134
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,430
The Royal Physician heard it himself.

135
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Could it be...

136
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,760
the peddler His Highness saved that one time?

137
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,129
I will look into it.

138
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,130
(Chief Court Lady Jo Myung Im)

139
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,170
And if...

140
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,370
she is the same peddler, what should be done?

141
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,210
Let go of me!

142
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,709
You were asking for that peddler so desperately...

143
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,150
in front of the Royal Physician.

144
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,319
What are you going to do now?

145
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,650
If the Left State Councillor sees the girl...

146
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,050
who looks just like the late Crown Princess...

147
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,660
Gosh! What are we going to do?

148
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,260
So what if he sees her?

149
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,730
He will kill her.

150
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,499
Kill her? What are you saying?

151
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,060
The first selection is in two days.

152
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,729
He would never allow a woman near you,

153
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,769
especially one...

154
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:32,740
who resembles the late Crown Princess.

155
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,940
Perhaps since you fell in the water...

156
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,739
Have you become so foolish you cannot recall...

157
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,350
something so clear?

158
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,850
No, it is not that...

159
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,450
Your Highness, if this were you,

160
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,890
you would have already struck me.

161
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,190
"I am going to kill you."

162
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,090
You should be flying into a rage!

163
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,460
Please, just hit me.

164
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,630
- Just hit me! - Goodness!

165
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,600
I do not want to!

166
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,140
- Your Highness! - What is wrong?

167
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Your Highness.

168
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,390
Grand Prince Je Un?

169
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,580
Father, what brings you here?

170
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,850
So this greenhouse went to you.

171
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,849
Did Grand Prince Je Un give it to you?

172
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,790
I asked what brought you here.

173
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,630
The first selection is in two days.

174
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,029
The late king gave this greenhouse to Queen Jangjeong...

175
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,800
for her Royal Wedding.

176
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,569
What will people say if a Crown Princess candidate...

177
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,340
is seen coming and going to this greenhouse?

178
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,710
Are you here to warn me to go along with the selection...

179
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,010
without putting up a fight?

180
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,410
And what if I refuse?

181
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,780
The gun that shot the Crown Prince...

182
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,890
- is still in my possession. - You already used that gun...

183
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,650
to ensure Grand Prince Je Un's safety.

184
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,920
So if you use that gun to avoid entering the palace,

185
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,100
are you saying you will abandon Grand Prince Je Un?

186
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,730
With that one gun,

187
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,740
did you think you could wrap me around your finger?

188
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,440
No.

189
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,410
Do you really think, for even a moment,

190
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,580
that you have ever had me under your thumb?

191
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,150
I am tolerating you because I still have a use for you.

192
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,890
I will put up with you.

193
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
So you...

194
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,390
will live your life in gratitude.

195
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,360
My lord, where are you returning from?

196
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,760
- Why? Is something wrong? - A letter arrived from Qing.

197
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,120
Eun Woo.

198
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,180
Yes?

199
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,120
Yes, I am Cha Eun Woo.

200
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,220
And you are? You seem much younger than me,

201
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,860
- Why do you speak so casually? - You want me to speak formally?

202
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,330
My apologies.

203
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,440
His Highness spoke of you so often, I felt like we were already friends.

204
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,070
The Crown Prince?

205
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,170
You know His Highness?

206
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
I do.

207
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,310
Very well.

208
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,650
Which brings me to my point.

209
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,949
Take me with you to the Royal Office of Attire...

210
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,990
- when you go there. - The Royal Office of Attire?

211
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,190
Honestly, this woman...

212
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,420
You think you can just waltz into the palace?

213
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,390
You startled me! There is no need to shout.

214
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,000
These are the ears that listen to the counsel of loyal subjects...

215
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,830
and the plight of the people.

216
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,400
I stand corrected. In that case, you listen up.

217
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,010
The way for you to enter the palace...

218
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,110
- is non existent! - Hey!

219
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,180
Get lost!

220
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,250
"Get lost?" Did you just tell me to get lost?

221
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,950
Do not do anything you will regret. I am warning you.

222
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,160
I said, do not do anything you will regret.

223
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,730
Darn it.

224
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,029
Bother me again,

225
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,560
and I will have you dragged to the Police Bureau!

226
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,230
You got a death wish? You will regret this.

227
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,600
Mark my words!

228
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,570
Hey! You louts!

229
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,140
Be careful with that silk. It is for the palace!

230
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,270
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

231
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,250
Right here.

232
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,330
All right, let us see.

233
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,570
- What are you doing? Get down! - I am leaving.

234
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,580
- Get down from there! Leave that! - I am not taking it.

235
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,920
You fools! What are you waiting for? Get her out of here!

236
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,120
- I am leaving on my own. - What is all this commotion?

237
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,020
Goodness, Head Merchant.

238
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Gang.

239
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,190
The court ladies Queen Dowager keeps sending to your chambers.

240
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,000
They all come from the Head Merchant.

241
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,570
My goodness. How can the resemblance be so exact?

242
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,480
Your Majesty.

243
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,820
Perhaps now is the time to say what you must.

244
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,090
You are right.

245
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,960
You wretched girl.

246
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,460
You tried to sneak into the palace, did you not?

247
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,360
For that crime, I could...

248
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,460
have you put to death right now!

249
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,130
And what crime would that be?

250
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
What did you say?

251
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,170
The attempt failed.

252
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,370
As for proof that I tried to enter the palace,

253
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,810
I only hid in a palace-bound cart.

254
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
I can just say I did not know, right?

255
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,150
You are not afraid of me, are you?

256
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,280
I suppose I am used to it.

257
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,920
The nerve of this girl...

258
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,220
You insolent girl!

259
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,160
How dare you disrespect Her Majesty the Queen Dowager?

260
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,789
Respectful or not,

261
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,330
you will send me to the Crown Prince's quarters, right?

262
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,460
Because this face...

263
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,840
is identical to that of the late Crown Princess.

264
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,540
Did you tell her?

265
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,610
I said no such thing.

266
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,010
It is all so obvious.

267
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,150
The Royal Secretary is exiled, and the bridal selection has begun.

268
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,679
The Left State Councillor's daughter will be the next Crown Princess.

269
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,950
And now that you have no allies in the palace,

270
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,220
you must see me as your last card to play, do you not?

271
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,819
You think that with this face, I can catch the Crown Prince's eye,

272
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,390
become his concubine, and bear a royal grandson.

273
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,290
A gamble you are willing to take.

274
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,260
That is what you think, is it not?

275
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,800
My goodness.

276
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,410
Yes. You are correct.

277
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,380
That is precisely how I intend to use you.

278
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,550
You will steal the Crown Prince's heart...

279
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,620
and conceive a royal heir. If you succeed,

280
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,220
I will spare your life.

281
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,220
As I have already told you,

282
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,889
even if you turn me in to the police,

283
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,390
my crime is not punishable by death.

284
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,700
Do you really think that until now,

285
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,000
I have only ever killed according to the law?

286
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,640
Dal, once she was grown

287
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,810
Lost her body

288
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,920
From that wretched Crown Prince

289
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,290
She received the divine punishment

290
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,160
Shaba shaba

291
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,190
Darn, shaba...

292
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,760
Your Highness, why are you acting like this?

293
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,769
You must eat.

294
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,170
You will collapse again if you keep this up.

295
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,840
Water flows from top to bottom, right?

296
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,070
So food must be the same way, right?

297
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,680
I cannot.

298
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,050
Your Highness.

299
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,590
The Left State Councillor is here.

300
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,030
Who is it?

301
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,950
Your Highness, I, Kim Han Chul, have come to pay my respects.

302
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,760
This is just...

303
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,530
I have been lying down for so long, I feel a bit stiff.

304
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,410
Here we go.

305
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,220
Your Highness.

306
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,790
- May I ask something of you? - What?

307
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,930
Yes. Of course.

308
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,100
It is about the girl you were searching for, Dal.

309
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,530
Is it possible...

310
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,600
that she is the peddler you saved the other day?

311
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
What?

312
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,340
No. That is not her.

313
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,650
I was looking for her, but it is not what you think.

314
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,420
There is absolutely nothing between me and that peddler.

315
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,320
The only woman for me is your daughter.

316
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,290
I certainly hope you mean that.

317
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,530
Goodness. You do not have to worry.

318
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,200
I will never be involved with her again. Absolutely never.

319
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,500
This is the new eunuch who will serve you starting today.

320
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,880
My name is Lee Gang Dol.

321
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,180
Your Royal Highness.

322
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,190
No way.

323
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,770
Did the world turn upside down while I was not looking?

324
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,140
Is there some new law that lets women be eunuchs now?

325
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,040
That is what makes me so special.

326
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,370
I made the impossible possible, did I not?

327
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,910
Do you think I am complimenting you?

328
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,080
I am asking you what on earth is going on!

329
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,190
Then, please let me enter the palace as a eunuch.

330
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,820
A eunuch? If a woman is caught impersonating a eunuch,

331
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,960
you could die. Do you not know that?

332
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,330
If you get caught, I will be in trouble too.

333
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,100
Even if I were to enter as a court lady,

334
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,900
the Chief Court Lady would fire me,

335
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,200
and I would never even get close to the Crown Prince.

336
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,700
If you are going to use me, then use me properly.

337
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,840
I will be the ace up your sleeve.

338
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,190
There is no law in the whole world that allows this.

339
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,220
There is absolutely no way this is allowed.

340
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,590
If there is no law, you just make one.

341
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,860
If that fails, you just break rules just to keep them on their toes.

342
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,270
I am looking at the very picture of shameless audacity.

343
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,600
If shameless audacity were a person, it would be you!

344
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,840
What are you on about?

345
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,310
Why steal my body and cause this mess?

346
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,810
- This is all your fault! - What are you even talking about?

347
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,379
If I had that kind of power,

348
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,950
do you think I would still be a peddler?

349
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,890
Hey, did you not have a red scar right here?

350
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,990
What?

351
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,800
Gosh, where did it go?

352
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,600
The way I remember it, that day,

353
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,930
a red light glowed from your wrist.

354
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,470
Are you really...

355
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,480
some kind of monster or an evil spirit?

356
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,210
No, I am definitely not anything like that.

357
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,580
But if this is the work of some strange spirit,

358
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,020
should we not perform an exorcism or go to a temple or something?

359
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,490
Are you out of your mind?

360
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,760
"The Crown Prince prays to shamans" or "The Crown Prince has gone mad."

361
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,360
Trying to spread that rumour in the capital?

362
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,690
We are already at the point of praying to rocks and the moon.

363
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,460
So why can we not pray to a shaman or to Buddha?

364
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,100
Listen to me.

365
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,140
The Crown Prince does not beg.

366
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,309
- Then what? - Gosh, you scared me.

367
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,740
What do you want us to do? What are you even saying?

368
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,010
First, we need to get out of the palace.

369
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,020
I have to get your confinement order lifted.

370
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,890
Do you have a way to do that?

371
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,320
The palace is, by nature,

372
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,720
a world ruled by women.

373
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,600
Lift the Crown Prince's confinement at once,

374
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,430
Your Majesty!

375
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,080
I asked you to get me out of the palace,

376
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,250
not get me soaked in a bath.

377
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,120
It was the Queen Dowager's condition.
(Watch on www.kisskh.ws to support Admin)

378
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,620
To lift the confinement, I had to attend your bath.

379
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,260
She uses the same tricks every time. As if that would ever stir my heart.

380
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,330
Goodness.

381
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,930
So with a more "creative" method, could any woman sway your heart?

382
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,500
Go on then, tell me.

383
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,700
What "creative" method does it take to make a man's heart waver?

384
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,040
Why are you asking me? You are the one who swayed my heart.

385
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,479
You did not just make my heart waver.

386
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,390
You stole my body too, did you not?

387
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,190
Oh, great. So now this is my fault too?

388
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,320
Yes! It is your fault!

389
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,930
So, have you thought of a way to switch us back?

390
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,200
Why do you always ask me?

391
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,929
Is your head just a hat rack? Why do you not use it?

392
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,200
This brain of mine is pretty good.

393
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,270
Right. You have got a point.

394
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,480
Remember, this was your idea, so do not get the wrong idea.

395
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,310
Beggars cannot be choosers.

396
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,580
What is it? Just tell me.

397
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,150
It is...

398
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,890
How about we recreate what happened that day?

399
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,290
That day?

400
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,590
The day we fell into the water.

401
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,630
My last memory from that moment was...

402
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,300
My last memory?

403
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,180
The kiss?

404
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,990
Yes. That is it.

405
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,360
I have no ulterior motives. Our bodies just switched that day,

406
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,730
so it makes sense to redo that day. That is all I am saying.

407
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,800
Do it.

408
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,940
- Do it? - Yes, do it.

409
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
Okay. Let us do it!

410
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,510
Let me repeat, I have no other intentions, okay?

411
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,820
Technically, this was your idea anyway.

412
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,980
I get it, just hurry up.

413
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,100
One, two.

414
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,040
Why did it not work?

415
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,480
I was so sure that would work.

416
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,220
Just do it properly this time. No holding back.

417
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,090
- Properly? - Yes.

418
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
Fine.

419
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:29,390
We will never get it to work if you come up for air so fast.

420
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,730
Your Highness.

421
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,670
What gives you the right to kiss me underwater?

422
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
I...

423
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,480
You said to do it properly, so I was recreating that exact day.

424
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,180
What is with him all of a sudden?

425
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Here.

426
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,770
I know you are mad I kissed you three times without asking,

427
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,240
but here, cover yourself with this.

428
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,740
You will catch a cold.

429
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,460
I am not angry.

430
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,860
I was just a bit surprised, that is all.

431
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,040
Who said you could be so reckless with my body?

432
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,640
Let us go to my chambers. We still have things to discuss.

433
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,490
Oh, my.

434
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,000
Nothing sparks a fire between a man and a woman...

435
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,900
like a hot, confined space.

436
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,540
Truly, when it comes to romance, the classics never fail.

437
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,140
Where did this little godsend come from?

438
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,950
Your reign will begin again, Your Majesty.

439
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,090
Gosh. Oh, for crying out loud.

440
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,900
Now what are we supposed to do?

441
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,200
Gosh. A peck did not work, and a real kiss did not work.

442
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
Doing it underwater did not work either.

443
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,670
Why are you taking that out on me?

444
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,710
I came up with one solution. Is it not your turn to find one?

445
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,110
After all, this is all your fault.

446
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,150
If you had not nearly drowned that day,

447
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,720
or if you did not have that odd scar to begin with,

448
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,420
something this bizarre and outrageous...

449
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,560
would never have happened!

450
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
That is right.

451
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,130
The scar.

452
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,060
The scar!

453
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
What?

454
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,040
That day, the scar on my wrist was glowing.

455
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,570
We both fell in the water,

456
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,370
then we kissed. That was the order, right?

457
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,040
You have to end things the way they began.

458
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,650
We have to do exactly what we did that day.

459
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Again?

460
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,420
You want us to fall in the water?

461
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:47,390
Hey. Do you have another solution? You want to keep living like this?

462
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,690
We cannot live like this.

463
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,230
But...

464
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,570
can we even get out to the bridge pier?

465
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,840
The Left Flank Guard and Eunuch Yoon would not let me go.

466
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,210
Then we need to find someone to help us.

467
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,680
- Eun Woo. - Goodness.

468
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,220
Oh, my. Your Highness.

469
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,190
- Goodness, Your Highness. - Hey!

470
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
Your Highness.

471
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,030
Have you been well?

472
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,600
- Get off me! What are you doing? - Where have I seen her before?

473
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,540
- Why are you here? - See? Did I not tell you?

474
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,770
I told you not to do anything you would regret. Right?

475
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,450
He is the one! He threw me out and told me to get lost.

476
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,150
- Eun Woo. - Yes? Yes? Oh, my.

477
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,120
Eun Woo! You are the hope of Joseon!

478
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,720
I am sorry? What?

479
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,670
- Gosh! - Your Royal Highness!

480
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,000
What are you doing? Hurry, go after him.

481
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,770
Hurry and follow him! You are going to lose him!

482
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,810
Come out, quick. Hurry up. We do not have time.

483
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Hurry, we have no time.

484
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,050
Which way do we go? Where?

485
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,530
Your Highness.

486
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,760
- I am the only hope of Joseon... - Honestly.

487
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,439
I am the only hope of Joseon.

488
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,370
Hope, my butt. We are done for!

489
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,140
All right.

490
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,450
All right.

491
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,850
Hurry up and stretch, you hear? We will be done if you get a cramp.

492
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,790
Wait.

493
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,420
If we pass out like we did last time,

494
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,590
we will need someone there to pull us out.

495
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,530
Shin Won and Se Dol should be here soon.

496
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,629
Then why did we bother sneaking out?

497
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,300
We should have just come with them.

498
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
The Crown Prince nearly drowned.

499
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,040
He wants to go back to the bridge pier to jump in again.

500
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,040
If I had told them, would anyone have said, "Yes, Your Highness"?

501
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,350
Or, "Allow me to clear the way for you"?

502
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,120
I guess we will just have to wait then.

503
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,560
- For goodness' sake. - What are you doing?

504
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,860
Do not just sit anywhere. It is filthy.

505
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,630
Gosh. This is how things get an unfair reputation. See?

506
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,730
A king decides a fish is delicious and calls it a delicacy.

507
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,770
Then it is just a common fish again. It is a sad life for the fish.

508
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,670
Why are you suddenly talking about a fish?

509
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,910
You are the one who slept outdoors while on the run for your life,

510
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,410
but you are calling this very smooth bridge filthy?

511
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,850
Now this bridge has been wronged, too. See?

512
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,390
From now on, I will call you the Bridge of the Wronged. Okay?

513
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,320
"Sniffle. So wronged."

514
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,430
So wronged.

515
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,460
All right, you are right.

516
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,410
I am sorry, Bridge of the Wronged.

517
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,340
Do not feel wronged anymore.

518
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,380
Goodness.

519
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,790
And as for you...

520
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,290
- I am sorry. - What?

521
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,960
So suddenly?

522
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,570
You told me to say I was sorry.

523
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,340
You told me to admit it was my fault.

524
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,810
At a time like this, you should apologise.

525
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,050
You should admit you were wrong.

526
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
I am sorry.

527
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,050
For saying you were low-born,

528
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,320
and for being so cruel and careless about the hard life you have lived.

529
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,030
For all of it.

530
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
It is okay.

531
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,970
You were not wrong, though.

532
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,710
I just wanted to give you pretty clothes.

533
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,580
I wanted to give you all sorts of beautiful things.

534
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,090
I never saw you as a replacement for the Crown Princess,

535
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,360
or as some kind of doll. Never.

536
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,130
In fact, because of you...

537
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,300
Because of you,

538
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,640
there were days I did not even think about the Crown Princess.

539
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,150
What? What are you blaming me for now?

540
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,820
It is because of you.

541
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,720
I knew it.

542
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,430
If it were not for you...

543
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,499
I would not have stopped the mat-rolling punishment...

544
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,530
like a madman...

545
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,530
or held a knife to the Minister of Personnel's throat.

546
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,040
But because it is you, I am finding...

547
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,370
that I do not mind this divine punishment.

548
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,260
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

549
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,030
- Your... - Your Highness!

550
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,130
Looks like they are here. Get ready quickly, okay?

551
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,570
Okay?

552
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,270
Okay, on the count of three, we jump.

553
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
One,

554
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,650
two,

555
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,510
three!

556
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,150
- I cannot. - What? What are you talking about?

557
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,340
He must be scared.

558
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,260
- Why? - Just close your eyes tight.

559
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,220
Do not worry, I am a great swimmer.

560
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,830
I will protect you this time too.

561
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,030
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!
What do we do?

562
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,270
Your Highness!

563
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,010
What are we going to do now?

564
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,880
Do not cry with my face.

565
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,950
Would I not look like a lunatic if I started laughing right now?

566
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,760
And watch your language.

567
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,770
Your attire must also be proper.

568
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:26,080
Hey, why are you getting so formal all of a sudden?

569
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,850
From now on, you have to truly become...

570
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,780
Lee Gang, the Crown Prince of Joseon.

571
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,150
Your Highness, I have prepared your new royal robes.

572
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,120
Do not shy away from luxury.

573
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,660
The red lining matches Your Highness's personal colour,

574
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,630
which we have determined is the "Summer Ice" colour type.

575
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,330
Personal colour, my butt!

576
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:53,200
My people are poor and have to wear hemp clothes in the dead of winter.

577
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,069
They cannot wash or eat, so sunburnt they cannot tell...

578
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,440
their own skin tone,

579
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,440
so why are we wasting money on the darn lining?

580
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,950
Coastal villages cannot catch fish because of the rough seas,

581
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,650
and the rice paddies have dried up and turned yellow from the drought.

582
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,220
This meal does not reflect reality of the country at all, does it?

583
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:17,260
- Your Highness, what do you mean? - Ignoring your people's suffering.

584
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,560
The reason we serve local specialties on the royal table...

585
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,470
is to stay informed of conditions in those regions.

586
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:29,140
But from this table, you would think the country is a field of flowers.

587
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
This is basically propaganda.

588
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,050
Hey! Can you not do something about that accent?

589
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,320
You speak the capital dialect well.

590
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,920
Is the Crown Prince dissing people with regional accents right now?

591
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,260
It is not that I am dissing them.

592
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,730
But if I, a capital native, suddenly speak with an accent,

593
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,060
would people not get suspicious?

594
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,730
But there is something I have been wondering.

595
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,830
Why are we hiding the fact that we have switched bodies?

596
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,310
Should we not tell everyone we have switched bodies so that...

597
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,409
it would be much easier to find a way...

598
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,540
to switch back with everyone's help.

599
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,910
What you want to go around telling everyone...

600
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,950
is that the Crown Prince has gone mad? Is that it?

601
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,220
"Everyone, I have switched bodies overnight with a peddler woman."

602
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:22,490
"What should I do?" Do you think any minister will go, "Is that so?"

603
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,130
Then say, "We will form a plan." You really think they would do that?

604
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,270
Why keep using that brilliant mind of mine like this?

605
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,070
Okay, I get it.

606
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,370
- I get it. - That is better.

607
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,580
To recap,

608
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,850
be extravagant, ignore the people's welfare,

609
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,880
use the capital's accent, and keep it a secret.

610
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,520
That is everything, right?

611
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,490
- Is that it? - We are not done yet.

612
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,619
Pretend you do not know anything.

613
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,759
"Things have root and branch."

614
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,960
"Affairs have an end and a beginning."

615
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,860
"To know what comes first and last is to be near the way."

616
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,570
Gosh, since these men feast on dust instead of rice,

617
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,370
it is no wonder all they talk is stale nonsense.

618
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,340
Enough of this.

619
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,580
Does anyone here know the price of rice or salt?

620
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,980
Your Highness, why concern yourself with such trivial matters?

621
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,120
Ancient sages spoke of governing to bring peace to the world.

622
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:26,160
Your Highness should look forward and cultivate a ruler's virtues.

623
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,560
Gosh, Judas Priest.

624
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,230
- Did he just... - Pardon?

625
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,270
I said, "Justice and Duty."

626
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:39,840
"Principle and Esteem."

627
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,970
Those are the virtues I will realise through the Great Learning.

628
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,640
Compared to books for the nobility, the people's plight...

629
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,650
is always met with a "Who cares?"

630
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:54,580
And the people are the only ones who get ruined.

631
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,890
However, I will simply "suck it up"...

632
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,690
and, as my teachers taught me, get back to my studies.

633
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,720
(To absorb knowledge through diligent study)

634
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,730
And be cold to everyone.

635
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,340
This morning greeting is unexpected.

636
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:24,780
Is it not a son's duty to ensure his father is well?

637
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,450
But why are you playing Go by yourself?

638
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,320
Would you like a partner?

639
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:38,230
The Crown Prince seems odd lately, do you not think?

640
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:42,030
It started with the eunuch who looks just like the late Crown Princess.

641
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,369
Be quiet. He even bathes with the eunuch...

642
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:47,000
because he cannot get over her.

643
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,940
- With a look-alike eunuch? - That is it. That is totally it.

644
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,110
You are right.

645
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,450
What has gotten into you, being so affectionate so suddenly?

646
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:59,820
A son must naturally show respect to his father.

647
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,790
Here, should I place my stone here?

648
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,590
Consider your move carefully.

649
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,190
- It is a picnic ko. - What is a picnic ko?

650
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,930
One side has nothing to lose,

651
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,400
but the other side must win...

652
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,540
to avoid a major loss. That is the situation.

653
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,140
I almost lost the game with that one move.

654
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,680
It is said the world is but a single Go board.

655
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,150
Human affairs are just one long game of Go.

656
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:44,160
The Left State Councillor's daughter was chosen today, was she not?

657
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,500
From now on, you cannot make a single mistake in any move.

658
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,660
You are finally the Crown Princess.

659
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,599
You are the master of this quarters.

660
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,860
Do not pay any mind to the rumours around the palace.

661
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,240
You did not think saying that would make me think of them more,

662
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,440
did you?

663
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:32,010
In any case, Your Highness.

664
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,780
From now on, do not worry about anything else,

665
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,650
and please live a long and happy life with the Crown Prince.

666
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,050
- All right? - Yeo Ri.

667
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:45,990
Did you know?

668
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,590
Until the royal wedding is held,

669
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,130
a woman is not the Crown Prince's yet,

670
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,560
even if she has been chosen.

671
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,800
What do you mean?

672
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,670
Have you been well?

673
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,750
I have not been doing so well myself.

674
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,480
But you, my lord,

675
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:16,790
will remain handsome forever, will you not?

676
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:25,159
(Memorial tablet of the beloved Kang Han Seong)

677
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,330
My lord!

678
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,169
What is going on?

679
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:34,070
Assassinating the Queen? Treason?

680
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,339
Do not cry.

681
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,469
(Kang Han Seong, Yeon Wol's brother)

682
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,810
- You will ruin your beautiful face. - My lord...

683
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,740
Can I ask you for a favour?

684
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,780
- A favour? - I know it is a lot to ask,

685
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,450
but please take care of the Crown Princess.

686
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:52,020
When my father and I are gone...

687
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:57,030
I cannot bear the thought of my dear sister all alone.

688
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,730
No matter what happens,

689
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,200
I will protect the Crown Princess, my lord.

690
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,110
I am sorry it has taken me so long to say this.

691
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,340
That I...

692
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,550
hoped you would be my one and only.

693
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:21,980
My...

694
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,750
Hong Nan.

695
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,520
My lord...

696
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:33,430
My lord...

697
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,470
Do not worry, my lord.

698
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,470
The Crown Princess.

699
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:47,210
I will protect her with my life.

700
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,380
That...

701
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,020
is the only reason I chose to live...

702
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,420
instead of following you.

703
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,660
We eunuchs, who protect the royals, must, in an emergency,

704
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,700
carry His Majesty and our superiors on our backs and run.

705
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,769
That is why maintaining our physical strength is essential.

706
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,870
All of you, carry a sack of flour and run ten laps.

707
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,870
If your sack bursts and spills, you get three extra laps.

708
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,340
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

709
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,580
(Eunuch Physical Fitness Test)

710
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,920
Even rice sacks tear easily.

711
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,260
But flour sacks? Darn it.

712
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,000
Then complain to His Royal Highness.

713
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,700
What does His Highness have to do with this?

714
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,900
Hello?

715
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,339
Well, now, look at that.

716
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,870
I do not know which palace he serves,

717
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,410
but that eunuch's master's head just burst.

718
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,750
What? What an outrageous thing to say.

719
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,850
Just because it is hard, they would drop the King or master?

720
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,519
Hey! Change those to flour sacks.

721
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,920
And add three laps every time a sack leaks.

722
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:09,390
Darn it. I should have become a court lady.

723
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,670
First place.

724
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:20,640
So hot.

725
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,040
- First place! - Gosh, what is his problem?

726
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:37,020
I should have just become a court lady.

727
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,070
Hey, you.

728
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,840
You there. Which department are you with?

729
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,250
Let me see your face.

730
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,320
Hey, newbie!

731
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:45,320
You little punk! I told you to clean up that flour.

732
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,420
How dare you try to run off?

733
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:50,590
Did you think I would not find you just because you were hiding?

734
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,560
My lord, my apologies.

735
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,670
But did you have business with our rookie?

736
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,070
- Not at all. - I see.

737
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,610
He can be a bit of a slacker,

738
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,510
but he is definitely not a suspicious person.

739
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,080
Why are you standing there?

740
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,480
Go and clean up that flour! Hurry!

741
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,150
- Yes, sir. - Right.

742
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,060
My lord, you have some flour on your beard...

743
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,830
What do you think you are doing?

744
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,940
Take care, my lord.

745
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,750
Goodness.

746
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:48,280
That was the greatest achievement of my 19 years.

747
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,600
You there. Are you not Dal?

748
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,130
- Who is it now? - It is me, Master Heo.

749
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,400
What, you do not recognise me in my official robes?

750
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,600
Fancy meeting my daughter's saviour here.

751
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,170
So this is why I could not find you. I waited for days in Boryeong.

752
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,980
Your daughter's saviour...

753
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,050
Are you Inspector Kim's father-in-law?

754
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,680
Gosh, do not even mention that scum.

755
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:23,690
Seriously, what were you thinking?

756
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,760
She is a fragile kid who is not even supposed to be in Hanyang,

757
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,790
and you ordered her to kidnap your widowed daughter?

758
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:33,330
Says the one who should not be in Hanyang.

759
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,660
You are not even a court lady.

760
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,430
So, have you become a eunuch?

761
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,200
That is just how it worked out.

762
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:47,040
Did that lowly inspector really try to kill a high official's daughter?

763
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,350
I cannot believe the Kim clan is that powerful.

764
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,110
You even know the officials' ranks too?

765
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,490
If he is Lord Heo, a high-ranking military official in Boryeong,

766
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,220
then he must be Lord Heo Ok, the former Naval Commander.

767
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,810
Your Highness!

768
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:20,840
- You are hurting my ears. - You must listen to me now!

769
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,040
That peddler.

770
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,850
The woman who came to Sinjusa.

771
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,450
She is a eunuch now.

772
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,920
Where is she?

773
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,860
It is not poisoned. You can drink it.

774
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,730
Why did you bring me here instead of reporting me to the Eunuch Office?

775
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:45,730
You must be scared.

776
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:50,440
I suppose if it were discovered that a woman posed as a eunuch,

777
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,340
you could be put to death.

778
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,110
Do not worry.

779
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,710
I will not report you.

780
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,280
For now.

781
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,550
What do you want?

782
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,190
I plan to fight against my father.

783
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,690
My father is using the Crown Prince to control the King,

784
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,760
and I will use you to control the Crown Prince.

785
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,560
And like that, I...

786
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,900
will take Joseon for myself.

787
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,770
She is going to use Dal as my weakness.

788
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,080
Spoken like the Left State Councillor's daughter.

789
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,250
Gosh, how many people are holding my life for ransom now?

790
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,320
My goodness!

791
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,550
I help out one person, and this is what I get?

792
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,150
There is a limit to repaying a favour with betrayal.

793
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,930
I saved his life, and now my own is being held for ransom,

794
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:46,430
while he gets to sleep soundly and orders me to make his bed.

795
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:49,160
- Goodness. - "He"? Did you say "he"?

796
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,000
Did you just refer to me disrespectfully?

797
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:53,230
When we are all about to die, what can I not say?

798
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,200
Do not worry.

799
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,370
You will be staying in my quarters for the time being.

800
00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:00,840
As long as you are here, the Crown Princess cannot touch you.

801
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,040
What?

802
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,880
- You do not care what others say? - Have you forgotten?

803
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,650
To everyone else, you are a man.

804
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,850
A Crown Prince studying all night, with his eunuch grinding the ink.

805
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,220
Is there anything strange about that?

806
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,860
Just because other people see a man, does that make me one?

807
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,060
How are we supposed to share a room?

808
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:39,410
I think I know...

809
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:41,350
what you were expecting,

810
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,320
but I am sorry, all right?

811
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:47,660
I have too much royal work to do to be sharing a bed with you.

812
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,760
What? I was not expecting anything.

813
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:55,800
I was just thinking what a relief that is.

814
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,490
That is why I killed Her Majesty, the Queen,

815
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:01,200
and framed the former Crown Princess for the crime.

816
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,299
That is why...

817
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,970
you chose death instead of getting revenge.

818
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,970
How pathetic.

819
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,720
Were you having a nightmare?

820
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:59,720
My heart...

821
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,760
My heart aches.

822
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,930
It is like I am underwater.

823
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,230
I feel like I am suffocating.

824
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,220
It is okay.

825
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,560
Why are we out for a walk this late?

826
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,800
If you lie down now, you will have that nightmare again.

827
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,600
Walking for a bit should help.

828
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,700
Do you have nightmares often?

829
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,640
Pretty often.

830
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:52,770
It must be your nightmares, Your Highness.

831
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,910
Actually, ever since we switched bodies,

832
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,280
I have been having dreams almost every night.

833
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,050
Dreams about the Crown Princess.

834
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,350
But they do not feel like just dreams.

835
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:09,220
I think they are your memories.

836
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,000
As if taking my body was not enough,

837
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,630
now you have taken my nightmares too.

838
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:20,170
Are you blaming me for taking your nightmares?

839
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,740
Those nightmares...

840
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,740
were the only way I could still see her.

841
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,110
But ever since we switched bodies,

842
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,580
I have not been able to have even those nightmares.

843
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,750
I just realised that now.

844
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,900
It is probably because you are in my body.

845
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:51,900
I fall asleep the second my head hits the pillow.

846
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,940
There is nothing for me to remember, anyway.

847
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,800
Nothing to remember?

848
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,670
The thing is...

849
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,610
My parents... They are not my birth parents.

850
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:09,820
When I was five, I lost my parents while running from slave hunters.

851
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,290
I was left an orphan, all alone. My aunt was the one who took me in.

852
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,390
Oh, my. What?

853
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:22,860
- You never told me any of this. - At the time,

854
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:27,670
I never thought we would be so tangled up like this.

855
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,540
Besides, this palace...

856
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:35,680
is a vicious place, you know?

857
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:40,820
My parents and my aunt's only crime was raising a poor orphan.

858
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:45,390
What if the Left State Councillor or the Queen Grand Dowager...

859
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,360
end up hurting my parents because of me?

860
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:59,170
You must have been so cold.

861
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,070
It was like a winter night.

862
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:05,940
A winter's night?

863
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:11,580
They say I was chased by slavers when I lost my memories.

864
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:15,450
When I opened my eyes,

865
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,150
my mind was completely blank,

866
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:20,820
but my memory was just a black void.

867
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,460
When I came to and went outside,

868
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:27,090
the sky was also pitch-black,

869
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,730
and the deep snow I was sinking into was stark white.

870
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,100
As I walked aimlessly,

871
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,640
I thought to myself, "Perhaps..."

872
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:40,270
"this can be my first memory."

873
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:45,410
"Then..."

874
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,820
"are these my first steps?"

875
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,950
"In that case, today will be my birthday."

876
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,160
"From now on, my season will be the winter night."

877
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,790
That is what I decided.

878
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:01,330
How can you be so calm?

879
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,630
After everything you went through.

880
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,230
What other choice do I have?

881
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,570
I do not have any good memories.

882
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,440
It only hurts me to dwell on the bad ones.

883
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:12,410
And it is my loss if I just cower and blame my awful fate.

884
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,140
What is awful about your fate?

885
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:19,550
- You are incredibly lucky. - I would not say I am that lucky.

886
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,750
No, you are very lucky.

887
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:27,990
To be so fatefully entangled with the Crown Prince.

888
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:29,920
So tell me.

889
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,890
Your dreams, your wishes, anything.

890
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,570
"Dream" is too grand a word for it.

891
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:43,870
Other than straw shoes,

892
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:46,910
I want one in silk shoes.

893
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:53,210
Silk shoes? I will buy you over a hundred pairs of them.

894
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:56,280
I will buy you enough to fill an entire room.

895
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:00,050
No, the "silk shoes"...

896
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,560
It is a metaphor.

897
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,330
Forget it.

898
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:13,430
There are two things that really annoy people.

899
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:16,340
One is when someone stops talking mid-sentence,

900
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,010
and the other is...

901
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,480
And the other is?

902
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:29,120
- What is it? - See?

903
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:32,750
Now you know how curious I am to hear what you were saying.

904
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:34,920
Gosh.

905
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:40,930
Not a life of constant wandering,

906
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:44,060
wearing out your straw shoes.

907
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:47,230
But a life where I wear silk shoes...

908
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,800
and walk at a leisurely pace.

909
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,340
That is the life I want.

910
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,280
Where I do not have to run anymore,

911
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,550
and I do not have to live in hiding.

912
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,520
A life where I can settle down...

913
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,550
and make a real family of my own.

914
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,660
What is it?

915
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,400
It may sound as foolish as a fish trying to swallow the moon,

916
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,170
but I am still allowed to dream, are I not?

917
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,950
Your heels are not scraped up today, are they?

918
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:39,820
What?

919
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,160
No.

920
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,430
Good.

921
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:55,640
- Your Highness! - Your Highness.

922
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,080
Wait...

923
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,920
Just wait here for a moment.

924
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:12,490
But I...

925
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,120
Do not come in.

926
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:24,770
What was that about? What is with this elaborate ditching?

927
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,180
I waited all night.

928
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:47,020
You cannot just mess with someone in the middle of the night.

929
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,150
No.

930
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,320
You were not supposed to come in yet.

931
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:35,330
Black and white...

932
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,000
do not just belong to the cold winter nights.

933
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,200
So from now on, your season...

934
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,440
will be a spring night.

935
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,510
And from now on, the path you walk...

936
01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:50,340
will be a path of flowers.

937
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,400
Should I make it snow?

938
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,990
Do not stray too far.

939
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,580
Am I still dreaming?

940
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:41,950
Or was last night the dream?

941
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,250
Why is my face...

942
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,760
Goodness, what was that?

943
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,600
Why? What?

944
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:22,590
No. That is... It is not that. It is just...

945
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:33,670
(Moon River)

946
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,519
Young people these days play tug-of-war in love.

947
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,920
They pretend to push you away,

948
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:55,389
but the moment you drift apart, they pull you right back in.

949
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:57,160
The tug-of-war in love.

950
01:15:57,290 --> 01:16:00,390
I am saying that if His Highness has other intentions,

951
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,060
what guarantee is there...

952
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,570
that the Gyesa Year Incident will not happen all over again?

953
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:09,900
I heard Dal went to the capital. I will take her and leave Joseon.

954
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
That he is in love.

955
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,140
The Crown Prince loves Park Dal.

956
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,020
(Moon River)
