[Episode 11]

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,260
Dad, about last night...

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,100
Shut up!

13
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,420
Must you always make such a scene?

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,980
With a mind like yours,

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,260
are you trying to ruin
your own engagement?

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,940
Last time,
because you couldn't hold your tongue,

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,820
our shipments through the dock

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,740
have been cut by more than half.

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,900
Must you always be so forgetful?

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,140
It's not like that! Dad.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,900
Keep the Blycher Hotel's account book
in proper order.

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,380
Lock it in your room.

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,620
No one is allowed to enter.

24
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,380
Am I disturbing you?

25
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,620
Not at all.

26
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:39,940
Come.

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,660
Come over.

28
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,460
Have some tea.

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,060
You may go.

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,700
So, are you settling in comfortably?

31
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Quite comfortable.

32
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,820
Good.

33
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,900
By the way,

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,940
the Chamber of Commerce election
is approaching.

35
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,780
Tomorrow,

36
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,940
I wish to host a banquet here at home

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,940
for my Chamber colleagues.

38
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,540
Go and prepare thoroughly.

39
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,940
At the same time,

40
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,980
I intend to announce

41
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,540
our marriage.

42
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,180
Sure.

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,300
Everyone.

44
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,180
It is an honor

45
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,780
that you could take time

46
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,300
to attend my family banquet.

47
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,620
First, today,

48
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,220
I wish to thank you all

49
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,060
for your long-standing support.

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,500
Thank you.

51
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,180
Secondly,

52
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,420
I want to announce

53
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,300
two most joyous occasions
for our Wang family,

54
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,700
the marriage of my daughter

55
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,180
to Chen Wenbin,
son of Military Governor Chen,

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,020
and

57
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,420
my own marriage to Liu Rumeng.

58
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,100
Rumeng,

59
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,500
these are Wang family heirlooms.

60
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,180
Put the rings on both of them.

61
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,780
Okay.

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,380
Rumeng, come with me.

63
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,140
Wenbin,

64
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,980
from now on,

65
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,340
we are family.

66
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,700
Wonderful!

67
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,100
Mr. Li.

68
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,740
Mr. Wang, congratulations!

69
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,700
Thank you, thank you.

70
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,620
Mr. Li,

71
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,860
regarding

72
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,020
the Chamber of Commerce matter,

73
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,100
what is your view?

74
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,020
Mr. Wang,

75
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,940
the merchants are all upstanding.

76
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,580
Not that you aren't upstanding enough,

77
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,540
but this drink of yours...

78
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,300
I dare not accept it.

79
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,420
It's just a drink,

80
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,420
for good fortune.

81
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,540
I toast you.

82
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,500
Then this drink from Miss Liu,

83
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,820
I shall savor it properly.

84
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,580
Congratulations.

85
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,900
Your first love
is now your mother-in-law.

86
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,980
Though it seems
she doesn't want to go with you.

87
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,900
What's the plan?

88
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,140
I'll go freshen up. Excuse me.

89
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,660
Enough talk. Go help her first.

90
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,020
Mr. Li, about our matter,

91
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,340
you really must lend your support.

92
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
Keep a close watch.

93
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,380
- Yes.
- Yes.

94
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,460
- What's that sound?
- What's happening?

95
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,500
Why are you here?

96
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,500
What's going on?

97
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:26,980
Let's go.

98
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,780
I don't know.

99
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,500
Was it just for this?

100
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,740
You're injured?

101
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,780
I'm fine.

102
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,380
Are you two alright?

103
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,740
Hurry, let's go.

104
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,420
People are coming this way, quick!

105
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:40,860
Go!

106
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,900
A gun?

107
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,780
Go search!

108
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,260
Well...

109
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,620
As the Wang family's concubine,

110
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,900
if everyone were to see

111
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,380
you with your son-in-law,

112
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,900
how would you ever marry into the Wangs?

113
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
What are you doing?

114
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,100
Shoot me.

115
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,580
Otherwise, my injury has no explanation.

116
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,140
Chen Wenbin!

117
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
What are you doing?

118
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,180
Liu Rumeng

119
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,380
is to become
the Wang family's concubine.

120
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,180
I know.

121
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,980
Sir,

122
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,020
Marshal Chen had too much to drink.

123
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,220
He mistook me for Wan'er, that's why...

124
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,580
Is that so?

125
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,780
A thief broke into the house.

126
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,780
Rumeng,

127
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,300
I was worried about your safety,

128
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,380
so I rushed over to check.

129
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,140
I'm glad you're unharmed.

130
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,460
Wan'er,

131
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,220
check quickly

132
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,020
if there's anything in the room

133
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,220
that shouldn't be here.

134
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,020
We wouldn't want to wrong
an innocent person.

135
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,220
Guards!

136
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,580
Search the room.

137
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,380
Wenbin,

138
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,180
do you mind

139
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,140
if we search you?

140
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,380
Just for safety's sake.

141
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,100
Take it out.

142
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,460
This is what you

143
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,140
left with me at The Paramount.

144
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,980
You haven't forgotten, have you?

145
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,180
Liu Rumeng, you...!

146
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:33,860
What's going on?

147
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,380
Sir! Miss Wang!

148
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,220
Someone was seen fleeing
from Miss Wang's room!

149
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,180
There's blood on the floor!

150
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,740
After them, quickly!

151
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,540
Mr. Wang,

152
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,140
