[The Sparrow's Gambit]

00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,500
[Episode 21]

11
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,620
Cry if you need to.

12
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,900
Let it out. You'll feel better.

13
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,620
When I first learned

14
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,100
that Wang Penghui

15
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,940
was the one who killed my family,

16
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,220
I broke down crying many times, too.

17
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,780
You don't need

18
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,300
to be strong around me.

19
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,020
After my mother died,

20
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,700
I was sent to the orphanage.

21
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,340
Kids bullied me

22
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,700
and beat me.

23
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,580
My life was dark

24
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,180
until he showed up.

25
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,700
He took me home,

26
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,220
gave me everything I'd dreamed of,

27
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,300
and taught me to read, to fight...

28
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,020
Besides you,

29
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,140
he's the most important person to me.

30
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,900
So why...

31
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,420
why did everything turn out like this?

32
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,820
Here, look.

33
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,340
My father gave me this.

34
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,940
He said

35
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,180
even wounded and lonely,

36
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,580
it still takes off to the sky.

37
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,940
You said the wind carries the kite.

38
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,340
Now I want to be your wind,

39
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,180
always by your side.

40
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,620
Drink as much as you want. I'll stay.

41
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,500
But promise me

42
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,900
when you're sober,

43
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,820
you'll pull yourself together.

44
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,020
Alright?

45
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,940
You're back.

46
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,820
Go get some rest.

47
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,620
Dad.

48
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,340
I dreamed of my mom last night.

49
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,580
She asked

50
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,820
why I'm so stubborn.

51
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,780
Wenjin...

52
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,300
She resented me for leaving you
in that orphanage.

53
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,020
She hasn't visited my dreams in years.

54
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,100
What did she say?

55
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,820
She was furious with me.

56
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,940
Said I'd been wrong.

57
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,100
But Dad,

58
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,940
what exactly did I do wrong?

59
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,900
Next time you're out late,

60
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,500
wear more layers.

61
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,500
Don't catch a cold.

62
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,500
Your mother's reminding you

63
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,340
that time shows someone's true colors.

64
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,980
Who you trust to watch your back,

65
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,340
that's your call.

66
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,340
Any unusual moves

67
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
from Wenbin?

68
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,140
Out all night for days.

69
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,340
With whom?

70
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,900
Miss Liu.

71
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,220
He is not to leave the house.

72
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,020
And remember,

73
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,340
keep him away from the basement.

74
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,940
Yes, sir.

75
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,340
Liu Rumeng again...

76
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,940
Mr. Chen,

77
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,820
quite the welcoming party.

78
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
What brings you here?

79
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,140
I'm here to inform you

80
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,820
that I'm taking over

81
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,700
the Song City Opium Case from today on.

82
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,220
You're clever, Miss Liu,

83
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,540
but sometimes

84
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,780
painfully naive.

85
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,020
One woman taking on the world?

86
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,100
That's not how this place works.

87
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,540
Planning to kill me?

88
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,740
If killing could solve everything

89
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,220
so easily,

90
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,500
why'd you spend months at the Wangs'?

91
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,500
Besides, Wenbin cares for you.

92
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,180
If I killed you,

93
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,580
my son and I

94
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,700
would be finished.

95
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,580
You're sharp.

96
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,940
Sharp people know how to play the game.

97
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,300
What do you want?

98
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,540
Name it.

99
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,340
The Chamber of Commerce?

100
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,380
Money?

101
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,100
Ah, right.

102
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,580
You don't care for such things.

103
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,900
Then what about Wenbin?

104
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,780
Keep this up,

105
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,540
and you're done with him.

106
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,100
We choose

107
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,340
our own path.

108
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,020
You're being silly again.

109
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,780
You're just the daughter

110
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,900
of the late Chamber President.

111
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,980
The Lin name is gone.

112
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,340
How does one woman fight

113
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
against the empire my family built?

114
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,860
I'm really curious,

115
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,740
what exactly will you do?

116
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,060
Are you done?

117
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,180
For Wenbin's sake,

118
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,100
take my advice and walk away.

119
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,220
I never offer a second chance.

120
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,100
What's going on?

121
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,620
Why all the guards?

122
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,940
How's the warehouse lead?

123
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,700
Don't even ask.

124
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,660
Higher-ups sent someone.

125
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,420
They took over the case.

126
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,740
The lead's dead now.

127
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,740
Gone for good.

128
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,660
What's that mean?

129
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,500
Well,

130
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,540
your father's running the show.

131
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,900
It's a classic case

132
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,540
of the fox guarding the henhouse.

133
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,420
Wenbin, he's your father.

134
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,100
Can you really go against him?

135
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,980
I know

136
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,780
I can't undo what's been done.

137
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,740
But he's still my father,

138
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,580
I can't watch him sink further.

139
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,140
I didn't get it before, not like Rumeng.

140
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,100
Now I finally do.

141
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,340
Chasing the truth,

142
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,340
that's what makes me feel alive.

143
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,940
Stick to the plan.

144
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,780
Careful, lots of eyes outside.

145
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,940
Nothing here.

146
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,340
Let's go.

147
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,940
Move this.

148
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,860
Su Zhengzhi?

149
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,100
Su Zhengzhi, is that you?

150
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,580
It's Chen Wenbin.

151
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,660
Hurry!

152
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,980
Wenbin! Wenbin!

153
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,980
Someone's coming. Go! Now!

154
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,940
Tomorrow's the Chen family banquet.

155
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,340
I'll get you out then.

156
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,100
