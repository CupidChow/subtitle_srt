[Episode 13]

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,900
Rumeng,

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,460
I know you've suffered many grievances

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,420
since entering the Wang family.

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,580
Set your mind at ease.

15
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,780
Once you are formally married,

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,060
I will protect you.

17
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,180
Okay.

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,100
Rumeng,

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,140
what's wrong?

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,420
Rumeng?

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,420
Rumeng?

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,500
Rumeng?

23
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,300
Room 904. Have fun.

24
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,100
After tonight,

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,780
you'll understand I'm better than her.

26
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,780
By now,

27
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,660
she should already be with Mr. Li.

28
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,260
What did you say?

29
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,700
Wenbin.

30
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,020
Rumeng! Rumeng!

31
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,220
Here I come, babe!

32
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,620
Come on, babe!

33
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,020
With my strength alone,

34
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,180
I could never expose their crimes.

35
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,060
Babe,

36
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,300
here I come!

37
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,300
Mr. Wang.

38
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,260
Mr. Li.

39
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,940
So,

40
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,100
did you enjoy yourself earlier?

41
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,300
Man,

42
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,620
you really went all out.

43
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,500
Don't worry.

44
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,900
From now on, you can count on me

45
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,300
for anything the Wang family needs.

46
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,780
Mr. Li,

47
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,980
then I would like

48
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,380
to thank you verbally.

49
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,700
I'll send you a generous package later.

50
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,020
We're all family now.

51
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,980
Wang Penghui, do you even
see me as your daughter?

52
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,180
You handed me over to someone else
like livestock?

53
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,660
Are you even human?

54
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,180
All these years,

55
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,700
haven't I done every dirty,
difficult job

56
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,860
for the Wang family?

57
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,020
What are you talking about?

58
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,220
You gave me

59
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,340
to such

60
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,100
an old scumbag?

61
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,860
Mr. Wang,

62
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
this is your daughter!

63
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,100
She can't just make wild accusations!

64
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,700
She's slandering me
in front of all these people!

65
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
You couldn't get back into the Chamber,

66
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,260
so this is your pathetic move?

67
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,580
Everyone, my conscience is clear.

68
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,900
I fear no false accusations.

69
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,700
This filthy woman must have

70
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,260
been fooling around with some other man

71
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,700
and now wants me to take the blame.

72
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,660
Let me tell you,

73
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,020
dream on!

74
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,780
Nonsense!

75
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,500
You're all hypocrites!

76
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,580
So-called pillars
of the business community!

77
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,300
You dare to do it but won't admit it,
is that it?

78
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,020
Wan'er,

79
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,060
could there be some misunderstanding?

80
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,260
You...

81
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,100
Misunderstanding?

82
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,940
It should have been you!

83
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,180
You arranged all of this!

84
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,940
I'll kill you!

85
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,420
Guards!

86
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,020
To think she'd stoop
to outright violence!

87
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,900
Let me go!

88
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,540
Mr. Wang,

89
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,420
regarding today's incident...

90
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,300
I know.

91
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,180
Once the Military Governor Chen returns,

92
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,780
I will personally come to apologize.

93
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,180
You've completely humiliated me today.

94
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,900
Go home

95
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,580
and kneel

96
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,540
until I am satisfied.

97
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
Are you okay?

98
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,100
So you're determined

99
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,740
to marry into the Wang family?

100
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,260
Yes.

101
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,380
Please leave.

102
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,980
Don't make me hate you.

103
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,620
I'll kill you!

104
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,140
Rumeng.

105
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,620
What a farce today.

106
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,460
Yes.

107
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,740
A farce.

108
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,500
You weren't hurt, were you?

109
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,020
No.

110
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,540
No...

111
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,620
That's good.

112
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,020
But there's something
I want to ask you now.

113
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,220
Where were you
when Wan'er had her incident?

114
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,380
Where was I?

115
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,740
Shouldn't you know best?

116
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,620
Then why did I hear

117
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,300
Chen Wenbin was with you?

118
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,180
What was in the wine?

119
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,740
You know perfectly well.

120
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
What Marshal Chen was doing,

121
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,580
and where he was...

122
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,700
How would I, in my dazed state,

123
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,020
have any idea?

124
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,300
Can you tell the truth?

125
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,740
The truth! Tell the truth!

126
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,100
Your eagerness
to marry off your daughter...

127
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,180
I understand.

128
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,020
But you sent Wang Wan'er
to lure me to a hotel

129
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,140
and drug me with incense.

130
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,180
That was a rather despicable tactic,
wasn't it?

131
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,020
Wang Penghui,

132
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,780
the Chen family values integrity
and character above all.

133
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,340
I advise you

134
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,180
to discipline your daughter properly.

135
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,340
Don't worry, Marshal Chen.

136
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,220
I've already made that fool
kneel in punishment.
