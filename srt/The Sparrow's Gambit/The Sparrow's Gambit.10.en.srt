189
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,500
and get revenge for you.

190
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,100
What are you causing a scene about
in the middle of the night...

191
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,940
Help her up.

192
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,820
Miss Wang, wake up!

193
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,860
What are you shouting for?

194
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,900
Look at the state you're in!

195
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,180
Dad! Dad!

196
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,260
I saw Qingmao!

197
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,420
Qingmao came for me!

198
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,860
- Qingmao came for me!
- Nonsense!

199
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,340
No, Dad!

200
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,780
She really came for me!

201
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,020
Get a grip!

202
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,460
Dad...

203
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,140
Dad! She came for me!

204
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,580
Qingmao came for me!

205
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,700
Qingmao came for me!

206
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,780
Get back to bed and go to sleep!

207
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,620
Qingmao came for me!

208
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,780
Qingmao came for me!

209
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,020
The timing is rather convenient.

210
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,580
How is it that Qingmao appears now,

211
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,820
only after Liu Rumeng has moved in?
