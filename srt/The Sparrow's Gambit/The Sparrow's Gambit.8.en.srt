[Episode 8]

11
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,620
This affair ends now

12
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,660
in your own room!

13
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,340
I think

14
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,860
you know

15
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,300
why Wang Wan'er invited you.

16
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,460
You don't wanna marry her, right?

17
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,860
You're looking for Qingmao, right?

18
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,660
Listen.

19
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,060
Work with me.

20
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,820
I'll tell you

21
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,380
how the Wangs killed her.

22
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,500
Do as you please.

23
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,620
You wretch!

24
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,020
Stop right there!

Liu Rumeng!

27
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,460
How dare you seduce Wenbin?

28
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,100
At the Paramount,

29
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,340
all guests are welcome.

30
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,820
Wenbin

31
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,260
is no exception.

32
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,700
You've been playing me all along?

33
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,420
Unlike you, Miss Wang,

34
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,060
you annoyed him with all your schemes.

35
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,220
It's a bother for me

36
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,980
that I did nothing

37
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,060
yet Wenbin keeps pursuing me.

38
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,060
The Blycher Hotel.

39
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,620
The Paramount.

40
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,420
Even in your room.

41
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,260
He's so bold.

42

Every time,

43
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,860
right under your nose.

44
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,420
It's thrilling,

45
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,140
really.

46
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,100
You're such a good friend to me.

47
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,180
You always do what I say,

48
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,180
in business and life.

49
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,020
The lost shipment,

50
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,820
today's party disaster, all of it.

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,820
I'm so worried about you.

52
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,780
You did this

53
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,460
on purpose, right?

54
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,060
Liu Rumeng,

55
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,260
our opium

56
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,460
is in your hands, right?

57
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,820
What?

58
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,740
The Wangs were secretly

59
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,820
transporting opium?

60
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,660
Scared?

61
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,660
Without you,

62
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,940
we wouldn't need

63
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,380
investment from the Chamber

64
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,620
to cover the opium loss.

65
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,220
Hand over

66
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,060
the opium now.

67
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,980
Or I'll

68
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,420
burn the Paramount down.

69
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,860
Don't cross the Wang family.

70
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,260
I never thought

71
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,420
you could be so vile!

72
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,260
Aren't you afraid of karma?

73
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,620
Karma?

74
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,620
Where is it?

75
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,260
I don't see it!

76
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,460
You're not the first ghost

77
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,820
our Wangs have made!

78
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,460
Miss Wang is a murderer!

79
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,580
Stop filming!

80
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,860
Stop!

81
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,620
I'll kill you all!

82
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,340
Enough!

83
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,180
Dad.

84
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,020
I can let her go.

85
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,820
But you cover the debt.

86
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,660
Yes, yes!

87
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,820
I have one last opium batch.

88
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,940
Just grant me dock access,

89
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,700
and I'll repay you, I swear!

90
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,300
Be smart. No next time.

91
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,700
Dad!

92
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,700
What is it?

93
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,940
Speak! What happened?

94
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,260
We...

95
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,820
We're expelled from the Chamber.

96
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,860
And...

97
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,420
No dock will take our goods.

98
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,780
You dare face me?

99
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,820
Don't you know

100
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,660
why we're in this mess?

101
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
I told you explicitly

102
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,500
to keep our business secret!

103
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,660
But you just wouldn't listen!

104
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,820
You ignored my words!

105
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,140
If I hadn't stopped you,

106
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,700
would you have

107
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,860
blabbed about my past, too?

108
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,700
You'll be the death of me!

109
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,580
No!

110
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,660
It wasn't me, Dad!

111
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,700
It's Liu Rumeng! All her doing!

112
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,260
Liu Rumeng! Liu Rumeng!

113
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,660
She played you for a fool!

114
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,100
If you had half her wits,

115
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,460
you wouldn't be...

116
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,700
Get out!

117
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,380
Liu Rumeng.

118
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,900
You came alone.

119
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,660
Aren't you afraid?

120
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,900
I've done nothing wrong.

121
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,060
Why should I be afraid?

122
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,140
Good.

123
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,980
You have some nerve.

124
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,100
Now give me one reason

125
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,820
not to kill you.

126
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,220
There's a misunderstanding between us.

127
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,300
What misunderstanding?

128
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,380
Miss Wang's effort to fix business flaws

129
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,660
were found by the Marshal.

130
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,220
I tried to help fix it,

131
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,700
which made her jealous.

132
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,820
That caused all this.

133
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,060
I overstepped.

134
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,500
So I came here

135
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,620
to apologize.

136
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,660
Apologize?

137
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,060
Besides the Paramount,

138
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,260
I own a dock in Song City.

139
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,460
How did you know

140
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,260
I need a dock right now?

141
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,020
This is all I own.

142
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,420
I'll pay any price

143
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,460
for a chance to live.

144
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,460
I have a shipment.

145
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,460
I'll use your dock.

146
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,460
And you'll oversee it personally,

147
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,260
and bring it back intact.

148
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,380
That is your final chance.

149
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,500
Deal.

150
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,660
Liu Rumeng, I will make you pay.
