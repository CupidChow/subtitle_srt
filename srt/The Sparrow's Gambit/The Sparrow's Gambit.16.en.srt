[Episode 16]

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,900
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,660
I've been in the hospital
the whole time.

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,980
Why are you slandering me?

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,420
Lin Qingyi!

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,980
I am Qingmao.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,420
I've come back.

17
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,140
Lin Qingyi?

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,260
More than ten years ago,

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,100
Mr. Wang framed the Lin family

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,020
for opium trafficking.

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,860
I knew nothing about it.

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,580
I won't help you commit perjury.

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,180
Framed?

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,020
The Lin family?

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,700
Miss Liu, are you referring

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,740
to the former Chamber
of Commerce President, Mr. Lin,

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,540
who was once
Song City's leading philanthropist?

28
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,620
Rumors said the Lin family

29
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,460
resisted arrest for opium trafficking

30
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,820
and set a fire, committing suicide,

31
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,020
killing all thirteen members.

32
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,180
It seems there's more to the story now.

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,380
I know the story.

34
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,180
A great fire destroyed the Lin family
back then.

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,780
The police rushed to close the case
without evidence.

36
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,060
Soon after,

37
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,140
a butler named Wang
from the Lin household,

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,260
using a letter from President Lin
as proof,

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,180
took over
all the Lin family's businesses.

40
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,860
This butler named Wang

41
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,660
couldn't be you, could it, Mr. Wang?

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,180
So it was him all along!

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,300
How despicable!

44
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,500
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,140
It was not me.

46
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,660
All of this

47
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,380
is a lie she fabricated to frame me.

48
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,060
Since you are ruthless,

49
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,220
don't expect loyalty from me.

50
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,220
Who between us is really lying,

51
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
Butler Wang?

52
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,180
The year I turned seven,

53
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,180
you started trafficking opium.

54
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,460
Back then, to help you make money,

55
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,940
I would pour basin after basin

56
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,380
of cold water over myself

57
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,820
until I made myself sick.

58
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,660
That way,

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,740
you could use the excuse
of buying medicine

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,940
to traffic opium.

61
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Shut up!

62
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,260
Nonsense!

63
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,300
Mr. Wang,

64
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,740
why not hear the rest?

65
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,740
The year I turned ten,

66
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,220
you were caught.

67
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,820
They urged you to turn yourself in,

68
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,540
but you set a fire

69
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,580
that burned the entire Lin family.

70
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,780
Then you raised their daughter

71
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,940
to be your own executioner.

72
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,860
You are evil to the core!

73
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,780
Wang Wan'er!

74
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,620
You're spewing lies!

75
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,020
Liu Rumeng, that you are Lin Qingyi

76
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,340
doesn't surprise me in the least.

77
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,140
I have no regrets.

78
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,860
I'd rather die than become a ghost
under your command.

79
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,580
I still have more revelations.

80
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,820
Back then, Wang Penghui and...

81
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,940
Put the gun down!

82
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,260
It wasn't me!

83
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,660
How can you still deny it at this point?

84
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,540
What a show, father
and daughter turning on each other!

85
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,380
Just one woman reduced you to this?

86
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,780
What woman?

87
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,580
The Lin family... That Lin family girl?

88
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,980
Lin Qingyi?

89
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,740
I told you to kill her back then.

90
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,020
I did kill her!

91
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,380
But... but... who knew...

92
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,660
You've brought this on yourself.

93
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,780
Find a way to get me out.

94
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,180
I'll settle this with her myself.

95
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,660
You know.

96
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,420
I never give a second chance.

97
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,020
I still have opium!

98
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,340
I still have opium!

99
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,860
In the warehouse!

100
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,020
I can still be useful to you!

101
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,340
It's over.

102
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,460
It's not over yet.

103
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,740
Liu Rumeng.

104
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,460
Wang Wan'er was shot from a distance.

105
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,420
It wasn't done by Wang Penghui.

106
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,460
Traces of Qingmao's weapon

107
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,620
were found on the injured officers
at the scene.

108
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,820
Some witnesses confirm

109
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,700
that Hua, from The Paramount,
appeared at the dock

110
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,220
under the identity of Qingmao.

111
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,380
She needs to be arrested
for questioning.

112
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,780
But she's missing now.

113
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,060
Please cooperate with our investigation.

114
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,860
Hua, you must leave Song City.

115
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,940
I can't lose you.

116
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,740
I know.

117
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,540
If I stay,

118
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
I'll become a weapon
they can use against you.

119
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,180
Meng has loved dumplings
since she was a child.

120
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,060
I'm afraid that after I leave,

121
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,180
no one will be left
to make them for her.

122
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,420
So, Wenbin, you need to learn properly,

123
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,660
so you can take care of her for me
in the future.

124
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,540
Hua, don't worry.

125
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,740
I will definitely take good care of her.

126
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,940
Here, Wenbin,

127
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,420
learn how.

128
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,540
Okay.

129
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,420
Rumeng, besides vengeance,

130
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,180
you must live a good life too.

131
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,620
Let go!

132
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,780
Let go!

133
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,540
I have Hua.

134
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,100
If Qingmao doesn't turn herself in
within three days...

135
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,780
I'm going to the police station!

136
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,100
No! It's too dangerous for you
to go alone now!

137
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,740
I can't let Hua die in my place.

138
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,420
I'll say this one last time.

139
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,220
As long as you go to the police

140
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,980
and expose Liu Rumeng as Qingmao,

141
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,540
the true culprit who killed Wang Wan'er,

142
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,140
I can let you live.

143
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,300
Moreover,

144
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,180
I can guarantee you

145
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,820
a life of wealth and luxury
for the rest of your days.

146
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,260
If you refuse,

147
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,020
I won't beat you anymore.

148
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,740
But my men here

149
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,140
haven't had any fun in quite a while.

150
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,900
So?

151
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,380
Do you agree or not?

152
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,980
Not bad looking.

153
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,060
Come here.

154
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,460
Let go!

155
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,620
Come on, chick.

156
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,580
Let go!

157
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,660
I'll do it.
