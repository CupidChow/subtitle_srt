I have a new friend to introduce.

00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,300
This is...

00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,580

Seeing is believing.

18
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,300
So you already knew Miss Liu.

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,140
Miss Liu,

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,820
since you're Wan'er's friend,

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,260

00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,620
the three of us

23
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,100
shall join Mr. Li for a fine game.

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,820
How about it?

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,860
A pleasure.

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:26,980
Very well.

27
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,500
Come, please sit.

28
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,500
Miss Liu, please.

29

Excuse me.

Mr. Li,

Blycher Hotel isn't ours.

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,980
No real effect.

56
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,260
That depends on your father's choice.

57

99
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,180
where did it come from?

100
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,420
This formula

101
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,660
was tucked

102
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,820
in a book

103
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,420
I bought overseas.

104

make a bottle

106
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,620

I like the scent.

Indeed.

Having Rumeng come today

113
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,580
was a happy accident.

114
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,740
It shows you and the scent

115
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,580

Every scar on me

154
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,780

Can't let him ruin my plan.

She, a singer's daughter,

I've seen it.

180
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,100
