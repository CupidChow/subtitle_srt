1
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,108
Mauricia!

2
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,937
Hey, be careful with that.

3
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,231
Pack it away properly.
We can use it next year.

4
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,068
Huh? Take a look at poor Rudolf,

5
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,445
already hunchbacked
from pulling the sleigh.

6
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,740
And these Christmas lights,
they don't even twinkle anymore.

7
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,867
Hey. Check this out.

8
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,411
Santa's losing all his hair.

9
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,915
Oh no, don't do that.
We'll need him for next Christmas.

10
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,125
Let's just clean him up
and add some more hair.

11
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,376
No one will notice.

12
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,213
This has been
the most exhausting Christmas ever.

13
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,591
Then before you know it,
it'll be Valentine's Day.

14
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,844
Christmas is our peak season.

15
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,429
You should get used to it.

16
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,350
You do realize we're surrounded
by competitors on every floor?

17
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,644
So, we should be thankful.

18
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,313
-Gigi! Vicky!
-Yeah?

19
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,690
Hello? The clock's ticking. We open soon.

20
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,569
Here. Just change the Christmas decoration
to Valentine's decoration.

21
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,073
You're moving so slow that at this rate
the Easter Bunny might catch up with you.

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,659
-Yes, sir.
-Come on, double time.

23
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:01,246
Hey, I have quick announcement
before we open, okay?

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,123
What kind of announcement?

25
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:07,627
I am happy to announce that this weekend,
although it's a little late,

26
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,173
we're finally having our Christmas party!

27
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,424
Clap your hands!

28
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,928
Yeah!

29
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,557
At last, we can celebrate
the birth of Jesus.

30
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,560
Now we only have a few weeks before Lent.

31
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,436
Shh, keep it down. He might hear.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,438
Yes, Gigi? You were saying?

33
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,356
Nothing, sir.

34
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,942
Oh, by the way,
you'll be the one in charge

35
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,361
of everything we need
for the Christmas party. Yes?

36
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,447
Sure, sir. Challenge accepted, sir.

37
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,907
Clap your hands!

38
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,288
And by the way,
the party is going to be a potluck.

39
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,499
-What? What's a potluck?
-Come on. That's not fair.

40
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,294
Hey! Clap your hands!

41
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,714
Good!

42
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,054
Hey, Gi!

43
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,557
We won't have enough servers later.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,143
You'll need to help on the floor
to speed up turnover.

45
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,770
But who will do my job as front of house?

46
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,480
You. Can't you do both?

47
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,108
Yes, I can do both.

48
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:17,572
Sir, perhaps it's time that you consider
the recommendations on my report.

49
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,450
-We really need additional staff because--
-Gigi!

50
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,287
We have a bottom line to meet monthly,
and hiring more people

51
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,415
means we're not meeting
our profitability target.

52
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,168
And as my assistant manager,

53
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,712
you should be the first person
who understands that.

54
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,214
That's right, sir.

55
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,507
Though according to my projections,
it looks okay if--

56
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,092
Welcome!

57
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,552
Come in!

58
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,971
-Come in, come in.
-The customer is king.

59
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,022
Annyeong haseyo! Welcome to SamgyupToSawa.

60
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:51,981
Table for three?

61
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,401
Annyeong haseyo! Welcome.

62
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,070
-Table for two?
-Yes, please.

63
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,738
Welcome!

64
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,492
The customer is king!

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,912
-Gigi!
-Yes, sir?

66
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,248
Table 11, bus out!

67
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,208
Eleven? All right.
I'll… I'll be right back.

68
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,418
Kamsahamnida!

69
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,004
Kamsahamnida!

70
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,261
Gigi!

71
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,887
-Sir?
-Hey.

72
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,891
Tomorrow I want to see the flowchart
for the Christmas party.

73
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,770
And regarding the potluck,
I want to know who's gonna bring what.

74
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,688
Got it.

75
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,647
And lastly,

76
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:38,236
can you guys add more hearts
and cupids to the decorations? All right?

77
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,153
Here.

78
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,698
Can I see them by tomorrow morning?

79
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,159
More cupids. More hearts.

80
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,371
More love, love, love!
And I mean a lot more.

81
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,539
Oh, the keys.

82
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,833
You're closing tonight.

83
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,209
Make sure it's done right.

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,794
Good night.

85
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,298
Hey, boy, wrap it up.

86
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,688
Take care.

87
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,525
Babe!

88
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,320
Babe, what took you so long?

89
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,864
Jingo asked me to do something.

90
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,866
I'll tell you about it later.
I'm starving.

91
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,494
Well, this isn't the first time.
Your boss is a piece of work.

92
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,831
This smells nice. You clean it?

93
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,292
Huh? It smells nice?

94
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,337
Unlike you. You smell like kimchi.

95
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,172
Jerk! Let's get outta here.

96
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,425
Yeah, yeah, just gimme a sec.

97
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,854
Okay.

98
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,940
You all right?

99
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,493
Babe, it's our song. You remember?

100
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,580
That song's seven years old now.

101
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,375
Can you believe it? Seven years together.

102
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,215
Hey babe.

103
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,510
Remember Niño and Leia
from our high school?

104
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,220
Yeah, are they dead?

105
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,474
So morbid. They got married. Here, look.

106
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,894
They really were meant for each other.

107
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,399
Whoa! Buknoy and Jingle.
You remember them?

108
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,818
They got married too?

109
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,236
No, they're both dead.

110
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,321
What? Are you serious?

111
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,199
I'm joking.
You're the one being so serious.

112
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,828
They're engaged. Imagine.

113
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,333
Babe, I think I know where
this conversation is going.

114
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,169
I wasn't implying anything. Stop it.

115
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,631
I keep telling you, I'm saving up.

116
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,593
When I'm promoted to senior accountant,

117
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:12,098
you and I will be the ones
our high school friends will gossip about.

118
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,484
Okay.

119
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,362
Okay, there you go.

120
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,241
Uh, babe!

121
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,534
Mm?

122
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,828
I'm working overtime
at the office tomorrow.

123
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,498
There's an audit,
so I won't be able to pick you up.

124
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,125
-Oh…
-Sorry.

125
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,293
It's fine.

126
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,880
What's another three hours
of my life wasted on commuting?

127
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,924
Don't be like that.
Come on, I said I'm sorry.

128
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,385
Hey, I'm just teasing.
Don't worry about it.

129
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,888
-Get outta here. Ride safe.
-All right. Really okay?

130
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,139
-Mm-hmm.
-Good.

131
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,475
-All right, good night.
-Good night.

132
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,893
Love you.

133
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,352
Babe!

134
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,437
-Mm?
-Love you.

135
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,814
Ah. Love you!

136
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,025
Bye!

137
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,535
-Hey.
-Hey, sis.

138
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,621
Did you get the text I sent you?

139
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,707
Yeah, about your tuition balance?

140
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,377
Mm, the registrar emailed.
They gave me a notice.

141
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,171
I know. I texted you back,

142
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,383
and said to ask mom for the payment.
Dad transferred her the money last week.

143
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,385
Mom told me to ask you for the money.

144
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,515
-Okay, where is she?
-In her room, making content.

145
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,351
Hello, hello, hello!

146
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,728
Add-to-carters! Here we go.

147
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,856
We're unboxing, how exciting.

148
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,653
How stunning is my new little bag? Look!

149
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,446
And fast delivery too.

150
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,616
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh, I just love it already.

151
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,117
Mm, so cute!

152
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,580
And you know, this will pair so well
with my OOTD tomorrow.

153
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,582
So stay tuned! Bye.

154
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,671
Darling, you're finally home.

155
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,049
Take a look at my latest purchase. Ooh.

156
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,009
Notice the impeccable stitching,

157
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,096
and smell, not fishy at all. Hm?

158
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,390
Doesn't it look Class A?

159
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,018
I wouldn't say Class A.
More like Class B, or even C.

160
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,812
Oh, don't be like that.

161
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,440
Did you take a look at the label?
Balenciagah.

162
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,025
They've added an 'H' at the end.

163
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,987
Hey, give it back.
No one will notice that.

164
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,238
-It's nice.
-Oh!

165
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,617
These shoes should be Jimmy Choo,
not Jimmy Chos.

166
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,371
And this watch is the worst.

167
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:44,041
It should be Bulgari,
but there's no 'I,' so it's just Bulgar.

168
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,127
Hey, don't get
your dirty hands all over it.

169
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,379
At least it's buy now, pay later.

170
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,465
Mom, why is Candy
asking me for money again?

171
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,552
Oh. Darling…

172
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,556
can you please cover it?
I'll pay you back later.

173
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,268
But didn't dad just send some money?
I'll message him.

174
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,478
Oh, don't do that. No, please.

175
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,524
Your Dad's working hard in Bahrain.
I don't want you disturbing him.

176
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,116
Hey!

177
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,161
-Is this the grand prize?
-Oh, cool!

178
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:25,416
Wow! We've got
a generous sponsor. Who's that from?

179
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,918
-It doesn't say, sir.
-Well, bring it in then!

180
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,337
-Okay.
-Quick!

181
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,546
Okay.

182
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,632
It's heavy.

183
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,467
-Easy, easy.
-Careful with that.

184
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,316
Vicky! Oh!

185
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,609
Clap your hands!

186
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,945
You are the winner
of one year's supply of kimchi

187
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,447
from our sponsor,

188
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,117
Go Dong Hae Food Industries!

189
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,329
Thank you, sir! Belated Merry Christmas.

190
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,290
You know this prize suits you very well.
You're both sour.

191
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,418
Now, for our grand prize!

192
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,087
Oh, put it here. Put it here.

193
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:16,175
This is from
our still-to-be confirmed sponsor.

194
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,677
I bet it's a washing machine.

195
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,137
-Oh, it's a mattress!
-Nah, it's a calendar.

196
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,889
Da, da, da, da!

197
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,850
And our grand prize winner is…

198
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,268
Hey, hey!

199
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,773
Mm. Gigi, you won.

200
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,359
-Whoa, go Gigi.
-Oh!

201
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,986
You're so lucky, Ms. Gi!

202
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,072
Congratulations, Gi!

203
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,449
Thank you sir. Belated Happy New Year.

204
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,035
Well, open it. Might be a mattress.

205
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,208
-Oh!
-Wow!

206
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,669
-Check it out.
-Ooh.

207
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,837
Nice.

208
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,839
Congrats, sis!

209
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,467
And if you don't want it, I really don't
mind taking it off your hands.

210
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,011
I'll just pay you
every payday for 20 years.

211
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,430
No way.

212
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,973
Don't be like that.

213
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,474
Let's just exchange gifts.

214
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,560
I'll give you my kimchi.

215
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,562
-Come on, let's take a pic.
-Okay. Okay.

216
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,273
Look. One, two, three!

217
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,274
One more.

218
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,697
That thing's huge.

219
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,198
How will it fit on my bike?

220
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,492
You'll figure it out.

221
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,493
Will I?

222
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,748
You know where it will fit?

223
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,917
My studio.

224
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,211
Come on, I never get this lucky.

225
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,380
But it's for both of us, right?

226
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,217
So we can Netflix and chill. Mm?

227
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,511
Would you stop trying it on? It's mine.

228
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,554
Why not?

229
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,432
This helmet does smell really good.

230
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,683
Babe, let's get outta here.

231
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,436
Just put the TV on your lap
and hold on tight.

232
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,229
And... don't let go.

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,170
Hi, Gigi.
To personalize your viewing experience,

234
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,631
kindly answer the following questions.

235
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,424
Please pick one.

236
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,552
Batman or Joker?

237
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,678
Batman.

238
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,388
Mara or Clara?

239
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,931
Mara, of course.

240
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,599
Sara or Ms. Minchin?

241
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,309
Mm, Sara.

242
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,228
King Kong or Godzilla?

243
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,605
Uh, King Kong, I guess.

244
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,358
Judas, Barabbas, or Gestas?

245
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,860
Gestas.

246
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,029
Are you happy with your life? Yes or no?

247
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,327
No answer means no.

248
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,288
Wait! I'm still thinking.

249
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,293
Oh.

250
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,212
"Law of the Oppressed."

251
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,631
"Law of the Oppressed highlights."

252
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,552
"Law of the Oppressed deleted scenes.
Law of the Oppressed reels."

253
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,013
It's all Law of the Oppressed.
Isn't there anything else?

254
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,472
LAW OF THE OPPRESSED

255
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:03,986
Law of the Oppressed

256
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,948
My destiny

257
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,952
Born from the soil

258
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,830
Change never comes

259
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,376
The Law of the Oppressed

260
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,088
A burden so heavy

261
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:28,802
Is this all
That I could ever hope for?

262
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,765
The Law of the Oppressed…

263
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,475
Who are these people?

264
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,602
There's not even anyone famous.

265
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:42,816
Law of the Oppressed

266
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,614
Papa!

267
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,492
-Mirinisa!
-Papa!

268
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,409
My daughter.

269
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,203
I've missed you, Papa!

270
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,414
I'm so happy you've returned
to our grand hacienda.

271
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,710
Oh! How your horses have missed you too.

272
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,838
They've been crying
for weeks in the stables.

273
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:10,344
Oh. By the way, let me introduce
your soon-to-be stepmother.

274
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,932
This is Mauricia.

275
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,768
And here is your soon-to-be stepsister.

276
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,271
Meet Mimi.

277
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,733
Ah. Hello to you both,

278
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,528
and welcome
to our extremely grand hacienda!

279
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,073
Oh! My dear horses.

280
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,660
Mauricia, Mimi,
I must depart for a moment.

281
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,954
-Sure.
-I'll just be at the stables.

282
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,456
I will leave the three of you for a while,

283
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,625
so you can get to know
each other better.

284
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,919
Go ahead, Pops!

285
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,469
So, you're Mirinisa.

286
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,017
Why did you slap me?

287
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,351
Oh!

288
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,022
What have I done to upset you?

289
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:03,981
Nothing.

290
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,609
I just wanted to introduce myself,
and leave my mark on you.

291
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,069
From now on,

292
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,282
we will reign as the new queens
of this grand hacienda!

293
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,617
-Do you understand?
-I understand.

294
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,579
And if you go squealing to your father,

295
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,832
then you'll get more than
just a slap on the cheek. Am I clear?

296
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,292
Clear, Ma'am.

297
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,922
What was that slap for?
I haven't done anything!

298
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,174
I felt like it.

299
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,384
Besides, three is my favorite number.

300
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,304
Be grateful it's not four or five or 46!

301
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,807
Anyway, Mimi, my seductive daughter,

302
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:44,813
shall we enter this very opulent hacienda
and find a few maids for us to bully?

303
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,068
Let's go, Mama!

304
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:56,617
Mirinisa, let me give you
some unsolicited but very valuable advice.

305
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,868
What is it?

306
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,870
Never stand in my way!

307
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,553
Oh, God. Isn't there
anything else to watch?

308
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,772
You must be Arnaldo.

309
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,190
I am, indeed.

310
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,944
Well, at least there's a cute guy.
Now I'm watching.

311
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,904
-Arnaldo?
-Mirinisa!

312
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,867
I'm here to give you these flowers.
Freshly picked wildflowers

313
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,828
from my grandmother's garden.

314
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,995
Mirinisa!

315
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:46,458
Here is a very, very, very long list

316
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,086
of all the chores you have to do today.

317
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,214
Start by cleaning the roof gutters,

318
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:57,302
then washing and ironing all the heavy
velvet curtains in every room.

319
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,972
Then, bathe the horses in the stables

320
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,350
and give them
world-class manicures and pedicures.

321
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,145
-Got that?
-Uh… all right.

322
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,188
-Well, what are you waiting for? Go!
-Oh! Oh!

323
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,275
Why does Mirinisa have to do all that?

324
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,278
You have a lot of maids here
in this grand mansion.

325
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,364
I like handsome men,

326
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,409
but I do not like handsome meddlers.

327
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,785
Who are you?

328
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,203
I am Arnaldo.

329
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,039
The sole grandson of Doña Auring,

330
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:30,002
who owns the enormous hacienda
over the hills yonder?

331
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,170
Yes, that's me.

332
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,088
Arnaldo.

333
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,467
You're a perfect match for Mimi,
my seductive daughter.

334
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,221
She's young, she's bouncy.
She's full of energy.

335
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,556
Show him what you've got.

336
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,892
Mm-hmm!

337
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,947
Ooh, ah.

338
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,157
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

339
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,909
That's my girl!

340
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,287
Mirinisa!

341
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,580
Yes, ma'am?

342
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,583
What have you done
to my expensive designer dress?

343
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,252
Please forgive me.
It got burned by the iron.

344
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,462
It was an accident!

345
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,172
Mama!

346
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,800
Look at what she's done
to my expensive designer dress!

347
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,302
You animal!

348
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,430
This is an expensive designer dress!

349
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,974
More expensive than your self-worth.

350
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:32,147
As punishment, you will scrub every inch
of that bathroom until it sparkles!

351
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,067
Señora, I really didn't mean to do it!

352
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,153
I promise to improve my ironing skills!

353
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,279
"Skills!"

354
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,490
-Filth belongs in filth! Get in!
-Señora! Señora!

355
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,825
And stay there!

356
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,997
Señorita! Señora!

357
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,718
Law of the Oppressed

358
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,061
I guess that's it.
We'll see you around, Gi.

359
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:15,065
Hey, once the restaurant gets back on
its feet, you'll be the first ones I call.

360
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,609
Thank you, Gi. That's kind of you.

361
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,238
-I'll see you, Gi.
-See ya.

362
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,538
Sir, is your decision
to fire them final? Maybe--

363
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,708
We need to cut costs, Gigi.
I had no choice.

364
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,960
But we're understaffed as it is.

365
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,921
That's why I thought
you could do double duty for a while.

366
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,173
You'll have to be a server
during peak hours.

367
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,384
But sir, I uh,

368
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,594
I'm here as the assistant manager.

369
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,433
I completed my degree
in hospitality management, with honors.

370
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,184
So I'm really not supposed
to be a waitress.

371
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,228
What do I care
if you graduated with honors?

372
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,938
Or if you're summa cum laude?

373
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,566
You don't really care
about this restaurant.

374
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,527
-No, that's not true.
-You're only thinking about yourself!

375
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,697
You don't know anything,
and you don't get to decide.

376
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,034
You still have a lot of kimchi to eat
before you become manager.

377
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,452
But, sir.

378
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,835
Betty!

379
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,045
Knock, knock!

380
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,465
We're wasting our time.
She's not even answering!

381
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,885
-Hey.
-Excuse me, can I help you?

382
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,137
Are you the daughter of Betty?

383
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,597
Why do you ask?

384
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,517
Well, we've been knocking for a while now,
but nobody seems to be home.

385
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,104
Could you please tell Betty
this is a gentle reminder?

386
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,648
She's way behind on her payments.

387
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:43,111
And instead flaunting her latest
spending spree on social media,

388
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,448
maybe she should
just pay her debts on time.

389
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,033
Tell her that, will you?

390
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,202
Boys?

391
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,168
Mom?

392
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,628
Mom!

393
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,172
Have they gone? Huh?

394
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,425
Who were they, Mom?

395
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,010
Um…

396
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,262
Well, they're debt collectors.

397
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,140
I missed a few payments.

398
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,393
How long have you had this debt?

399
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,437
Uh… I don't remember.

400
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,690
Maybe it's been… one year?

401
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,027
I'm calling Dad.

402
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,278
Oh darling, wait!

403
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,156
Please don't call your father.

404
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,327
Uh, I'll think of something,
I promise I'll fix this.

405
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,206
Just don't tell your dad anything,
I'm begging. Don't call him.

406
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,624
Please?

407
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,293
Yeah, all right.

408
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,254
It's okay. Don't be upset.

409
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,630
Thank you, my darling.

410
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,258
You know, you're so kind.

411
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,015
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-What the hell was that?

412
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,642
-Gigi!
-Oh here, here, here, let me help.

413
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,186
What a mess,
and look at all the food you wasted!

414
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,646
That's coming out of your pay!

415
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,065
It was an accident, sir. I'm sorry.

416
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,400
Well, quick, clean it up!

417
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,735
This is a tripping hazard
for our customers!

418
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,571
I'll do it, sir.

419
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,032
Gigi is better suited
to front of house anyway.

420
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,411
She's the assistant manager.
She's not a server.

421
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:18,331
I don't need your opinion, Vicky.
I need you to get a mop!

422
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,416
Sorry, sir.

423
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,126
Hey.

424
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,254
You better shape up.

425
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,385
Table 18! Hurry up!

426
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,600
She can't even carry a tray!

427
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,316
Hm.

428
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,829
-Hey, sis!
-Why does it stink outside?

429
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,082
Uh, Gi… I think Mom
should be the one to tell you.

430
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,626
Why? What happened?

431
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,629
Well, a courier arrived out front.

432
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,965
So, I opened the door expecting a package,

433
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,386
but to my shock, the courier
was actually one of the debt collectors.

434
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,387
They tricked me.

435
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,182
And they didn't just throw hurtful words.

436
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:21,228
They threw rotten eggs right in
my face and vandalized our house!

437
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,356
Why didn't you report it
to the authorities?

438
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,108
I didn't want to make it a big deal.

439
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,531
Darling, maybe you can help out your mom?

440
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,407
Why me?

441
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,452
Why don't you call Dad already?

442
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,663
Oh, I can't.

443
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,082
Can this stay between me and you?

444
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,585
Oh, he'd be so angry at me.

445
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:48,838
Darling,

446
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,550
help me out, please?

447
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,262
Just with a partial payment
on the interest.

448
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,848
I know that you've got some money saved.

449
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,018
Please, can you help your mommy, please?

450
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,189
How much do you need?

451
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,191
Fifty thousand.

452
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,735
Fifty thousand pesos?

453
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,306
Excuse me, can you follow that motorbike?

454
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,061
Okay.

455
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,356
-Abet! Oh, it's amazing!
-Nice.

456
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,655
-Wow, are we really eating here?
-Yeah, the food here's delicious.

457
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,573
Abet!

458
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,618
Who's she?

459
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,369
Gigi, wait, let me explain.

460
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,788
Let you explain?
Why were you giving her a ride?

461
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,206
Huh?

462
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,751
Uh, kee… keep it down.
Can we maybe not talk here?

463
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,546
Here?!

464
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,841
You're taking her out
for pizza, Abet? Pizza?

465
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,761
All this time you've never
taken me out for pizza!

466
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,929
And you should know that I love pizza!

467
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,222
Please calm down.

468
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,809
So is that what you were
saving up for, huh? To take her out?!

469
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,937
You don't have the balls
to break up with me? Is that it?

470
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,107
-Hey, Gi, wait! Just let me explain.
-Don't touch me! Don't.

471
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,819
So this…

472
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,697
This is the putrid stink on my helmet?

473
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,034
Smells like flowers! Move it!

474
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,244
Gigi, please listen to me. Gi!

475
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,125
-No, no, no.
-This is my helmet!

476
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,877
I paid for it! Let go!

477
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,172
Abet, come on.

478
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,965
Let's get a Pizza Marga-reta-rita!

479
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,634
Forget about her.

480
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,767
Idioto!

481
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,185
Stupid!

482
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,229
Dim-witted wench!

483
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,022
Uneducated!

484
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,774
-You're getting on my nerves!
-Mauricia!

485
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,444
Mimi! What are you doing
to my only daughter?

486
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,862
Oh, it's nothing, Papa.

487
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,408
Oh, darling, we are just playing
a little clapping game. See?

488
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,994
Mother, Father, I want bread

489
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,789
Sister, Brother, add some spread

490
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:31,167
All my words you must obey

491
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,753
Or a slap will come your way

492
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,463
One, two, three, four!

493
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,801
That hurt!

494
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,678
Sorry, Mama!

495
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,723
Quick, one more! Oh, sorry, sorry!

496
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,308
Mother, Father, I want…

497
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,477
Troublemaker!

498
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,563
Presumptuous hag!

499
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,648
Unpleasant witch!

500
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,358
-Mauricia!
-Aah…

501
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,486
Mimi! What are you doing
to my only daughter?

502
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,488
Oh, it's nothing, Papa!

503
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,285
Oh, we're just trying to give
Mirinisa a new look, Pops!

504
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,542
And this is our finished product.

505
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,670
Now, smile, or you won't get dinner!

506
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,009
You're nothing

507
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:26,765
but a third-rate, try-hard snotty rat!

508
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,061
Mauricia, Mimi!

509
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,647
What are you doing to my only daughter?

510
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,316
Oh, darling,

511
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,986
this is just a harmless drinking game.

512
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,156
It's your turn.

513
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,580
Oh, you missed!

514
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,165
That is not enough!

515
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,292
I would have dunked her
in a barrel of wine!

516
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,420
That's what you get
if you act weak and dumb!

517
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,924
Playing the victim!
You deserve that, girl.

518
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,011
At last, Gigi.

519
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,305
You've finally seen the light.

520
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,432
Don't be afraid.

521
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,100
I come in peace.

522
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,729
It's time for you to join us, Gigi.

523
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,276
Wait. Gigi!

524
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,362
Gigi!

525
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,200
Gigi, come back here!

526
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,993
Where are you going?

527
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,370
Gigi! Just wait--

528
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,457
Oh, well. You'll be back.

529
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,384
Kamsahamnida.

530
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,261
Law of the Oppressed?

531
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,097
If it exists, I've never heard of it.

532
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,265
It exists.

533
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,100
Who's it got in it?

534
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:56,145
I don't know. No one famous.
Maybe they're indie or theater actors.

535
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,231
But I'm serious. The villain talked to me.

536
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:01,568
She said my name. She looked right at me!
She knows me.

537
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,029
Mm, Gi, seems like
your TV may just be possessed.

538
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,366
If you're scared, you could give it to me.

539
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,788
Hey, Gigi, Vicky!
What's going on out here?

540
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,583
Get inside.
Table 14 is waiting to be served.

541
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,418
Yet, here you are yapping away!

542
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,046
I see you, Vicky!
Throwing the team off their game.

543
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,507
And you, Gigi!

544
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,136
Go calm the customers down
before they turn into cannibals!

545
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,227
Huh?

546
00:31:54,871 --> 00:32:00,251
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

547
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,100
Babe, happy Valentine's.

548
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,186
Oh, babe!

549
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,647
You are so sweet!
I have a gift for you too!

550
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,649
I got you something else really special.

551
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,091
Mirinisa!

552
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,468
Señorita?

553
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,561
What is it, Señorita Mimi?

554
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,605
Get me a freshly squeezed orange juice.

555
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,065
And you better make it quick!

556
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,859
Of course.

557
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,580
Mirinisa!

558
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,207
What is it, Señora Mauricia?

559
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:07,587
Make your father drink this,
so he gets strong.

560
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,548
-Did you hear me?
-Yes, yes, ma'am.

561
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,550
-Do it now!
-Okay, okay.

562
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,103
Mirinisa!

563
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,237
Could you be any slower?
I've been waiting.

564
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,489
Give me that!

565
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,074
Please forgive me.

566
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,502
Papa.

567
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,422
Drink this so that you can
regain your strength.

568
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,725
Ah.

569
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,379
Mama!

570
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,881
-Mimi?
-Mama!

571
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,805
Mimi?

572
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,599
Mimi?

573
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,895
Mimi? Is that you?

574
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,315
Mimi! My daughter!

575
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,944
My seductive daughter!

576
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,947
Mimi!

577
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,574
Mimi.

578
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,536
What have you done to my daughter?

579
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,625
Mimi!

580
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,799
Oh!

581
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,178
Oh, Mimi!

582
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,099
Oh, my seductive daughter!

583
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,810
I will miss you.

584
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,731
And I promise on your grave,

585
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:35,484
that I will stop at nothing,
until I am the owner

586
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:41,490
of Arnulfo's grand mansion
and vast, exquisite hacienda.

587
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,953
Vengeance will be mine!

588
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,915
I will avenge you, with the help of…

589
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,002
Gigi!

590
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,051
Me?

591
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,552
Why me?

592
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,678
Well, why not?

593
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,599
Now is the time
to accept your true power, Gigi.

594
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:10,394
Allow me to help you unlock
your full potential.

595
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,064
Lean on me. Trust me.

596
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,608
What have you got to lose?

597
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:54,272
Welcome to our world. The Teleserye World!

598
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,857
The world of soap opera.

599
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:00,444
I'm so excited for you.
You won't regret this.

600
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,823
You and me, we are going to be a team.

601
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,204
-Oh.
-Mmm.

602
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,040
Oh.

603
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,678
How do you like it so far?

604
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,596
The view is perfect.

605
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,974
These houses are unreal.

606
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,769
And the sunset? Ah, so gorgeous.

607
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,980
I want to take pictures of everything.

608
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,817
There are no bad angles in this world.

609
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,988
Every corner here is ready for a take,
ready for action.

610
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,283
Our world thrives on drama.

611
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,535
And there is no drama without conflict.

612
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,330
And there is no conflict
without good versus evil.

613
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,374
Light versus darkness.
Hero versus villain.

614
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,419
Those are the only two things
that matter to us.

615
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,588
Heroes and villains.

616
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,632
And I knew right away
which side you belong to.

617
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,937
Honk your horn at them!

618
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,191
Again!

619
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,985
-Move it!
-How about them?

620
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,445
Are they heroes or villains?

621
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,614
They're extras.

622
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,699
They do not belong to any side.

623
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,910
They are a part of this world

624
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,622
to make the scenes become
more credible, more believable.

625
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,458
Townsfolk and such, you know.

626
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,543
For more texture and context.

627
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:46,342
They're the ones who failed
to become a hero or a villain.

628
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,720
So now they're lucky
to be a part of the scene,

629
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,597
in the background.

630
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,308
Passing by and… doing things.

631
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,436
Sometimes they have lines, but…

632
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,604
…enough about them.

633
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,524
The most important thing in this world

634
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:05,444
is we always please The Sponsor.

635
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,696
"The Sponsor"?

636
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,659
As long as the forces
between heroes and villains are balanced,

637
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,536
The Sponsor is happy.

638
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,955
And if The Sponsor is happy,

639
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,832
the storylines get extended,

640
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:22,336
the show will go on,
as will our existence.

641
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,465
You'll get more of an understanding
as we go along.

642
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,926
But, first things first.

643
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,303
You need to enroll.

644
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,498
Welcome to the Kontrabida Academy.

645
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,294
Where you can become
a full-blown leading villain.

646
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,338
Our school motto is

647
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,884
"there can be no hero without a villain."

648
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,029
Who are they?

649
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,323
They are the founders of this school.

650
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,742
Impressive, isn't it?

651
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:42,249
I graduated with flying honors,
summa cum laude,

652
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,503
Bachelor of Science
in interdisciplinary bullying.

653
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:50,132
Major in diva behavioral science,
and minor in character assassination.

654
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,384
Such a high achiever.

655
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,846
I have a master's degree
in revenge studies.

656
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,932
Right now, I'm finishing my doctorate.

657
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,601
-Guess what my dissertation is?
-What?

658
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,312
The art of social climbing
in the digital age

659
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:07,024
or how to fake it online
until your friends die of envy.

660
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:12,029
Actually, I was scheduled for my defense,
but I got busy with taping the show.

661
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,949
Oh, by the way,

662
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:20,246
outstanding alumna of every year
since graduation.

663
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:25,209
And it's also worth mentioning
that I am seated on the board of trustees

664
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:29,922
as head bitch slash debater
slash demoness.

665
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,216
You're so hardworking.

666
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,636
I don't mean to brag,
but what I'm trying to say is this.

667
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,765
You are in good and capable hands.

668
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,774
Class, furrow your eyebrows.

669
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,902
Closer! Closer.

670
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,905
You should always sneer to the right!

671
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:59,159
And slowly point your lips forward!

672
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,620
Wide eyes!

673
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,205
Wider!

674
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,916
Chin up! Higher!

675
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,335
Good! Good.

676
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,463
That will be
your default facial expression

677
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,341
even when no one's around! Understood?

678
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,884
Yes, sir!

679
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,011
Good.

680
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,263
Children. Prepare.

681
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,057
"Your mom." Go!

682
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,560
Your mom has no money.

683
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,687
Your mom has even less money.

684
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,938
Your mom's blue.

685
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,231
Your mom's pink.

686
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,568
Your mom eats pigeons for breakfast.

687
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,321
Your mom's a skank. And she eats pigeons.

688
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,698
Very bad, children.

689
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,075
I love it!

690
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,038
Aren't they cute?

691
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,414
Like all other schools,

692
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,542
we have grade levels,
a distinguished faculty of teachers,

693
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,379
and most importantly,
a purposeful curriculum to be followed.

694
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,923
Three, four, and slap!

695
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,009
Yes, another slap!

696
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,761
And slap!

697
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,096
Hold it.

698
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,682
I said slap. You slap!

699
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,476
You hit, hit the mark!

700
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,727
And slap.

701
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,396
Ms. Mauricia, I don't think
I can handle it.

702
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,648
Yes, you can.

703
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,358
I believe in you.

704
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,985
If you complete your studies here,

705
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,571
your life will change for the better.

706
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,032
In fact, after graduation,

707
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,577
there will be a role waiting for you,
in Law of the Oppressed.

708
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,746
For me?

709
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,083
You will be my recommendation
to replace Mimi.

710
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,252
You know, my seductive
but dearly departed daughter?

711
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,213
But why me?

712
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,466
To be honest, this is all experimental.

713
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,261
This is our first time outsourcing
talent from the human world.

714
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,931
All the things you're going through

715
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,559
with your job, your family,
and your love life…

716
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,355
I can sense your blood boiling within you.

717
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,193
You're a time bomb
that could explode any moment.

718
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,738
Your unexpressed rage.

719
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,657
If you channel it the right way,

720
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:07,287
we'll make you the finest villain
my world and your world have ever seen.

721
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,792
I know how unhappy you are.

722
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,878
You owe it to yourself to be happy.

723
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,214
It's about time you put yourself first!

724
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,590
Okay?

725
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,927
If you agree,

726
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,971
please sign here.

727
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,890
I… uh, can I just read it first?

728
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,559
Don't you trust me?

729
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,069
Welcome to your villain era.

730
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,739
Let's go.

731
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,636
What is history?

732
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:06,930
Yes?

733
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:11,727
History is the study of past events,
particularly in human affairs.

734
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,481
Mm. That is a textbook
description of history.

735
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:20,652
Now, here at the Kontrabida Academy,
history is all about what?

736
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,070
Anybody?

737
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,491
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!

738
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,035
Oh, my God. Mauricia!

739
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,537
My former student.

740
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,415
Let's see if you still remember. Come.

741
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:41,590
Here at Kontrabida Academy,
history is all about digging dirt.

742
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,592
Very good!

743
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,761
Elaborate.

744
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,890
Dig up dirt on the person
you want to get revenge on,

745
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:55,145
like their dating history, family history,
even their browser history.

746
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,857
Dig deep. Dig thoroughly.

747
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:04,279
Search for the all the weaknesses
and dirty laundry of your target.

748
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,742
The more scandalous it is, the better.

749
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,119
Take all the information you gather,

750
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:15,082
and use it as leverage
to render them powerless against you.

751
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:19,169
Bring them to their knees
and make them beg for mercy.

752
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:23,799
And don't stop until they are… Ma'am?

753
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:24,800
History.

754
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,751
I've got you, Jingo.

755
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,884
Here at the Kontrabida Academy,

756
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:11,263
art is not a sculpture nor a painting.

757
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,057
The art we refer to is you.

758
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:21,064
It is all about finding and creating
your look as a unique leading villain.

759
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,692
The most intimidating outfit,

760
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,611
the most alienating hairstyle,

761
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,447
and the most expressive eyebrow contour.

762
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,532
It is all about a look

763
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,494
that attracts attention, demands respect,

764
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:39,458
while instilling fear
in whomever you come into contact with.

765
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,002
You're all in for a treat today

766
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,172
because we'll be having a makeover session

767
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,425
for one of you.

768
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,218
Any volunteers?

769
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,054
Gigi. Step forward.

770
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:57,601
Gigi. Ugh! Oh.

771
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:02,981
That name sounds like a child's

772
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,775
or a best friend.

773
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,903
It does not sound like a main character.

774
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,614
All the best villains

775
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:15,661
have names ending in "ah."

776
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,162
Lavini-ah!

777
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,915
Selen-ah!

778
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,626
Claudi-ah.

779
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,545
Ah.

780
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,799
So are we changing my name then?

781
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:32,344
I have a brilliant ide-ah.

782
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,609
Wow. Gigi, is that you?

783
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,653
The name…

784
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,614
is Gia.

785
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,075
Seriously, what's going on?

786
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,504
Surprise.

787
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,007
And what have you done to your uniform?

788
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,384
That's against company policy.

789
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,511
Speaking of company policy,

790
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,097
you have another surprise coming.

791
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:04,436
Presenting the owners of SamgyupToSawa

792
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,230
and a couple of law enforcers for backup.

793
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,111
Well, clap your hands.

794
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,991
Ma'am, sir, may I ask
what brings you here?

795
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,952
We found out why this SamgyupToSawa branch

796
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,621
is always in the red.

797
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,917
Seems like you've been running
an operation of your own. Hm?

798
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,671
I checked the books

799
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,468
and crossmatched them with the order slips
for pork belly and kimchi.

800
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,680
All of your entries are overpriced.

801
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:48,897
Have you been taking advantage
of someone else's business?

802
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,570
And now we've seen all the discrepancies.

803
00:51:56,238 --> 00:52:00,700
I didn't just graduate with honors.
I also minored in accounting.

804
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,121
Go for the kill, Gia.

805
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,956
Time to drop that bomb!

806
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,129
And here…

807
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:17,384
Here is the proof
of where you've been spending

808
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,470
all the money you've been stealing
from this restaurant.

809
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,350
That's why even if you go home early,

810
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:29,688
you stink to high heaven
when you come to work in the morning.

811
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,817
In fact, you smell even worse than kimchi,

812
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,071
because you've been spending
all night at the casino.

813
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,034
I think you better clear out
your personal belongings right now,

814
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,953
because you're never coming back.

815
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,332
Officers, take away
this thief immediately,

816
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,959
and don't let him out of your sight.

817
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,170
-God knows what else he might steal.
-Wait, please!

818
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,173
Wait, let go of me!

819
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,301
You traitor!
After what I have done for you!

820
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,180
Confrontation mode on highest level!

821
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,100
What you have done for me?

822
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,979
The only thing you've ever done
is push me around,

823
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:15,901
belittle me, and treat me
like I was a complete idiot.

824
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,239
So, take a good look at this face.

825
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,201
Because this is the face

826
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,370
of the new manager of this restaurant!

827
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,164
Let go of me!

828
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,583
You're going to pay for this, Gigi!

829
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,126
You'll pay for this!

830
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,295
For the last time…

831
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,548
it's Gia.

832
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,177
-Just cooperate.
-Wait! Ma'am, sir, help.

833
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,887
Wait, let go of me!

834
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,227
Clap your hands.

835
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:55,607
Gia, Gia, Gia, Gia, Gia, Gia, Gia, Gia!

836
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,278
You taught her well, Mauricia.

837
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,739
I love her already.

838
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,741
Let's drink to that!

839
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:05,992
Of course.

840
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,457
Words have power.

841
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,584
Words can hurt.

842
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,171
Words can scar you for life.

843
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:23,385
That's why it's important
to expand your existing vocabulary.

844
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:28,765
So that you can deliver
the perfect, bitchiest one-liner.

845
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,685
Yes! It's time to master

846
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:36,398
the art of full-on confrontational
dog show insults.

847
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,191
Gia, step forward.

848
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:46,366
Destroy them just by using words.

849
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:52,163
Remember the three points
to perfect an insult.

850
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,000
Insult one's loneliness. Go!

851
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,921
You must be so lonely!

852
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:03,967
No love life, no social life.
Even your family doesn't like you.

853
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,218
And guess what?

854
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,219
Nobody cares.

855
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:13,351
Insult one's poorness. Go!

856
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,898
You're so poor,

857
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:22,610
you want to go to Boracay,
but can only afford Dolomite beach.

858
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:30,869
And when all else fails,
insult one's ugliness.

859
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,168
You were gorgeous until I saw your face.

860
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:45,133
Brava, Gia. Brava! Brava!

861
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,931
Here at the Kontrabida Academy,

862
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:57,103
math is all about
exacting calculated vengeance.

863
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:01,983
If x is equal to hate
raised to the power of y,

864
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,986
and y is equal to deceit

865
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,739
divided by the square root of z,

866
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:11,493
and z is equal
to the level of gullibility,

867
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,329
the result is equal to?

868
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:19,000
The result is equal to foolproof control
of the situation through gaslighting.

869
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,418
Very good.

870
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:26,674
If A is equal to doubt,
and B is equal to suspicion,

871
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,762
what is the product of A times B squared?

872
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:34,974
The result is perfect opportunity
for brainwashing.

873
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,726
Correct.

874
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:41,356
Now, if x is equal to an old, rich man
on the brink of death,

875
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:44,526
and y is the sum of all his assets,

876
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:48,780
and z is x's total love and trust for you,

877
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,827
put x, y, and z together.
What do you get, Gia?

878
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,788
You get everything.

879
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,706
I am so impressed.

880
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,504
Were these all your credit cards, Mother?

881
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,132
Yes.

882
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,092
Don't you lie to me.

883
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,636
I swear, that's all!

884
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,097
I just use them alternately.

885
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,726
We already know your modus operandi.

886
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,605
Now cut them up.

887
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,692
I said cut them up!

888
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,572
Uh, but if I do that,
then what will I use?

889
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:33,324
If you don't cut them up,

890
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,869
then the three of us
will disown you as our mother!

891
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,466
Gia, proceed to Phase 2.

892
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,719
Apply everything you have learned.

893
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,980
Travis, hand me Mother's phone.

894
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:09,402
Candy, our mother's password, please.

895
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:17,243
You will record a video
to send to Daddy in Bahrain.

896
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,828
And why would I do that?

897
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:19,746
Oh.

898
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,665
Because if you don't do it,

899
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,168
then we will do it.

900
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:31,966
And we will reveal everything you've done
with the money meant for our family.

901
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:37,096
You will own up to every single mistake.

902
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:42,644
And you will promise to sell
all of the stupid stuff that you bought.

903
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,690
And finally, and most importantly,

904
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:54,697
you will transfer, to my account,
every remittance that Daddy sends,

905
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,283
month after month after month.

906
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,660
Are you serious?

907
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,371
What, you're giving me orders now?

908
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,707
Maybe you three are forgetting
that you are my children!

909
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,295
Don't give in to emotional blackmail!

910
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,257
Mean what you say, Gia!

911
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:20,974
Your children, whom you have drowned
in debt and shame!

912
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,810
If you don't do this,

913
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,771
consider yourself no longer our mother!

914
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,731
Do you understand me?

915
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,404
Are you ready?

916
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,574
Are you ready?

917
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,326
I'm ready. Ready. I'm ready now.

918
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:42,829
Action.

919
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,624
Hi, honey.

920
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,588
Uh, honey, I have something to tell you.

921
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:07,562
Not to brag to you all,
but, uh… I am the greatest coach

922
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,106
this school has ever had.

923
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:14,027
Now, Mauricia.
Do you know why her slap is so good?

924
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,988
Because I taught it to her.

925
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,243
True. I learned from the best.

926
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,120
-That's right.
-Let me demonstrate.

927
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,246
Sure!

928
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,665
This is the Fake-out.

929
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,545
Ow, that hurts! But…

930
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,006
very good!

931
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,177
And this is the Double Dutch.

932
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,349
Okay!

933
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,225
That's Olympic level.

934
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:50,021
That slap has the power
to render the hero comatose.

935
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:51,814
And my particular favorite.

936
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:57,278
This next one is the slap that would
cause the hero temporary amnesia.

937
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:01,240
This is one, two, three, punch, slap!

938
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:11,584
-Uh, Coach, are you all right?
-Huh?

939
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:12,919
Who's that?

940
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,004
Where am I?

941
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,889
In this class, I will teach you
which substances

942
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,600
you should splash on the hero's body

943
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,519
for minimum effort

944
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,729
and maximum effect.

945
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,024
Mauricia!

946
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,068
Ma'am? Come here.

947
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,153
Are you sure, ma'am?

948
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:42,115
Of course. Come on, join me.

949
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,952
I'm curious if you still remember
everything I've taught you.

950
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:50,456
Class, if the drink is red wine…

951
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,627
Target the eyes.

952
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,881
But if it's water…

953
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:03,970
Straight up the nose.

954
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:10,393
C-Coffee, tea, or hot choco--

955
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,772
Oh… Oh, God.

956
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,567
Zero in on the outfit
for guaranteed stains!

957
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,987
Did you… Did you get that?

958
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:21,946
Very good.

959
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,741
Now, I'm going to teach you all

960
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:28,578
the proper technique for smashing
a cake into the hero's face.

961
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,664
-Let me assist you.
-No, no. That's okay, I got it. It's okay.

962
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,124
-I can help you.
-No, no. It's okay.

963
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,460
-I can demonstrate.
-No, I said it's okay, Mauricia!

964
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,086
-Let me show you.
-No, stay away from me!

965
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,923
-No! Get away from me! Damn it!
-But I… But I want to help!

966
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,259
-No. I already told you!
-I'm helping!

967
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,735
The pizza here is delicious!

968
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:15,750
Gigi?

969
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,460
Is that you?

970
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,504
Why?

971
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,422
Do you like what you see?

972
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,176
It's still me, Abet.

973
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,304
But you can call me Gia now.

974
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,349
I am bolder,

975
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:36,229
and I am smarter, and much more fierce.

976
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:42,068
Ah! Where are your manners?

977
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,737
Aren't you going to introduce me to Miss…

978
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,739
Marga-reta-rita?

979
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,408
Yeah, um, this is Peachy.

980
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:52,995
Peachy.

981
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,748
Oh, isn't that "just Peachy"?

982
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:02,547
Your real name
is Patricia Marie Pinagong, correct?

983
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,465
What's it to you?

984
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,679
Do you remember the old Patricia?

985
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:20,147
Where did you get this?

986
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,652
That's you? In those pictures?

987
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:25,903
I don't know this person!

988
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:31,617
A liar is just a thief
with smoother hands.

989
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,454
The thief of someone else's boyfriend!

990
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,211
Here is a before and after online ad

991
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,632
for the New Me Aesthetic Center,

992
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,011
located somewhere in Angono.

993
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,846
I don't know. I don't usually go there.

994
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:54,765
Can I have one?

995
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:02,607
No wonder you could afford the procedure.
You got it for free.

996
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,651
So this is really you?
You've been hiding the truth?

997
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,952
Yeah!

998
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,996
-Yes! The Double Dutch Slap!
-That's it!

999
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,749
I taught that to her!
I taught her that move!

1000
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,545
Boy, you've been scammed.

1001
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:27,173
Good luck with your future babies.

1002
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,508
There's a good chance
they'll look like Neanderthals,

1003
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,344
since you're not so handsome either.

1004
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:34,680
But if your mission is to increase
the ugly population, then go ahead.

1005
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,390
I wish you the best.

1006
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,017
Oh!

1007
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:42,939
Is this water still or sparkling?

1008
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,482
Still.

1009
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:52,531
Boom! That's perfect aim.

1010
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,950
Straight through the nose!

1011
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:02,416
That's for the seven years
of my life that you've wasted!

1012
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,710
This is only the beginning.

1013
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,755
I'll make it my mission
to destroy your life,

1014
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:09,423
and I'm not going to stop there.

1015
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:13,386
I will keep on going until you curse
the day that you were born!

1016
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,691
-Yes!
-Woo!

1017
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:01,267
To all my professors, I thank you,

1018
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:04,478
for showing me the darkness of your souls.

1019
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:08,274
and for teaching me
the craft and mastery of evil.

1020
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:12,361
And to the person
who saw my true potential

1021
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,697
and shaped who I have become,

1022
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:18,200
the ultimate leading villain…

1023
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,873
Mauricia, I dedicate this to you,

1024
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:29,712
and to all of my classmates
who will graduate alongside me today.

1025
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:32,965
Let us go forth and unleash chaos!

1026
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,009
And always remember,

1027
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:40,556
there can be no heroes without villains!

1028
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:17,635
Ah! Welcome to the set!

1029
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:19,845
Thank you, Mauricia.

1030
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:27,394
Actors, please be ready.
We will begin taping in one minute.

1031
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,940
I repeat, we will begin taping
in one minute.

1032
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:31,982
Thank you!

1033
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:33,776
I'm so nervous.

1034
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,779
Don't be nervous. Instead, be excited!

1035
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:40,950
Hey! Move!

1036
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:47,915
Excuse me. Sorry.

1037
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,211
Arnulfo.

1038
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:53,712
Darling.

1039
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,299
Arnulfo, darling.

1040
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,260
Meet my youngest daughter

1041
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:02,138
fresh from her European vacation.

1042
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:05,266
She is the younger sister of Mimi,

1043
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,601
my seductive daughter.

1044
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,563
Gia, meet your new papa!

1045
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:19,780
Welcome! To this opulent grand mansion.

1046
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,075
Feel at home.

1047
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:24,910
Thank you, Papa.

1048
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:30,749
And this is Arnaldo,
the sole grandchild of Doña Auring,

1049
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:35,754
owner of an enormous hacienda
over the hills yonder.

1050
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,049
Aha, so you're Arnaldo.

1051
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:44,346
Now I understand why my dead sister
was dead-set on you.

1052
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,641
It's my pleasure to meet you, Gia.

1053
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,522
I will now be taking
Don Arnulfo to the garden

1054
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,565
so he can get some…

1055
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:56,275
…fresh air.

1056
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:02,948
Cover your mouth.

1057
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,083
And you must be Mirinisa.

1058
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:17,213
You're the one responsible
for the death of Mimi,

1059
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,131
my seductive older sister.

1060
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:22,927
What you did was unforgivable!

1061
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:25,930
And this is what you deserve!

1062
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:28,140
Huh?

1063
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,059
You need to slap her harder.

1064
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,686
But she hasn't done anything to me yet.

1065
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:40,986
Get in the kitchen and separate
every single spring roll wrapper!

1066
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,947
-Understood?
-Yes, ma'am!

1067
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,700
And what are you all
standing around for? Get to work!

1068
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,582
Cut! Moving on.

1069
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:56,794
Gia, you're the one
who should've slapped Mirinisa!

1070
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:59,088
Remember, stick to the script.

1071
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:02,258
Yes, sir. Sorry, it's my first day.

1072
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,845
Yeah. First day jitters, huh?

1073
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,067
Pull my hair.

1074
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,361
Here. Pull harder.

1075
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,281
I said harder!

1076
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:29,201
Here, let me.

1077
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:35,916
Ah, it hurts! Have mercy on me.

1078
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:41,797
Just like that.

1079
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:57,062
Oh! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1080
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:58,939
Ooh.

1081
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:06,613
Now breathe.

1082
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:09,992
Very good.

1083
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:15,414
Gia! Are you okay?

1084
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:16,498
Do as I do.

1085
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:17,458
Okay, sure.

1086
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,709
-Ready?
-Ready.

1087
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:27,509
Miss, miss! There's a worm in my food.

1088
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,053
Here. Here, take a look.

1089
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,888
There is no worm! Eat it!

1090
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:34,266
The only thing I can see
is a caterpillar on your face!

1091
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,060
Eat that! It's nutritious.

1092
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,565
I said eat it!

1093
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:43,692
Okay, okay. I'm eating. Eating!

1094
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,870
Miss… Miss!

1095
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,330
What is it now?

1096
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,248
I'm choking, miss!

1097
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:00,626
Water, please!

1098
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,878
-Are you giving me an order?
-Huh?

1099
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,004
You want water?

1100
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,130
Get it yourself!

1101
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,466
Uh, okay. Okay, okay.

1102
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,264
Are you done?

1103
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,724
Then put it back!

1104
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,059
Isn't that your job?

1105
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:20,229
Okay, I'll… I'll put it back.
I'll put it back.

1106
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,690
Anything else I can do for you?

1107
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:42,876
Tip.

1108
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,170
Tip? Um…

1109
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,760
Add some more!

1110
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:54,888
Here. Give me that.

1111
01:13:58,934 --> 01:13:59,977
Guys.

1112
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,272
-Kamsahamnida!
-Kamsahamnida!

1113
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:06,275
-Can I get my cab fare?
-Ha!

1114
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:07,276
Again.

1115
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,501
So, how's the food?

1116
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,796
Good? Good.

1117
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,007
Order rice as well.

1118
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,467
-Ms. Gia.
-What?

1119
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,928
I think that one of our customers
must be an actor.

1120
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,598
-Which one?
-There.

1121
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:43,645
What are you doing here?

1122
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,356
How did you get out
of the Teleserye World?

1123
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,941
You left on the TV.

1124
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,402
But don't worry.

1125
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,489
None of your family saw me.

1126
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,575
Are you following me?

1127
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,202
Maybe I am.

1128
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,120
Will anyone mind?

1129
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,749
No. No one will mind.

1130
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,044
Are you ordering?

1131
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,963
Do you even eat? Why are you here?

1132
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:13,133
Give me a tour of your world,
if that's okay.

1133
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,137
Can we have coffee? Or a chat?

1134
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:21,642
Forgive me if my arrival disturbed you.

1135
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:26,313
The truth is… you've caught my attention.

1136
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:27,397
Why is that?

1137
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:32,569
I've never met anyone like you before.
You're not from our world.

1138
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,364
Life is much better in your world.

1139
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,785
There's fresh air,
no traffic, and no crime.

1140
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,412
Here, it's dirty and pure chaos.

1141
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:46,041
Your world isn't the reason I'm here.

1142
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:52,965
You are.

1143
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,218
You like me? Is that allowed?

1144
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,302
Why wouldn't it be?

1145
01:15:58,136 --> 01:15:59,846
You told me that no one would mind.

1146
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,517
You don't like me, is that it?

1147
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,896
Who am I to refuse someone like you?

1148
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:09,982
The perfect man.

1149
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:15,445
But we're not a match.
I'm a villain, after all.

1150
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:18,156
You? A villain?

1151
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:20,492
You couldn't slap Mirinisa.

1152
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,078
You couldn't even give me a lap dance.

1153
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:26,999
I even saw you saying "excuse me"
to the extras.

1154
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,042
You been keeping tabs on me?

1155
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:34,339
In this world, do you use
the word "crush"?

1156
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,425
Of course.

1157
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,136
You do? Do you?

1158
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,265
Can you please tone down
your leading man act?

1159
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:46,268
And don't you dare smile at me like that!

1160
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,687
You heroes. You're putting on a show,

1161
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,772
trying to seduce me, aren't you?

1162
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,858
I'm not. I promise.

1163
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:53,984
I'm not acting.

1164
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:57,070
I'm just being my natural charming self.

1165
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:01,908
I swear.

1166
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:22,262
There, the TV's on.
Now you can return to your world.

1167
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:23,972
Come with me?

1168
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,558
I don't have taping today,
so why should I go?

1169
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,187
I have something to show you.

1170
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:59,883
Welcome to San Bida University.

1171
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:08,558
Hello.

1172
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:16,108
I feel so out of place here.
Everyone's a goody-two-shoes.

1173
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,110
The type that couldn't hurt a fly.

1174
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,821
You're all so… angelic.

1175
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:23,782
That's because at San Bida, our motto is,

1176
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:27,202
"In a world of darkness, be the light."

1177
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:30,414
Get it?

1178
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,874
"Be the" like "bida."

1179
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,251
-Bida--
-I got it.

1180
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,461
Corny, but I got it.

1181
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:40,173
IT IS BETTER TO BE KIND THAN RIGHT.
WRONG PEOPLE

1182
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,179
Hope?

1183
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:47,973
This is what you study here?

1184
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:56,857
Modesty?

1185
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,573
Patience?

1186
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:09,578
If someone throws a rock at you,
what do you throw back?

1187
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:11,788
-Yes?
-A much bigger rock?

1188
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,707
Oh, no, no, no. Yes?

1189
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:14,875
A grenade?

1190
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,878
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1191
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:20,130
When they throw a rock at you,

1192
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:22,716
you throw them a piece of bread!

1193
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:24,801
-Ah.
-Oh yeah, okay.

1194
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,471
When someone slaps you on the left cheek.

1195
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:29,306
You should kick them?

1196
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:31,475
Oh, no.

1197
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:32,684
-Yes?
-You pull their hair?

1198
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:38,607
When someone slaps you on the left cheek,

1199
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,942
offer them the right cheek.

1200
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:43,069
-Ah.
-Write that down.

1201
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,740
If there's a will, there's a…

1202
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:48,408
-Peanut curry?
-Cured beef!

1203
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:49,493
Fried chicken!

1204
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:53,330
Oh, I know! Pizza!

1205
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:54,790
-Is it curry?
-Ice cream?

1206
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,043
You think it's easy to learn all that?

1207
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:02,964
It's not always easy to be patient,
modest, or hopeful.

1208
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,425
Why did you bring me here?

1209
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:07,761
So you can see the other side.

1210
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,346
What for?

1211
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,265
I know you're not really bad.

1212
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:18,814
So, you think I'm hero material,
not villain material?

1213
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:20,941
In my opinion?

1214
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,362
Only you can answer that.

1215
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,264
Stop, please.

1216
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:55,016
Driver, stop!

1217
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:55,934
-Oh!
-Careful!

1218
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,519
-Watch it!
-Are you all right?

1219
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,147
Are you okay?

1220
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:03,316
I'm okay.

1221
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:09,990
I got something for you.

1222
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:23,920
Ooh!

1223
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:54,242
Relaxing, isn't it?

1224
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,578
-My turn.
-Here, try.

1225
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:30,779
For you, Gia.

1226
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:32,030
-Thank you.
-Gia!

1227
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:33,239
Mauricia?

1228
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,493
What are you doing here?

1229
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:38,119
Keep away from Arnaldo!

1230
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:42,207
I have the contract that you signed.

1231
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:44,584
And right here it clearly states,

1232
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:47,671
"A hero and a villain
can never fall in love."

1233
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,423
Well, we are not in love.
We're just acquaintances.

1234
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:55,470
Gia, I was not born yesterday.

1235
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:58,682
I can see from the twinkle in your eyes

1236
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:03,103
and in your body language
where this relationship is headed.

1237
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:07,399
Arnaldo, if this reaches The Sponsor,

1238
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:11,820
then you will suffer the same fate
as Mimi, my seductive daughter.

1239
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,697
Why? What really happened to her?

1240
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:17,242
She was banished
to the Island of the Forgotten!

1241
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:22,747
-Hey!
-Oh!

1242
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:25,000
You scared me!

1243
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,545
Mimi, my seductive daughter,

1244
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:30,880
got involved with an extra,

1245
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:34,134
a peasant with no speaking lines.

1246
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:37,929
When such forbidden love occurs…

1247
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,850
…this world loses balance
and order is lost.

1248
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:44,894
That's why The Sponsor
strictly prohibits it.

1249
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:48,982
As punishment,

1250
01:23:49,065 --> 01:23:52,944
they killed off the character of Mimi,
my seductive daughter.

1251
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,114
Give me a project.

1252
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:59,659
And she was sent
to the Island of the Forgotten

1253
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,828
to be with the other washed up has-beens.

1254
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,416
Please, give me a project!

1255
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:08,918
Give me a project!

1256
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:14,007
As for you, Gia,
you will go back to being Gigi,

1257
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,801
a pushover, a doormat, a wimp!

1258
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:20,305
You will lose all confidence in yourself,

1259
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:24,517
and people in your world
will once again trample all over you.

1260
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:36,780
Arnaldo, if you don't stop
this foolish behavior,

1261
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:41,451
I will be the one
to report you to The Sponsor.

1262
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,303
Darling, are you still mad at me?

1263
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:08,853
Mm. You know I did
everything that you asked.

1264
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:15,568
I really am sorry.
Will you please forgive me?

1265
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:22,033
Maybe I just wanted
to be like those actors on TV

1266
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:25,787
and those influencers on social media.

1267
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:31,793
I'm not mad at you anymore, Mom.

1268
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:34,462
Really?

1269
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:35,964
Really.

1270
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:37,841
I'm so happy.

1271
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:46,266
Here. Do your add-to-cart thing.

1272
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:49,018
Just this once. My treat.

1273
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:50,478
Really?

1274
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:55,233
Oh, I've missed you!

1275
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,152
Mm… I've missed you.

1276
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,820
One item.

1277
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:01,156
Okay, yeah. One item.

1278
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,408
One of each color.

1279
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,202
I'm kidding!

1280
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:11,666
Annyeong haseyo! SamgyupToSawa.
Annyeong haseyo! SamgyupToSawa.

1281
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:17,463
Hi.

1282
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:22,093
I know that you won't forgive me easily,

1283
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,971
no matter how many times
I say I'm sorry,

1284
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:30,351
but I don't think that I'm the only person
in the world to fall out of love.

1285
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:36,232
Maybe it's that…
we'd been together so long

1286
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:39,861
and everything became routine.

1287
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,073
And my mistake…

1288
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:49,204
was that I couldn't admit--

1289
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:51,289
You didn't love me anymore.

1290
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:52,874
The same happened to you.

1291
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,542
Admit it, Gi.

1292
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:57,253
You didn't have feelings for me anymore,

1293
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:58,922
and I could feel it.

1294
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:05,053
Maybe my mistake
was setting my mind on a future together,

1295
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:08,848
like getting married
and starting a family.

1296
01:27:09,515 --> 01:27:11,601
But for all the wrong reasons.

1297
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:13,561
Not because we loved each other.

1298
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:18,566
Because I wanted a new chapter.

1299
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:23,196
I wanted progress,
to move forward for the sake of it.

1300
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:30,828
Gi.

1301
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,249
I'm sorry.

1302
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:44,467
What about Peachy? Do you love her?

1303
01:27:51,724 --> 01:27:53,101
I hope you'll be happy.

1304
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,898
And if our kids look like Neanderthals,

1305
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:02,151
I'll let them get plastic surgery.

1306
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:11,744
-Bye, Jingo!
-Bye!

1307
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:13,246
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

1308
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:15,748
Gigi?

1309
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,293
I mean, Gia.

1310
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,379
-Jingo?
-It's me.

1311
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:23,006
You look so fresh.

1312
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:25,800
It's so nice to see you.

1313
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,887
If you're not too busy,
let's get breakfast together.

1314
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:30,805
My treat.

1315
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:33,016
Come on!

1316
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:35,310
Thank you.

1317
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:38,104
What happened to you?

1318
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:40,773
What is with this positive aura?

1319
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:43,359
Did you win the lottery?

1320
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:46,529
Or have you found the Lord? What?

1321
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:49,866
You know what?
Getting fired from SamgyupToSawa.

1322
01:28:49,949 --> 01:28:51,951
Best thing that's ever happened to me.

1323
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:53,786
Thanks to you.

1324
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,664
Maybe I just really needed a break.

1325
01:28:58,207 --> 01:28:59,959
Now I work for a call center.

1326
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:04,213
I am slowly paying off
what I owe the owners of Samgyup.

1327
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:06,632
And I went back to college,

1328
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,928
so I wouldn't feel insecure
around well-educated people like you.

1329
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,390
Oh, I also work out.

1330
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:17,268
Calisthenics, yoga, and Pilates.

1331
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:20,813
And the most important thing…

1332
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:24,525
I quit gambling.

1333
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:25,943
Good.

1334
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:27,820
Good for you.

1335
01:29:30,656 --> 01:29:31,949
Sorry, Gia.

1336
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:35,953
I'm sorry for treating you so badly.

1337
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:40,958
I know that you didn't deserve
to work in such a toxic environment.

1338
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:46,547
I'm sorry too,
for becoming a villain in your life.

1339
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,758
Oh, nah. Not at all!

1340
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:53,137
I am happy with who I am
and the life I have.

1341
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,015
You don't need to apologize.

1342
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:58,184
You just did what you thought was right.

1343
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:00,353
You are not a villain.

1344
01:30:06,442 --> 01:30:11,114
Ouch! Oh, Gia, please stop!
It hurts! It hurts!

1345
01:30:14,033 --> 01:30:16,411
Gia, please believe me.

1346
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:21,082
I didn't steal your necklace.
Stealing is not in my nature.

1347
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:24,085
You're lying.
If you didn't steal the necklace,

1348
01:30:24,168 --> 01:30:25,253
why was it on your dresser?

1349
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:27,171
Isn't that where you found it, Mama?

1350
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:28,840
Uh-huh! Right there!

1351
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,175
Arnulfo, darling,

1352
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,511
are you going to let
your daughter get away

1353
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:35,847
with committing such a nefarious crime?

1354
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:40,143
Isn't it about time we banish her
from this extravagant mansion?

1355
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:42,603
-Please calm down, Mauricia.
-Oh!

1356
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,105
Have pity on Mirinisa.

1357
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:47,817
Huh?

1358
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:51,320
Uh…

1359
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:02,623
Hm?

1360
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:04,625
You must fight back, Mirinisa.

1361
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:06,335
Fight back.

1362
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:15,136
Don Arnulfo, it was Mauricia
who stole the necklace.

1363
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:17,555
And she put it on the dresser herself.

1364
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:20,600
Gia, what are you talking about?

1365
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:21,726
It's true, isn't it?

1366
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:25,855
Don Arnulfo, Mauricia is manipulating you.

1367
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:28,524
She's not just poisoning your body,
she's poisoning your mind.

1368
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:29,734
Wait, wait, wait.

1369
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:35,615
Isn't it Mauricia's role here,
to make our lives miserable?

1370
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:37,742
And my life a living hell?

1371
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:43,289
Uh, Gia, aren't you going to push me over?

1372
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:46,626
Then I'll hit my head in the fall
and get amnesia,

1373
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:49,086
forget all about Arnaldo,

1374
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,797
and then you swoop in
to claim him for yourself?

1375
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,760
Mirinisa, you are the main character.

1376
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:58,846
And you can change your story,

1377
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,765
starting with the main title.

1378
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:02,934
Enough with Law of the Oppressed.

1379
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:07,355
-It can be The World of Mirinisa!
-Gia!

1380
01:32:07,438 --> 01:32:09,190
It should've been changed ages ago!

1381
01:32:09,273 --> 01:32:10,358
Oh, you think so?

1382
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:11,817
Change the title!

1383
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:15,154
Change the entire show!

1384
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:17,365
-That's right. The whole show.
-Yeah!

1385
01:32:17,448 --> 01:32:18,282
That's enough!

1386
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:26,332
Must I remind you
that we all have roles to play?

1387
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:29,085
There's a hero, and there's a villain.

1388
01:32:29,168 --> 01:32:32,171
And who gave you
the right to deliver dialogue?

1389
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:36,050
Look who's playing the hero now, Mauricia.
You're the one trying to save this show.

1390
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:40,805
And you are the biggest
mistake of my life!

1391
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:43,641
You're a piece of trash.

1392
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:47,436
Much worse than Mirinisa!
You don't belong in this world.

1393
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,939
You're right. I don't belong here

1394
01:32:50,022 --> 01:32:52,900
because in my world, the real world,

1395
01:32:53,484 --> 01:32:57,822
a person can be both a hero and a villain,
and that's okay.

1396
01:32:58,322 --> 01:32:59,907
Well, in this world it's not!

1397
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:02,952
And if we don't perform
our designated parts,

1398
01:33:03,035 --> 01:33:04,453
it will be the end!

1399
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:08,374
All of this and all of you will disappear!

1400
01:33:08,457 --> 01:33:10,876
-That's not true!
-Who said that?

1401
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,422
The same things just keep on happening.
I am sick of being an NPC!

1402
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:16,173
Why are you speaking?

1403
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:18,217
Keep it down! You shouldn't be speaking!

1404
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:20,011
Why are you all talking to me?

1405
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:22,346
Why am I talking to them?

1406
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:24,890
Because they want a new chapter.

1407
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:34,817
Mauricia! Mauricia!

1408
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:39,363
Oh! Director!

1409
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,365
Didn't I tell you, Mauricia?

1410
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:44,452
It won't work if you hire
someone from the outside.

1411
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:46,454
Now she's a troublemaker.

1412
01:33:46,537 --> 01:33:48,956
It was just an experiment, Director.

1413
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,750
So you're the director?

1414
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,044
Uh-huh. That's right.

1415
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:56,339
And you, Gia. You're a burden.

1416
01:33:56,422 --> 01:33:58,215
Why can't you just follow the script?

1417
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:02,386
Director, maybe you can
think of a new storyline for next season.

1418
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,889
One where people actually use their brain,

1419
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:06,474
Aren't you sick of this?

1420
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,727
Well… Uh…

1421
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:13,105
Go ahead! Keep brainstorming.

1422
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:15,733
I'm taking this to the very top,

1423
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:17,360
to The Sponsor.

1424
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:22,490
And I will make sure that all of you
end up on the Island of the Forgotten!

1425
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:35,002
Mauricia! Mauricia, where are you going?

1426
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,975
I can see Mauricia! After her!

1427
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:21,132
Mauricia!

1428
01:35:39,942 --> 01:35:41,527
Where can I find The Sponsor?

1429
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,821
Mauricia? Is that you?

1430
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:44,822
Yes.

1431
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:47,408
Sh. Where's The Sponsor?

1432
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:51,412
Where is The Sponsor?

1433
01:35:51,495 --> 01:35:54,039
At the very end, in the corner office.

1434
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,291
Thank you.

1435
01:35:55,374 --> 01:35:58,252
Mauricia! Mauricia!

1436
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:00,296
Mauricia!

1437
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,551
Is this the office of The Sponsor?

1438
01:36:05,634 --> 01:36:07,011
OMG, Miss Mauricia!

1439
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:10,598
Yes, this is the office of The Sponsor,
but he is in a board meeting right now.

1440
01:36:10,681 --> 01:36:11,932
Okay. Where's that?

1441
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,434
There, in the conference room.

1442
01:36:14,518 --> 01:36:15,811
Mauricia!

1443
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:17,354
Mauricia!

1444
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:19,815
Mauricia!

1445
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:21,776
Mauricia!

1446
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,028
Mauricia!

1447
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:31,577
Mauricia!

1448
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:33,996
Mauricia! Quickly.

1449
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,166
-Where's Mauricia?
-In there, Director.

1450
01:36:37,249 --> 01:36:39,043
There, let's go! Hurry!

1451
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:51,680
Are you The Sponsor?

1452
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:53,474
Yes, I am.

1453
01:36:55,017 --> 01:36:57,937
Mauricia, what are you doing
on this floor?

1454
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:00,272
There's been trouble downstairs.

1455
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:02,358
Please do me a favor.

1456
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:05,903
Have them all banished
to the Island of the Forgotten!

1457
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:10,908
Ah, Director. What is going on here?

1458
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:13,035
I'm really very sorry about this, sir.

1459
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:21,961
Quiet! Quiet, please.

1460
01:37:23,045 --> 01:37:24,088
Oh!

1461
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,841
It's her!

1462
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,218
She is the one
who caused all this trouble.

1463
01:37:29,718 --> 01:37:31,262
She should be charged!

1464
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:34,682
Inciting rebellion,
instigating a revolution.

1465
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:37,643
They're all trying to shut down this show!

1466
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:40,354
Uh, Mr. Sponsor, sir,
with all due respect,

1467
01:37:40,437 --> 01:37:43,858
we just want something to change.
Isn't it about time?

1468
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:47,695
Miss, change is dangerous.

1469
01:37:48,737 --> 01:37:52,199
What our viewers want
is to feel safe and comfortable

1470
01:37:53,325 --> 01:37:55,744
with stories that give them hope.

1471
01:37:57,329 --> 01:37:59,331
We already have enough hope,

1472
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:02,960
but what good is it, having hope,
if nothing ever changes?

1473
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:07,131
What I learned from being a villain,
Mr. Sponsor, sir,

1474
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:10,301
is that being a villain
is not about being evil.

1475
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:12,511
It's about having the courage to fight.

1476
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:14,680
Not for what is wrong,
but for what is right.

1477
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:17,224
And now I'm fighting for what's right.

1478
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:20,185
Don't you think our show is due
for a few changes?

1479
01:38:20,853 --> 01:38:22,271
-Absolutely.
-She's right.

1480
01:38:23,772 --> 01:38:25,190
-Chase.
-Yes, sir?

1481
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:27,818
Uh, how is Law of the Oppressed rating?

1482
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,279
Uh, it's still doing well, sir,

1483
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:32,823
but ratings have plateaued

1484
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,784
and not picked up
for a very long time, sir.

1485
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:38,203
Okay, okay.

1486
01:38:38,787 --> 01:38:39,872
Okay, so...

1487
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:45,294
what type of show would you recommend

1488
01:38:45,377 --> 01:38:47,046
to replace Law of the Oppressed?

1489
01:38:47,129 --> 01:38:49,465
Uh, me?

1490
01:38:49,548 --> 01:38:51,842
-Yes.
-I… I…

1491
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:53,010
Well, Gia?

1492
01:38:53,552 --> 01:38:55,846
What show would you replace
Law of the Oppressed with?

1493
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:57,640
Cat got your tongue?

1494
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:02,061
Wait, wait! Excuse me!
Uh, Mr. Sponsor, sir?

1495
01:39:02,144 --> 01:39:04,772
We can make a series
based on the historical fiction novel

1496
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:06,523
Noli Me Tángere.

1497
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:09,401
But with a Bridgerton spin to it. Yeah?

1498
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:10,945
Noli Me Tángere?

1499
01:39:11,028 --> 01:39:12,613
Boring!

1500
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:15,908
What about a culinary docuseries show

1501
01:39:15,991 --> 01:39:19,203
about adobo variations
across the Philippines?

1502
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:20,496
And for season 2,

1503
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:22,998
we can feature
different types of Filipino sausage.

1504
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:24,458
Adobo and Sausages?

1505
01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:26,543
Who in the world
would want to watch that show?

1506
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:29,338
A mixed genre TV series.

1507
01:39:29,421 --> 01:39:31,423
It's like an action… musical!

1508
01:39:32,549 --> 01:39:33,801
A whodunit comedy.

1509
01:39:33,884 --> 01:39:35,970
It could also be an erotic thriller.

1510
01:39:36,053 --> 01:39:39,974
Mixed genre? You just invented that.
There's no such thing.

1511
01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:43,310
Members of the board.

1512
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:45,688
Help me out here.

1513
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:47,648
What do you think?

1514
01:39:55,447 --> 01:39:56,490
Mm.

1515
01:39:57,032 --> 01:39:59,702
You, you, you, and you.

1516
01:39:59,785 --> 01:40:00,619
Stay.

1517
01:40:03,205 --> 01:40:04,331
-Director.
-Yeah?

1518
01:40:05,582 --> 01:40:07,710
I want you to listen
to what they have to say.

1519
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:11,255
-Yes, sir.
-The rest of you may leave.

1520
01:40:12,297 --> 01:40:14,049
-Okay.
-Leave.

1521
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:16,010
-Leave, okay.
-Back to the set.

1522
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:18,178
-Okay. Sure.
-Wait for me there.

1523
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:19,805
So talk to me.

1524
01:40:19,888 --> 01:40:21,515
What are you thinking for this miniseries?

1525
01:40:21,598 --> 01:40:22,850
Noli Me Tángere?

1526
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:25,811
-Tell me more, tell me more.
-Well, it's a great story.

1527
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:27,980
Uh, it's a powerful
social and political critique

1528
01:40:28,063 --> 01:40:31,316
of Spanish colonial rule,
through the story of a young Filipino man.

1529
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:34,862
And what are you still doing here?

1530
01:40:36,947 --> 01:40:38,032
You may go.

1531
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:39,658
What?!

1532
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:41,660
-Can you believe that just happened?
-I know.

1533
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,412
I wonder what she's going to do now that--

1534
01:40:43,495 --> 01:40:44,496
Gia!

1535
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:49,334
So? Are you happy?

1536
01:40:50,252 --> 01:40:53,130
If nobody watches these new shows,

1537
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:55,382
it will be all your fault.

1538
01:40:57,092 --> 01:40:59,595
Mauricia, how will we know
if we don't try?

1539
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,392
You are the villain of my life!

1540
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:13,108
Looks like being a hero suits you.

1541
01:41:15,402 --> 01:41:16,236
Thank you.

1542
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:29,583
-Ms. Gi?
-Hey, Gigi.

1543
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:33,170
Ooh! Welcome back.

1544
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:34,213
-And, Gi…
-Hmm?

1545
01:41:34,296 --> 01:41:35,756
…thanks for everything.

1546
01:41:35,839 --> 01:41:37,466
You didn't forget about us.

1547
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:39,218
Didn't I tell you?

1548
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:42,971
Once our finances recovered,
you'd be the first ones I'd call.

1549
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:44,765
-Thank you! Thank you!
-Well done.

1550
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:49,144
In fact, our finances
are doing so well that, Vicky?

1551
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:50,145
-Yeah?
-Oh!

1552
01:41:50,729 --> 01:41:53,440
There's something wrong
with your name tag.

1553
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:55,317
Here. Hang on.

1554
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,611
I think this will suit you much better.

1555
01:41:57,694 --> 01:41:59,071
Oh my God.

1556
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:04,159
Congratulations!

1557
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:06,787
Go Vicky!

1558
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:09,039
Thank you. Oh!

1559
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:10,916
And you don't need to worry.

1560
01:42:10,999 --> 01:42:15,087
I promise you that I will be
the best assistant manager ever!

1561
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:17,548
Thank you! Thank you.

1562
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:19,550
Oh. You deserve it!

1563
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:21,009
You work so hard, right?

1564
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:23,762
-Yeah, best boss ever!
-Can you let us clock off early, Vicky?

1565
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:26,390
Hey, watch it.
All right, back to work, all of you!

1566
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:28,517
Oh, just messing around!

1567
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,811
-She runs a tight ship, hey.
-Got ya!

1568
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:48,579
Hey, come in.

1569
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:54,209
-You're just in time.
-Oh?

1570
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:55,335
Dinner's ready.

1571
01:42:59,756 --> 01:43:02,718
So what do you want to do tonight?
Are we going out?

1572
01:43:03,635 --> 01:43:07,055
Not tonight.
Let's just stay in, and watch something.

1573
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:12,227
So what are we watching?

1574
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:14,688
Mm. There's a new episode
of my favorite show.

1575
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:16,690
Oh. All right.

1576
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:18,942
Mm.

1577
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:23,197
SEÑOR'S SECRET TO SUCCESS

1578
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,324
THE FOREST

1579
01:43:25,949 --> 01:43:27,117
Ah! There!

1580
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:28,076
This?

1581
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:37,377
Welcome to Mauricia's Mansion.

1582
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:41,715
That's right! I am now
the queen of this majestic estate,

1583
01:43:41,798 --> 01:43:45,802
and the sole owner
of a vast, sprawling hacienda.

1584
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:48,388
I'm left to rule alone,

1585
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:52,434
so I must clean this royal mess alone.
