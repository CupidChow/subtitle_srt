1
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,482
Mauricia!

2
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:05,231
Careful! Pack it properly.
We'll use that again next year.

3
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:10,278
Seriously? Look at Rudolph. All that
sled-pulling gave him a hunchback.

4
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,907
And these Christmas lights,
they don't even twinkle anymore.

5
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,034
Here. Check this out.

6
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,578
Santa's losing his hair.

7
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,915
Be careful!
We'll use this again next Christmas!

8
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,376
Let's just add a bit more hair
and clean it so no one will notice.

9
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,713
This has been
the most exhausting Christmas season ever.

10
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,591
Gosh, I didn't even notice
Valentine's Day is coming up.

11
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:36,429
Christmas is our busiest time.
That's how it is. Get used to it.

12
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,892
And we should be happy. This mall
has shops like ours on every floor.

13
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,644
We should be thankful.

14
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,603
Vicky!

15
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,313
-Sir?
-Gigi!

16
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,690
Do you know what time it is?
We're about to open.

17
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,569
Just change the Christmas decorations
to Valentine's, okay?

18
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,657
You're too slow.
At this rate, you'll finish by Easter.

19
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,574
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:01,246
Oh, I have a quick announcement
before we open.

21
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,123
What is it, sir?

22
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm happy to announce that this weekend,

23
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,627
although it's a bit late,

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,131
we'll be having our Christmas party!

25
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,424
Come on! Clap your hands!

26
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,094
There you go.

27
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,057
Finally, we can celebrate Christ's birth.

28
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,643
After all, Lent is just a few weeks away.

29
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,728
Be quiet. He might hear you.

30
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,356
Nothing, sir.

31
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,361
By the way, you'll be in charge
of everything for the Christmas party.

32
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,487
Okay?

33
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,907
Clap your hands!

34
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,872
And by the way,
this will be a potluck party, okay?

35
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,748
-Well, isn't that convenient.
-Sir!

36
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,375
-Potluck, really?
-Hey!

37
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,127
Clap your hands!

38
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,054
Hey, Gi.

39
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:05,143
We're short on staff.
Help out on the floor to speed things up.

40
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,354
I'm working front of house.
Who will cover my spot?

41
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,480
Can't you do both?

42
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,108
-I can.
-See?

43
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:17,572
Sir, perhaps it's time you consider
the recommendations in my report.

44
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,866
-We need more staff bec--
-Gigi.

45
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:33,296
And as my assistant manager, you should be
the first to understand that.

46
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,507
I ran the projections,
and they look okay--

47
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,092
Eoseo oseyo!

48
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,971
-Come in!
-Sonnimi wangida!

49
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,022
Annyeonghaseyo! Welcome to SamgyupToSawa.

50
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,401
Annyeonghaseyo! Welcome.

51
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,738
Eoseo oseyo!

52
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,492
Sonnimi wangida!

53
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,912
-Gigi!
-Yes, sir?

54
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,915
-Table 11, bus out!
-Eleven? All right.

55
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,208
I'll be right back.

56
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,418
Kamsahamnida!

57
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,004
Kamsahamnida!

58
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,261
Gigi.

59
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,887
-Sir?
-Hey.

60
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,891
Tomorrow, I want to see
the program flow for the party.

61
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,810
Regarding the potluck…

62
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,355
-Okay.
-And lastly…

63
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:38,236
Can you add more hearts and cupids
to the decor? I barely see any.

64
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,153
Here.

65
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,115
Can I expect them tomorrow morning?

66
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,371
More oomph! Add a lot more.

67
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,539
Here are the keys.

68
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,209
You're closing the store tonight.

69
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,506
Hey, man, time to go.

70
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,688
Stay safe, ma'am.

71
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,525
Babe!

72
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,403
Babe, what took you so long?

73
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,864
Jingo gave me an extra task.

74
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,116
I'll tell you about it later.
I'm starving.

75
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,494
Your boss is a real piece of work.
This isn't the first time.

76
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,998
This smells nice. Did you clean it?

77
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,292
Huh? Does it smell nice?

78
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,337
Unlike you, babe. You smell like kimchi.

79
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,172
Jerk. Let's go.

80
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,008
Hold on a sec.

81
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,854
Okay.

82
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,940
All right.

83
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,493
Babe, it's our song. Remember this?

84
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,580
That song's seven years old.

85
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,375
That means we've been together
for seven years too.

86
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,090
Babe.

87
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,510
Do you remember Niño and Leia
from high school?

88
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,220
Yeah. Are they dead now?

89
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,180
You're so morbid.

90
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,474
They got married. Look.

91
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,894
They really ended up together.

92
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,399
Whoa. What about Buknoy and Jingle?
Remember them?

93
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,818
They got married too?

94
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,236
No, they're dead.

95
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,321
Are you serious?

96
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,199
Kidding! You're too serious.

97
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,078
They're engaged. Imagine?

98
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,333
Babe, I think I know where this is going.

99
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,169
Where? I didn't say anything.

100
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,257
I told you. I'm just saving up.

101
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,718
When I get promoted to senior accountant,

102
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,555
you'll be the one
dropping those surprise posts.

103
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,098
I'm just saving up.

104
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,484
Okay.

105
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,820
Off you go.

106
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,241
Babe?

107
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,828
I'll be working overtime tomorrow.

108
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,498
There's an office audit. Is it okay
if I don't pick you up from work?

109
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,293
It's fine.

110
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,880
What's another three hours
of my life wasted commuting?

111
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,424
Babe, I'm sorry. I just…

112
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,385
Kidding! I'm just being silly. No worries.

113
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,220
-Go on.
-Silly girl.

114
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,139
-Take care.
-Are you sure it's fine? Okay.

115
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,352
Babe.

116
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,535
-Hi, sis.
-Sis.

117
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,205
Did you get my text?

118
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,707
Yeah, about your tuition balance?

119
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,377
Yeah. I got a notice.
The registrar emailed me.

120
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,171
I replied. Didn't you get it?

121
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:29,383
I told you to ask Mommy.
Daddy sent money last week, right?

122
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,385
Mommy said to ask you.

123
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,596
Where is she?

124
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,515
In her room, shooting videos.

125
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,229
Here we go, add-to-cart buddies!

126
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,856
Let's do the unboxing!

127
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,653
Look how pretty my bag is!

128
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,239
The delivery was quick too.

129
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,573
Look, it's so stylish.

130
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,034
Gorgeous!

131
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,202
You know what?

132
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,705
This is gonna go perfectly
with my OOTD tomorrow,

133
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,582
so stay tuned! Bye!

134
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,671
Sweetie, you're here.

135
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:10,049
Check out my new purchase.

136
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,009
See those stitches? Perfect.

137
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,387
Smell it. No harsh, synthetic smell.

138
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,390
It doesn't look like a Class A replica.

139
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,142
That's right. Looks more like Class B.

140
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,812
-Or Class C.
-You're too harsh.

141
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,939
Look at the label inside.

142
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,440
Balenciagah?

143
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,025
There's an H at the end? "Gah."

144
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,987
That's fine. No one will notice it anyway.

145
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,238
So nitpicky.

146
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,115
Look at your shoes.

147
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,617
Jimmy Choo became Jimmy Chos.

148
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,496
And your watch is the worst.

149
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,041
It wants to be Bulgari, but it lost
the 'I' and settled for Bulgar.

150
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,379
Leave them alone!
These are buy now, pay later anyway.

151
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,716
Mommy, why is Candy asking me
for money again?

152
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,927
Oh, that. Sweetie…

153
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,556
Can you take care of it for now?
I'll pay you back later.

154
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,268
Didn't Daddy just send money?
I'll message him now.

155
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,478
Sweetie, you don't need to do that!

156
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,524
Your daddy's doing fine in Bahrain.
Don't make him worry.

157
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,116
Hey, look!

158
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,161
Is this the grand prize? That's cool!

159
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,998
Looks like we have a generous sponsor.

160
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,416
Who's it from?

161
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:28,210
-It doesn't say, sir.
-Well, bring it in, then!

162
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,587
-Oh, right.
-Quick!

163
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,048
Careful.

164
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,467
-This is heavy.
-Careful.

165
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,649
Vicky!

166
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,525
Clap your hands!

167
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:56,447
You won a year's supply of kimchi
from our sponsor,

168
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,450
Go Dong Hae Food Industries!

169
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:07,083
This prize suits you perfectly,
just as sour as you are.

170
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,669
Now, for our grand prize!

171
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,087
Put it down, please.

172
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:16,175
This is from
our still-to-be confirmed sponsor.

173
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,053
-I bet it's a washing machine.
-No, a mattress.

174
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,889
-No, it's just a calendar.
-Here we go!

175
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,850
And our grand prize winner is…

176
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,774
-Gigi, you won.
-Congrats, ma'am!

177
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,986
-You're so lucky, Miss Gi.
-Wow, you got yourself a TV.

178
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,449
Thank you. Belated happy New Year, sir.

179
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,035
Open it.
Could be a mattress for all we know.

180
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,208
-Oh!
-Wow!

181
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,752
-Wow!
-It really is a TV.

182
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,839
Congrats, sis!

183
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,467
Sis, if you don't like it,
just give it to me.

184
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,011
I'll pay you bit by bit,
every payday for the next 20 years.

185
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,430
No way!

186
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,599
Come on, let's exchange gifts.

187
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,560
I'll give you my kimchi.

188
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,353
-Let's take a photo.
-Sure.

189
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,271
Look here.

190
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,274
One more.

191
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,946
That's huge, babe.

192
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,490
How's that gonna fit on my bike?

193
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,492
We can make it work.

194
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,493
"Make it work"?

195
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,748
Well, it will fit

196
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,208
in my studio.

197
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,420
Come on. I rarely get this lucky.

198
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,380
But isn't it for us?

199
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,967
We can Netflix and chill now. Yeah?

200
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,052
You're full of nonsense.

201
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,345
-Let's go.
-Please.

202
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,432
This smells so good.

203
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,683
Babe, let's go.

204
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,061
Just put it on your lap
and hold it tight. Okay?

205
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,522
Keep it secure. Come on. Let's go.

206
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,678
Batman.

207
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,931
Mara, of course.

208
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,309
Sara.

209
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,605
King Kong, I guess.

210
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,358
Judas or Barabbas or Gestas?

211
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,860
Gestas.

212
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,028
Are you happy with your life?

213
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,288
Wait. I was thinking.

214
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,212
Law of the Oppressed.

215
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,631
Law of the Oppressed highlights.

216
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,552
Law of the Oppressed deleted scenes.
Law of the Oppressed reels.

217
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,013
It's all Law of the Oppressed!
What else is here?

218
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,472
LAW OF THE OPPRESSED

219
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:03,986
Law of the Oppressed

220
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,948
Is my destiny

221
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,952
Born from the dirt

222
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,830
Change never comes

223
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,501
The Law of the Oppressed

224
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,088
A burden so heavy

225
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:28,802
Is this all that I could ever hope for?

226
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,765
The Law of the Oppressed

227
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,475
Who are these people?

228
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,186
Isn't there at least
one famous actor here?

229
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:42,816
Law of the Oppressed…

230
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,614
Papá!

231
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,492
-Mirinisa!
-Papá!

232
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,409
My dear.

233
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,203
I've missed you, Papá.

234
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,706
I'm glad you returned safely
to our grand hacienda.

235
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,710
Your horses missed you too.

236
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,838
They've been crying for weeks
in the stables.

237
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:10,344
By the way, I've returned
with your future stepmother.

238
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,056
This is Mauricia.

239
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,768
And your new stepsister.

240
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,271
Meet Mimi.

241
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,528
Hello, and welcome
to our sprawling hacienda!

242
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,073
Oh! My horses!

243
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,660
Mauricia, Mimi, I'll leave you for now.

244
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,954
-Sure.
-I'll just head to the stables.

245
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,919
Go ahead, Pops!

246
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,469
So, you're Mirinisa.

247
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,017
Why did you slap--

248
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,022
What did I do to you?

249
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:03,981
Nothing.

250
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,609
I just wanted this moment to leave a mark
on your cheek and on your mind.

251
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,069
Because from now on,

252
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,282
we will rule as queens
over Arnulfo's grand hacienda.

253
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,491
Do you understand?

254
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,118
Yes.

255
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,579
And if you tell your father about this,

256
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,832
you'll be getting more than just a slap.
Am I clear?

257
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,292
Yes, ma'am.

258
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,922
What was that for?
I haven't done anything!

259
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,382
I just felt like slapping you.

260
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,304
Be grateful it's not 4, 5, or 46.

261
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:44,813
Shall we step inside this grand estate
and find some servants to torment?

262
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,743
What's that?

263
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,553
My God.
Is there really nothing else to watch?

264
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,190
That's me.

265
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,944
Good thing there's a cute guy.
I'm not sleepy anymore.

266
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,904
-Arnaldo?
-Mirinisa!

267
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,867
I'm here to give you
these freshly picked wildflowers

268
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,661
from my grandmother's garden.

269
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:41,995
Mirinisa!

270
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:49,086
Here is a very, very, very long list
of things you need to get done today.

271
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,839
Start with cleaning the roof gutters.

272
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:57,094
Next, wash and iron the heavy velvet
blackout curtains in each room.

273
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,972
Then bathe the horses in the stables

274
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,850
and give them
world-class manicures and pedicures.

275
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,851
Did you get it?

276
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,145
Yes?

277
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,188
Well, what are you waiting for? Go!

278
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,275
Why should Mirinisa do all that?

279
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,862
You have a lot of servants
in this grand mansion.

280
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,030
I like handsome men,

281
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,409
but I can't stand those who meddle.

282
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,785
Who are you?

283
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,203
I'm Arnaldo.

284
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,039
The only grandson of Doña Auring,

285
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:30,002
who owns the vast hacienda
on the other side of town?

286
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,170
That's me.

287
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,088
Arnaldo.

288
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,467
You would be a better match for Mimi,
my seductive daughter.

289
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,140
Show him what you've got.

290
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,287
Mirinisa!

291
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,580
Mimi?

292
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,583
What have you done
to my expensive designer dress?

293
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,462
Sorry. It was an accident.
I didn't mean to burn it with the iron.

294
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,172
Mamá!

295
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,800
Look what she did
to my expensive designer dress!

296
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,010
You bitch!

297
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,430
Do you have any idea
how much this designer dress costs?

298
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,515
It's worth more than your dignity!

299
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,517
As punishment,

300
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:32,147
you're staying in that bathroom
until it's spotless!

301
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,566
Señora, I truly didn't mean it!

302
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,153
I swear I'll work on my ironing skills!

303
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,279
"Skills"?

304
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,490
-No! You deserve that!
-Señora!

305
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,825
Stay there!

306
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,997
-Serves you right!
-Señora!

307
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,718
Law of the Oppressed

308
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,061
Gi, I guess this is it.
We'll see you around.

309
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:15,065
When the restaurant bounces back,
you'll be my first call.

310
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,609
Thank you, Gi. You're so kind.

311
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,238
-Bye, Gi.
-Bye.

312
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,538
Sir, are you sure about firing them?

313
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,708
I don't see any other way to cut expenses.

314
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,960
But we're already short on staff.

315
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,005
That's why I think you'll need
to do double duty for now.

316
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,173
Take on serving duties during peak hours.

317
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,633
Hold on, sir.

318
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,095
I'm here as an assistant manager.

319
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,848
Not to brag, but I have a degree
in Hospitality Management,

320
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,433
and I graduated with honors.

321
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,184
I'm not here to wait tables.

322
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,938
So what if you got a degree?
Or you graduated with honors?

323
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,566
You don't care about the business.

324
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,527
-That's not true.
-You only think of yourself!

325
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,034
You still have a lot of kimchi to eat
before you can become a manager.

326
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,452
But, sir…

327
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,835
Betty!

328
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,295
Anyone home?

329
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,465
This is crazy. She's not even answering!

330
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,885
Who are you? How can I help you?

331
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,137
Are you Betty's daughter?

332
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,597
Why do you ask?

333
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,517
We've been knocking for a while now,
but no one's answering.

334
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,104
Please tell Betty
that this is just a friendly reminder.

335
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,648
She's way behind on her payment.

336
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,861
And instead of showing off on her socials,

337
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,448
she should just pay her debts on time.

338
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,949
Please tell her that.

339
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,172
Are they gone? Are they?

340
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,425
Who are they?

341
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,262
They're debt collectors.

342
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,140
I missed a few payments.

343
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,393
How long have you had this debt?

344
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:20,690
I don't remember. Maybe… a year?

345
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,027
I'm calling Daddy.

346
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,278
Sweetie, don't!

347
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,031
Don't call your dad.

348
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,327
I'll take care of it.
I'll figure something out.

349
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,206
Just please don't call your dad.
Don't tell him anything.

350
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,293
All right.

351
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,254
Okay. Don't worry anymore.

352
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,630
Thank you, sweetie.

353
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,258
You're so kind.

354
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,764
-I'm sorry.
-What's that?

355
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,015
Oh, no.

356
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,642
-Gigi!
-Here, let me help.

357
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,769
You made a mess and wasted food!

358
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,230
That will be deducted from your salary.

359
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,525
-It was an accident, sir. I'm sorry.
-Quick, clean it up!

360
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,735
Guests could slip on that mess.

361
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,571
I'll do it, sir.

362
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,450
Miss Gigi is better suited
for front of house.

363
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,411
She's an assistant manager, not a server.

364
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:18,331
What I need is the mop, not your opinion.
Go get it now!

365
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,416
Sorry, sir.

366
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,126
Hey.

367
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,757
Stupid.

368
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,594
Hey, table 18. Hurry up!

369
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,266
So stupid!

370
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,453
Sis.

371
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,829
Why does it stink outside?

372
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,082
Oh, I think Mom
should be the one to explain.

373
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,626
Why? What happened?

374
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,629
A courier came by earlier.

375
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,965
When I went out to get the parcel,

376
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,010
I was surprised to see who it was.

377
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,138
It was one of those collectors
who was hanging around outside.

378
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,600
They didn't just throw
hurtful words at me.

379
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,811
They also threw rotten eggs at me
and the house!

380
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,356
Why didn't you report it
to the authorities?

381
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,108
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

382
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,528
Sweetie,

383
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,531
maybe you can help me out.

384
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,282
Why me?

385
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,660
Why don't you call Daddy?

386
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,246
I can't do that.

387
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,082
He can't find out about this.

388
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,585
He'll be mad at me.

389
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:48,838
Honey.

390
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,550
Please help me out,

391
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,262
even if it's just a partial payment
of the interest.

392
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,848
I know you've saved some money.

393
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,018
Please help your mom. Please?

394
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,772
How much do you need?

395
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,191
Fifty thousand.

396
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,735
Fifty thousand?

397
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,306
Mister, follow that motorbike.

398
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,062
-We're here. Nice, right?
-Abet!

399
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,315
Wow, this is fancy!

400
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,238
-This is where we're eating?
-Food's good here.

401
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,573
Abet!

402
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,618
Who's she?

403
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,369
Gigi, wait, let me explain.

404
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,788
"Let me explain"?
Why was she on your bike?

405
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,206
Talk!

406
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,751
Not here. There's too many people.

407
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,546
Pizza?

408
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,841
You're taking her out for pizza? Really?

409
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,761
All this time,
you've only taken me to that pares place.

410
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,929
I've started smelling like star anise.

411
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,222
Calm down.

412
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,809
You didn't have the balls to break up
with me, so you decided to date us both?

413
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,937
You said you were saving up.
Saving up what? Sins?

414
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,107
-Gi, let's talk.
-Don't touch me! Back off!

415
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,819
This smell.

416
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,614
This is the putrid smell on my helmet!

417
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,034
Smells like flowers for the dead! Move!

418
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,244
Gi, please listen to me. Gi!

419
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,877
This is my helmet! I paid for this!

420
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,172
Abet, let's go.

421
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,965
Let's just eat "pecha" pie.

422
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,550
Forget about her.

423
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,475
Idiot!

424
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,143
Foolish!

425
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,229
Stupid!

426
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,022
Ill-bred!

427
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,774
-I'm so fed up--
-Mauricia!

428
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,444
Mimi! What are you doing to my only child?

429
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,862
This is nothing, Papá.

430
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,408
Darling, we are just playing a game.

431
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,994
Mother, Father, I want some bread

432
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,789
Sister, brother, I want some coffee

433
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,542
Everything I say, you must obey

434
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,753
If you mess up, you will get a slap

435
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,547
One, two, three, four

436
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,635
-That hurt.
-Sorry, Mamá.

437
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,723
Quick, one more time! Oh, sorry.

438
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,308
Mother, Father, I want some bread

439
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,893
Troublemaker!

440
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,104
Impudent!

441
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,648
Witch!

442
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,691
Mauricia!

443
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,486
Mimi! What are you doing to my only child?

444
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,488
This is nothing, Papá!

445
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,670
Smile, or you're not getting dinner.

446
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,061
Mauricia! Mimi!

447
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,647
What are you doing to my only child?

448
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,165
That's not enough!

449
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,292
I would've drowned her
in a barrel of wine!

450
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,880
That's what you get
if you act dumb and weak! Playing victim!

451
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,924
You deserve that, girl.

452
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,011
At last, Gigi.

453
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,305
You've finally seen the light.

454
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,432
Don't be afraid.

455
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,729
It's time for you to join us.

456
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,276
Wait. Gigi.

457
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,362
Gigi.

458
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,199
Gigi.

459
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,993
Gigi, where are you going? Come back here!

460
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,370
Gigi! Come back…

461
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,707
Oh well, you'll be back for sure.

462
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,384
Kamsahamnida.

463
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,261
Law of the Oppressed?

464
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,097
Does it exist? I've never heard of it.

465
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,265
It does.

466
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,392
Who's starring in it?

467
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,145
I don't know. They're not famous.
Probably indie or theater actors.

468
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,231
Seriously, though,
the villain talked to me.

469
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:01,568
She looked at me
and called me by name. She knows me!

470
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,655
Miss Gi, it looks like that TV
has some kind of supernatural power.

471
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,366
You know, you could just give it to me.

472
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,788
Hey, Gigi, Vicky, what's going on?

473
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,583
Table 14 has been trying to get
your attention for a while now.

474
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,418
You're just chatting away!

475
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,046
Hey, Vicky. I've had enough of you.

476
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,507
And you, Gigi,

477
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,136
better keep those diners happy
before they turn into cannibals.

478
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,727
What?

479
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,186
Whoa, babe!

480
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,647
You're so sweet!
I have a gift for you too.

481
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,649
Babe, I've got more for you.

482
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,091
Mirinisa!

483
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,468
Señorita?

484
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,561
What is it, Señorita Mimi?

485
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,605
Get me a freshly squeezed orange juice.

486
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,900
-It's too hot outside. Hurry up!
-Yes, ma'am.

487
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,580
Mirinisa!

488
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,207
What is it, Señora Mauricia?

489
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:07,170
Give this to your dad to drink.
It'll help make him stronger.

490
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,464
Understood?

491
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,548
Yes, ma'am.

492
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,550
-Do it now!
-Yes, ma'am!

493
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,103
Mirinisa!

494
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,237
Not only are you slow,
but you have the nerve to serve me last?

495
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,489
Give me that!

496
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,074
I'm sorry.

497
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,502
Papá.

498
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,422
Drink this to regain your strength.

499
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,837
Mamá!

500
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,881
-Mimi?
-Mamá!

501
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,596
Mimi.

502
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:43,599
Mimi!

503
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,313
Mimi!

504
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,363
Mimi!

505
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,407
Mimi!

506
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,619
What have you done to my child?

507
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,625
Mimi!

508
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,636
Mimi!

509
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,731
And I promise you

510
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:37,778
that I won't rest
until Arnulfo's grand mansion

511
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,490
and sprawling estate
are finally in my hands.

512
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,952
I will avenge you!

513
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,915
You will be avenged by me and

514
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,002
Gigi!

515
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,051
Me?

516
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,552
Why me?

517
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,678
What's wrong?

518
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,599
It's time for you
to accept your true power, Gigi.

519
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:10,394
Allow me to show you your full potential.

520
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,896
Just lean on me.

521
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,272
Welcome to our world, the Teleserye World!

522
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,732
Thank you for your trust.

523
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,596
The view is perfect!

524
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,974
The houses look different.

525
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,311
And the sunset, it's so beautiful!

526
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,230
I want to take a selfie everywhere I go.

527
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,817
In our world, every angle is beautiful.

528
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,988
Every nook and cranny is camera-ready,
always ready for action.

529
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,575
Our world thrives on drama.

530
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,910
And there's no drama without conflict.

531
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,246
Every great conflict is a battle
between good and evil.

532
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,374
Hero versus villain.

533
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,171
Hero and villain.

534
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:05,217
And right from the start,
I knew which side you were on.

535
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,937
Honk your horn at them.

536
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,065
Honk again.

537
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,985
-Move!
-How about them?

538
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,445
Are they heroes or villains?

539
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,155
They are extras.

540
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,910
They're part of this world

541
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:35,456
to make the scenes
feel more real and believable.

542
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,458
Townsfolk and such, you know.

543
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:46,342
They're the ones who failed
to become either heroes or villains.

544
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:50,596
Now, they're fine just being in
the background or sometimes the foreground

545
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,017
just passing by and doing all sorts
of things in the scene.

546
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,644
Sometimes they have lines, but…

547
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,524
What you should remember in this world…

548
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,659
As long as there is balance
between the forces of good and evil…

549
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,832
And when The Sponsor is happy,
the story stretches on,

550
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:22,336
the show continues,
and our existence carries forward.

551
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,465
You'll get it all later, as we go along.

552
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,303
You need to enroll first.

553
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,878
You will become
a full-fledged villain here.

554
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,213
Our school motto,

555
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,884
"There is no hero without a villain."

556
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,029
Who are they?

557
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,323
They are the founders of this school.

558
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:34,742
Impressive, right?

559
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,257
Minor in slander.

560
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,384
You're such an achiever.

561
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,683
Guess what my dissertation is.

562
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,601
What is it?

563
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:12,029
I was supposed to be at my defense,
but I got busy taping the show.

564
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:20,454
I've been recognized as an outstanding
alumna every year since graduation.

565
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,922
…as head bitch-slash-loudmouth-
slash-demoness.

566
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,216
You're so hardworking.

567
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,636
Not to brag,
but what I'm trying to say is this.

568
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,774
Class, furrow your eyebrows.

569
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,905
Smile while pointing your lips
to the right!

570
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:59,535
And slowly point your lips forward!

571
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,289
Wider!

572
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:11,463
That will be
your default facial expression

573
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,341
even when no one's around! Understood?

574
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,057
Your mom… Go!

575
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,560
Your mom's poor!

576
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,687
Your mom's dirt-poor!

577
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,938
Your mom's blue!

578
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,231
Your mom's pink!

579
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,568
Your mom eats pigeons!

580
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,321
Your mom's a dirty pigeon, a slu--

581
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,454
They're so cute.

582
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,396
Miss Mauricia, I don't think I can do it.

583
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,648
You can.

584
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,358
I believe in you.

585
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,985
If you finish this course,

586
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,571
your life outside
will become so much better.

587
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,032
In fact, after graduation,

588
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:23,577
there's a role waiting for you
in Law of the Oppressed.

589
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,746
For me?

590
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,083
I'm going to recommend you
as Mimi's replacement.

591
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,213
But why me?

592
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,261
This is our first time outsourcing talent
from the human world.

593
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:47,559
All the things you're going through
with your job, family, and love life,

594
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:52,481
I can sense the blood boiling within you.

595
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,860
You're like a ticking time bomb,
ready to explode at any moment.

596
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:07,287
…will make you the finest villain
my world and your world have ever seen.

597
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,214
It's about time you found some happiness.

598
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,890
Can I read it first?

599
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,653
Welcome to your villain era.

600
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:20,652
Here at the Kontrabida Academy,
history is all about what?

601
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:41,590
Here at Kontrabida Academy,
history is all about digging dirt.

602
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,890
Dig up dirt on the person
you want revenge on,

603
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:55,312
like their dating history,
family history, or even browsing history.

604
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,147
Dig deep.

605
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:58,982
Dig thoroughly.

606
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:04,279
Look for your target's weaknesses
and dirty laundry.

607
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,621
Use every bit of dirt you find
as leverage.

608
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:15,499
Make sure they stay under your power

609
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:19,169
until they kneel before you
and beg for mercy.

610
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,751
I've got you, Jingo.

611
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,884
Here at the Kontrabida Academy…

612
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,057
The art we're talking about is you.

613
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:21,064
It is all about finding and creating
your look as the main villain.

614
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,458
…to anyone you come in contact with.

615
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:45,172
You're all in luck today
because we're having a makeover session

616
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,425
for one of you.

617
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,224
Gigi.

618
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,731
Sounds like a child's name.

619
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,483
Or a best friend.

620
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,903
That name doesn't give off
main character vibes.

621
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,614
All the best villains…

622
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,995
Lavini-ah!

623
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,915
Selin-ah!

624
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,626
Claudi-ah.

625
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,799
Are we changing my name?

626
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,075
What nonsense is it this time?

627
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:54,384
And what did you do to your uniform?
That's against company policy!

628
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,111
Clap your hands.

629
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,991
Ma'am, sir, what are you doing here?

630
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,952
So that's why,
out of all SamgyupToSawa branches,

631
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,038
this one was always in the red.

632
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,291
You've been up to some shenanigans.

633
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,468
…and crossmatched them with the
order slips for pork belly and kimchi.

634
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,931
All the entries in the books
are overpriced.

635
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:48,897
You've been stealing
from someone else's business?

636
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,570
We've seen all the discrepancies.

637
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,573
Not only did I study
Hospitality Management,

638
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,700
I also minored in accounting.

639
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,956
Drop the bomb!

640
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,129
Lastly…

641
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:17,384
This is the proof
of where you've been spending

642
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,470
the money stolen from this restaurant.

643
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,350
So that's why,
even though you always leave early,

644
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:30,272
you still come into work
reeking the next day.

645
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,817
You smell worse than pungent kimchi

646
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,071
because you had practically
made the casino your home.

647
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:43,034
You'd better clean out
your personal belongings from your office.

648
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,953
You're not coming back in here ever.

649
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,875
Officers, please keep a close watch
on this thief.

650
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,170
-Who knows what else he'll steal?
-Wait!

651
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,173
Wait! Let go of me!

652
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,008
You traitor!

653
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,979
All you ever did was belittle me,

654
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:15,483
push me around,
and treat me like I'm a fool.

655
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,031
Well, take a good look at this face.

656
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:27,370
This is the face
of this restaurant's new manager!

657
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:28,997
Let go of me!

658
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,583
-Come on.
-You will pay for this, Gigi!

659
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,126
You will pay for this!

660
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,716
What?

661
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,426
-Come with us.
-Wait! Ma'am, sir!

662
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,887
Help me! Let go of me!

663
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,475
Clap your hands.

664
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:55,607
Gia, Gia, Gia!

665
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,741
Let's drink to that!

666
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:23,385
That's why it's time
to expand your vocabulary.

667
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:52,163
Remember the three points
to perfect an insult.

668
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,921
What a miserable life you have!

669
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,215
No love life, no social life,

670
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,134
even your family detests you.

671
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,219
Nobody cares.

672
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,898
It's you!

673
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:22,610
You wanted to go to Boracay, but all
you could afford was Dolomite Beach.

674
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,168
You almost looked good,
then you turned to face me.

675
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,931
Here at the Kontrabida Academy…

676
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:01,983
If X is equal to hate,
raised to the power of Y,

677
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,986
and Y is equal to deceit,

678
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,906
divided by the square root of Z,

679
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:11,493
and Z is equal
to the level of gullibility,

680
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,329
the result is equal to?

681
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:26,674
If A is equal to doubt,
and B is equal to suspicion…

682
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:41,356
Now, if X is equal to an old, rich man
on the brink of death…

683
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,504
Are these all your credit cards, Mommy?

684
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,132
Yes.

685
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,675
Tell me the truth.

686
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,262
Yes, that's all!

687
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,098
I switch between all my credit cards.

688
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,726
We already know how you operate.

689
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,689
Cut them all up.

690
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,692
Cut every single one!

691
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,572
But what will I use if I do that?

692
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,824
If you don't cut them up,

693
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,869
we'll disown you as our mother!

694
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,594
Apply everything you've learned.

695
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,980
Travis, give me Mommy's phone.

696
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,985
Candy, type in Mommy's password.

697
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:17,243
You're going to make a video
to send to Daddy in Bahrain.

698
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,828
And why would I do that?

699
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:19,746
Why?

700
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,665
Because if you won't do it,

701
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,168
we will.

702
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:31,966
We're going to expose everything
you've done with this family's money.

703
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:36,971
You will own up to your mistakes now.

704
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:43,144
You're going to promise to sell
all this junk you bought!

705
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:48,399
Lastly, and most importantly,

706
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:54,155
you'll transfer Daddy's remittances
to my account.

707
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,407
Every month.

708
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,201
Hold on.

709
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,371
Why would I do that?

710
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,707
Perhaps you've forgotten
that you are my children!

711
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,295
Don't give in to emotional blackmail.

712
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:20,974
Your children, whom you have drowned
in debt and shame!

713
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,269
If you don't do this,

714
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,771
the three of us will leave you for good!

715
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,731
Do you understand?

716
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,404
Are you ready?

717
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,574
Are you ready?

718
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,326
I'm ready. Absolutely ready.

719
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:42,829
Action.

720
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:52,171
I have… I have something to tell you.

721
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:07,520
Not to brag, but I'm the best coach…

722
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:14,027
Do you know why
Mauricia's so good at slapping?

723
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,947
Because I taught her that.

724
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,116
That's true.

725
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,545
Ow, that hurts! But…

726
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,265
Okay.

727
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,225
Slap like an Olympian.

728
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:50,021
That was the slap
that could knock the hero into a coma.

729
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:51,814
This is the kind of slap

730
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:55,985
that would give the hero
temporary amnesia.

731
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:08,998
Oh no.

732
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:12,919
Who are you?

733
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,004
Where am I?

734
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,889
In this class,
I'll teach you which liquids

735
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,600
to splash on the hero's body…

736
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:34,857
Mauricia.

737
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:46,536
I want to know if you still remember
everything I taught you.

738
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:03,970
Straight to the nostrils.

739
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:10,518
If it's coffee, tea, or hot chocolate…

740
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,567
Zero in on the outfit
for guaranteed stains!

741
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,741
Now, I'm going to teach you

742
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:28,578
how to shove the hero's face into a cake.

743
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,124
-I can help.
-No, it's okay.

744
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,460
-I can demonstrate.
-I said it's okay, Mauricia!

745
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,339
Get away from me, damn it!

746
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,259
-I want to help.
-No. I already told you!

747
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,735
The "pecha" pie here is really delicious.

748
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:15,750
Gigi?

749
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,460
Is it really you?

750
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,504
Why?

751
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,422
Are you mesmerized?

752
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,176
It's still me, Abet.

753
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,682
Fiercer,

754
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,601
braver,

755
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:35,770
smarter.

756
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,737
Aren't you going to introduce me

757
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,739
to Miss "Pecha" Pie?

758
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,408
This is Peachy.

759
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:52,995
Peachy,

760
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,748
who loves "pecha" pie.

761
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:02,547
Your real name
is Patricia Marie Pinagong, correct?

762
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,465
What's it to you, huh?

763
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,262
Do you still remember the old you?

764
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,273
Where did you get this?

765
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,235
That's you in the pictures?

766
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:25,903
I don't know this woman!

767
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:31,033
A liar is just a thief in disguise.

768
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,454
A thief of someone else's boyfriend!

769
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,465
…for New Me Aesthetic Center.

770
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,846
I'm not sure. I don't go there.

771
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:54,807
Can I have one?

772
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:02,607
Now it makes sense.
You got the procedure for free.

773
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,651
What does this mean?
Were you lying to me the whole time?

774
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,749
-Yeah!
-I taught her that move!

775
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,294
You've been scammed, kid.

776
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:27,256
Good luck with your future babies.

777
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:31,344
They'll probably look like Neanderthals
since you're pretty average.

778
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,804
But if your mission
is to spread ugly genes…

779
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,939
Is this water or soda?

780
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,482
Water.

781
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,364
Boom!

782
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,950
Bullseye! Straight to the nose!

783
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:02,416
That's for the seven years
of my life you wasted!

784
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,087
This is just the beginning, Abet.
I'm only getting started!

785
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,755
I will mess up your life,

786
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:13,803
and I won't stop until you regret
the day you were born into this world!

787
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:24,188
Yes!

788
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,857
-Yes!
-Yes!

789
01:06:58,472 --> 01:06:59,765
To all my professors,

790
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:05,062
thank you so much for your patience,
the darkness in your souls,

791
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:08,524
and all the evil you've taught me.

792
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:14,572
And to the one who saw my potential and
believed I could become who I am today,

793
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:18,200
a full-fledged villain,

794
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:24,040
Mauricia, this medal's for you.

795
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:29,336
And to my classmates,
who are also graduating today,

796
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,965
let us unleash chaos together!

797
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,009
And always remember this.

798
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:36,886
There are no heroes

799
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:40,431
if there are no villains!

800
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:33,776
I'm so nervous.

801
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:36,779
Don't be nervous. Be excited instead.

802
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:40,950
Move!

803
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,211
Arnulfo.

804
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:05,266
She's the younger sister of Mimi.

805
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,563
Gia, meet your new Papá.

806
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:19,780
Welcome to our opulent mansion.

807
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:24,910
Thank you, Papá.

808
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:30,749
And this is Arnaldo,
the only grandchild of Doña Auring,

809
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:35,379
the owner of the vast hacienda
on the other side of town.

810
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,924
Aha! So you're Arnaldo.

811
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:44,346
Now I know why my dead sister
was dead set on having you.

812
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,641
It's my pleasure to meet you, Gia.

813
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,355
I'll take Don Arnulfo out
for a walk in the garden

814
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,108
to get some fresh air.

815
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,795
You're responsible for the death of Mimi.

816
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:24,637
What you did was unforgivable!
This is for you!

817
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,059
Slap her harder.

818
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:32,686
But the poor thing
hasn't done anything to me.

819
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:40,986
Get to the kitchen and separate
those spring roll wrappers, one by one!

820
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,947
-Do you understand?
-Yes, ma'am!

821
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:47,076
Lazybones! Get those instant
coffee mix ingredients sorted out now!

822
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:56,794
Gia, you're the one
who should've slapped Mirinisa!

823
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:59,088
Just a reminder, stick to the script.

824
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:02,174
Yes, sir. Sorry, it's my first day.

825
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,526
-Pull my hair.
-Okay.

826
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,361
Pull harder.

827
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,572
Harder!

828
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:29,201
I'll do it.

829
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:33,706
Ouch!

830
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,500
Please, have mercy on me.

831
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,464
-It's that easy.
-Oh, okay.

832
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:06,613
Breathe in!

833
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,291
-Do as I do.
-Sure.

834
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:29,053
Miss! What's wrong with your food?
Look, there's a worm in it!

835
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,888
There's no worm! Eat it!

836
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,891
But there is a bug on your face!

837
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:36,060
Eat that! It's nutritious!

838
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,565
Eat it!

839
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:43,233
Yes, ma'am. I will eat it.

840
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,330
What now?

841
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,248
I'm choking!

842
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:00,626
Water, please!

843
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,878
-You're ordering me around?
-What?

844
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:03,796
You get it.

845
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:07,049
-Get it yourself!
-Yes, ma'am. All right.

846
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:14,098
-Are you done?
-Yeah.

847
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:15,724
Put it back!

848
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,059
Isn't that your job?

849
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,728
Okay, I'll put it back.

850
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,690
Anything else I can do for you?

851
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,760
Add some more!

852
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:54,930
Give me that.

853
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,272
-Kamsahamnida!
-Kamsahamnida!

854
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:06,275
-Can you give me some cab fare?
-No way!

855
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,007
Order rice as well.

856
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,425
-Miss Gia.
-Yes?

857
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:35,471
Miss Gia, I think
we have a celebrity dining here.

858
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,806
-Who?
-Over there.

859
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:43,645
What are you doing here?

860
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,356
How did you get out
of the Teleserye World?

861
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,941
You left the TV on.

862
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,402
But don't worry.

863
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,489
No one in your family saw me.

864
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,575
Are you following me?

865
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,202
Anything wrong with that?

866
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,120
Is someone going to get mad?

867
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,749
No. No one.

868
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,044
Are you ordering anything?

869
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,963
Do you even eat? Why are you here?

870
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:13,133
Give me a tour of your world,
if that's okay with you.

871
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,137
Can we have coffee? Or a conversation?

872
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:21,642
I'm sorry if I showed up unexpectedly.

873
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:26,313
The truth is,
I've been watching you for a while now.

874
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:27,272
Why?

875
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:32,569
I've never met anyone like you before,
someone not from our world.

876
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,364
Life is much better in your world.

877
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,785
Fresh air, no traffic, no crime.

878
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,412
This world is chaotic and exhausting.

879
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:46,041
Your world isn't the reason I'm here.

880
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:52,965
You are.

881
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,218
You like me? How's that possible?

882
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,302
Why not?

883
01:15:58,136 --> 01:15:59,846
You told me no one would get mad.

884
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:03,976
What's wrong? Don't you like the idea?

885
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,896
Who am I to refuse someone like you?

886
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:09,982
You're so perfect.

887
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:15,153
But we're not a good match.
I'm a villain after all.

888
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,156
You? A villain?

889
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,492
You couldn't even slap Mirinisa.

890
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,078
You couldn't even give me
a good lap dance.

891
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:27,332
I watched you excusing yourself
while passing in front of the extras.

892
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,042
Have you been observing me?

893
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,337
Do people in your world use

894
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:34,339
the word "crush"?

895
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,425
Of course.

896
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,136
There. That's what you are to me.

897
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,265
Can you please tone down
your leading man act?

898
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:46,268
Don't smile at me like that!

899
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,103
You heroes.

900
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,772
You're deceiving me, trying to seduce me.

901
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:51,815
I am not.

902
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:53,984
I am not acting.

903
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:57,070
I'm just being my natural charming self.

904
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:22,262
There. The TV's on.
You may go back to your world.

905
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:23,972
Will you come with me?

906
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,558
Why should I? I'm not filming today.

907
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,187
I have something to show you.

908
01:18:11,978 --> 01:18:15,732
I feel so out of place here.
Everyone's very nice.

909
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:18,193
Everyone seems so kind.

910
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,404
You're like angels.

911
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:23,407
That's because our motto at San Bida is…

912
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:30,414
Did you get it?

913
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,041
Be the…

914
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,251
-Yeah, right.
-Bida!

915
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,044
Corny, but I get it.

916
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:40,173
WRONG PEOPLE

917
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:47,973
This is what you study here?

918
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:09,578
If someone throws a rock at you,
what would you throw in return?

919
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:11,788
A much bigger rock.

920
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:14,875
A grenade?

921
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:20,130
When someone throws a rock at you,

922
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:22,716
throw them a piece of bread in return.

923
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,471
When someone slaps you on your left cheek…

924
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:29,306
You should kick them?

925
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:32,684
You pull their hair?

926
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:40,525
When someone slaps you on your left cheek,
offer them your right cheek.

927
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:46,740
If there's a will, there's a…

928
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:48,533
-Curry stew!
-Tapsilog!

929
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,119
Sour soup!

930
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,043
You think it's easy to learn all that?

931
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:02,964
It's not easy to be patient,
modest, or hopeful.

932
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,425
Why did you bring me here?

933
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:07,886
So you'd see the other side.

934
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:09,346
What for?

935
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,265
I know you're not evil.

936
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:18,814
So, you think I'm cut out
to be a hero, not a villain?

937
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:20,941
What I think?

938
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,862
Only you can answer that.

939
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,264
I'm getting off.

940
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:54,516
Driver, stop!

941
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:58,019
Ouch! Watch your driving, mister!

942
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:01,147
Are you okay?

943
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:03,316
I'm okay.

944
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:09,990
I brought gifts for you.

945
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:54,242
Relaxing, isn't it?

946
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,578
-Let me.
-Try it.

947
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:30,612
For you, Gia.

948
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,197
-Thank you.
-Gia!

949
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:33,907
Mauricia!

950
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:36,159
Why are you here?

951
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:38,119
Stay away from Arnaldo!

952
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:44,167
You signed a contract,
and it clearly says here that,

953
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,671
"A hero and a villain
can never fall in love."

954
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,423
We're not in love. We're just friends.

955
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:58,682
I can see from the twinkle in your eyes

956
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:03,103
and from your body language
where this relationship is going.

957
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:07,399
Arnaldo, if this reaches The Sponsor,

958
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,110
you will suffer the same fate as Mimi.

959
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,697
Why? What happened to Mimi?

960
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:17,242
She was banished
to the Island of Has-beens!

961
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:22,956
-Hey!
-Hey!

962
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:26,292
You startled me!

963
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:30,880
Mimi, my seductive daughter,
got involved with an extra,

964
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,633
a peasant with no speaking lines.

965
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,929
When such forbidden love occurs,

966
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,850
this world loses its balance
and order is lost.

967
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:44,894
Thus, it is strictly prohibited
by The Sponsor.

968
01:23:47,647 --> 01:23:49,315
As punishment,

969
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:52,944
the character of Mimi,
my seductive daughter, was killed.

970
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,114
Give me a project.

971
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:59,659
And she was sent
to the Island of Has-beens

972
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,204
along with all those whose fame has faded.

973
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:09,419
-Give me a project!
-Give me a project!

974
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:14,007
And as for you, Gia,
you will go back to being Gigi,

975
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,801
a pushover, a doormat, a wimp!

976
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:20,305
You will lose all your self-confidence,

977
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:24,100
and people in your world
will once again trample on you.

978
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:37,363
Arnaldo, if you don't stop
this foolishness,

979
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:41,451
I will personally report you
to The Sponsor.

980
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,303
Sweetie, are you still mad at me?

981
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:08,853
I did everything you asked me to do.

982
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:15,568
Please forgive me for being selfish.

983
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:22,033
I just wanted to be like
those actors on TV

984
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:25,662
and those influencers on social media.

985
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:31,793
I'm not mad at you anymore, Mom.

986
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:34,462
Really?

987
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:35,964
Really.

988
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:37,841
Thank you.

989
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:46,266
Here. Add anything you want to that cart.

990
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:49,018
My treat. Just one item, okay?

991
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:50,478
Really?

992
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:55,650
Oh, I've missed this so much!

993
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,820
Just one item, okay?

994
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:01,156
Yes, dear, just one.

995
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,119
I'm joking.

996
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:11,666
Annyeong haseyo. SamgyupToSawa.

997
01:26:19,632 --> 01:26:24,220
No matter how many times I say I'm sorry,
I know you won't forgive me easily.

998
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:30,351
But I don't think I'm the only person in
the world who's ever fallen out of love.

999
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:36,482
I don't know.
Perhaps we'd been together for so long

1000
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:39,861
everything became routine.

1001
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:44,073
My mistake was…

1002
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:49,204
I couldn't tell you that--

1003
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:51,289
You no longer had feelings for me.

1004
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:52,874
You have to admit it.

1005
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:57,253
You no longer had feelings for me either.

1006
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:58,922
And I could feel that.

1007
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:05,053
Perhaps I was wrong
to set my mind on that future

1008
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,848
where we'd get married,
have kids, and raise a family.

1009
01:27:09,515 --> 01:27:13,102
But not because I loved you
or we loved each other.

1010
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:18,566
Maybe I wanted a new chapter.

1011
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:23,196
I wanted to run away
just for the sake of moving forward.

1012
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:30,828
Gia.

1013
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:44,467
What about Peachy Pie?
Do you really love her?

1014
01:27:51,724 --> 01:27:53,101
I hope you'll be happy.

1015
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,898
If our children end up
looking like monkeys,

1016
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:02,151
that's fine. I'll just sign them up
for plastic surgery.

1017
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:15,748
Gigi?

1018
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,379
-Jingo?
-Yes, it's me.

1019
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:23,006
You look fresh.

1020
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,887
I hope you have some time.
Let's have breakfast.

1021
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:33,016
Come on!

1022
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:38,104
What happened to you?

1023
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:40,773
What's with this positive aura?

1024
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:43,359
Did you win the lottery?

1025
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:45,445
Have you found God? What is it?

1026
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:49,532
You know, getting fired from SamgyupToSawa

1027
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:52,285
was the best thing
that has happened to me.

1028
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,664
Maybe I just really needed a break.

1029
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:04,213
I'm slowly paying off my debt
to the owners of SamgyupToSawa.

1030
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:06,758
I also went back to college,

1031
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:10,928
so I wouldn't feel so small
around educated people like you.

1032
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:17,268
I'm also working out now.
Calisthenics, yoga, and Pilates.

1033
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:20,813
And most importantly,

1034
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,525
I quit gambling.

1035
01:29:30,656 --> 01:29:31,491
I'm sorry.

1036
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:35,953
I'm sorry for treating you badly.

1037
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:40,958
I know that you didn't deserve
to be in such a toxic environment.

1038
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:46,547
I'm sorry too
for becoming a villain in your life.

1039
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,758
No, you weren't. No!

1040
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:52,887
I am happy with my life right now.

1041
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:58,184
You don't need to apologize.
You just did what you thought was right.

1042
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:00,353
You are not a villain.

1043
01:30:06,442 --> 01:30:10,446
Ouch, Gia, please stop! It hurts!

1044
01:30:14,033 --> 01:30:16,411
Gia, please believe me.

1045
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:21,082
I didn't steal your necklace.
Stealing isn't in our blood.

1046
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:25,253
Liar. If you didn't steal it,
why was it in your dresser?

1047
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:27,171
Mamá, didn't you find the necklace there?

1048
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:28,840
Yes, exactly!

1049
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,134
Arnulfo, darling,

1050
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:35,847
are you going to let your daughter
get away with committing such a crime?

1051
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:40,143
Isn't it about time to banish her
from this very opulent mansion?

1052
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:42,603
Calm down, Mauricia.

1053
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:44,605
Please have mercy on Mirinisa.

1054
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:04,625
Fight back, Mirinisa.

1055
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:06,335
Fight back.

1056
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:15,136
Don Arnulfo, it was Mauricia
who stole the necklace.

1057
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:18,139
She was the one who put it
in Mirinisa's dresser.

1058
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:20,600
Gia, what are you talking about?

1059
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:21,601
It's true.

1060
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:25,855
Don Arnulfo, Mauricia is manipulating you.

1061
01:31:25,938 --> 01:31:28,524
She's poisoning not only your body
but also your mind.

1062
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:35,490
Isn't it Mauricia's role
to make my life miserable?

1063
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,742
To make all of our lives miserable?

1064
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:46,626
Aren't you supposed to push me?
Then I hit my head, get amnesia,

1065
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:49,086
forget all about Arnaldo,

1066
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,797
and you celebrate because now he's yours?

1067
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,760
Mirinisa, you are the hero of this story.

1068
01:31:56,594 --> 01:32:00,765
In fact, this should no longer happen.
You should change the title.

1069
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:02,934
Enough with Law of the Oppressed.

1070
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:06,187
Make it The World of Mirinisa.

1071
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:07,772
-Gia.
-Right!

1072
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:10,358
-It should've been changed ages ago!
-About time!

1073
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:13,319
-Yes, change the title!
-Change it!

1074
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:15,154
Change the entire program!

1075
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:17,365
-Indeed!
-That's right!

1076
01:32:17,448 --> 01:32:18,282
Enough!

1077
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,332
We all have roles to play here.

1078
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:29,085
There's a hero, and there's a villain.

1079
01:32:29,168 --> 01:32:32,171
And who gave you the right
to deliver dialogue?

1080
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:36,050
You're a villain, Mauricia,
yet you always act like a main character.

1081
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:41,389
And you are my life's biggest mistake!

1082
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:43,641
I picked up a piece of trash!

1083
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:47,436
You're much worse than Mirinisa!
You don't fit in this world.

1084
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,354
Maybe so.

1085
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:53,192
I don't fit in here
because in my world, the Real World,

1086
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:57,822
a person can be both a hero and a villain,
and that's perfectly fine.

1087
01:32:58,322 --> 01:32:59,907
Well, not in this world!

1088
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:04,453
And if we don't fulfill
our designated roles, it will be the end!

1089
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:08,374
All of this and all of you will disappear!

1090
01:33:08,457 --> 01:33:10,459
-That's not true!
-Who said that?

1091
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,670
It's always the same thing.

1092
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:16,257
-I'm sick of being an NPC!
-Why are you talking?

1093
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,301
You shouldn't be speaking!

1094
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:20,011
Why are you talking to me?

1095
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:22,346
Why am I even talking to you?

1096
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:24,890
Because they want change.

1097
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,817
Mauricia!

1098
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:39,363
Director!

1099
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:44,452
I told you, Mauricia,
getting someone from outside won't work.

1100
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:46,454
That Gia is a troublemaker.

1101
01:33:46,537 --> 01:33:48,956
It was just an experiment, Director.

1102
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,458
Are you the director?

1103
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,044
Yes, that's right.

1104
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:58,215
And you, Gia, you're a burden.
Why didn't you follow the script?

1105
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:02,970
Director, maybe you can think
of a fresh storyline for the new season,

1106
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:06,724
where people actually think.
Aren't you tired of this formula?

1107
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:10,311
-How…
-Go ahead!

1108
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:12,688
Brainstorm away.

1109
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:15,733
I'm going to the very top,

1110
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:17,360
to The Sponsor!

1111
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:22,490
And I will make sure that all of you
will end up on the Island of Has-beens!

1112
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:35,002
Mauricia! Mauricia, where are you going?

1113
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:49,141
Let's go after Mauricia!

1114
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:20,423
Mauricia!

1115
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,527
Where is The Sponsor?

1116
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,821
Mauricia? Is that you?

1117
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:47,408
Where's The Sponsor?

1118
01:35:51,495 --> 01:35:54,039
In the corner office at the far end.

1119
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:58,836
Mauricia!

1120
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,463
Mauricia!

1121
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:13,434
-Where?
-In the conference room.

1122
01:36:14,685 --> 01:36:15,811
Mauricia?

1123
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:17,354
Mauricia!

1124
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:19,815
Mauricia!

1125
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:21,776
Mauricia!

1126
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:24,028
Mauricia!

1127
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:31,577
Mauricia!

1128
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:33,996
Mauricia! Here.

1129
01:36:35,247 --> 01:36:37,291
-Where's Mauricia?
-She's inside, Director.

1130
01:36:37,374 --> 01:36:39,043
Let's go that way! Hurry!

1131
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:00,523
There's been some trouble downstairs.

1132
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:05,903
Banish them to the Island of Has-beens!

1133
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:06,904
Wait up!

1134
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:10,908
Director, what is going on here?

1135
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:26,841
It's her!

1136
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:29,218
She caused all this trouble.

1137
01:37:29,718 --> 01:37:31,262
Sue her!

1138
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:37,643
They all want this show to shut down!

1139
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:43,858
We just want some change. It's about time.

1140
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:47,486
Young lady, change is dangerous.

1141
01:37:57,329 --> 01:37:59,331
We're overflowing with hope,

1142
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:03,544
but what use is hope if nothing changes?

1143
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:07,131
What I learned from being a villain, sir,

1144
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:10,301
is that being a villain
is not about being evil.

1145
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:17,224
And what I'm fighting for is right.

1146
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:20,352
There's a lot that needs to be changed
in our show, right?

1147
01:38:20,853 --> 01:38:22,271
Yes, she's right.

1148
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:27,818
How are the ratings
of Law of the Oppressed?

1149
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:49,965
-Oh, me?
-Yes.

1150
01:38:51,842 --> 01:38:53,010
Well, Gia?

1151
01:38:53,552 --> 01:38:57,640
What show would you replace
Law of the Oppressed with? Nothing?

1152
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:02,061
Wait! Mr. Sponsor, sir.

1153
01:39:02,645 --> 01:39:05,564
We can make a limited series
based on Noli Me Tangere

1154
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:09,401
but with a Bridgerton spin to it.
Don't you agree, Director?

1155
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:10,945
Noli Me Tangere?

1156
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:16,450
We can also do a culinary docuseries show

1157
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:19,203
about different versions of adobo
from various regions.

1158
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:22,998
And for Season 2, we can feature
different types of longganisa.

1159
01:39:23,082 --> 01:39:27,044
Adobo? Longganisa? Is this a wet market?
Who would watch that?

1160
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:29,338
Mixed genre drama series.

1161
01:39:29,421 --> 01:39:32,049
Like an action-musical.

1162
01:39:32,549 --> 01:39:33,884
A whodunit comedy.

1163
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,970
It could also be a suspense-thriller BL.

1164
01:39:36,553 --> 01:39:39,974
Mixed genre. Nonsense.
That's not possible.

1165
01:40:03,205 --> 01:40:04,331
-Director.
-Yes?

1166
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:13,173
Okay.

1167
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:15,426
-Leave.
-Leave. Right.

1168
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:16,844
-Back to the set.
-Okay.

1169
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:18,429
-Wait for me there.
-Sure.

1170
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:22,850
-Hey, what was that? I'm confused.
-A series about Noli Me Tangere.

1171
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:34,862
And why are you still here?

1172
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:41,493
-I hope he approves.
-Right.

1173
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:43,412
Exciting. What will they talk about?

1174
01:40:43,495 --> 01:40:44,496
Gia.

1175
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:49,334
Are you happy now?

1176
01:40:50,335 --> 01:40:52,963
If nobody watches these new shows,

1177
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:55,382
it will be your fault!

1178
01:40:57,176 --> 01:40:59,595
How will we know if we don't try?

1179
01:41:02,389 --> 01:41:05,392
You are the villain of my life!

1180
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:13,108
Being a hero suits you just fine.

1181
01:41:28,624 --> 01:41:29,583
Hi, Miss Gi.

1182
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:31,251
Hey!

1183
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:35,339
Miss Gi, thank you so much.

1184
01:41:35,839 --> 01:41:37,466
You didn't forget about us.

1185
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:39,218
I told you, didn't I?

1186
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:42,971
Once the restaurant bounces back,
you'll be my first call.

1187
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:44,765
-Thank you.
-Thank you, ma'am.

1188
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:49,144
And since our finances
are doing well, Vicky…

1189
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:50,145
Yes?

1190
01:41:50,729 --> 01:41:53,440
There's something wrong
with your nameplate.

1191
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:57,569
Hold on.
I think this will suit you better.

1192
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:09,039
-Miss Vicky!
-Miss Gigi, gosh!

1193
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:10,916
Don't worry.

1194
01:42:10,999 --> 01:42:15,337
I promise you I will be
the best assistant manager ever.

1195
01:42:15,879 --> 01:42:17,548
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.

1196
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:20,175
You deserve it.
You're great at what you do.

1197
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:21,969
-Right?
-Yes!

1198
01:42:22,052 --> 01:42:24,555
-Treat us to lunch, Vicky!
-Request an advance!

1199
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:26,557
Okay, back to work. Come on.

1200
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,808
She's strict.

1201
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,811
Just kidding. Go on.

1202
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:50,706
Hello.

1203
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:54,209
You're just in time.

1204
01:42:59,756 --> 01:43:02,718
What do you want to do tonight?
Are we going out?

1205
01:43:03,635 --> 01:43:07,055
No, let's just stay here.
Let's watch something.

1206
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:12,227
What are we watching?

1207
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,813
My favorite show has a new episode.

1208
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:16,690
All right.

1209
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,324
THE FOREST

1210
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,117
There!

1211
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:28,076
That one?

1212
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:41,715
I am now the queen of this grand mansion.

1213
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:46,303
I'm the sole owner of this vast hacienda.

1214
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:48,388
I'm the only one left here.

1215
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:52,434
And I'm the only one left
to clean all this.
