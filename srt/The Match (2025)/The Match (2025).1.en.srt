1
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,331
BASED ON THE TRUE STORY OF GO PLAYERS
CHO HOON-HYUN AND LEE CHANG-HO.

2
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,000
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
MAY DIFFER FROM REAL-LIFE COUNTERPARTS.

3
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,670
THE YING SHIBEI WORLD GO CHAMPIONSHIP
WAS HELD IN THE 1980S

4
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,922
TO FIND THE WORLD CHAMPION.

5
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,840
ONE SPOT WAS GIVEN TO KOREA,
AN UNDERDOG COUNTRY.

6
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,093
CHO HOON-HYUN 9-DAN ADVANCED
TO THE FINAL AGAINST EXPECTATIONS.

7
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,678
HIS OPPONENT, NIE WEIPING 9-DAN OF CHINA,
KNOWN AS "THE BLACK BEAR OF THE CONTINENT"

8
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,680
WON THE CHINA-JAPAN SUPER LEAGUE
11 CONSECUTIVE TIMES

9
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,932
AND WAS THE WORLD'S BEST PLAYER.

10
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:45,313
The last round of the first Ying Shibei
World Professional Go Championship Final

11
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,732
will be held in Singapore today.

12
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,985
Korea's Cho Hoon-hyun 9-dan
and China's Nie Weiping 9-dan,

13
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,821
tied at two wins and two losses each,

14
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:56,783
will battle in the match of the century
to become the King of Go.

15
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,245
White has won all the previous rounds,

16
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:04,457
so there's great interest
in who'll be white in the final round.

17
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,959
He's here.

18
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,795
A word, please.

19
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,131
Mr. Cho, how are you feeling?

20
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,966
How did you prepare for today's match?

21
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,426
What if you choose black?

22
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,929
-Are you going to attack fiercely?
-Nie Weiping!

23
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,849
Piss off to Korea!

24
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:25,603
China will definitely win!

25
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,941
MATCH VENUE
STAMFORD HOTEL, SINGAPORE

26
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,494
Nie Weiping 9-dan, white.

27
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,372
Cho Hoon-hyun 9-dan, black.

28
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,306
Let the match begin.

29
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,602
THE 1ST YING SHIBEI
WORLD GO CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL, LAST ROUND

30
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,688
CHO HOON-HYUN 9-DAN VS NIE WEIPING 9-DAN

31
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:41,346
THE MATCH

32
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:45,934
Korea's Cho Hoon-hyun 9-dan has ascended
to the top of the international Go scene.

33
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,437
Cho defeated not only Japan,
which boasts of being

34
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,439
the center of the world Go scene,

35
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,025
but China, where Go originated,

36
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:58,238
and his victory proves that the quality
of Korean Go is top-class.

37
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,864
Right now,

38
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,952
I feel like I couldn't lose
to the God of Go himself.

39
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,537
Cho Hoon-hyun 9-dan,
the Go world champion,

40
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,747
returned to Korea today.

41
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,583
Cho 9-dan took part in a unique parade
from Gimpo Airport

42
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,544
to the Korea Baduk Association
located in Jongno 2-ga.

43
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,713
The government has decided to award Cho

44
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,299
with the Eungwan Order of Culture Merit

45
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,386
for improving the prestige
of Korean Go throughout the world.

46
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,766
5 MONTHS LATER

47
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,853
ONE-ON-MANY TEACHING MATCH
WITH PROFESSIONAL GO PLAYERS

48
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,402
This kid is something.

49
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,071
Didn't he solve
the life-and-death problem earlier?

50
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,739
-What?
-From earlier.

51
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,741
Gramps, this way.

52
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,412
-Let's go.
-Okay.

53
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,581
Look at this!
You're in a tight spot, Mr. Cheon.

54
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,083
Look at you sweating.

55
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,503
He's a Go prodigy in Jeonju.

56
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,131
-He started less than six months ago.
-Six months?

57
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:02,302
I heard he's unmatched in Jeonju,
no, in the entire Jeolla Province.

58
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,761
-That's right.
-Hey.

59
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,014
I think it's over. Why don't we stop here?

60
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,599
Hold on, darn it.

61
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,147
-I don't think it's over yet.
-What?

62
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,151
You're wrong. It's over.

63
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,069
If you don't mind, can I step in?

64
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,530
Yes!

65
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,257
What? It's an atari.

66
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,217
YOU MAY CAPTURE THE OPPONENT'S STONE
ON THE NEXT MOVE

67
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,302
He's been hit hard.

68
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,887
Call it a tie and stop here?

69
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,728
Wow, that's amazing.

70
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,230
He's as good as I expected!
He turned it around.

71
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,567
He's a champion for a reason.

72
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,529
It's harder to win
when you have an advantage.

73
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,826
I went too easy on him.

74
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,120
Play another round.

75
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,622
What's with you?

76
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,916
Don't be rude, little kid.

77
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,542
Go play over there.

78
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,252
Stay out of this, novice.

79
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,172
Come on. I want one more round.

80
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,466
I'll win if we play again.

81
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,635
What's your name?

82
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,262
It's Chang-ho.

83
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,597
Lee Chang-ho.

84
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,559
Come on, sit here.

85
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,479
Chang-ho.

86
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,982
I heard you're good with life-and-deaths.

87
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,069
WHEN A PLAYER CAN SAVE THEIR STONES
OR KILL THE OPPONENT'S STONES.

88
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,407
Find black's lifeline.

89
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,160
If you solve this,
I'll play another match with you.

90
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,745
Do you mean it?

91
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,664
Keep your promise.

92
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,291
You can't take it back.

93
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,420
He's a Lee from Gyeongju, like me.

94
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,005
A family elder kept talking about him,

95
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,675
so I told him to bring the boy.

96
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,219
Well, he's good for a kid.

97
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,475
That little kid has quite a temper.
Is he your nephew?

98
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,644
I just met him for the first time.

99
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,815
The family tree is all messed up.
He's actually a generation above me.

100
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,734
Looks like I have a young uncle now.

101
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,529
How many handicap stones?

102
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,826
Four stones against a pro in six months?

103
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,203
Did you say "black's lifeline"? Not white?

104
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,205
Did you make a mistake, Mr. Cho?

105
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,999
A mistake? Me?

106
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,836
Why confuse him with a problem
that has no answer?

107
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,046
There are no definite answers in Go.

108
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,883
I've never seen a play like this.

109
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,636
His haengma and opening are all mixed up…

110
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,888
HAENGMA: THE SHAPE OF STONES

111
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,014
…but it's oddly powerful.

112
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,183
OPENING: OPENING TACTIC TO GET ADVANTAGE.

113
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,780
-Did you solve it this time?
-I think he can do it.

114
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,616
Bend and push.

115
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,784
No, here. There, I mean--

116
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,952
Come on.

117
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,038
Gosh. You're so distracting.

118
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,416
I told you I had to concentrate today.

119
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,252
If you stare at me,
I can't get anything done.

120
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,921
You're right.

121
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,340
He needs to focus on this important work,

122
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,093
so let's step out and have a drink.

123
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,513
-Drinks are on me.
-We got scolded by him.

124
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,516
If I drink during the day,
I'm going to pass out again.

125
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,392
That kid…

126
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,727
Don't you have homework?

127
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,063
Are you going to sit there all day?

128
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,949
He's the only son in three generations,
and he adores him.

129
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,203
Humor him and say the boy's good,
that he shows talent.

130
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,288
I'll take care of the rest.

131
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,546
Amazing, isn't it?

132
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,215
What a vigorous style from a young man.

133
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,634
I'm 1-kyu in Go,

134
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,388
and I'm lucky to win
one out of ten matches with him.

135
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:19,225
Everyone keeps saying he's a prodigy,
filling him up with hot air.

136
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,813
He's so into this silly game of stones
that he's ignoring the family business.

137
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,569
Go's stature has risen recently
thanks to Champion Cho here.

138
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,988
There are more international competitions,

139
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,241
and you can contribute to Korea's
global reputation through it too.

140
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,828
-You think so?
-Sure.

141
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,290
That being said,

142
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,208
I was hoping

143
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:48,379
you could take the boy on
for a few months, Mr. Cho.

144
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,798
I would compensate you handsomely

145
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,217
and sponsor you magnanimously too.

146
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,346
Use that money for his studies
so he can run the family business.

147
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,140
That would be better for him.

148
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,726
You don't get better at Go
by working hard.

149
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,771
No point in training him
unless he's a genius.

150
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,607
Talent?

151
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,192
He doesn't have it.

152
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,194
Not a trace of it.

153
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,824
Cho!

154
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,035
Cho!

155
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,704
Hey! Cho Hoon-hyun!

156
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,000
I've worked for months
to get that meeting.

157
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,045
Do you know how much money
he can give us as a sponsor?

158
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,713
What are we, beggars?

159
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,091
Business meetings, sponsorships,
they're all fine.

160
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,093
But let's not put money before Go.

161
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,638
He called it "silly game of stones"!

162
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,556
Don't you have any pride?

163
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,058
Pride?

164
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,327
Min-je.

165
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,663
Cho Min-je, what are you doing?

166
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
-Cho Min-je!
-Daddy!

167
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,417
You're home.

168
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,252
-Yeah.
-I made this for you.

169
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,090
-Hey! I told you not to touch the mail.
-Did you?

170
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,925
No, leave it. I'll tidy it up.

171
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,010
-Come here.
-Is the mail that interesting?

172
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,931
Come on. Let's wash our hands and eat.

173
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,350
Could you turn on the gas stove?

174
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,351
Let's go up.

175
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,269
I want sausages.

176
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,980
You had some this morning.

177
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,903
KEEP YOUR PROMISE
FROM LEE CHANG-HO

178
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,662
Hello.

179
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,872
Hey, Lee. Cho Hoon-hyun speaking.

180
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,374
Oh, hey.

181
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,875
That boy, Chang-ho?

182
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,128
Could I meet him again?

183
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,714
Come on, let's go.

184
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,048
Hurry.

185
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,593
SORRY, WE'RE CLOSED TODAY.

186
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,182
I'll only use three handicap stones.

187
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,727
But if I win, you have to teach me Go.

188
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,855
Why me?

189
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,023
I heard you're the strongest player,
mister.

190
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,151
That you're the best in Korea.

191
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,068
Hey!

192
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:20,781
Best in Korea? Try the best in the world.
You have no clue about what's going on.

193
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,284
Hey. The masters are talking.

194
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,453
Why does a novice keep interrupting?

195
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,622
Look just how rude this little brat is.

196
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,876
Last time, I only lost
because I gave you four handicap stones.

197
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,253
I'd knock you out in an even game.

198
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,214
You want to win against a kid that badly?

199
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,052
What if you lose?

200
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,805
What will you do for me?

201
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,936
BANANA MILK

202
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,441
Fine.

203
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,070
Cho Hoon-hyun came all the way down here.
It's a done deal.

204
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,364
What a smart son you have.

205
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,449
Hey.

206
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,534
Don't stand there. Come here.

207
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,454
Look at him on pins and needles.

208
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,019
I can't seem to make
my way around the board here.

209
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,230
It's over for real this time, right?

210
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,025
Yes, I lost this match.
You've gotten much better.

211
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,031
You must be hungry.

212
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,451
But who won?

213
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,036
Uncle Chang-ho just won.

214
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,664
Goodness, he won!

215
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,919
Uncle, are you going to play again?

216
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,172
We each won a game.
I need to see this through.

217
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,633
Chang-ho, do you find Go fun?

218
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,176
It's horrible.

219
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,512
When I lose, I can't sleep or eat.

220
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,722
It's the most infuriating thing
in the world.

221
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,976
But when I win,
there's nothing more fun in the world.

222
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,895
That's why we keep playing Go, right?

223
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,314
That kid's an old soul.

224
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,526
We'll finish the match…

225
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,321
when you come to Seoul.

226
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,701
-Well.
-Goodness.

227
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,539
And don't call me "mister" like a novice.

228
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,374
I'm not talking about you.

229
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,753
I'm your teacher, so call me "sir."

230
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,090
-Teacher?
-Good heavens.

231
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,217
He did it!

232
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,761
Chang-ho, what are you doing?

233
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,723
Bow to your teacher now.

234
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,641
-You don't have to.
-What?

235
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,809
Let's not keep him!

236
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,270
-This deserves a cheer.
-Hurray!

237
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,855
Hurray for Korea's independence!

238
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,694
You play three-day matches.
How are you going to handle a student?

239
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,196
Where can you find the time to teach him?

240
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,866
This is just between us,

241
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,494
but you don't have
the right personality to teach anyone.

242
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,838
Don't make more work for yourself.

243
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,340
Just focus on your matches.

244
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,426
What if he fails to become a pro?

245
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,220
Tons of people
are just waiting to come at you.

246
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,431
They'll say all sorts of things!

247
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,350
I don't care about him becoming a pro.

248
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,607
I suddenly became curious
about how his Go will turn out.

249
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:48,447
Think of this as your grandpa
and wear it all the time.

250
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,532
Since you're going to do this,

251
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,993
go all in and leave no regrets.

252
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,664
Go and do your best, okay?

253
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,500
And listen to Mr. Cho.

254
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,044
Okay?

255
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,546
Okay.

256
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,074
Mr. Cho.

257
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,660
Goodness, you'll break the door.

258
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,495
Hurry!

259
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,080
The bathroom…

260
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,791
Goodness.

261
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,670
Welcome.

262
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,089
It must've been a long journey. Come in.

263
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,434
Man, I almost didn't make it.

264
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,023
Oh my, what a handsome kid you are.

265
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,525
Look at his thick bones
and wide shoulders.

266
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,777
Sir, your wish came true.

267
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,363
He has the perfect build
for a ssireum wrestler!

268
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,117
-She's a girl.
-"She's a girl."

269
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,786
Mrs. Cho, anyway, congratulations.

270
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,080
You've got two babies at the same time.

271
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,207
I guess you're right.

272
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,960
-You're Chang-ho, right?
-Yes.

273
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,378
Nice to meet you.

274
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,010
This is the study.

275
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,680
If you want to read anything,
help yourself.

276
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,028
I was just about your age.

277
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,822
Who's this old man?

278
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,741
He was my teacher.

279
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,410
Yikes.

280
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,454
He looks terrifying.

281
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,831
How old is he?

282
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,500
He passed away a long time ago.

283
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,629
Consider yourself lucky.

284
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,547
I'm still young and energetic.

285
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,427
My grandpa said
death doesn't care about your age.

286
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,474
Come on out now.

287
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:22,935
Come on.

288
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,108
Is it because this is Igangju?
I don't feel drunk.

289
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,693
It sure is
one of Joseon's top three liquors.

290
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,614
Make sure to tell your grandfather
that I am grateful.

291
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,200
-Yes, sir.
-Do you like the food?

292
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,160
Yes, it's good.

293
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,620
You're a good cook, ma'am.

294
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,000
"Ma'am" doesn't sound quite right.

295
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,168
I agree.

296
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,255
We're family now.
You shouldn't call her that.

297
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,715
I have to call her something.

298
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,052
-I'm not sure how to address her.
-He's right.

299
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,471
Once titles get mixed up,
your life can get…

300
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,473
quite tricky.

301
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,228
How about "Auntie"?

302
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,356
Just call me "Auntie." Is that okay?

303
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,734
Yes.

304
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,155
Chang-ho, would you like more rice?

305
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,739
Yes.

306
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,908
A little more, please. Auntie.

307
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,120

CONGRATULATIONS
CHO HOON-HYUN CONQUERS THE WORLD

310
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,442
Who are you? Are you looking for your dad?

311
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,194
I'm not looking for anyone.

312
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,988
I'm here to play Go.

313
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,239
Go?

314
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,457
Who's that kid?

315
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,084
He's Champion Cho's student.

316
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,672
Who's next?

317
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,301
Hong-sik lost too?

318
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,886
Seriously, he's no joke.

319
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,471
He could be a pro.

320
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,017
I haven't seen that shape before.

321
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,769
He chose to push ahead?

322
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,145
It doesn't make sense.

323
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,317
Jeez, this is silly.

324
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,780
I don't have time,
so just come at me all at once.

325
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,365
Is he serious?

326
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,547
He sure is a prodigy.

327
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,634
Otherwise, why would've
Champion Cho brought him from Jeonju?

328
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,097
Champion Cho found a good talent.

329
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,557
-He's really good.
-He's something.

330
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,783
Two territories here,

331
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,369
and if you add the komi, it's at least 20.

332
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:28,870
Keep going?

333
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,916

4TH ROUND

336
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,589
CHO HOON-HYUN 9-DAN VS NAM GI-CHEOL 8-DAN

337
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,344
Mr. Cho, you have 30 minutes left.

338
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,346
FINAL MATCH BETWEEN
DEFENDING CHAMPION AND CHALLENGER.

339
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,353
Champion Cho is brutally tenacious.

340
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,273
Poring over a match
he's already won for 30 minutes?

341
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,526
My respect goes to Expert Nam
for not throwing stones.

342
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:03,196
This isn't the first time, and he knows
he'll eventually embarrass himself.

343
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,949
I'm sick of this era of Cho and Nam.

344
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,494
Mr. Nam, this is your final countdown.

345
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:10,996
One,

346
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,414
two,

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,835
four, five,

00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,754
six,

350
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,340
seven, eight,

351
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,008
nine…

352
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,433
What a bummer.

353
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,728
I should've blocked it there.

354
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,774
How stupid.

355
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:56,833
There it is.

356
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,001
The Tremor Technique.

357
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,380
-What's that?
-How do you not know about that?

358
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,801
If Cho Hoon-hyun starts bouncing his leg,
it's in the bag.

359
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:10,305
In baseball, it's like Sun Dong-yol
warming up in the bullpen.

360
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,016
It kills the opponent's spirit to fight.

361
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,396
One,

362
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:18,855
two,

363
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,440
three,

364
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:21,900
four…

365
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,654
When the drizzle makes no sound

366
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,450
We part at Busan Station in sorrow

367
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:37,332
Goodbye, farewell

368
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,669
There goes the whistle of tears

369
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,551
A no-count win by Cho Hoon-hyun 9-dan.

370
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,886
A WIN SO DECISIVE
IT IS UNNECESSARY TO COUNT TERRITORIES.

371
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,140
Oh boy, Expert Nam
seemed really angry today.

372
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,893
Still, he should've put the stones back.
Such bad manners.

373
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,896
Please, you're giving a lecture
on manners? "The drizzle"?

374
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,692
You need to crush them
to make it easier the next time.

375
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,778
Don't worry.
He'll be back, thirsty for revenge.

376
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,366
Congratulations!
I heard your song choice was superb today.

377
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,411
You bet. I can already see
the headlines tomorrow.

378
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:18,540
Uncle Chang-ho is currently
sweeping through Gwancheol-dong.

379
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,043
He's mowing down apprentices
like they're grass.

380
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,921
They're talking about
the tiger cub you brought,

381
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,673
and how he's a genius, a prodigy.

382
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,674
Lee.

383
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,595
You shouldn't tell Chang-ho
that he's a genius and a prodigy.

384
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,638
It won't help him.

385
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,976
Wait for me.

386
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,061
Hello, sir.

387
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,814
What's this?

388
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,441
Candy.

389
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,610
I'm home.

390
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,861
You two came together.

391
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,322
Yes, we met on the way.

392
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,908
-Chang-ho, how did it go?
-Good, Auntie.

393
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,659
How was the match today?

394
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,495
I lost.

395
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,747
You always say that.

396
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,797
Your opening, haengma, and reading,
they're all terrible.

397
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,925
But do you know what's the worst?

398
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,636
Your bad attitude.

399
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,637
What?

400
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,264
But I beat everyone.

401
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,934
Those older apprentices weren't that good.

402
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,519
Winning isn't everything.

403
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,355
Despite just starting to learn Go,

404
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,149
you belittle those
who have studied for years?

405
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,152
Your moves became lazy
when you were at an advantage.

406
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,488
Do your best until the end.

407
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,782
Learn to respect your opponents.

408
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,534
What about you, sir?

409
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,328
You bounce your leg and hum.

410
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,246
You…

411
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,873
Hey, I…

412
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,625
I can't even…

413
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,126
Why, you little…

414
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,631
You can do that when you become the best.

415
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,425
Unbelievable.

416
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,639
Learn the basics first.

417
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,058
But I've already read them.

418
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,228
The standard patterns are boring,
and they're too easy.

419
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,354
"Too easy"?

420
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,441
Which side seems better?

421
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,819
It's obvious white has the advantage.

422
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,284
Take white.

423
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,794
You don't come up
with a good move by thinking long.

424
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,462
Thinking is for bad players.

425
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,173
Cultivate a sense of the game.

426
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,843
But don't play impulsively.

427
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,471
Don't back down.

428
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,224
The essence of Go
is the battle, the attack.

429
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,937
Is white still better?

430
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,065
No.

431
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,026
Take black.

432
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:09,002
I've only used the basics you belittle,
so why are you losing?

433
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,176
"Genius, prodigy,"
don't believe what people call you.

434
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,179
You're only good
at calculating and memorizing.

435
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,598
You're only imitating how to play Go.

436
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,143
Don't be cocky. Learn the basics.

437
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,359
And use your right hand, if nothing else.

438
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,903
It's a basic courtesy
to show your opponent.

439
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,155
Yes, sir.

440
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,076
Stamina is everything.

441
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,578
The rashness of an impulsive move.

442
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,415
The complacency of wanting to compromise.

443
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,210
The arrogance
of wanting to end matches fast.

444
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,630
These are things that happen
when your stamina fails,

445
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,757
and they'll lead you to defeat.

446
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,021
No, I'm going to use this hand.

447
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,119
DEAR GRANDPA,
I HOPE YOU'RE WELL.

448
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,423
ONE STEP, ONE MOVE

449
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,804
Who eats jjajangmyeon on the rooftop?
Gotta be kidding me.

450
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,303
Hello, sir.

451
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,846
Why are you eating here?

452
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,976
You couldn't have ordered together?

453
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,897
I had to walk up here twice.
God, just eat at the restaurant.

454
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,861
Champion Cho must work hard to feed you.

455
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,073
Hey.

456
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,326
You know who I am, right?

457
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,495
Yes, of course. I do.

458
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,833
You're Mr. Nam Gi-cheol,
my teacher's rival.

459
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,960
Rival? Please.

460
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,340
Don't relax because you became a pro,
and keep studying.

461
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,217
Your teacher is extremely good.

462
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,260
But,

463
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,679
the thing is…

464
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,684
I'm not sure if it's something
I can learn by studying.

465
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,230
I wish I could be half as good as him,

466
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,109
but I just don't seem to have it.

467
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,655
Don't try to learn.

468
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,490
Try to win.

469
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,119
Then you'll naturally learn.

470
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,997
That's what I did
when I played against Cho.

471
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,881
CHO HOON-HYUN'S LEGENDARY MATCHES

472
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,716
WHITE CHO HOON-HYUN
BLACK KIM SEONG-JU

473
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,142
Man, he's so fast.

474
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,061
How can I capture this?

475
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,481
Going head-on won't help at all.

476
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,401
Should I just hold my ground?

477
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,089
Chang-ho's working hard into the night.

478
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,007
Yeah.

479
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,843
So, how's it going?

480
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,596
The prelims start soon, right?

481
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,183
How he does right now
is not what's important.

482
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,685
It's about finding his own Go.

483
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,189
Rushing him won't help.

484
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,901
Don't just push him.
Coax and soothe him instead.

485
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,902
He's still a kid.

486
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,322
He won't come to anything if I baby him.

487
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,824
He's someone's precious kid.

488
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,536
I can't slack off.
I need to make him the best.

489
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,166
In the world of competition,
if you're not the top dog,

490
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,794
your life is too sad.

491
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,006
THE 7TH DAEWANGJEON
1ST PRELIMINARY ROUND

492
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:27,296
I mean, staring at the board
won't solve anything.

493
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,548
You know what?

494
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,426
I thought he fell asleep during the match.

495
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,346
The kid plays Go like he's 60 years old.

496
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,932
He's lost two rounds in a row.

497
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,686
-How much did you lose, No?
-Two hundred thousand won.

498
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,897
I'll lose all my tournament earnings
from this month.

499
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,693
He's Cho Hoon-hyun's kid,
so I thought he'd be good.

500
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,530
He was a bright kid.
Why is he getting worse?

501
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,033
He's become totally weird too.

502
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:59,120
Champion Cho must hound him
day and night with that temper of his.

503
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,290
He's living with him too,
so it's no wonder.

504
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,294
Grandpa.

505
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,797
Mr. Cho's Go is flashy and strong,

506
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,466
but it doesn't suit me.

507
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,093
I'm going to find my own Go,

508
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,639
something no one else can replicate,
even if it takes time.

509
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,603
That's not it!
Upper right corner, knight's jump,

510
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,980
attach the one at the top,
push, and extend.

511
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,523
What have you learned so far?

512
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,441
Honey.

513
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,069
-Talk again tomorrow.
-Leave.

514
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,904
He can't win all the time.

515
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,573
He's upset about the loss,
so stop pushing him so hard.

516
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,657
Just leave.

517
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,541
You hold back when you should attack
and vice versa.

518
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,251
Why are you offbeat?

519
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,131
If a fight breaks out,
there would be more variables,

520
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,050
so it'd be better to wait until later--

521
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:54,967
I told you.

522
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,971
Go isn't about compromising
and building territories.

523
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,474
Bite, scratch, claw, and fight!

524
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,062
That's your style, sir.
It's not right for me.

525
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,271
Stop being cheeky.

526
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,356
Style?

527
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,441
A style of play?

528
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,652
None of those matter if you lose.

529
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,446
Use the basics.
Standard patterns come first.

530
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,617
Does everyone need to play Go
the same way?

531
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,911
There is an order to things!

532
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:27,500
You need to have a reason for every attack
and for every retreat.

533
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,752
You need the basics

534
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,672
before you can make changes,
interpretations, and styles.

535
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,429
It's the same here.

536
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:45,726
It's only natural to extend over here,
so why would you retreat? Why?

537
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,146
Are you openly defying me?

538
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,986
It's the right move, but there's a chance

539
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,822
that the tables might turn.

540
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,159
But if I make this move,

541
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,494
I'm 100% sure

542
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,290
that I'll win at least half a point.

543
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,125
100%?

544
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,420
How many times have I told you
that it's difficult

545
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,340
to claim territory in the center,
that it's hard to make calculations?

546
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,176
You're right.

547
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,681
But I thought
I could do the calculations, so…

548
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,226
I did an experiment.

549
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,479
"An experiment"?

550
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,067
You think Go is just a silly game.

551
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,280
You ignore the basics,
rely on your petty skill,

552
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,490
and obstinately cling to your ideas.

553
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:46,871
Let's stop.

554
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,042
No reason to get angry at someone
who doesn't want to learn.

555
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,640
But

556
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,934
if I make this move,

557
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,769
I'm 100% sure

558
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,773
that I'll win at least half a point.

559
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,278
Those who play first
have the advantage in Go.

560
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,198
So, when playing someone of the same rank,

561
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,076
the first player starts
with 5.5 points in the hole.

562
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,079
That's called komi.

563
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,252
The half-point here is given
to prevent a tie,

564
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,464
and such a thing
does not actually exist on the board.

565
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,677
The smallest unit that decides a match.

566
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,305
Half a point,
which does not exist on the board.

567
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,266
Perhaps,

568
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,644
this kid is seeing something else here.

569
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,618
RESPECTFULLY YOURS, CHANG-HO.

570
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,668
SIR, AUNTIE, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

571
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,718
Where to?

572
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,054
Jeonju, 9:40 bus, please.

573
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,057
All right, 9:40 bus to Jeonju!

574
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,059
The 9:40 bus is now leaving!

575
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,396
Okay, anyone else boarding?

576
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,815
Is everyone on board?

577
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:49,910
Jeez.

578
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:51,746
Sir?

579
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,638
Yesterday,

580
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,602
you talked about "half a point."

581
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,939
It turns out you weren't completely wrong.

582
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,317
But it wasn't right either.

583
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,735
I just

584
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,905
haven't found the right move yet.

585
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,622
Go doesn't have answers,

586
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,292
but I forced you to give me one.

587
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,545
I'm sorry.

588
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,215
It's better to walk steadily

589
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,801
than to run and wobble.

590
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,554
You found your own Go. That's good enough.

591
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,810
If that is your decision,

592
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,645
you need to own it.

593
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,563
In both Go

594
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,482
and life.

595
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,278
Got it?

596
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,540
Your spirit takes up 80% of a match.

597
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,460
Even if you lose,
don't let them crush your spirit.

598
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,421
Try to hide it.

599
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:28,175
Your thoughts, emotions,
and even your breathing.

600
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,137
Don't show your opponent anything.

601
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:35,307
I know, but it's easier said than done.

602
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,519
Think about something
familiar and comfortable.

603
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,274
Something that relaxes you
just by thinking about it.

604
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,653
The match is over
the moment you lose your composure.

605
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,245
You shouldn't differentiate
the stones by color.

606
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,623
Every move has to have a reason behind it.

607
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,333
Territory

608
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,337
comes into being naturally
and cannot be built with force.

609
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,799
Take care of each and every stone.

610
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,135
Then you'll find

611
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,889
the stones have come into harmony.

612
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:22,438
THE 29TH CHOEGOWIJEON
FINAL PRELIMINARY

613
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,860
Cho, don't you have to be there?

614
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,028
I don't have to.

615
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,780
Poor Uncle Chang-ho.
Out of all those players,

616
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,366
he had to meet Ko again,
the seasoned veteran.

617
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,328
Hey, don't worry about him.

618
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,414
You should all be figuring out
how not to be eaten by him.

619
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,208
He's an odd one.

620
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:48,047
He can't even review his games properly,
but he somehow keeps getting better.

621
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,718
His opening is sloppy,
and his haengma is slow,

622
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,346
but he somehow builds up a formation.

623
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:59,725
When it comes to calculations,
he might be better than me.

624
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,811
Does he still play like a 60-year-old man?

625
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:03,896
No.

626
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:05,898
Like an 80-year-old.

627
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,284
I'd rather protect
half a point for certain

628
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,120
than make a whole point through a fight.

629
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,667
In the end, Go is a fight for territory.

630
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,378
Grandpa.

631
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,339
I think I've finally found my own Go.

632
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,633
It's a bit unpolished

633
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,219
and not flashy like Mr. Cho's,

634
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,890
but I'm not going to let
anyone beat me, ever.

635
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,524
Yeah, that's a good cut.

636
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:56,073
The feng shui must be great
here at Yeonhui-dong, huh?

637
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,909
You have two great pro Go players
under the same roof.

638
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,913
Uncle, congratulations.

639
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,916
You've made it to the finals already.
You're in good shape.

640
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,336
Why don't we take a picture
to remember this day?

641
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,465
Mr. Cheon, please take
a family picture for us.

642
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,426
Of course.

643
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,350
Here we go.

644
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,768
One, two!

645
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,730
Chang-ho. Come on, smile.

646
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,064
Why do you look so glum?

647
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,734
What? He's got that big smile on him.

648
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,402
Yeah, he's smiling.

649
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,529
-That's his smile?
-Yes.

650
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,866
Okay, then. Here we go.

651
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,827
One, two, three!

652
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,208
But I think

653
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,087
it'd be better for white
to bend this way here.

654
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,715
It could win a lot,

655
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,968
but it might leave an opening.

656
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,970
Still, isn't it simpler to cut here?

657
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,933
You're being too cautious

658
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,935
that you're taking a long way around.

659
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,772
I don't love it,

660
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,318
but it doesn't seem
like it's going to give me a bad name.

661
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,612
Who's next?

662
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,406
Mr. Nam Gi-cheol.

663
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,286
I'm worried too.

664
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,789
His Go is so fierce.

665
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,707
He's tenacious.

666
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,337
If you start to back down,
he'll think you're weak and hit hard.

667
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,589
Go strong from the beginning.

668
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,300
I'm going for a hard defense.

669
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,386
You punk…

670
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,806
You told me to find my own Go.

671
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,140
So I should butt out?

672
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,268
Have faith in me.

673
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,437
Okay.

674
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,440
Think of it as a lesson, and take it easy.

675
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,442
No.

676
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,113
I'm planning

677
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,615
to win.

678
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:09,373
THE 23RD WANGWIJEON FINALS
12TH ROUND

679
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,138
Nam Gi-cheol 9-dan, black.

680
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,140
Lee Chang-ho 3-dan, white.

681
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,435
Let the match begin.

682
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,770
THE 29TH CHOEGOWIJEON
CHALLENGER SELECTION

683
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,189
NAM GI-CHEOL 9-DAN VS LEE CHANG-HO 3-DAN

684
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,370
Mr. Lee.

685
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,788
Oh! My goodness.

686
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,166
Why don't I get you coffee
in the review room?

687
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,753
I'm good. I won't understand anything
even if I see it.

688
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,423
Mr. Cho, you have ten minutes.

689
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,634
Oh my!

690
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,469
Let's see.

691
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,978
Oh dear.

692
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,065
A no-count win for white,
Cho Hoon-hyun 9-dan.

693
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,736
Hey, Mr. Baek.

694
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,822
I learned a lot from you.

695
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,951
Hey, Cho.

696
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,496
Black seems to have an advantage.

697
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,706
Like you know anything.

698
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,124
You got crushed too.

699
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:19,294
I didn't get crushed, man.
I was still drunk that day.

700
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,505
This is the record up to the 115th move.

701
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,608
Maybe I shouldn't have cut it here.

702
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,944
If I'd just taken it…

703
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,703
I could've pushed one
and expanded to the center.

704
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,798
A game between you and Champion Cho
would be interesting.

705
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,637
You're better in the closing stages.

706
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,056
Congrats, Lee.

707
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,440
Expert Nam collapsed at the end.

708
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,109
See? I'm not weak. Chang-ho's too strong.

709
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,112
It must be the feng shui of Yeonhui-dong.

710
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,492
LEE CHANG-HO

711
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,410
CHALLENGER

712
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,245
My.

713
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,587
My, my.

714
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,923
A teacher-student match…

715
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,675
It's happening too soon.

716
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,677
He earned his way up. What can I do?

717
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,972
What if Chang-ho actually eats you up?

718
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,390
Please.

719
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,935
That's still ten years away.

720
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,650
CITY HALL

721
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,119
WINS THE YING SHIBEI CUP!
UNIFIES THE WORLD!

722
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,738
CHO HOON-HYUN VS SEO GEON-WOO

723
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,496
Mr. Cho's haengma is weak

724
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,957
when attacked in the middle of a game.

725
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:09,256
His check is always weak
when the shape expands.

726
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,223
Sir, dinner's ready.

727
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,141
Okay.

728
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,271
Oh, here's the book.

729
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,289
Come on, give him a pep talk.

730
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,124
You are his teacher after all.

731
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,001
What do you mean?

732
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,588
Did you get some sleep?
How are you feeling?

733
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,173
I'm good, Auntie.

734
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,718
Don't get too hung up on the outcome.

735
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,430
Just play your own Go.

736
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,142
Yes, sir.

737
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,311
CHALLENGE MATCH
LAST ROUND

738
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,812
-Isn't that the car?
-They're here.

739
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,355
FEBRUARY 2ND, 1990
KOREA BADUK ASSOCIATION, GWANCHEOL-DONG

740
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,524
-They came together?
-Get a picture!

741
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,360
-Mr. Cho!
-It's an unprecedented match.

742
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,863
-How do you feel?
-Are you scared of your student?

743
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,282
Goodness. What's the rush?

744
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:22,788
Good luck.

745
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,498
Thank you.

746
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,875
We'll now choose stones.

747
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,185
Lee Chang-ho 4-dan, black.
Cho Hoon-hyun 9-dan, white.

748
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,149
Let the match begin.

749
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:37,529
CHO HOON-HYUN 9-DAN VS LEE CHANG-HO 4-DAN

COUNTDOWN

751
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:27,913
Let's see.

752
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,539
How many moves have been made?

753
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,957
-Wait a minute.
-How is it?

754
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,292
I just got it!

755
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,544
-I haven't looked yet.
-Tell me!

756
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:35,629
A little later!

757
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,758
I'll tell you later, okay?

758
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:40,884
God!

759
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,552
What a racket. Seriously.

760
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,723
That's a fierce opening from Cho.

761
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,809
See? It's an onslaught from the beginning.

762
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:54,064
How ruthless of him
against his young student.

763
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,816
That is brutal. It really is.

764
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,668
TIME SPENT

765
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,004
LEE CHANG-HO 2 HOURS 10 MINUTES
CHO HOON-HYUN 50 MINUTES

766
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,180
The game will resume after lunch.

767
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,103
Should I have just taken it?

768
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,023
A knight's cap,
and then a two-space extension.

769
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,861
Maybe I should have given up a point.

770
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,704
Great-grandfather, when did you get here?

771
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,998
I took the first bus.

772
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:53,915
Right.

773
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:59,296
Chang-ho, you seem to be
off your game today.

774
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,132
You were quite ruthless against me.

775
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,050
Maybe he favors his teacher?

776
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,637
Ask Mr. Cho to go easy on Uncle Chang-ho

777
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:08,972
and cut him some slack.

778
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,975
That's nonsense. A match is a match.

779
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,648
He's such a…

780
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:22,944
Good. The food is here.

781
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,326
Careful now. It's hot. It's really hot.

782
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,327
Goodness.

783
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:51,366
Uncle Chang-ho seems to be making
a lot of small mistakes today.

784
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,953
We can't compete with him either,
so how could a kid?

785
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,623
And it's his teacher, whom he looks up to.

786
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,020
TIME SPENT

787
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,774
LEE CHANG-HO 3 HOURS 51 MINUTES
CHO HOON-HYUN 1 HOUR 43 MINUTES

788
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:36,786
The match is over
the moment you lose your composure.

789
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,789
Think about something
familiar and comfortable.

790
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,627
Something that relaxes you
just by thinking about it.

791
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,059
TIME SPENT

792
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,980
LEE CHANG-HO 3 HOURS 53 MINUTES
CHO HOON-HYUN 2 HOURS 58 MINUTES

793
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,595
Mr. Cho.

794
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,180
One,

795
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:43,681
two,

796
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,183
three,

797
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:46,809
four,

798
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,561
five,

799
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,063
six,

800
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:51,939
seven,

eight,

802
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:54,984
nine,

803
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,527
ten.

804
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,989
LEE CHANG-HO 4 HOURS 50 MINUTES
CHO HOON-HYUN 5 HOURS

805
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,159
Mr. Cho, you have two countdowns left.

806
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,065
I don't know. We'll know when it ends.

807
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,859
I might be wrong,

808
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,987
but we might see a real coup here.

809
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:21,988
A coup?

810
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,573
Really?

811
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,744
Why don't we go over there
and see for ourselves?

812
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,746
Hey. Come on, hurry up.

813
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:30,747
Hurry, run.

814
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,518
Maybe not?

815
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,460
Black wins by half a point!

816
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,378
At 271 moves!

817
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,214
Hey, I said black!

818
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,465
No.

819
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,467
Lee Chang-ho won!

820
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,073
It's so late.
There won't be any restaurants open.

821
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:50,785
Cho.

822
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,130
A word on your student and his victory?

823
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,882
Mr. Cho, can I get a comment?

824
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:12,348
There's nothing more for me to teach him.

825
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:14,433
He can go his own way now.

826
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,894
What do you think went wrong today?

827
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,354
-Sorry.
-Mr. Cho.

828
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,814
Where was the match decided?

829
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:22,900
You might face Mr. Lee in the Giseongjeon.
What's your plan?

830
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:23,901
Mr. Cho!

831
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,037
First of all, congratulations.
How do you feel?

832
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,124
I'm sorry to my teacher

833
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,002
that I won with a bad game.

834
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,221
You're late.

835
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,602
How did it go?

836
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,532
Chang-ho, great job.

837
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,034
Congratulations.

838
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,119
Thank you.

839
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:01,290
Good work. You must be tired.
Go up and rest.

840
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,459
Okay.

841
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,096
Grandpa.

842
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,974
Did you see me win today?

843
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:20,977
You know,

844
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,313
I really wanted to win.

845
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:27,984
In my own way.

846
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,400
A HALF-POINT WIN
SENSATION IN THE WORLD OF GO

847
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,568
YOUNGEST CHAMP, LEE CHANG-HO

848
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,863
That boy…

849
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,563
Should I have wedged it here?

850
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,454
Hey.

851
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,039
Sir.

852
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,335
The review…

853
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,337
Yes, we should do it.

854
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,755
TO GO OVER MOVES FROM PAST GAMES.

855
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,090
The weather's good.

856
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,258
To the living room?

857
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:23,307
What if I defend here?

858
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,309
That's not bad either.

859
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,688
But it's better to look here…

860
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,279
and expand the center
because black is heavy.

861
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:45,371
Or…

862
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,835
what if I wedge it here?

863
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:08,435
No, the shape doesn't look good there.

864
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:12,022
You could defend this side instead

865
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:15,317
or attach it here first.

866
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,157
No, I don't think this is bad.

867
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,743
Make an atari here, push through…

868
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:27,872
and attach.

869
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:31,667
No, not there. It leaves a bad aftertaste.

870
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,086
No need to look any further.

871
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,341
Sir.

872
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,515
I'm sorry.

873
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,269
About yesterday's game.

874
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:52,938
What?

875
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,944
Am I your teacher when we play Go?

876
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:02,740
Answer me! Am I?

877
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:05,701
No.

878
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:08,329
You're my enemy.

879
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:10,497
Winning a game doesn't change anything.

880
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,626
Don't flatter yourself.

881
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:17,129
You win and lose every day.
That's the fate of a pro.

882
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,297
You arrogant punk.

883
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,427
From now on, we won't review our games.

884
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,893

01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:20,234
It's an earth-shattering event
that'll go down in Korean Go history.

888
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:22,569
It's unprecedented, anytime, anywhere.

889
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,906
Yes. Daewangjeon, Giseongjeon,

890
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:30,077
Paewangjeon, Choegowijeon,
and now, Giwangjeon.

891
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:34,039
The student and the teacher have met
in five consecutive final matches.

892
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,792
This is all because of Lee Chang-ho 6-dan.

893
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,377
He's growing too quickly.

894
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,547
Cho 9-dan wouldn't have expected
him to rise so quickly either.

895
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,134
Recent games show
that Cho is backed into a corner.

896
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:47,970
Cho's knife is famous for its sharpness.

897
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,639
It pierces and twists in your weak spots.

898
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,224
But it doesn't seem

899
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:55,019
to be working on Lee Chang-ho 6-dan.

900
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:58,939
Yes, Lee 6-dan lets his opponent
do as he likes.

901
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:01,942
But when you're done,
you find that you've lost.

902
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:03,777
It leaves you dumbstruck.

903
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:06,030
One professional player told me

904
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:09,533
that he's scared to face Cho,
but as for Lee Chang-ho,

905
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,494
he doesn't even want to look at him.

906
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:16,081
As everyone knows, the two have
completely different playing styles.

907
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:18,542
Cho is fast. Lee is slow.

908
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:21,045
Lee holds back while Cho attacks.

909
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,422
But looking at the game records,

910
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:26,342
they seem to have switched their styles.

911
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:30,179
It's the teacher, Cho 9-dan,
who has got his back to the wall,

912
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,598
while Lee 6-dan is on the offense.

913
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:36,435
It must mean that Cho is struggling
to change the flow by any means.

914
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,687
Yes, but the problem is,

915
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,815
Lee Chang-ho isn't just good at defense.

916
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:44,485
He thoroughly punished Cho yesterday.

917
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,863
Cho Hoon-hyun, the best player,
had his hands tied.

918
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,574
-A comment, please!
-Mr. Cho!

919
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:51,575
Mr. Cho!

920
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,621
Mr. Lee, congratulations.

921
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:57,706
Could you tell us how you feel?

922
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,958
Where do you think the game was won?

923
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,211
Only the Paewangjeon remains.

924
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:06,382
If Cho loses there,
he'll end up with no wins this year.

925
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:11,345
How do you all think
the next game will go?

926
01:13:11,428 --> 01:13:13,514
Lee Chang-ho is indeed in great spirits,

927
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:16,600
but this is Cho Hoon-hyun, the King of Go.

928
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:18,352
Well, he won't back down easily.

929
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:19,520
Yes, that's right.

930
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:22,314
If you look at Fujisawa 9-dan of Japan,

931
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,401
he won a championship in his 60s.

932
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,486
Don't be daft, you guys.

933
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:30,531
There was no Lee Chang-ho in Japan!

934
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:32,699
WINNER OF THE YING SHIBEI CUP!
UNIFIES THE WORLD!

935
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:39,081
Lee Chang-ho is changing
the paradigm of Go.

936
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,042
Go fans are even saying,

937
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:44,878
"Go is a sport where you fight all day,

938
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,381
only for Lee Chang-ho to win in the end."

939
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,135
ETERNAL KINGDOM FALLEN BY HALF-POINT

940
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,053
"SIR, IT'S PAEWANG THIS TIME"
CHO ON THE EDGE OF A CLIFF

941
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:55,889
THE 29TH PAEWANGJEON CHALLENGE MATCH
4TH ROUND

942
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,975
CHO HOON-HYUN 9-DAN VS LEE CHANG-HO 6-DAN

943
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:33,927
Hey, Cho!

944
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:36,263
Get the tissue.

945
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:51,945
Mr. Cho?

946
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,740
We'll get going now.

947
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,159
All right. Have a safe trip home.

948
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,921
This is terrible, really.

949
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,882
For you and for Chang-ho.

950
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,113
Is your stomach upset?

951
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,202
I feel bad.

952
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,455
For Mr. Cho…

953
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,209
and Auntie.

954
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:51,380
So,

955
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,550
would you rather lose?

956
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,475
Then give it your best and win.

957
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,894
What else can you do?

958
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:42,180
You're home.

959
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,569
You couldn't even tie your shoes,

960
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:59,031
and now, you look like a real pro.

961
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:07,205
It's time…

962
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,126
for you to stand alone.

963
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:15,130
It makes no sense to keep you here

964
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:19,343
as my student
when you've already surpassed me.

965
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:25,349
No, I'm still not there yet.
I have so much left to learn.

966
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,310
I have nothing to teach you.

967
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,066
I should have sent you away sooner.

968
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,406
Winning and losing
are part of our lives, yes…

969
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,161
but to live in the same house like this,

970
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,665
when we fight our guts out every day,

971
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,043
is hard for both of us.

972
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:56,963
I'm sorry, sir.

973
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,008
Did I teach you that?

974
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:06,098
A pro's job is to win,
no matter who the opponent is.

975
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,692
I'm learning a lot lately, thanks to you.

976
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:20,779
I've learned that I can lose at any time.

977
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,038
I know you'll do well,

978
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:33,291
but don't get lazy after leaving here.

979
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,307
I realized…

980
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,644
that I've never

981
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:56,273
complimented you properly.

982
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:00,485
As a teacher…

983
01:19:03,613 --> 01:19:05,449
I've always been proud of you.

984
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:09,411
You were…

985
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,081
always my pride.

986
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,519
I packed some kimchi.

987
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,354
Chang-ho likes it.

988
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,939
Oh my, thank you.

989
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,025
We're done.

990
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:43,069
Chang-ho.

991
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:44,780
Give me a hug.

992
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,618
Come visit often. And don't skip meals.

993
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:53,538
Yes, Auntie.

994
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,634
Keep warm, and come by
for more side dishes when you run out.

995
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:08,303
Sir, thank you so much for everything.

996
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:09,554
It was nothing.

997
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,639
Take care.

998
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:13,058
Sure. Have a safe journey.

999
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:17,646
Sir.

1000
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:25,570
Thank you

1001
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:27,697
for everything.

1002
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:29,741
Hey…

1003
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,920
Mr. Cho asked me to give you this.

1004
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:02,148
WHITE CHO HYEON-SIK VS BLACK LEE CHANG-HO
BLACK WINS BY 1.5 POINTS

1005
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:45,150
The Great Cho Hoon-hyun
without a single win, seriously?

1006
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:48,904
He was devoured by the tiger cub
he raised. Who can he blame?

1007
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,656
-Still, it does sting.
-It does.

1008
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,241
The truth is,

1009
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:56,661
we make more money when matches are tight.

1010
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,914
We won't make much commission like this.

1011
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,334
Lower the payout on Chang-ho.

1012
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:04,669
One,

1013
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:08,548
two, three, four, five,

1014
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:13,929
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1015
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,933
Cho of white runs out of time and loses.

1016
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:20,936
Nam of black wins by default.

1017
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,215
Where are the kids?

1018
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,717
-Aren't they home yet?
-No.

1019
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,261
How was the game?

1020
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:57,430
I lost.

1021
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:00,684
I can live with a loser,

1022
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,395
but not a pathetic man.

1023
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:06,982
Don't run like a coward.

1024
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:15,156
I've never resented you or Chang-ho once
while taking care of him,

1025
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,201
but seeing you like this

1026
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:20,787
makes me want to hate Chang-ho.

1027
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,375
Why are you so pathetic?

1028
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:37,053
Champion Lee, it's been a long time!

1029
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,304
Have you eaten?

1030
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:40,807
If not, why don't we have lunch together?

1031
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:43,143
No, I'm not hungry yet.

1032
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:44,561
I'm sure he's full.

1033
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:48,231
He gorged himself
on all those championship titles

1034
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:49,816
and gobbled up his teacher too.

1035
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:52,986
He didn't gobble up anything.
Watch your mouth, man!

1036
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:55,488
Why are you throwing a fit?

1037
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,033
It was a joke.

1038
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,451
Joke!

1039
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,165
It must be nice for you, Lee.

1040
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,500
Wow, you're photogenic too.

1041
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,753
ANOTHER FORFEIT
WILL CHO HOON-HYUN RETIRE?

1042
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:13,381
Wow, you could be a model.

1043
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:19,637
How about a bowl of naejangtang?
It's been a while.

1044
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,097
-Sure.
-Okay.

1045
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:24,184
-A drink too?
-What should I do, then?

1046
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:29,939
Me?

1047
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,318
What would you do, Mr. Baek,
if you were me?

1048
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,404
Should I lose?

1049
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:40,075
Well, why are you asking me that?

1050
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,995
That's what I was taught.

1051
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,247
That a pro's job is to win.

1052
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:51,294
You must not have met
a good teacher yet, Mr. Baek.

1053
01:24:51,377 --> 01:24:52,712
You little…

1054
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,757
You think you're above everyone else now?

1055
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:58,510
It's a joke.

1056
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:01,221
I was joking too.

1057
01:25:01,304 --> 01:25:02,514
What?

1058
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:05,183
He said it was a joke.

1059
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:08,186
Let's go now, Lee.

1060
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,778
A forfeit? The Great Cho Hoon-hyun?

1061
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:19,322
You should have at least played!

1062
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,242
Do you know
how much your wife worries about you?

1063
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:24,702
And Chang-ho?

1064
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,454
Poor kid.

1065
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:30,083
He might not talk about it,
but he must feel terrible.

1066
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:40,176
Hey, what are you doing?
You're a lightweight.

1067
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:45,265
Hey, Cho.

1068
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:47,225
What?

1069
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:59,362
My knife's gone rusty.

1070
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,410
You don't have an umbrella.

1071
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:07,495
Hey, Cho!

1072
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:56,878
CHO HOON-HYUN VS LEE CHANG-HO
NO-COUNT WIN BY LEE

1073
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:15,897
I'd be upset if you bowed down
to something as small as this.

1074
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:21,986
Because you've stabbed me in the back
at least a hundred times.

1075
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:27,408
Everyone hurts when they're punched.

1076
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,329
Chang-ho must be having a hard time too.

1077
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:34,999
The poor kid's suffering

1078
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,919
because he met a teacher like me.

1079
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:42,924
He's a champion, and he can't even smile
as much as he likes.

1080
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,344
You're still his teacher.

1081
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:51,057
You need to challenge him
so that he grows stronger.

1082
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:55,436
Go is so odd.

1083
01:27:58,022 --> 01:27:59,524
Once you place a stone,

1084
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,694
you feel like you could do it…

1085
01:28:04,862 --> 01:28:06,781
but it's hard to place it down.

1086
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:13,955
I thought I'd finally started
to understand the game.

1087
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:18,376
You win if you can overcome that.

1088
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:24,090
The aching wound oozes, scabs over,
and is covered with new flesh.

1089
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:26,884
You endure it…

1090
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:31,389
until an opportunity comes to you.

1091
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:35,476
Cho.

1092
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:41,399
I've found that once you start
running away on the board…

1093
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:45,903
there's nowhere else to go.

1094
01:28:57,915 --> 01:28:59,167
Be yourself.

1095
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,253
Being quiet and hunched up like this

1096
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,089
doesn't suit you at all.

1097
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,636
GO IS ABOUT TRYING TO FIND AN ANSWER
WHEN THERE ARE NONE

1098
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,554
KENSAKU SEGOE (CHO HOON-HYUN'S MASTER)

1099
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:20,289
GO IS A FIGHT AGAINST YOURSELF
JULY 1964, CHO HOON-HYUN

1100
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:26,170
I'm stuffed. That was good.

1101
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,840
Mr. Baek, congrats on your easy win ahead.

1102
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:30,341
I didn't see Cho today.

1103
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,719
Don't congratulate me.
This is going to be an uncomfortable win.

1104
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:37,765
Now's the moment to face off
against Cho Hoon-hyun and crush him.

1105
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,352
He won't come. He's too scared.

1106
01:30:45,523 --> 01:30:47,942
Mr. Baek, you're here.

1107
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:49,694
So,

1108
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,238
did you have a filling lunch?

1109
01:30:55,867 --> 01:31:00,705
1 YEAR LATER

1110
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,712
THE 2ND WOMEN'S GUKSUJEON FINALS

1111
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:09,255
Sir?

1112
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:11,215
Look at you, kid.

1113
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:12,717
Here, let me.

1114
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:15,553
It's okay. I'll do it.

1115
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:26,147
Sir.

1116
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:28,816
Today's game…

1117
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:30,818
Of course I won!

1118
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:35,072
What are you asking me that for?
It's embarrassing.

1119
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:40,077
Look at me playing
in the preliminaries like some novice.

1120
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:43,581
I saw your game yesterday.

1121
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:47,376
So you're still not choosing to fight.

1122
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:51,005
Because I can win without fighting.

1123
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:56,010
Why risk it and fight?

1124
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:59,305
Or are you avoiding a fight
because you're scared?

1125
01:31:59,805 --> 01:32:01,224
Of course not.

1126
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,976
Whose student do you think I am?

1127
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,776
Yeah. A master doesn't need
a lecture from a novice.

1128
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:16,280
Lee Chang-ho 7-dan wins a no-count win

1129
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,616
and succeeds in defending
his Daewangjeon title.

1130
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:22,036
He has 19 consecutive championship wins,
and if he wins…

1131
01:32:22,119 --> 01:32:26,123
What matters is how many consecutive wins
Lee Chang-ho gets, right?

1132
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,376
Paewangjeon will be held…

1133
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:31,128
You don't have to watch it.
Lee will win three to zero.

1134
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:34,298
Cho Hoon-hyun is a has-been now.

1135
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:37,218
Cho 9-dan advanced
through a variety of preliminaries

1136
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:41,597
and finals and now will challenge
his old student, Lee Chang-ho 7-dan.

1137
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:42,765
Lee Chang-ho…

1138
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,727
-Hey, you're here.
-Hi.

1139
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:48,563
-Okay, all done.
-Okay.

1140
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:51,399
-Did you check the mic?
-Yes.

1141
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,526
Hey, Cho.

1142
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,695
Don't do it if you don't want to.

1143
01:32:56,612 --> 01:32:57,446
Really?

1144
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:01,534
I'm joking.

1145
01:33:01,617 --> 01:33:04,287
I'm not that shameless.
It's about time I did one.

1146
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:05,788
Go ahead.

1147
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:10,001
First, congratulations.

1148
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:15,798
You were voted the most popular Go player
by the fans last year.

1149
01:33:15,881 --> 01:33:16,882
How do you feel?

1150
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:20,303
If I had known, I would have started
losing much sooner.

1151
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:24,056
When I was on a winning streak,
everyone hated me so much.

1152
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:26,559
Yes.

1153
01:33:26,642 --> 01:33:28,227
Well, the records show

1154
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:31,480
you've played 110 matches
in the last year alone.

1155
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:34,567
You've been playing
practically once every three days,

1156
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:37,570
with all the preliminaries and the finals,

1157
01:33:37,653 --> 01:33:41,240
when, in the past, you were used to
waiting as the defending champion.

1158
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:42,825
It's been rough.

1159
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:49,123
But it makes the match more exhilarating
when a single loss

1160
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:51,584
will send you down the cliff.

1161
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:53,336
It's been fun in a way.

1162
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:56,339
It was refreshing,
going against young rookies too.

1163
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:01,802
Well, Lee Chang-ho 7-dan is on a roll,
and everyone is saying

1164
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:03,971
that it's not news if he wins.

1165
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,890
Now, for your last question,

1166
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:10,895
could you send a message to Lee Chang-ho,
your student and opponent in the final?

1167
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:19,570
He might have been my student,
but a match is a match.

1168
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:23,991
If I have to fight Chang-ho,

1169
01:34:25,242 --> 01:34:26,911
I plan on giving it my all.

1170
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:31,832
It's now my turn to challenge him
as he did me.

1171
01:34:40,966 --> 01:34:42,301
CHO HOON-HYUN RETURNS!

1172
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:10,204
THE 31ST PAEWANGJEON CHALLENGE MATCH
LAST ROUND

1173
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:12,790
CHO HOON-HYUN 9-DAN VS LEE CHANG-HO 7-DAN

1174
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:37,940
It's the final game.
Both sides have two wins each.

1175
01:35:38,023 --> 01:35:40,067
I thought it'd begin in a cautious manner,

1176
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:42,862
but it's going very quickly.

1177
01:35:42,945 --> 01:35:46,866
The opening so far
is the same as the fourth match.

1178
01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:48,451
It's as if it's choreographed.

1179
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:51,203
Yes, it's heated,
with neither side backing down.

1180
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:54,498
It's like they're both shouting
that their Go isn't wrong.

1181
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:58,878
Lee Chang-ho 7-dan
is known as the "God of Calculation."

1182
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:02,965
Cho 9-dan won the first two matches

1183
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:06,886
but lost the next two and is now perched
on the edge of a cliff.

1184
01:36:06,969 --> 01:36:10,347
The teacher-student matches
have continued in this pattern,

1185
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:14,769
and comeback wins have become
Lee Chang-ho's signature.

1186
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:19,190
Cho's challenge is to keep
his composure until the end.

1187
01:36:26,489 --> 01:36:27,740
Cho is playing elsewhere.

1188
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:31,035
It's customary to take
and strengthen here,

1189
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:33,329
but he just placed his stone here.

1190
01:36:33,996 --> 01:36:36,665
Hasn't Cho's Go become
so much sharper and more acute

1191
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:39,418
since he's bounced back
after hitting rock bottom?

1192
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:42,838
Yes, it earned him a new moniker,
the "God of War."

1193
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:44,173
From that perspective,

1194
01:36:44,256 --> 01:36:47,218
it seems Cho is planning
to incite a fight here and there.

1195
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:49,553
I'm curious how Lee 7-dan will respond.

1196
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:54,308
Wow, Lee Chang-ho 7-dan strikes back!

1197
01:36:54,391 --> 01:36:55,810
He's out to capture his enemy.

1198
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:59,063
He has no intention of compromising today,
which is unusual.

1199
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:02,817
Cho sneers,
like he didn't expect this either.

1200
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:25,089
Lee Chang-ho strikes back
against Cho Hoon-hyun's wave of attacks!

1201
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:29,760
Cho shakes up the center.

1202
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:33,722
It doesn't seem like Lee Chang-ho
will have to rise to the attack.

1203
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:39,478
Wow, Lee Chang-ho!

1204
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:41,146
He jumped in!

1205
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:46,193
Neither gives their groups a glance.
All they care about is the battle!

1206
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,613
Neither the teacher nor the student

1207
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,950
will give an inch
when it comes to the match.

1208
01:38:07,339 --> 01:38:09,592
The battle is truly chilling.

1209
01:38:09,675 --> 01:38:12,011
They're fighting like sworn enemies.

1210
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:19,143
Lee is now taking a long pause.

1211
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:24,732
He's probably running tens of thousands
of possible sequences in his head.

1212
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:49,798
Lee Chang-ho makes a sharp thrust.

1213
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:52,051
Cho has to be aching.

1214
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:56,931
White seems to be
at an advantage in general.

1215
01:38:57,014 --> 01:38:58,807
What do you think, Mr. Nam?

1216
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,977
Champion Cho has started fights
here and there,

1217
01:39:03,145 --> 01:39:05,397
but Chang-ho's walls are just too thick.

1218
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:08,651
Yes, it seems like Lee is ahead
by three and a half

1219
01:39:08,734 --> 01:39:11,070
or four and a half points so far.

1220
01:39:11,862 --> 01:39:15,866
The game is entering its endgame.

1221
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:19,203
If Lee wins today,
he'll reenact his teacher's achievement,

1222
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:21,914
which is to win
all championships in a year.

1223
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:25,000
Lee Chang-ho 7-dan. You're almost there!

1224
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:34,051
He's making a counterattack
in an unlikely situation.

1225
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:36,887
Could it be that Cho
is planning to capture over here?

1226
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:39,056
It won't be easy.

1227
01:39:39,556 --> 01:39:41,558
It's Lee Chang-ho he's facing.

1228
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:44,311
He's defended it well.

1229
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:46,605
It's Lee Chang-ho after all.
That's a good spot.

1230
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:50,526
Yes, he staged a defense
and went for his opponent's vital point.

1231
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,862
It's a classic Lee Chang-ho move.

1232
01:39:55,823 --> 01:40:00,327
How will Cho, who's on the defensive,
get out of this difficult situation?

1233
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:05,457
He has never been
at an advantage during this game.

1234
01:40:19,596 --> 01:40:22,933
What was that move by Cho?
Does that make any sense?

1235
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:25,269
What? He's going to jump in even more?

1236
01:40:25,769 --> 01:40:28,188
Whoa, it's too reckless.

1237
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:30,107
I mean, there's nothing to back it.

1238
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:43,203
Did Lee just retreat?

1239
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:48,459
I think it'd be better
to bend here and capture one point.

1240
01:40:49,251 --> 01:40:50,085
So what was that?

1241
01:40:52,921 --> 01:40:56,550
Is there something more to Cho's move?

1242
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:59,011
I'm sorry. What did I miss?

1243
01:40:59,094 --> 01:41:01,847
What could possibly be behind this move?

1244
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:09,396
Vital points are very tender.

1245
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:16,320
Once you get hit, you can't move.
You can only gasp.

1246
01:41:19,656 --> 01:41:21,658
As more stones are placed and they mingle,

1247
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,578
it results in more vital points.

1248
01:41:26,288 --> 01:41:28,749
My vital point is also

1249
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:31,710
that of my opponent.

1250
01:41:35,172 --> 01:41:36,840
-Wait a second.
-Yes?

1251
01:41:37,549 --> 01:41:39,301
I see. It's genius!

1252
01:41:39,885 --> 01:41:42,471
Black retreats here,
and white makes an atari.

1253
01:41:42,554 --> 01:41:44,973
Black connects,
then white needs to extend here.

1254
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:48,977
And in the end,
black will inevitably gain an advantage.

1255
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:51,605
It's an exquisite bid for victory by Cho!

1256
01:41:51,688 --> 01:41:54,358
The teacher finally twists
the student's arm!

1257
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:58,403
If this works,
Cho might turn the game around.

1258
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:01,031
It takes two to play Go.

1259
01:42:02,574 --> 01:42:06,662
A single genius cannot create
a good game of Go on his own.

1260
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:09,540
This match

1261
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,792
is one that will go down in history.

1262
01:42:24,888 --> 01:42:26,974
Lee Chang-ho bends on the left side.

1263
01:42:28,183 --> 01:42:29,768
Cho blocks decisively.

1264
01:42:44,283 --> 01:42:46,785
The stone statue winces!

1265
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:48,704
So Lee Chang-ho is human too!

1266
01:43:51,725 --> 01:43:53,227
Lee Chang-ho resigns!

1267
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:54,978
Cho Hoon-hyun has won!

1268
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:58,398
Lee Chang-ho is blocked
from a grand slam by his teacher!

1269
01:43:59,566 --> 01:44:03,570
Cho Hoon-hyun got up again after 15 losses

1270
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:07,824
and has finally overcome the huge obstacle
that is Lee Chang-ho!

1271
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:13,080
Cho wins the Paewangjeon and escapes
his drought of no championship titles!

1272
01:44:13,872 --> 01:44:14,957
Everyone!

1273
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,042
The King is back!

1274
01:45:03,922 --> 01:45:04,756
WINNER

1275
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:30,407
Have a safe journey home.

1276
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:33,243
Here.

1277
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:34,745
This is…

1278
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:37,080
Well, it didn't feel right
to throw it out.

1279
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:39,249
It's still usable. Here.

1280
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:47,382
TAXI

1281
01:45:47,966 --> 01:45:51,970
Cut, throw-in, bend,

1282
01:45:52,846 --> 01:45:55,349
atari, cover…

1283
01:46:19,831 --> 01:46:21,750
GO IS ABOUT TRYING TO FIND AN ANSWER
WHEN THERE ARE NONE

1284
01:46:24,669 --> 01:46:29,174
GO IS A FIGHT AGAINST YOURSELF
JULY 1964, CHO HOON-HYUN

1285
01:46:36,765 --> 01:46:41,603
NOVEMBER 16, 1998
THE 42ND GUKSUJEON EVE EVENT

1286
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:43,605
Now, let's wrap up the pictures

1287
01:46:43,688 --> 01:46:45,357
and start the press conference.

1288
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:49,277
Reporters, could you please
move to your designated seats?

1289
01:46:52,114 --> 01:46:57,035
First, the Guksu Champion title
has come to represent you in a way,

1290
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,287
so you must be very emotional right now.

1291
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:00,997
You take a title

1292
01:47:02,124 --> 01:47:04,709
and have it taken away from you.
That's how it goes.

1293
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:06,962
Maybe it's my age, but these days,

1294
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:09,005
I'm more interested in…

1295
01:47:12,342 --> 01:47:15,262
leaving behind a good game record
than winning a title.

1296
01:47:15,345 --> 01:47:18,265
Mr. Cho, you've been on a roll recently.

1297
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,642
Is there a secret to it?

1298
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:23,228
Well…

1299
01:47:26,022 --> 01:47:28,442
They say the sun shines

1300
01:47:29,234 --> 01:47:31,820
the brightest before it sets.

1301
01:47:34,364 --> 01:47:36,366
I expect it will subside soon.

1302
01:47:37,742 --> 01:47:39,661
What's your take, Mr. Lee?

1303
01:47:41,288 --> 01:47:43,039
Since he quit smoking,

1304
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:45,375
he stopped making mistakes
in the closing stages.

1305
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,169
It must've been the cigarettes.

1306
01:47:49,004 --> 01:47:49,838
Thank you.

1307
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:55,927
Finally, could you both tell us
how you'll approach tomorrow's match?

1308
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:01,600
Chang-ho's gotten a taste
for comeback wins lately,

1309
01:48:01,683 --> 01:48:03,977
which is probably
why he let me win the first game,

1310
01:48:05,437 --> 01:48:09,107
but now that we're at it, I'll turn
tomorrow's match into another lesson.

1311
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:14,237
I think one loss was enough for a lesson.

1312
01:48:16,156 --> 01:48:19,659
Many of you seem to be
rooting for Mr. Cho's victory,

1313
01:48:20,243 --> 01:48:22,913
but I'm not willing to relinquish

1314
01:48:23,705 --> 01:48:25,790
the hard-won champion title so easily.

1315
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:51,775
Chang-ho, it's you again?

1316
01:48:55,111 --> 01:48:56,446
Yes, sir.

1317
01:49:01,326 --> 01:49:02,410
It is what it is.

1318
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:04,704
This is what a match is.

CHO HOON-HYUN TOOK BACK
THE GUKSU CHAMPION TITLE, HIS SYMBOL

1323
01:50:26,786 --> 01:50:29,039
FROM LEE CHANG-HO AFTER FIVE YEARS
ON THE DAY OF THE FIRST SNOW.

1324
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:30,206
THE FIRST SNOW FELL THAT DAY.

1325
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:39,299
LEE CHANG-HO RULED AT THE TOP
OF THE INTERNATIONAL GO SCENE FOR 15 YEARS

1326
01:50:39,382 --> 01:50:40,717
FOLLOWING HIS TEACHER'S FOOTSTEPS

1327
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,136
AND IS STILL CONSIDERED
THE STRONGEST PLAYER IN HISTORY.

1328

THE TEACHER AND THE STUDENT

1329
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:53,813
ARE STILL ACTIVELY PLAYING.
