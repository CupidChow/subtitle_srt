1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,509
Dad,

2
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:09,509
why didn't you ever tell me

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,820
the world is so boring?

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,190
The world where everyone's
constantly judging you.

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,100
It would be nice if there was
someone who doesn't do that.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,210
- Gotcha!
- Hey!

7
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,579
What's with you?

8
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:44,850
The duo, Ryu and Zen, are ready
to dominate the court once more!

9
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,590
Whoo! Catch!

10
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,619
Ryu swiftly passes the ball to Zen.

11
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,259
And Zen passes it back to Ryu again

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,200
before Ryu runs ahead and shoots!

13
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,100
Whoa, that was so close!
That guy sucks!

14
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,500
- I suck, you say?
- Hey!

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,540
What's with you?

16
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,239
Hey, Ryu! That hurts!

17
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,219
That's enough. I'm tired.

18
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,959
- There.
- Ow!

19
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,489
That hurts.

20
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,829
Well, you annoyed me first.

21
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,099
So? Do you feel better now?

22
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:46,810
And remember my face
before you get into another fight.

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,049
- Your face?
- For sure.

24
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,650
I always have to fix things for you.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,420
And when it's about Coach, he always
punishes us with push-ups.

26
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,859
I'm exhausted.

27
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:02,659
Ryu,

28
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:04,959
do you know

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,069
I've got your back?

30
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,840
Yes, I do.

31
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,590
(The Rebound)

32
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,659
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

33
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,300
There's practice
after school every day

34
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,430
from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.

35
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,770
Sometimes there's
morning practice at 6:30 a.m.

36
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,909
Don't miss it and don't be late.

37
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,909
And which locker can I use?

38
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,120
(Ryu)

39
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,050
Huh?

40
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,389
That's my old one. How come...

41
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,789
It stinks.

42
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,860
I don't know
what its former owner left in there.

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,860
No one wants to use it.

44
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,529
You kept the key for me?

45
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,439
Why did you come back
all of a sudden?

46
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,540
Didn't you say you weren't going to
play for the school team anymore?

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,879
You know I do as I please.

48
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,649
I had no idea.

49
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,350
I never knew

50
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,750
ever since
you suddenly went missing.

51
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,399
I'm back, aren't I?

52
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,240
And you're going
to disappear again, aren't you?

53
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,269
A year, right?

54
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,779
What?

55
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,110
The school is allowing the club

56
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,480
to continue for only a year, right?

57
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Then they'll demolish it
to build a science building.

58
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:13,889
Mm.

59
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,750
That's what the director said.

60
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:21,259
But the board might
change their mind

61
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,730
if we make it through
the qualifying round.

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,399
Why are you stroking my hair?

63
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,610
Well,

64
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:37,040
I find Little Mister Zen adorable.

65
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,579
You're always daydreaming no matter
how many years have passed.

66
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,949
You're still unrealistic
like before.

67
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,550
Jerk,

68
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,550
I'm the captain.

69
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,050
I just don't want you
to dream too much.

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,019
Take a look at your teammates.

71
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,490
Ouch!

72
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,829
No way! I'm going to get us
through the qualifying round!

73
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,500
A street basketball player?

74
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,040
Yes, he's brutal. People always
lose to him when he's playing.

75
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:08,069
- Street basketball?
- Oh please.

76
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,980
How brutal can he be?
It's only street basketball.

77
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,709
Does he even know the rules
of a proper basketball team?

78
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,180
We'll be wasting
our time training him.

79
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,480
Ryu represented the school
the same time as Zen,

80
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,449
but then he mysteriously resigned.

81
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:22,490
So Ryu was here before us?

82
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,589
Before you too, Jed.

83
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:26,819
I think he should be

84
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,790
the one training you.

85
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,360
You too, Prince.

86
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,639
I'm not worried
about him being good.

87
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,069
I'm worried about something else.

88
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,470
- What's that?
- What's that?

89
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,839
Street basketball players
always get into fights.

90
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,910
Is our club going to get disbanded
because of these people again?

91
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,920
- That's true.
- You've got a point.

92
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,319
What are we going to do
if that happens again?

93
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,449
Darn.

94
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,259
I don't want to change clubs again.

95
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,990
You're stereotyping.

96
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,730
Not all street basketball players
are like him.

97
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:05,029
I can't help it, can I?

98
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,529
Our club got into trouble
because of drug problems.

99
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,199
It's normal to be worried.

100
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,069
We should be worrying
about team members right now.

101
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,769
We have to submit the names
tomorrow, and we're still one short.

102
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,339
There's a lot to do.

103
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,839
I wonder when the newbie's
going to stir up trouble.

104
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,709
It's like having
a ticking time bomb on the team.

105
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,920
No,

106
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,980
I don't think
Ryu's that kind of person.

107
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:28,920
What's the matter?

108
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,689
Are you a fortune teller?

109
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,560
Are you that confident in him?

110
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,060
Should we bet on it then?

111
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,629
I don't think
Ryu's going to disappoint us.

112
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,269
What if you're wrong?

113
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,600
That means we're betting
on our club's future.

114
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,810
Hey, Prince. A bunch of girls
are waiting for you.

115
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,620
Who are you going with?

116
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,480
Nan from class six?

117
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,319
Nook from grade nine?

118
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,189
I'm not going with anyone.

119
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,259
Oh? Why not?

120
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:11,300
I don't have feelings for them.
So why would I go with them?

121
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:15,629
Hang on. They're so pretty,
and you don't like them?

122
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,769
So who do you have feelings for?

123
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:23,470
Someone.

124
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,410
Who?

125
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,910
- Do I know them?
- Of course.

126
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:31,550
They're a prankster.

127
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,750
A big mouth.

128
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,559
And a busybody.

129
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,759
They don't sound
like a very nice person.

130
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,830
Why did you fall for them?

131
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,429
I know, right?

132
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,830
I don't know

133
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,200
why I fell for them either.

134
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,940
Come on. Let's get changed.

135
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,679
(Class 1 Grade 10)

136
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,389
Of course.

137
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,759
Come on.

138
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:14,230
Sure.

139
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,659
Hey, what are you doing?

140
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,259
- Don't move.
- Hey!

141
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,029
Can't I copy off of you?

142
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,000
- Give that back!
- Let's go.

143
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,440
Hey!

144
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,240
Hey!

145
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,210
Give it back!

146
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,580
Don't.

147
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,909
Our club might get disbanded
if you get into a fight.

148
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,919
Stop being so stingy.

149
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,059
No!

150
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,460
Don't burn it!

151
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,889
No!

152
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,029
Don't do it!

153
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,330
- You...
- Hey!

154
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,000
How is this any of your business?

155
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,110
Apologize to him!

156
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,750
Jedi. My name's Jedi.

157
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:10,850
What's with you?

158
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,179
Let go of me!

159
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,220
I'll set you on fire
if you don't say it.

160
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,830
All right! I'm sorry!

161
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,860
To whom? Speak up!

162
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,940
Jedi, I'm sorry!

163
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,769
I said it! So let me go!

164
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:39,580
What are you doing?

165
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,990
Are you finished?
Can we sit with you?

166
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,570
Zen, I don't think our club's
going to make it to the next game

167
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,840
if things continue like this.

168
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,809
I agree. He already got
into a fight on his first day here.

169
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,179
Good thing he got off
with a warning.

170
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,879
But we'll get disbanded for sure
if it happens again.

171
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,990
Let's see how it goes.

172
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,720
But I'll talk to him anyway

173
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,220
so he won't start a fight again.

174
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,590
- But I...
- It's okay.

175
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,799
I'll handle this.

176
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,429
Eat up.

177
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,669
All right.

178
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,830
Can I sit with you?

179
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:15,370
Jedi.

180
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,309
Who's a fan of Star Wars?
Your mom or dad?

181
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:19,139
Huh?

182
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:20,710
My name?

183
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:22,679
The whole family, actually.

184
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,820
Are you a fan too?

185
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,379
No, I'm not.

186
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,960
Here. Grade 10 textbooks.

187
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,059
The teacher said
you just transferred here.

188
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,389
You can call me by my name.

189
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,700
Mm. The teacher said
you just transferred here, Ryu.

190
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,299
So I got you the books.

191
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,340
Let me know
if you want me to tutor you.

192
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,639
I'm happy to help.

193
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,549
What's up with you now?

194
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,950
Let's shake hands and become allies.

195
00:12:57,649 --> 00:12:59,919
You don't look like someone
who has any friends.

196
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,320
Let's form a galactic alliance.

197
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,159
The heroes of Star Wars.

198
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:10,460
Shut up and eat
if you want to be friends with me.

199
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:18,240
Anyway, thanks so much
for helping bring Ryu back.

200
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:20,299
He's not actually a difficult case.

201
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,909
His mom always donates
whenever we need sponsors.

202
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:28,610
His mom?

203
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,350
Oh?

204
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,250
He's not an orphan? Isn't that why
he's involved in street basketball?

205
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,620
I don't think so.

206
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,419
No one knows what happened to him.

207
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,990
Anyway, thank you so much
for bringing him back.

208
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,730
That's okay.
It's necessary after all.

209
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,830
We were a few players short.

210
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:50,169
Besides, I gave you
my word, Director.

211
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,639
Did you find all 12?

212
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,440
Well, not yet. We're still short.

213
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,279
But I'm looking.

214
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,789
- Exchange?
- Yes.

215
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,919
That's it.

216
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:26,539
Hey.

217
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:27,970
Can you pass it back?

218
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,909
Sure.

219
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,350
Whoa. That was a lucky shot.

220
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,490
Being lucky implies
a lack of intent.

221
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,460
But I did it intentionally.
So it wasn't lucky.

222
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,830
Can I play with you guys?

223
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:51,929
Sorry. There isn't
an opening on our team.

224
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,629
Go and play somewhere else, loser.

225
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,070
Come on.

226
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,080
Do you like shooting hoops?

227
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:08,850
Yes, sir.

228
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:10,909
Are you free this evening?

229
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:15,620
I'd like to introduce you
to our final member.

230
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,289
Can you introduce yourself?

231
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,590
Hello. I'm Chogun.
I'm in grade 10, class 1.

232
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,299
Are you really going
to let me play with you?

233
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,470
Zen, doesn't he have autism?

234
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,740
Right? Are you sure he's up for it?

235
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,409
Coach, we don't have much time
to practice before our next game.

236
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,639
We don't have time to help him.

237
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,940
That's right.

238
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,879
Shouldn't we spend it practicing?

239
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,450
Give him a ball.

240
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,450
Chogun.

241
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,820
Shoot.

242
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,570
Whoa, a three-pointer.

243
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,470
Again.

244
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,679
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

245
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,019
Wow!

246
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,190
How did you pull that off?

247
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,960
Have I done something wrong?

248
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,419
Not at all.

249
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,990
You haven't done anything wrong.

250
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,889
That was excellent, Chogun.

251
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,799
Does that mean we have
12 players on our team now?

252
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,440
And which position
would you like us to play, Coach?

253
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,039
Hm...

254
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,309
I think I'll have to see
what you've got first.

255
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,409
Let's do it this way.

256
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:52,950
Show me whichever position
you think you're good at.

257
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,820
Okay?

258
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,860
A basketball match begins
with five players on each team.

259
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:04,400
A team comprises
of five main positions.

260
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,130
The point guards control the ball.

261
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,569
The shooting guards
score from a distance.

262
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,769
The small forwards break
through the opponent's line.

263
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,269
The centers are positioned
underneath the basket.

264
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,680
They have to be tall
and good at playing defense.

265
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,880
And finally, the power forwards
or the inner wings.

266
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,319
They have to be good
at both defense and offense.

267
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,990
They play by their strengths
and score from the inner circle.

268
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,160
And most of them have
to be good on the rebound as well.

269
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,289
A jump ball involves one player
from each team

270
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,660
trying to take control of the ball
that gets tossed in the air

271
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,000
and pass it on
to their waiting teammates.

272
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:44,029
Whichever team gets it
will have a better chance.

273
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,029
Ryu's team is now on the offense.

274
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,299
Ryu!

275
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,829
This way!

276
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Pass it!

277
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,029
Over here.

278
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,970
The streets and the court
aren't the same, you know?

279
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,440
Try me.

280
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,799
Bring it on.

281
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,180
Hey!

282
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:06,079
Do you think you're so tough?

283
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,920
You!

284
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:09,990
- Ouch!
- Hey!

285
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Why are you guys fighting?

286
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,920
- Zen!
- Enough!

287
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,230
- Hey!
- Hey!

288
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,599
I told you to play basketball,

289
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:21,599
not boxing!

290
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,670
Oh, okay! You have
strength to spare?

291
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,299
All right.

292
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,410
Get into position for push-ups!

293
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,339
Are you all deaf?

294
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,480
But Coach,

295
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm bleeding!

296
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,319
Why are you telling me?
Do you think I'm your mother?

297
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,720
Clean it yourself!

298
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,890
Down on the floor!

299
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:48,759
Our team's rule is that

300
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,759
everyone shares the responsibility
of one person's wrongdoing!

301
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,329
Give me 100 push-ups! Go!

302
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,599
- What?
- Huh?

303
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:56,599
Two-hundred!

304
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,339
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

305
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,039
Didn't you hear what I said?

306
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,970
I did.

307
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,140
But I'm not doing it.
I'm not in the wrong.

308
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,279
Hey!

309
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,480
Isn't the word "rule"
in your vocabulary?

310
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,619
Didn't we get in trouble
because you were roughhousing?

311
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:15,390
But Jed started it.

312
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,490
And?

313
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,890
The coach's punishing all of us.
You have to do it.

314
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,960
I'm not in the wrong.

315
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,460
Everyone's getting punished,

316
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,099
yet you still insist
you're not in the wrong?

317
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,329
Yes!

318
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,599
Ryu!

319
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,369
Ryu, wait.

320
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:38,880
What's up with you?

321
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,750
Can you calm down
if you want to keep playing?

322
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,109
You're saying I started it.

323
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,119
I don't know if you did or not.

324
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,390
But you shouldn't insult
other people like that.

325
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,049
And what about him insulting me?

326
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,690
You're no different
from everyone else.

327
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,559
I always look bad
in everyone's eyes anyway.

328
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,299
Move.

329
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,299
Move!

330
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:08,539
Hey!

331
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,529
Zen?

332
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,170
What's the matter?

333
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Oh, you're
one of our customers, aren't you?

334
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,609
I'm glad you remember.

335
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,549
I'm Atom.

336
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,319
Of course I remember.

337
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,589
I'm not that forgetful.

338
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:03,089
Right, Zen. I just moved here.

339
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,559
Can you recommend
some good places to eat?

340
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,599
I want to eat something.

341
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:09,799
Oh, sure.

342
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:14,869
Go up two streets,
turn left and then right.

343
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,309
And it's right there.
That place is really good.

344
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,440
Hm.

345
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,240
Can you help me get there?

346
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,920
And you can keep me company too.

347
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:29,220
I want to pay you back
for jumping in the pool to save me.

348
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,089
Atom, you're not going to
stop mocking me at all?

349
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,960
That was so embarrassing.

350
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,299
I'm not mocking you.

351
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:40,599
I'm actually impressed

352
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,069
that you did that.

353
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,170
I think it was cute.

354
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,910
Yo!

355
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,819
Where were you?
Why didn't you join me for dinner?

356
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:07,460
I bought something for you too.

357
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:09,529
I was at school.

358
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:10,829
Huh.

359
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,359
That's right. I completely forgot
you go to school.

360
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,569
Right. Boss contacted me again.

361
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,309
I told you. I quit.

362
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,710
Don't be so dramatic.

363
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,519
All right. One last time.

364
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,849
Make him some money.

365
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,690
And I'll help you tell him.

366
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:37,990
Okay?

367
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:43,890
Hey.

368
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,029
Come on. Why the long face?

369
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,000
Don't ruin your good looks.

370
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,440
I don't feel well. I'm going to bed.

371
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:58,309
Oh?

372
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,980
You're kicking me out now,
dear brother?

373
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,710
I'm not. I really don't feel well.

374
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,180
For real?

375
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:10,789
You don't have a temperature.

376
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:13,960
Q,

377
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,589
I want to go to bed.

378
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
All right.

379
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,230
I'll go.

380
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:34,710
All right. Let's dig in.

381
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,119
Mm!

382
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,220
This is heaven.

383
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,559
- Mm!
- Mm!

384
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,759
Indeed.

385
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,599
Seeing you smile
makes me feel better.

386
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,569
Were you okay back then?
You looked stressed.

387
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,039
Did something happen?

388
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,279
Nothing.

389
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,640
I was just a bit bummed out.

390
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,049
Two people on my basketball team
got into a fight.

391
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,980
You're a basketball player?

392
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:16,519
Mm.

393
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,390
I'm also the team captain.

394
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,859
That's awesome.

395
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,369
And you?

396
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,640
What are you doing here?

397
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,210
Well,

398
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,210
I moved here with my parents.
Pretty normal.

399
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,150
Don't you miss your friends

400
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:46,420
at your old school at all?

401
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,589
No, I didn't really
have that many friends.

402
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:58,559
I transferred schools a lot
before I went to my old one.

403
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,700
It happened so often I didn't get
to make friends before moving again.

404
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:04,369
Whoa.

405
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,069
I can imagine that.

406
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,069
Your story dwarves my problem.

407
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,410
Hey, my story isn't that dramatic.

408
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,720
Come on. Let's take a selfie.

409
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,930
One, two...

410
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,160
Okay.

411
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,470
That's nice.

412
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:40,269
Can I take a photo of just you too?

413
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,509
Sure.

414
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:47,309
One, two...

415
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,549
- Okay.
- Is that all right?

416
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:51,750
Of course.

417
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,319
That was cute.

418
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,450
Can I post it
on social media as well?

419
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,190
You're the first friend
I made here after all.

420
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,460
Of course you can.

421
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,759
I'll tag you too then.

422
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,700
What's your account name?

423
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:11,799
Oh.

424
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,869
Of course.

425
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:20,539
Here.

426
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,549
- I'll post it then?
- Mm.

427
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,049
All right. Dribbling drills.

428
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,450
Ready?

429
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:58,109
Everyone, put your vest
in this basket.

430
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,960
Thank you. Thank you.

431
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,099
Lin, are you forgetting something?

432
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,839
What am I forgetting?

433
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,339
- The group report!
- That's right.

434
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,509
I completely forgot.

435
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:31,980
What should I do?

436
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,789
Leave it there, Lin. I'll do it.

437
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,690
Didn't something urgent come up?

438
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,160
But this is my job.

439
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,390
Just go. It's okay.

440
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:46,700
You've already done so much.

441
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,099
Really?

442
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,329
All right.

443
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,000
Thanks for helping, Zen.

444
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,670
I'll treat you
to some dessert later.

445
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:56,269
- Sure. You should get going.
- Bye.

446
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:58,009
Let's go.

447
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,220
- Gotcha.
- Hey!

448
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,490
What are you doing?

449
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,490
Catch!

450
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:54,200
Hey, your instincts are still intact.

451
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,799
Did you follow me here?

452
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,000
Don't flatter yourself, PF.

453
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:00,869
I just came up here
to hang laundry.

454
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,569
Then I spotted you lying there
like some tragic hero.

455
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,410
Catch.

456
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,119
We're not little kids anymore.
Why are we still doing this?

457
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:21,289
Whoo!

458
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,559
- Hello, Q?
- Ryu,

459
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:55,160
you're not going
to flake out on me, are you?

460
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,930
- Mm.
- Just don't bail on me.

461
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,829
I won't.

462
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,640
Is something the matter?

463
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:11,170
No, I have to get going.

464
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,339
You're going to play
in a street game again, aren't you?

465
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:16,950
Do you have
to win or lose this time?

466
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,049
Is it going to kill you
to stay out of my business?

467
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,480
I can't do that.

468
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,519
I'm the team captain now,

469
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,619
and you're my teammate.

470
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:29,160
Practice is over.

471
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,730
I'm not your teammate,

472
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,430
and you're not my captain.

473
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,700
But you're only...

474
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:42,410
my Little Mister Zen.

475
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,720
Hold on!

476
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,029
What now?

477
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,529
I'm coming with you.

478
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,160
What a busybody.

479
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,500
I'm playing a street game.
You're still going to come?

480
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,069
Yes, I'll go.

481
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,140
Huh? Zen?

482
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:15,940
Get going, will you?

483
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,410
Don't you have
your part-time job to go to?

484
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,680
Other people are on the schedule.
I don't have to go.

485
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:25,250
Can you just drive now?

486
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,750
Are you really up for this, Captain?

487
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:29,119
I won't pick you up if you fall off.

488
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:36,930
Then I'll hold onto you like this.

489
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,559
If I go down, then you'll be
going down with me.

490
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,630
Try me.

491
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:43,170
- Go on.
- Sure.

492
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,200
- Hold tight, Little Mister Zen.
- Mm.

493
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,400
Hey, Ryu! Are you messing with me?

494
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,900
Can you slow down?

495
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:17,470
Are you scared, Captain?

496
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,000
I'm not.

497
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:23,440
Hey, Ryu! Slow down!

498
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,809
Ryu!

499
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,349
Q,

500
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,289
Did you remind Ryu?

501
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,519
Yes, Boss.

502
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,859
He's been reminded.

503
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,430
So where is he then?

504
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,930
Why haven't I seen him on the court?

505
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,609
Something urgent came up.

506
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,970
He's on his way here.

507
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,180
Something urgent.

508
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,910
You know how much I lost
because of him last time?

509
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,480
I hope you won't
disappoint me tonight.

510
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,190
No, Boss.

511
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,289
It won't happen again.

512
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,630
Good.

513
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,139
Darn it.

514
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,909
(Congee Jumbalaya)

515
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,380
Why did you stop?

516
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:34,909
Oh?

517
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,280
Twenty skewers of chicken, please.

518
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,420
I'll scan to pay.

519
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,599
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

520
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:00,670
Here.

521
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,139
What's with you?

522
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,110
You're hungry, aren't you?

523
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:07,010
Not really.

524
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:15,920
Your stomach is rumbling.

525
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,420
(Congee Jumbalaya)

526
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,070
Come on. Get on the bike.

527
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:29,969
Huh?

528
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,599
You won't enjoy it as much here.
I'll take you somewhere else.

529
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,570
You couldn't get a hold of Ryu?

530
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,309
What have you been doing?
You're all useless.

531
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,380
- Who's substituting for him?
- I am.

532
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:50,019
Don't you remember?

533
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,590
I used to be the top player

534
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,289
before Ryu's breakthrough.

535
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,190
You? You're going to play?

536
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,760
I need Ryu.

537
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,099
But no one can get a hold of him.

538
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,969
He called me.

539
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,300
He got into a bit of an accident.

540
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:10,670
He won't be able to play anyway,
even if he gets here in time.

541
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,380
But your leg.

542
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,920
Forget about it, Boss.
Your work is more important.

543
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,650
Let's go.

544
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,619
After you.

545
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,659
Darn it.

546
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:39,670
Here.

547
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
Thanks.

548
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,219
That's delicious!

549
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:14,269
What are you laughing at?

550
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,639
What? Do I have food on my face?

551
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,019
All better now.

552
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,559
Thanks.

553
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,329
Ryu,

554
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,269
why did you come back
to join the team?

555
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,050
I want to keep the promise
I gave to someone.

556
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,369
The person that you said

557
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,809
introduced you to basketball?

558
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,690
I think

559
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,489
they're going to be very happy.

560
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,539
And...

561
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:56,309
aren't you going to play
street basketball anymore?

562
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,289
Do you want more?

563
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,130
You're feeding me?

564
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,469
There's something
on your face again.

565
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,880
Wipe it then.

566
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,150
There.

567
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,349
Pass the ball!

568
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,320
Pass it!

569
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:49,960
Yes, that's it!

570
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,059
Keep going!

571
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:56,769
Hey! Darn it!

572
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,139
Keep your hands up!

573
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,469
Out of the way!

574
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:25,130
Where were you?

575
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,500
Did you substitute for me?

576
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,500
I asked you a question.

577
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,869
I was practicing at school.

578
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,579
I told you I wanted to quit.

579
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,289
What's so great

580
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,829
about your friends at school?
Why have you changed so much?

581
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,500
It has nothing to do
with other people.

582
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,369
I can make my own decisions.

583
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,469
Someone like you

584
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:11,840
isn't suitable to be
at a place like that.

585
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,340
Suitable or not,

586
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,880
I make my own choices.

587
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,789
Seriously,

588
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,119
do you still consider me
your brother?

589
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:55,949
So?

590
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,519
- Did you score?
- No!

591
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:58,590
You didn't?

592
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,989
- Hyah!
- Hey!

593
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,730
It's okay.

594
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,360
One, two, three!

595
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:11,900
- Yay!
- Yay!

596
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,610
- Yay!
- Yay! Well done!

597
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,510
Well done, Ryu.

598
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:29,550
One day, you will become

599
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,389
basketball's most valuable player.

600
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,219
Dad, I'm going to be a basketball
superstar when I grow up.

601
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,159
And I'll bring home
the MVP award for you to see.

602
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,659
Ah, I guess that's a promise?

603
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,429
Yes, I promise!

604
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,559
Ma'am?

605
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:44,389
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

606
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:46,000
Can you get up? I'll help you.

607
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:50,699
It's all right.

608
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,369
Thank you so much.

609
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,599
Here. I'll carry these.

610
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,170
Where are you going?

611
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,139
I'm about to head home.

612
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:01,909
- Should I give you a lift?
- It's all right. Thank you so much.

613
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,380
It's okay. I'll give you a lift.

614
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,420
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

615
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,789
Do you live alone, ma'am?

616
00:44:09,889 --> 00:44:11,219
I live with my grandson.

617
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,320
But he's working part-time
at a cafe nearby.

618
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:15,360
He'll be home soon.

619
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,429
Oh.

620
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,030
Are you sure you can manage
on your own?

621
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,230
Of course. Don't worry.

622
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:26,940
Then do you mind
giving me your phone

623
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,170
so I can add my number?

624
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,969
Oh, please do.

625
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,510
Here's my number.

626
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:39,780
You can always call me
if you can't reach your grandson.

627
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:42,480
My name's Atom.
I recently moved here.

628
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,650
You're very lovely.

629
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:50,829
Ma'am, which cafe did you say
your grandson's working at?

630
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:53,960
Oh, Café for All up the road.

631
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,980
Get home safe, Zen.

632
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,210
- Bye, Golf.
- Bye.

633
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,449
Bye. See you later.

634
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,449
Let's go. I'll give you two a lift.

635
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,889
We'll take my car,
but I parked it on the next street.

636
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,619
I'm hungry too, actually.

637
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,840
Hey, what are you doing?

638
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,210
Take him away.

639
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:59,230
I'm going to be a basketball
superstar when I grow up.

640
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:02,360
And I'll bring home
the MVP award for you to see.

641
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:06,769
I will keep my promise, Dad.

642
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,380
Q?

643
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,190
What's going on?

644
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:31,523
I'm going
to cut your wrist with this.

645
00:46:32,654 --> 00:46:33,494
Zen!

646
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:34,994
Do you have feelings for him?

647
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:38,293
I'm worried those guys might
come back to harass you again.

648
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:40,233
I don't want you to get beaten up
because of me again.

649
00:46:41,463 --> 00:46:43,603
In my opinion,
I don't think you guys are ready.

650
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:46,474
So when then? The next game
is less than two weeks away.

651
00:46:46,574 --> 00:46:47,643
Atom?

652
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:49,503
Is that you, Ryu?

653
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:51,273
Zen told me you're making desserts.

654
00:46:51,413 --> 00:46:52,674
Please let me help you.
