1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
Zen.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,880
What?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,320
Do your best, guys!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,239
What about Ryu?

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,439
Ryu, what are you doing?
Why aren't you getting in the car?

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,079
What are you waiting for?

7
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:39,240
I'm sorry, Mom.

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,719
- Wait.
- Ryu!

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,960
- Sir?
- Get off!

10
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,079
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,640
I'd like to see it for myself.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,399
But I can't promise that
I'll change my mind.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,479
It's okay. I'm just happy
everyone's here. After you.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,840
- Let go of me!
- No, sir.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,840
- Are you deaf? I said let go!
- Ryu!

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,840
Ryu, stop right now!

17
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,799
Can you stop behaving
like a rabid dog already?

18
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,239
Mom,

19
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,319
just let me go and play.

20
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,599
This game is very important to me.

21
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,719
There's nothing more important
than the future I've chosen for you.

22
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,439
You can be angry
with me all you want.

23
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,879
But one day,

24
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,200
you'll understand
I've been doing everything for you.

25
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,400
I've been trying
to get better at basketball.

26
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,239
But not because of Dad.

27
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,079
Because I know
he'll never come back.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
That's not true! You play basketball
to provoke me

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,040
so that I'll never forget about him.

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,439
How could I provoke you

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,359
if you've never come to see me play?

32
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,400
Before you decide my fate,

33
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,040
can you at least watch me play?

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Get in the car.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,280
Mom.

36
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,280
- Mom!
- Let's go, sir.

37
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,679
(The Rebound)

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,520
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

39
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,639
Hey.

40
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,439
We meet again.

41
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,960
James.

42
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,520
Consider this a rematch.

43
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,759
Where are your two other friends?
Aren't they here?

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,560
Then this time around
is going to be much harder for you.

45
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,639
Where's Ryu?

46
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,039
Right? Who's going
to mesh with Zen then?

47
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,639
Right? How are they going to
defeat the other team now?

48
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,879
Ball!

49
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,079
Do you even know how to play, dummy?

50
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Hey.

51
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Come on, Chogun.

52
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,610
Oh? Are you too dumb to play?

53
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,610
- Hey!
- Huh?

54
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,120
Timeout.

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,079
They're using violence,

56
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,920
and they're representing our school.

57
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,560
This is very embarrassing.

58
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,759
They're playing dirty.

59
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,879
If it weren't a game, I'd give them
a taste of my punches.

60
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,399
Calm down.

61
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,839
Okay.

62
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,160
I know how you're feeling right now.

63
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,839
Those guys are trying

64
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,920
to trick you into committing fouls,

65
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,120
especially you, Chogun.

66
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,079
But they're being so mean.

67
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,240
They called me dumb too.

68
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,399
I don't like it at all.

69
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,879
Chogun, I understand.

70
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,160
But that's their plan.

71
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,519
They wanted to make you feel
that way, understand?

72
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,199
Zen,

73
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,560
it's up to you now.

74
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,959
You're the backbone of the team now.

75
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,040
I'll try, Coach.

76
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,199
Great.

77
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,680
- Oh?
- Dear, dear!

78
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,240
This is Tanwarin's third foul.

79
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:25,319
If that's the case,
St. Paul's will get a penalty shot.

80
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,879
Then we'll have to find out

81
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,199
if the penalty will leave Tanwarin
even further in the dust.

82
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,839
How many fouls now?

83
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,720
It doesn't look good, Coach.

84
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,759
First, get ready.

85
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,959
Excuse me?

86
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,040
I said get ready to jump in.

87
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,199
Yes, Coach!

88
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,000
This is your chance. Do your best.

89
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,959
Lin,

90
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,360
I can do this, right?

91
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,759
Hey.

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
Be confident.

93
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,360
All right. If you play well today,

94
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,160
I'll treat you to a movie
on Saturday, okay?

95
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Good luck.

96
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,079
Come here.

97
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,639
Our team's going down this round.

98
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,519
The game isn't over yet,
and there's still a lot of time.

99
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,959
Stay positive.

100
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,240
Okay. Um...

101
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,720
We've already come this far.

102
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,680
I want you to think
about it this way.

103
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,960
No matter the outcome,

104
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,399
I want you to remember that
you did your best. Okay?

105
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,039
Okay. Chogun, take a break.

106
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,330
First, you sub for him.

107
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,799
- Go.
- Come on.

108
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,000
Coach.

109
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,120
Can I play?

110
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,120
Sorry. Something came up.

111
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,799
Where have you been?

112
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,879
Long story. Let's play.

113
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,090
All right. Get ready.

114
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,960
I thought you weren't coming.

115
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,799
I made you a promise.
Of course I'd be here.

116
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,639
I told you to be
the first to arrive.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,039
I'm here, aren't I?

118
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Let's get warmed up.

119
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,120
All right. Let's go.

120
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,090
Finally!

121
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,120
I thought you were so scared
of me that you chickened out.

122
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,639
Don't be so delusional.

123
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,720
Ryu-Zen! Go! Go!
Tanwarin, hang in there!

124
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,399
Ryu-Zen, show 'em!
To the death, Ryu-Zen!

125
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,919
Ryu-Zen! Go! Go!
Tanwarin, hang in there!

126
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,480
Ryu-Zen, show 'em!
To the death, Ryu-Zen!

127
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,039
Ryu-Zen! Go! Go!
Tanwarin, hang in there!

128
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,960
Ryu-Zen, show 'em!
To the death, Ryu-Zen!

129
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,039
Ryu!

130
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,398
When will you quit being
the basketball coach

131
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,090
of a lowly school
and find a proper job?

132
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,360
But basketball is my dream.

133
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,519
How can you ask me
to throw it all away?

134
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,240
This is not the time
for empty hopes and dreams!

135
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,840
Don't you see how fast
our son's growing?

136
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,559
He's getting bigger every day,
and the expenses are increasing!

137
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,960
Don't you see?

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,480
Everything I've been doing

139
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,120
is for you and our son!

140
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,480
It's not enough!

141
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,720
I don't want my son and me
to be sitting on a pile of debt

142
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,000
that we'll never pay off.

143
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,919
Well, I'm trying.

144
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,519
I've been trying!

145
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,600
You have to choose

146
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,679
between me and Ryu

147
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,399
and that stupid basketball.

148
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:35,200
Please don't do this.

149
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,799
Don't do this.

150
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Get out.

151
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,279
Get out!

152
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,559
Darling.

153
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,320
I said get out!

154
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,120
Get out.

155
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,360
Get out.

156
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,039
Get out!

157
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,039
Dad.

158
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,000
You can be angry
with me all you want.

159
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,600
But one day,

160
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,879
you'll understand
I've been doing everything for you.

161
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,559
Before you decide my fate,

162
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,039
can you at least watch me play?

163
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,799
Ryu-Zen, show 'em!
To the death, Ryu-Zen!

164
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,480
Ryu-Zen! Go! Go!
Tanwarin, hang in there!

165
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,720
Ryu-Zen, show 'em!
To the death, Ryu-Zen!

166
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,720
Ryu-Zen! Go! Go!
Tanwarin, hang in there!

167
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,440
- Yes!
- Whoa!

168
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,240
Since Ryu joined the game,
Zen's been playing so well!

169
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,519
Whoa!

170
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,639
Tanwarin is the underdog once again.

171
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,879
Feinting and all.

172
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,360
And now the score is tied.

173
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,159
Are you here to support Ryu as well?

174
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,600
- Yes.
- Oh?

175
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,158
Why didn't you tell us
you're on the same side?

176
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,840
And how can you be empty-handed?

177
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,480
Here. Take this, please.

178
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,320
- Let's root for them together.
- Please.

179
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,799
- Let's do it.
- Root for them with us.

180
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,600
Of course. Thank you.

181
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,720
First, there's not much time!

182
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,000
Ten seconds!

183
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,039
Only ten seconds!

184
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,399
You have to take the shot!

185
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Come on. Get up.

186
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,639
Are you okay?

187
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,819
Wow! That was a very close call
for Tanwarin in the last second!

188
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:24,285
That's my school.

189
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,190
I've always been rooting for them.
Aren't they good?

190
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:51,062
Ryu.

191
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:55,383
Thanks.

192
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:23,702
Handle it for me.

193
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:26,143
That's right.

194
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,623
Thanks so much...

195
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:29,383
I have to go.

196
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,143
Mom,

197
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,342
how did I do?

198
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:57,663
I canceled your flight.

199
00:16:58,783 --> 00:16:59,783
Huh?

200
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:03,702
Mom?

201
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:14,942
Ryu,

202
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:18,073
you looked amazing out there.

203
00:17:19,262 --> 00:17:20,742
When you were calm and silent,

204
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:24,982
you were cool just like me.
Don't you know?

205
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:35,833
Mom, thank you so much

206
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:37,833
for coming to watch me play.

207
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,103
Ryu,

208
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:30,073
are you sure your mom's okay
with you staying the night here?

209
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,073
Well, I missed you.

210
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:36,782
You're always exaggerating.

211
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:43,502
And you?

212
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:45,353
Did you miss me?

213
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:47,982
Of course.

214
00:18:48,982 --> 00:18:50,022
But I...

215
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:54,183
I want you to spend more time
with your mom.

216
00:18:56,942 --> 00:19:00,143
I'm sorry I was late today.

217
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:02,593
As always.

218
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:08,702
What are you doing?

219
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:10,502
Making it up to you.

220
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:21,702
You want to make up for it?

221
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,502
Here. I'll help.

222
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:41,942
You want to help me,

223
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:44,383
but you still need to do yours.

224
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:01,982
We made it to the finals.

225
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:04,542
Do you think the school's
going to overturn their decision?

226
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:10,143
For sure. Come on.

227
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:27,863
Hey, Ton.

228
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,183
So? What did the committee say?

229
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:33,462
Well...

230
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:36,623
They're not changing their minds?

231
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:38,782
Mm.

232
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:41,862
But you still should be
very proud of yourselves

233
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:44,103
whether the club gets to
continue or not.

234
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,833
Because at least,

235
00:20:46,782 --> 00:20:47,833
our team gets to be

236
00:20:48,222 --> 00:20:52,222
one of the two teams to
represent our province at nationals.

237
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,423
How is that possible, Coach?

238
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:57,942
Nationals are during
the next school year.

239
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,981
That's right. although we get to be
in the finals,

240
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:01,502
we won't be able to go
to nationals anyway.

241
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:08,863
Don't lose hope just yet.

242
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:13,702
The school might change its mind
if we win our next game.

243
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,022
What will you do
if the club gets disbanded?

244
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:29,353
Hm... I'd probably go back
to the Journalist Club.

245
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,742
But it'd be a shame.

246
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:34,353
We won't get to
see each other as much

247
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:36,262
if we're not in the same club.

248
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:46,942
- Lin.
- Hm?

249
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,863
Well...

250
00:21:50,262 --> 00:21:51,302
Well?

251
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:54,742
Is something the matter?

252
00:21:58,143 --> 00:21:59,343
I have a crush on you!

253
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:04,823
And for a while now.

254
00:22:06,222 --> 00:22:07,942
I know you have feelings for Ryu,

255
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:11,383
but I still like you anyway.

256
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:14,462
I've known that for ages.

257
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:16,583
How?

258
00:22:17,022 --> 00:22:18,262
Did someone tell you?

259
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:19,742
But I never told anyone.

260
00:22:20,702 --> 00:22:22,022
There's no need for that.

261
00:22:22,262 --> 00:22:25,103
I can see from a mile away
that you like me.

262
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:27,942
But anyway, thanks for telling me.

263
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:29,863
Well then.

264
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:31,702
Should we try going out together?

265
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:33,623
They say you'll live for eternity
if you date someone younger.

266
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:35,423
Slow down, cowboy.

267
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:38,583
Let's just talk. No need to rush.

268
00:22:38,742 --> 00:22:39,823
Talk like?

269
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:43,663
Not like brother and sister.
It's been ages already.

270
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,903
Whatever. It's your call.

271
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:50,462
Oh? Lin? What does that mean?

272
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:55,262
Grandma, I'm home.

273
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:56,502
Hi.

274
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,702
Grandma!

275
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:02,143
I told you to wait for me
to start making desserts.

276
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:05,663
Oh? It's okay. I can do it.
It's really nothing.

277
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:07,742
The doctor said you shouldn't
be working too hard.

278
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:09,782
Hard? It's nothing.

279
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,942
Are you tired?
You've been practicing hard.

280
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:15,063
The big game is coming up soon.

281
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,903
Anyway, you should've waited for me.

282
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,302
How could I wait?

283
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:24,262
I received an order,
so I had to get to it.

284
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:26,343
We'll lose money if we keep
the shop closed for too long.

285
00:23:26,462 --> 00:23:27,542
Grandma,

286
00:23:27,663 --> 00:23:29,583
your health is our priority.

287
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:33,143
I have to save up a lot of money

288
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:35,903
in case you go
to a sports university.

289
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,903
Then I'll be able to support you.

290
00:23:41,302 --> 00:23:42,302
Okay.

291
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,702
Here. I'll do this.

292
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:46,262
All right. Let's work together.

293
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,103
Phuket?

294
00:23:57,262 --> 00:24:00,502
It's an awesome proposal.

295
00:24:00,702 --> 00:24:03,143
The scout came to watch you play.
He thought you were great.

296
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,383
(Zen: I'm interested in
the Phuket scholarship.)

297
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:16,702
(Is it too late, Atom?)

298
00:24:19,903 --> 00:24:23,903
(Atom: No, it isn't.
Let's go there together.)

299
00:24:31,942 --> 00:24:35,981
Hello! Welcome to the final round

300
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:38,301
of the high school
basketball tournament.

301
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:41,343
We'll be finding out
who's going to nationals!

302
00:24:41,423 --> 00:24:43,222
Wow, this is very significant.

303
00:24:43,302 --> 00:24:49,902
Everyone here has been supporting
the two competing schools today.

304
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:53,103
- And who do we have with us?
- Tanwarin Wittaya

305
00:24:53,183 --> 00:24:55,583
and Bangkurat International!

306
00:24:55,663 --> 00:24:59,383
- Yes!
- Give it up!

307
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:02,863
It's time.

308
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:05,942
This will be the last game

309
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:10,183
we get to play together
as the school's team.

310
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:15,823
And no matter the outcome, I want to
say I'm very proud of all of you.

311
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:19,183
And it's been an honor
to be your coach.

312
00:25:19,663 --> 00:25:20,702
So,

313
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:22,702
I want this game

314
00:25:24,302 --> 00:25:27,863
to be the one that all of us will
remember forever.

315
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:29,742
Can you do that for me?

316
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:30,942
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

317
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:32,583
- Can you?
- Yes, Coach!

318
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:34,462
- Can you?
- Yes, Coach!

319
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:36,143
Let's go!

320
00:25:36,222 --> 00:25:37,423
- All right!
- Wait.

321
00:25:41,423 --> 00:25:42,982
I have something
important to tell you guys.

322
00:25:47,782 --> 00:25:49,423
I'm really sorry, everyone.

323
00:25:51,022 --> 00:25:52,022
But...

324
00:25:52,702 --> 00:25:54,982
this is the last game
I'm playing with you guys.

325
00:25:55,183 --> 00:25:56,183
Of course.

326
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,063
Our club's about to be disbanded.

327
00:25:58,823 --> 00:25:59,823
It's not that.

328
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:06,702
I'm transferring to a team in Phuket
after this game.

329
00:26:10,823 --> 00:26:13,302
- What have you done?
- Ryu...

330
00:26:14,262 --> 00:26:17,021
You asked me to come play with you,
and now you're abandoning me?

331
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:18,222
I'm sorry, Ryu.

332
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:21,863
I just don't want Grandma
to work hard for me anymore.

333
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:25,623
If I go, I'll get a scholarship.

334
00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:28,103
And Grandma will be able to
live more comfortably.

335
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:32,863
I'm sorry, Ryu.

336
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:33,942
Darn it!

337
00:26:34,702 --> 00:26:37,063
Hey, come on.

338
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:42,143
I'd like all of you
to understand Zen,

339
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:43,942
okay?

340
00:26:44,742 --> 00:26:46,383
It's his decision.

341
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,742
All right.

342
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:51,183
Let's go, everyone.

343
00:26:52,423 --> 00:26:53,903
Play this game

344
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:57,063
like it's the last game
we'll ever play.

345
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,982
Do your best,

346
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:00,903
okay?

347
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:02,383
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

348
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:03,462
Bring it in!

349
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:18,343
All together?

350
00:27:19,502 --> 00:27:21,942
- Tanwarin! Hey!
- Tanwarin! Hey!

351
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:42,302
Block them!

352
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:45,183
Oh?

353
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:52,663
Yes!

354
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:54,462
All right!

355
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:01,702
Go! Go!

356
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:40,063
Ryu, listen to me.

357
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,343
You have to.

358
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:43,542
How could you do this?

359
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:46,583
I'm sorry.

360
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:51,022
But basketball isn't
just between the two of us.

361
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:53,542
There are other people too, Ryu.

362
00:29:14,982 --> 00:29:16,462
I'm going to count to three.

363
00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:24,063
Let's make happy memories
together, Ryu.

364
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,583
One...

365
00:29:31,782 --> 00:29:32,903
- Two...
- Two...

366
00:29:35,462 --> 00:29:36,663
- Three...
- Three...

367
00:29:48,942 --> 00:29:50,183
I'm ready now.

368
00:29:52,863 --> 00:29:53,863
Thanks so much.

369
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:55,462
Hang on.

370
00:29:58,623 --> 00:30:00,022
Can I have some moral support?

371
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:05,742
Hey!

372
00:31:07,903 --> 00:31:08,903
Zen!

373
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:11,063
Go on! Go!

374
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,183
(Ryu and Zen)

375
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:54,262
Hey!

376
00:32:01,863 --> 00:32:03,143
Argh!

377
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,143
Time's almost up!

378
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:49,103
Time is up!

379
00:32:49,222 --> 00:32:52,663
And the winner is
Bangkurat International!

380
00:32:52,823 --> 00:32:54,022
Wow!

381
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:56,221
- Well done!
- Defeated by only one point!

382
00:32:56,222 --> 00:32:57,343
What a shame!

383
00:32:57,383 --> 00:32:59,022
But Tanwarin still did really well!

384
00:32:59,823 --> 00:33:00,982
Well done!

385
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:03,742
Excellent!

386
00:33:03,823 --> 00:33:05,623
- You did well.
- Come here.

387
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:09,103
Good job.

388
00:33:11,903 --> 00:33:13,143
I'm sorry, Ryu.

389
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:17,583
I couldn't make our final game
a good memory.

390
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:20,542
I'm really sorry.

391
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:23,542
Says who?

392
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:25,942
Getting to play with you is

393
00:33:26,262 --> 00:33:28,423
the best memory I'll ever have.

394
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:30,423
No,

395
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:32,262
our team will ever have.

396
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:41,742
Thanks.

397
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:43,022
Mm.

398
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:47,462
Second place? We really
got second place?

399
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:49,823
Zen,

400
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:53,383
people didn't believe
our team would make it,

401
00:33:53,462 --> 00:33:55,022
but you helped us win second place!

402
00:33:57,343 --> 00:33:58,863
Thank you, Zen.

403
00:33:59,383 --> 00:34:00,903
Thank you so much!

404
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:02,782
- Well done!
- Come on.

405
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:04,143
We got second place!

406
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:09,023
Good job!

407
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:10,583
You're so awesome!

408
00:34:10,663 --> 00:34:11,742
- You're good.
- Thanks so much, Captain!

409
00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:15,063
I'm at a loss for words.

410
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:16,623
Ryu, just now...

411
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:17,992
Well done.

412
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,262
All right, everyone!
Let's take some photos!

413
00:34:26,103 --> 00:34:29,422
Come on. Give me a smile.
We won second place.

414
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:31,543
Come on. Okay, ready?

415
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:35,342
One, two, three!

416
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:38,302
- Hey!
- Hey!

417
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,862
I'll probably miss this place a lot.

418
00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:27,952
Everywhere I look

419
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:30,822
is full of memories.

420
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:39,952
Can you not go?

421
00:35:44,262 --> 00:35:45,782
If I had a choice,

422
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:48,543
I'd want to stay as well.

423
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,623
But just like Coach Ton told us,

424
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:57,822
it's just life.

425
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:02,382
Nothing is certain.

426
00:36:04,143 --> 00:36:05,222
Some things

427
00:36:05,782 --> 00:36:07,583
are out of our control.

428
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:14,663
But this...

429
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:16,742
This you can control.

430
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,952
You can ask my mom
to give you a hand as well.

431
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:20,422
Just give me the word.

432
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:28,342
You're going to ask for money
from her so you can give it to me?

433
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:31,583
I won't accept it.

434
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:35,422
Do you think...

435
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,663
I'd be able to play
basketball with pride

436
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:46,472
if I were using money
I didn't earn myself?

437
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,952
Don't forget to visit me

438
00:37:03,702 --> 00:37:05,222
once you get there.

439
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:14,472
Mm.

440
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:16,992
For sure.

441
00:37:40,543 --> 00:37:41,543
Zen.

442
00:37:57,262 --> 00:37:58,262
Let's go.

443
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:00,623
Or you'll miss the contract signing.

444
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:47,902
(Q: Can you come out to see me?)

445
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:50,103
Where have you been, Q?

446
00:40:54,342 --> 00:40:55,543
I've been around.

447
00:40:58,583 --> 00:40:59,583
What about you?

448
00:41:00,262 --> 00:41:01,302
You're quite good, actually.

449
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:04,382
I heard

450
00:41:06,103 --> 00:41:08,143
your team won second place
at provincials?

451
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,342
Mm.

452
00:41:13,422 --> 00:41:14,422
And...

453
00:41:16,543 --> 00:41:17,623
what's next for you?

454
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:20,063
I heard

455
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:22,262
your club's about to be disbanded.

456
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:27,342
And your friend, Zen,

457
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,183
is leaving.

458
00:41:34,512 --> 00:41:35,822
You heard quite a lot.

459
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:38,583
Well,

460
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,063
I'll probably keep playing.

461
00:41:41,952 --> 00:41:43,623
I enjoy this kind of basketball.

462
00:41:44,663 --> 00:41:46,583
I don't want to go back
and play that way anymore.

463
00:41:55,742 --> 00:41:56,782
So cool.

464
00:41:58,023 --> 00:41:59,023
You're still...

465
00:42:00,382 --> 00:42:01,702
as cool as always.

466
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:06,952
Well...

467
00:42:08,063 --> 00:42:09,512
I had a good teacher like you.

468
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:17,222
- And uh...
- Excuse me?

469
00:42:18,183 --> 00:42:19,183
Yes?

470
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:21,063
We're closing in ten minutes.

471
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:24,023
Would you like to order
anything else?

472
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,143
One moment, please.

473
00:42:26,782 --> 00:42:27,782
Q...

474
00:42:31,023 --> 00:42:34,822
Well then. No more drinks for me.

475
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:52,782
(Q: Thanks for agreeing to meet...)

476
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:55,023
Thanks for agreeing to meet.

477
00:42:55,543 --> 00:42:58,822
I'm happy just knowing
you're doing well.

478
00:42:59,422 --> 00:43:01,663
I'll keep watch over you
from somewhere.

479
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:04,302
Keep going, brother.

480
00:44:34,623 --> 00:44:36,022
(Three Months Later)

481
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:38,023

(Assembly Hall
#SaveBasketballClub)

483
00:44:39,702 --> 00:44:41,503
(#SaveBasketballClub)

484
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,262
Guys,

485
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:47,183
it's time to get up and keep
practicing. Come on. Up!

486
00:44:49,262 --> 00:44:50,503
Yes, Captain!

487
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,222
That's the way to do it.

488
00:44:52,742 --> 00:44:54,183
The rest of you, come on.

489
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,742
Hey! Get up now!

490
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,543
If Coach comes back
and sees you slacking off,

491
00:45:00,943 --> 00:45:02,302
it'll be the death of you.

492
00:45:02,623 --> 00:45:05,302
But we've lost our motivation, Lin.

493
00:45:05,463 --> 00:45:07,623
Oh? I'm right here, aren't I?

494
00:45:08,023 --> 00:45:11,302
Who else do you want
motivation from, Jed?

495
00:45:11,782 --> 00:45:13,623
Hey, that's not what I meant.

496
00:45:14,342 --> 00:45:16,503
- So what did you mean?
- Well...

497
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:19,222
Well, I meant...

498
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:21,222
You're the only one for me.

499
00:45:21,902 --> 00:45:24,103
So I don't need motivation
from anyone else now.

500
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:28,861
Man, ever since
you guys went public,

501
00:45:28,862 --> 00:45:30,862
it's nothing but sweetness.

502
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:32,902
Shut up, Mai.

503
00:45:33,503 --> 00:45:34,503
And you guys too.

504
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:36,782
I'll kick your butt
if you keep teasing us.

505
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:39,543
Hey, guys.

506
00:45:40,023 --> 00:45:43,103
We fought until the committee agreed
to postpone disbanding the club.

507
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:44,663
So we have to keep it up.

508
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:45,943
Come on! Get up!

509
00:45:46,222 --> 00:45:48,143
Come on! Hang in there!

510
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:03,983
Captain, is everyone
on the team here?

511
00:46:04,663 --> 00:46:07,183
- Zen, you shouldn't be...
- He transferred back.

512
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:10,822
Our club's lifespan has been
extended as well.

513
00:46:11,183 --> 00:46:13,702
That's so awesome!

514
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:18,183
Congratulations, Captain.

515
00:46:19,463 --> 00:46:20,463
Can I still...

516
00:46:21,503 --> 00:46:23,103
be on the team?

517
00:46:24,103 --> 00:46:26,663
Of course. You're dressed
for the occasion anyway.

518
00:46:26,862 --> 00:46:29,862
But you won't be allowed
to leave again if you join.

519
00:46:30,503 --> 00:46:33,262
Okay, Captain.
I'm not going anywhere.

520
00:46:44,063 --> 00:46:48,063
Michael Jordan once said
he can accept failure

521
00:46:48,143 --> 00:46:52,302
because everyone fails at something.

522
00:46:52,382 --> 00:46:56,422
But he can't accept not trying.

523
00:46:56,663 --> 00:46:59,342
No matter which direction
life takes us,

524
00:46:59,503 --> 00:47:02,023
we'll always have the opportunity
to follow our dreams.

525
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:40,382
Enough. I'm spent.

526
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:42,422
What's wrong with you?

527
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:43,902
We haven't seen each other
in three months

528
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:45,422
and that's all you've got for me?

529
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,302
That's all, you say?

530
00:47:47,422 --> 00:47:50,143
I haven't even had a break
since I got back yesterday.

531
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:52,902
Where did you get all this energy?

532
00:47:53,742 --> 00:47:55,103
It's because I missed you.

533
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:56,342
Another round?

534
00:47:56,422 --> 00:47:57,422
Huh?

535
00:48:02,943 --> 00:48:05,222
Zen, do you remember

536
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:07,782
when you asked me
who I play basketball for?

537
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:09,862
I know the answer now.

538
00:48:11,342 --> 00:48:13,663
Mm. For whom?

539
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:16,103
For myself,

540
00:48:16,983 --> 00:48:18,183
and for you too.

541
00:48:18,782 --> 00:48:20,702
So? Deep, isn't it?

542
00:48:22,663 --> 00:48:24,063
It's average.

543
00:48:24,543 --> 00:48:26,342
- Average?
- Mm.

544
00:48:26,742 --> 00:48:28,261
I guess it's time for
some more punishment.

545
00:48:28,262 --> 00:48:29,302
Ryu!

546
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:30,663
Ryu!
