1
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,359
Are you Lin, the manager
of the basketball club?

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,160
Yes, ma'am.

3
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,760
(The Rebound)

4
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,760
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

5
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,000
Here you are, sir.

6
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,439
Thank you.

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Hang on.

8
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,640
Have a seat.

9
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,239
What?

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,239
Are you tired?

11
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,280
No.

12
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,598
What's the rush?
There are plenty of servers.

13
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,959
Sit here so I can watch your face.

14
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,530
They're preparing coffee.

15
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,960
Come on. Stay for a bit.

16
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,639
I should go and help them.

17
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,090
Are you going to defy your customer?

18
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,960
Give that a try. I'll unwrap
the straw for you.

19
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,000
This is cocoa, very tasty.
Our specialty.

20
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,530
You should try.

21
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,960
Is it less sweet?

22
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,719
Of course. It's like... 25 percent.

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,439
It seems the staff here
are very attentive.

24
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,919
I bet that's 50 percent sweet.

25
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,599
It's definitely only 25 sweet,

26
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,319
but then I also added
love which is another 25.

27
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,879
So that adds up to 50.

28
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,680
I'll give it 55
since you're way too cute.

29
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,120
Fifty-five?

30
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,919
Pay up.

31
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,719
I told you.
This guy's the real deal.

32
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,719
I never make mistakes
with this kind of thing.

33
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Take it.

34
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,960
We're at work, and there's
a bunch of people here!

35
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,159
What's up, Lin?

36
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Ryu,

37
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,240
I need your help
with something important.

38
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,960
Mom?

39
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,050
You probably wouldn't have come
if I'd called you myself, would you?

40
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,839
Mom.

41
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,170
Why do you have to
live such a risky life?

42
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,480
What if something happened to you?
What would I do?

43
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,050
What exactly do you want?

44
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,319
Playtime is over.

45
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,959
It's time to come home now.

46
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,610
I don't call that place home.

47
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,360
So where is your home then?

48
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,240
That shoebox of an apartment?

49
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,199
Or that boy's house? Zen, is it?

50
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,879
Do you really want me
to answer that question?

51
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Ryu!

52
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,639
Ryu!

53
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
Ryu, how did it go?
You met your mom, didn't you?

54
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,399
Why did you trick me?

55
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm sorry. Well...

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,920
she said she wanted to see you.

57
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,920
She hadn't seen you in a long time.

58
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,800
She even went looking
for you at the club.

59
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,959
And?

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,800
So you set me up so I'd talk to her?

61
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,360
No, I just wanted to help.

62
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,519
You wanted to help?

63
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,399
Have you ever asked me
if I needed your help?

64
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,279
Ryu, calm down.

65
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,959
She meant well.

66
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,560
But I didn't ask for it.

67
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm sorry... Ryu!

68
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,439
Hang on tight or you might fall off.

69
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,600
Thanks for keeping me company.

70
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,199
Feeling any better now?

71
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,720
Why am I such a horrible person?

72
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
You're not.

73
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,639
You didn't know what was going on
between Ryu and his mom.

74
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,600
Besides, people are nosy anyway.

75
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,759
How am I going to look him
in the face from now on?

76
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,199
Well, if you can't
look him in the face,

77
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,680
then look at his hands or feet.

78
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,560
First.

79
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,279
I'm serious.

80
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,319
I don't think he's one
to hold grudges for that long.

81
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,040
Grandma, I'm home.

82
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,439
How are you? Have you eaten
anything? Are you hungry?

83
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,360
I'm good, Grandma.

84
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,319
Right. Do you mind staying
with Atom for a bit?

85
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,519
I have to get some more desserts
from the back to add to this.

86
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,639
It's not enough.

87
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,879
Do you need a hand?

88
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,160
It's okay.
Stay with Atom, all right?

89
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,040
Watch your step.

90
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,040
I'll be fine.

91
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,920
What's up, Atom?

92
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,720
I came to help Grandma
make desserts.

93
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,360
I hope you don't mind.

94
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,759
Why would I mind?

95
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,319
It's good you've been visiting,
so Grandma won't feel lonely.

96
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,800
Right, Zen.

97
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,959
You still owe me a movie.
Should we go?

98
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Uh...

99
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Well...

100
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,159
I have something to tell you.

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,210
About what?

102
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,399
The thing is...

103
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,330
me and...

104
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,240
Grandma!

105
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,039
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

106
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,759
Atom, call an ambulance now!

107
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,879
Grandma!

108
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,090
I came straightaway
as soon as you told me.

109
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,559
What did the doctor say, Zen?

110
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,960
What I'm worried about is

111
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,919
the thyrotoxicosis she has.

112
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,759
What kind of treatment
does she need?

113
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,879
She needs immediate thyroid surgery.

114
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,840
Surgery?

115
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,450
Exactly.
But there's no need to worry.

116
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,210
It's actually normal
for someone with this condition.

117
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,919
She's also been taking antithyroid
medication for two years,

118
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,639
but her condition hasn't improved.

119
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,120
My grandmother's been sick
for a while now?

120
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,759
Zen,

121
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,240
what's wrong with her?

122
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,039
Who's this?
What's this crybaby doing here?

123
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,799
Grandma,

124
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,240
I'm sorry.

125
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,879
I had no idea you were sick.

126
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,720
There's nothing wrong with me.

127
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,639
There are still a lot of your games
that I need to watch.

128
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,519
Easy-peasy.

129
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,360
There, there.

130
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,039
Don't cry, my little monkey.

131
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,559
I love you, Grandma.

132
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,159
- I love you.
- I love you too, Zen.

133
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,360
There, there. Don't cry.

134
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,120
It's 120,000 for the surgery?

135
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,919
Have you thought
about what you're going to do?

136
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,360
I have to find money for Grandma's
surgery no matter what.

137
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
Zen,

138
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,720
I have a bit on me.
You can take it for now.

139
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,799
Me too.

140
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,360
Hey, it's okay.

141
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,200
I'll...

142
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,559
I'll find a way.

143
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,080
Zen, Ryu...

144
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,559
Street basketball?

145
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,440
Three-on-three.

146
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,159
You'll get 150,000 if you win.

147
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,240
Who's with me?

148
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,559
I am.

149
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,559
I'm a street basketball veteran.
You can trust me with this.

150
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,840
Zen, what about you?

151
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Mm.

152
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,159
Let's win some money.

153
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,559
We have to pull this off.

154
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,720
Are you really going
to play street basketball?

155
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,039
Mm.

156
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,559
With Ryu and that moro...

157
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,159
and Atom?

158
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Mm.

159
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
Ryu, are you sure?

160
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,759
You and...

161
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,399
and Atom?

162
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,519
Of course.

163
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,600
I won't whack him in the face.

164
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,200
If you don't start,
then I won't retaliate.

165
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,639
Like I said,

166
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,600
Atom's going to be training with us.

167
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:25,200
But he'll train after we're done

168
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,799
so you guys won't be confused.

169
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,799
- Hm.
- Mm.

170
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,039
I look forward
to training with you guys.

171
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,240
Where's Lin? Isn't she here yet?

172
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,360
Jedi, do you know anything?

173
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,240
No idea.

174
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,919
She didn't text me or anything.

175
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,240
She had to deal
with something about her family.

176
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,240
Oh.

177
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
Come on. Let's do it.

178
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,039
Hey.

179
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,759
- Let's play.
- Hey, wait for me.

180
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,039
All right. Let's go.

181
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,759
- Hey.
- Hey!

182
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Hey.

183
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,000
Game on.

184
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,480
- Ryu.
- Come on, Ryu.

185
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Hey.

186
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Zen!

187
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,919
Are you okay?

188
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
I'm fine.

189
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
I'll give you a hand.

190
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,559
I'll do it.

191
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,080
Let's keep practicing.

192
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
So?

193
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,159
- Help him.
- Keep going.

194
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,519
Come on.

195
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,679
Are you done with your thing?

196
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
Mm. All done.

197
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,159
But I thought practice
would be over by now.

198
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,720
It is over. Those guys are training
for street basketball.

199
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
Street basketball?

200
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,240
Why?

201
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,240
Isn't this wasting the team's
time and effort?

202
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,039
That won't do.

203
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,200
I should tell Dad.

204
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,639
Hold it.

205
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:32,080
They're playing to pay
for Zen's grandma's surgery.

206
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,840
She's sick.

207
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,360
Zen's grandma is sick.

208
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,919
That's right. She needs a surgery.

209
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,679
So they decided they'd play.

210
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,960
But judging by their form,
I don't think they'll make it.

211
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,170
What are you guys playing at?

212
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
Coach,

213
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,079
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about using the court.

214
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
- We're about to...
- The prize money.

215
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,170
You have to win it.

216
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,559
Whether it's the second
or third place, bring it home.

217
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
And I'll pay the rest.

218
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,440
But Coach...

219
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,680
What's there to be confused about?
Keep training.

220
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,170
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

221
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,650
- Come on.
- Let's do it.

222
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
Who's your daughter?
You're such a cool dad.

223
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Naturally.

224
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,650
Hey, hey!

225
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,279
Ryu, why are you
showing off your dribbling?

226
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,839
You got past his defense,
so take the shot!

227
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,759
Again.

228
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,559
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

229
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Come on.

230
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,359
See?

231
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,079
Trust.

232
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,039
That's your issue.

233
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Therefore,

234
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,170
let's try it this way.

235
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,680
You have to pass the ball
as usual but blindfolded.

236
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,200
You have to pull this off.

237
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,200
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

238
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,240
Here. We'll start with you, Atom.

239
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Zen.

240
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,079
Failed.

241
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Try again.

242
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,359
Ryu.

243
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,890
Failed.

244
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,799
Try again, Ryu.

245
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,319
Atom.

246
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,359
Listen.

247
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,920
You have to listen to each other.

248
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,599
Make good use of your senses!

249
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,200
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

250
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,039
Here. One more time.

251
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,079
Better.

252
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,200
Ryu.

253
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,119
Atom.

254
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,200
Three-on-three street basketball!

255
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,039
The first team is RAZ!

256
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,519
And the second team is LEB!

257
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,170
Give it up!

258
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,410
Let's go! Let's go!

259
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,440
Come on, Zen!

260
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,039
There's not much distance at all!

261
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,480
They're breathing
down each other's necks!

262
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,279
Ryu has the ball,

263
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,519
and he's running though!

264
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:07,410
Let's have a look at LEB!
They're really in the zone!

265
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,759
They're plowing through!
Zen intercepts! He scores!

266
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,440
Wow!

267
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:19,200
RAZ is really causing a lot
of problems for LEB's defense!

268
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,559
Let's keep watching!

269
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,039
Go! Go!

270
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:25,278
Whoa! And they scored again!

271
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,519
That's it.

272
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:31,169
LEB say they're also tough
and here to play.

273
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,920
They're going head-to-head!

274
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:38,410
All right. Here it comes.
What a beautiful shot!

275
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,650
And the team that moves
on to the next round is RAZ!

276
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,599
It's time for the semi-finals.

277
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,039
And RAZ's opponent for tonight is

278
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:58,279
BO or Blue Orca!

279
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,440
Hey.

280
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:09,039
Wow, this game is as brutal
as the last one.

281
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,440
- Ryu!
- These teams are on fire.

282
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,359
- Shoot!
- Look at Ryu go.

283
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,519
And that's three points for them.
They're now in the lead.

284
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,920
And he shoots.

285
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,920
That was clumsy.
He needs to find his rhythm.

286
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,319
Let's see what RAZ has.

287
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,200
Whoa. Can RAZ do it?

288
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,039
I have to say Blue Orca's defense
is super tight!

289
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,240
And... he scores!

290
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:48,240
Absolutely unbelievable. The newbie
team has won both their games.

291
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,599
But in fact, we can't really
call them newbies.

292
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:56,160
Ryu, Zen, and Atom are already
top high school basketball players.

293
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,640
They're very well-known
among the fans.

294
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,480
NewGen's defense is super strong!

295
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,839
- RAZ can't get through.
- Just a little bit!

296
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,240
- Ryu!
- You can't win if you don't fight.

297
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,079
And he scores!

298
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,519
I can tell this is a tough one for
RAZ.

299
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,480
And the ball goes to Ryu.

300
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,680
That's his specialty!

301
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,240
How are they going to counter
that now?

302
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,559
- Ryu!
- RAZ is on fire.

303
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,039
NewGen is known for being swift.

304
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,480
If it's a swift playstyle,
it's them.

305
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,880
It seems NewGen
has got them figured out.

306
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,480
But they're still behind...

307
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,160
Coach, one more game
and they win the tournament.

308
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,920
- Jedi.
- Yes, Coach?

309
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,839
The next one is the final, isn't it?

310
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Yes, it is.

311
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,759
Based on my observations,

312
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,599
our team is more exhausted
than usual.

313
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
Lin,

314
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,119
what's the difference between
first and second place?

315
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,039
First place gets 150,000,
and second place gets 80,000.

316
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,279
How much do they need
for the surgery?

317
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,680
It's 120,000, Coach.

318
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,839
They can't give up now!
The ball goes to Zen!

319
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,200
And Zen...

320
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,839
Gee, that was so close!

321
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,559
Zen shoots again,
and he scores! All right!

322
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:24,599
This is intense. And NewGen...

323
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:31,400
Whoa! And they did it
for the second time!

324
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,559
And this one's from NewGen!

325
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,799
That's their trick! And they score!

326
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,960
Ryu has the ball. He's feinting.

327
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:45,000
And then... wow!

328
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:46,559
He got through!

329
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,200
All on his own!

330
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,160
NewGen shoots.

331
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,960
Whoa.

332
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,839
Match point!
Who's going to score this one?

333
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,799
And they did it!

334
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,880
And RAZ goes to the final! Wow!

335
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,480
Stay tuned to see who they're facing

336
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,519
and which team's going
to get the trophy

337
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,440
and the prize money
totaling 150,000 baht.

338
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,720
- Let's go!
- Let's keep watching.

339
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,279
Our first team are
the newbie underdogs.

340
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,480
But I'm not sure if their exhaustion
from a whole day of playing

341
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,480
will affect them or not.

342
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,960
So stay tuned and
keep rooting for RAZ!

343
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,200
Go! Go! Go!

344
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,400
As for the opposing team...

345
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,400
Look at that. There are no words
to describe them.

346
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,119
They're three-time champions.
Give it up for...

347
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,920
King James!

348
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,640
Wow!

349
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,240
It's definitely going
to be a rough night!

350
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,039
That's James!
He's on the youth national team.

351
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,240
Shoot.

352
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,599
The guys are in for some trouble.

353
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,720
I thought he looked familiar.
Are they going to be okay?

354
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,359
I guarantee this game
will not disappoint, guys!

355
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,039
Come on! Keep it up!

356
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,519
Hang in there, Ryu!

357
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,480
Hey, Atom!

358
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,039
Do it, Atom!

359
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,440
Come on, Ryu.

360
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,160
Shoot! Take the shot!

361
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,440
Calm down! Keep it together!

362
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,519
Shoot!

363
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,440
Take it easy.

364
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,400
- Ryu.
- Ryu!

365
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,680
Whoa.

366
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,640
This is super brutal.

367
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,799
It's neck-and-neck.

368
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,400
He shoots. He scores!

369
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,200
RAZ!

370
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,119
RAZ! RAZ!

371
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,759
RAZ!

372
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,160
Whoa!

373
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,000
They let that one through.

374
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:33,720
RAZ appears to need a timeout.

375
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:38,319
See? They didn't get their nickname
because they were lucky.

376
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,079
King James is still
living up to their name.

377
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,039
Let's find out how RAZ
is going rebound from this.

378
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,160
I know you're all tired.

379
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,720
But you're nearly there now.

380
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:53,960
You're playing like
you usually play.

381
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,960
But this is street basketball.

382
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,559
Since they're playing street style,

383
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,640
then you have to as well.

384
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,599
If they push, you have to push back.

385
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,400
What is there to be scared of?

386
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,119
Get your head in the game.

387
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,319
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

388
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,640
Come on. Bring it in.

389
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,319
Bring it in.

390
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Together.

391
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,759
RAZ! Hey!

392
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,400
Go! Go! Go!

393
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,440
Let's do it!

394
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,599
Stop them!

395
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Over here!

396
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,079
Take the shot!

397
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,880
A three-pointer!

398
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
Well done!

399
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,640
Wow! This is so gut-wrenching!

400
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,519
There's only one minute left!

401
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,680
We'll find out soon enough if
the reigning champions

402
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,920
will be able to secure
their fourth championship or not.

403
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,640
You three, listen!

404
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,839
Trust. That's your issue.

405
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,079
We will focus on listening
and sensing each other's movement.

406
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,640
Make good use of your senses!

407
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,200
Grandma,

408
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,160
please wait for me.

409
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:29,000
RAZ!

410
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,359
Grandma?

411
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Grandma!

412
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,119
The doctor said you're not supposed
to use your voice after surgery.

413
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,960
Don't speak just yet.

414
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,880
Not just yet.

415
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,759
Okay?

416
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,440
Oh? The phone?

417
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,920
Here you go.

418
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,559
Take it slow.

419
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,039
(Are you tired? I'm sorry
for being a burden.)

420
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,759
Not at all, Grandma.

421
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,759
I'm not tired.

422
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,359
I told you.

423
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,200
I'd take care of you.

424
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,480
But don't worry, Grandma.

425
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,799
Even though Mom and Dad
aren't here anymore,

426
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,480
I'll look after you.

427
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,559
Stay with me for a long time, okay?

428
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,359
It's nice the three of us
got to play together.

429
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,519
I agree.

430
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,359
You're an awesome partner.

431
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,680
Same goes for you.

432
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,640
The game reminded me
about something.

433
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,279
What is it?

434
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,400
The joy of shooting hoops.

435
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:36,240
It wasn't for the sake
of the competition.

436
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,039
We play because we love it.

437
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:42,319
Basketball taught us to love others

438
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,839
and helped us love ourselves again.

439
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,880
The basketball team has been

440
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,329
bringing our school
a lot of positive attention.

441
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,960
So I'd like to propose
to the board to reconsider

442
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,880
and allow the team to
continue next year.

443
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,679
But we've already decided
to disband it next year.

444
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,239
But we can reconsider it, can't we?

445
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,769
I think we should move ahead.

446
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,679
Demolishing the gym to build
a science and technology building

447
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,289
is quite complicated.
There are a lot of details involved.

448
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,329
But I don't see how the demolishing
and rebuilding of the building have

449
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:46,599
anything to do with the disbanding
of the basketball team.

450
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,719
And the club doesn't require
a large budget to operate.

451
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:55,920
That's right. It's not too much.

452
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,400
But you're probably well aware

453
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,599
that our total budget
isn't much either.

454
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,159
That's right.

455
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,768
I think we should focus on
academic achievements

456
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:09,360
according to the policy
from upper management.

457
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,769
More importantly, Kanin's
students have also won

458
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:15,679
a lot of national academic awards.

459
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,559
If we provide them with proper
support,

460
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,519
our students could
even win internationally.

461
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,000
(Meeting Room 1)

462
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:30,769
Don't worry, Kanin.

463
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,559
We're on your side, no matter what.

464
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,000
Thank you very much.

465
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,159
We're a school. We have to focus on
academic achievement.

466
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,809
We're doing the right thing.

467
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,400
What is this?

468
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,769
We're making a name for our school,

469
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,840
yet they still insist
on disbanding our club?

470
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,480
So we'll have to find
a new club next year?

471
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,119
I won't get to play
basketball ever again?

472
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:58,039
No, I love basketball.

473
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,289
It'll be fine, Chogun.

474
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,480
Should we protest?

475
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,920
I'll lead.

476
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,360
Good idea. I'm in.

477
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,639
I'm in!

478
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:18,289
- I'm in!
- Count me in!

479
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Let's do it!

480
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,960
A protest is a way to express our
objection.

481
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:25,079
Count me in too.

482
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,329
- Me too.
- I want to do it too.

483
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,239
- I'm in too!
- I'm in!

484
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:29,480
Hold on!

485
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,809
Calm down, guys!

486
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,639
The game isn't over yet!

487
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,360
We can always hope for a miracle!

488
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:38,360
What miracle?

489
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,159
Our next game has to be our best
game.

490
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,769
We got to nationals.
Anything can happen.

491
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:46,809
He's right.

492
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:50,199
If we can pull it off, then we have
leverage against the school.

493
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,519
That's true.

494
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,039
But are we going
to be able to pull it off?

495
00:36:57,329 --> 00:36:59,289
It's already a miracle
we got through.

496
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,439
Right? The teams in the next round
are brutal.

497
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,559
Of course we can.

498
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,769
We have to make it through.

499
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,400
Let's do it to it, guys!

500
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,880
- Let's do it to it!
- Let's do it to it!

501
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,289
Yes!

502
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,769
Let's do it!

503
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:20,400
Bring it in.

504
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,519
- Let's do it to it!
- Let's do it to it!

505
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:25,880
All right!

506
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:33,480
Wow. Why is your school
being so harsh?

507
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,079
They're that bent
on disbanding the club?

508
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,679
I know, right?

509
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,329
I'm so bummed.

510
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,920
You won't get to play

511
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,400
in your senior year
without the club.

512
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,920
Then what about
your university scholarship?

513
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,239
What would you do about it?

514
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,400
Isn't that your dream?

515
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,119
Right?

516
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:57,440
But I'll give it a go in case
the board changes their mind.

517
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,920
I have to go now.
I'm visiting Grandma.

518
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:04,599
Sure. Visit her for me too.
I'm worried about her.

519
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,440
Have you read the details
about the scholarship in Phuket?

520
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,559
Yes, Dad.

521
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,840
Can I discuss it with the agent?

522
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:31,840
Why?

523
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,159
It's nothing.

524
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,199
Free tuition,

525
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,599
training incentives,

526
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,809
and your monthly expenses covered
while you're on our team.

527
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,840
I have one condition.

528
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,159
I was expecting that.

529
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,440
I didn't think an athlete of your
level would be satisfied.

530
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,440
Is there anything else you want?

531
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:12,809
If you want me to join your team,

532
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,000
can you award the scholarship
to one of my friends as well?

533
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,519
It also depends on his skill.

534
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,440
There's no need to worry about that.

535
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,809
You'll get to witness it for
yourself.

536
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,039
This is the game that will decide
which team goes to the provincials.

537
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,769
There is a quota of four teams.

538
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,920
Three of the places
have been filled.

539
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:50,119
That means whichever team wins this
will be the fourth team to make it.

540
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,880
Isn't that Ton who got banned?

541
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:12,119
I didn't expect to see him back on
the court.

542
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,159
Palamit.

543
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:18,440
They're good at shooting
under the hoop.

544
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,519
Just follow the game plan, okay?

545
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,039
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

546
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,769
Today's game is
between Palamit School,

547
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,039
known for their excellence
at shooting under the hoop,

548
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:48,329
and the other school, Tanwarin
Wittaya, is the underdog.

549
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,159
Stay tuned, and that includes
everyone watching remotely.

550
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,840
Let's see how things turn out.

551
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,079
Are you okay?

552
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,599
I'm a bit scared.

553
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,559
I don't know if we can beat them.

554
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,199
Don't be scared. We can do this.

555
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:09,880
Come on. Let's get warmed up.

556
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Ryu!

557
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,239
Zen!

558
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:40,440
Shoot!

559
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:43,079
- Zen!
- Zen, over here!

560
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,639
Zen!

561
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:47,809
Zen!

562
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:51,599
- Zen!
- Hey!

563
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,289
Why didn't he pass the ball?

564
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,199
He kept staring.

565
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,440
Calm down, Zen! Hang in there!

566
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,639
Wow! Palamit did it again!

567
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:15,840
They're looking great today.

568
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,199
Go.

569
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,329
So, what's next?

570
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,400
- Whoa.
- Hey!

571
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:42,039
It's okay!

572
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,400
As you can see,
for Tanwarin Wittaya,

573
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,289
their players are mostly new.

574
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,679
Why the change? Do you know?

575
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:54,079
The old team was caught
using narcotics.

576
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:56,480
- Oh.
- So they were expelled.

577
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,039
And a new team was formed.

578
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,329
That's why there are many new
players on the team.

579
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,920
- Jedi. Status report.
- Yes, Coach?

580
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,960
Our team committed a lot of fouls.

581
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:08,960
Traveling and reaching in.

582
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,039
They're losing their shot.

583
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:13,920
What's wrong with Zen today?

584
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,039
Hey, what's up with Zen today?
He keeps messing up.

585
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:27,719
Right? Are they going to be okay?

586
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:37,559
Zen!

587
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:39,599
Hang in there!

588
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,960
Aw!

589
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,558
He must be Zen's boyfriend!

590
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:44,559
Definitely.

591
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:47,719
Time's up.

592
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,679
Zen,

593
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,800
what's up with you?

594
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:05,559
Why are you playing like that?

595
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm sorry, Coach.

596
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,800
I know how important
this game is to you,

597
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,320
to our team, and to our club.

598
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,519
But let me tell you.

599
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,719
If that's how you're going to play,

600
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,079
then this might be your last game.

601
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:26,960
Do you understand what I said?

602
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,559
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

603
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,159
- Coach.
- Hm?

604
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,639
Can I talk to Zen for a bit?

605
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
Zen.

606
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:46,039
Ow. Hey!

607
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,960
Ryu!

608
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,199
Just tell me off already!

609
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,199
Didn't you tell me

610
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,719
your dad would hold you like this

611
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,760
when you were upset?

612
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,159
Ryu...

613
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,480
Hold me tight.

614
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,280
I'm scared we're going to lose.

615
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,400
Shh!

616
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,039
Don't be.

617
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,719
We'll do our best.

618
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,159
Ryu, you're not going to bail on me

619
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,599
like you did in middle school if we
make it to finals again, are you?

620
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,079
I promise.

621
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,760
Both Coach Ton and the club
are going to go.

622
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,920
The school board has issued an order

623
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:36,519
for Coach Ton to be relieved of his
duties immediately.

624
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:37,880
Aren't you going
to help at all, sir?

625
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:39,840
The decision isn't even final.

626
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,920
Can you help Coach, Mom?

627
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,239
If I help, what are you going to
give me in exchange?

628
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,360
Now that you're all here, I'd like
to begin Coach Ton's investigation.
