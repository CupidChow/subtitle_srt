1
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,329
Hello? What's up?

2
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,859
I'm out front.
Can I stay with you tonight?

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,009
What? Are you really
going to sleep here?

4
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,140
Yes.

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,380
Are you okay?

6
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,450
You can tell me if you're not.

7
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,649
Can you scratch my back?

8
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,109
I used to ask my dad
to scratch my back

9
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,379
when I couldn't sleep.

10
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,049
I miss him.

11
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,890
Hey?

12
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:25,760
Are you okay?

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,930
I asked for a scratch, not a hug.

14
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,400
Well, whenever I couldn't sleep,

15
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,140
my dad would hold me.

16
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,480
Like this.

17
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,280
- Zen.
- What?

18
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,800
(The Rebound)

19
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:54,670
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

20
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,009
It's been 24 hours.
Should I cut it, Dad?

21
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,949
So? Maybe one more day?

22
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,620
We've had enough, Coach.

23
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
There.

24
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,860
Well then. Let's start practicing!

25
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,300
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

26
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:35,939
Come on!

27
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,480
Go! Go! Go!

28
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,579
Come on!

29
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,149
Faster!

30
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,120
Let's go!

31
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,029
That was 9.4 minutes.
You all passed.

32
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,170
- Yes!
- Yes!

33
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,569
We did it!

34
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,769
Hey!

35
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,740
Jedi, how are the stats
looking today?

36
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,439
Much better, Lin.
If you look at the graph,

37
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,449
let the X-axis be the date
and the Y be the running duration.

38
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,649
When we started recording stats,
everyone's base was high.

39
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,220
But as time went by,
the value of Y kept decreasing.

40
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,889
More importantly, do you see this?

41
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,560
When we started recording stats,

42
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,129
the lines for each person were
notably different.

43
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,800
But as time went by,
the lines decreased gradually.

44
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,529
The difference is barely noticeable.

45
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:39,600
And the team's average running time
is significantly better.

46
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,839
Awesome.

47
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,269
Lin,

48
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,139
who's this statistician?

49
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,110
Dad, are you getting Alzheimer's?

50
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,250
This is Jedi, our newest member.

51
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,050
You gave him permission
to join the retreat.

52
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,750
Oh, Ryu's friend?

53
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,889
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,360
- He's my right-hand man.
- Sure.

55
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,529
But now, he's on my left.

56
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,759
Ugh, who do you take after? Okay.

57
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh!

58
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,220
Keep going!

59
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,360
Good work!

60
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:34,660
Ryu!

61
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,529
All right. Stay focused.

62
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,500
Anyone who's watching from home

63
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,639
can join in on the fun
with the 300 people here.

64
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,069
Siamwit shoots!

65
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,910
Tanwarin Wittaya is on the offense!

66
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,990
Tanwarin Wittaya is catching up!

67
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,089
Well done!

68
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,069
- Oh!
- Whoa!

69
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,410
Be a Buffalo!

70
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,090
We did it!

71
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,289
We won!

72
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,129
Congratulations, Captain.

73
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,500
We won!

74
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,480
You've got some skills.

75
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,639
Is that really a surprise?

76
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,019
Hey!

77
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,620
- Over here!
- Coach, we did it!

78
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:12,159
Hey, put me down!

79
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,059
Stop!

80
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,330
I know you're happy,
but do we really need a group hug?

81
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,899
Maybe a little.

82
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,370
- Should we?
- Are you shy, Coach?

83
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,570
You can't stop smiling.

84
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,639
Let's pack up and go home.

85
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:31,009
Let's go!

86
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,080
Tanwarin has defeated

87
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:37,649
our former champion, Siamwit!

88
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,820
They really did it!

89
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:43,820
Ton?

90
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,460
Ton, is that you?

91
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,389
Do you remember me?

92
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:49,759
I'm Poom.

93
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,929
We were on the youth team together.

94
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,870
Whoa.

95
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,740
I thought you quit
basketball for good.

96
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,470
But you ended up coaching.

97
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,210
Atom, come here.

98
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,120
I'd like to introduce you

99
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,860
to Coach Ton.

100
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:22,429
Hello, Coach.

101
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,429
This is Atom.
He's my top player this year.

102
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,870
We recently bought his contract.

103
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,799
He's going to try out
for the national team too.

104
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,990
Wow! Right now it's...

105
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,659
- Oh?
- He passes the ball!

106
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,730
It means Tanwarin Wittaya has

107
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,730
defeated Siamwit today!

108
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,600
- That's right!
- Wow!

109
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,440
Ryu.

110
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,809
Whoo!

111
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,879
Psych!

112
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,590
It didn't go through the hoop?

113
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,610
Ryu,

114
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:48,980
you're quite good at basketball.

115
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,720
Don't you want to use it
to earn some money?

116
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,049
What do you mean?

117
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,190
Like street basketball gambling.

118
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,889
Street basketball gambling?

119
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,460
Does that even exist?

120
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,490
Are you interested?

121
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,259
Sure.

122
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,629
Whatever you say.

123
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,769
Let's do it.

124
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,639
Why were you so good
this time around?

125
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,710
I don't think so.

126
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,450
I only wanted you
to be as satisfied as possible.

127
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,590
Not because you wanted
to protect Ryu?

128
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,330
Boss.

129
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,029
Do you think I don't know?

130
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,669
You only slept with me
to protect him.

131
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,210
That's not true.

132
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,210
Really?

133
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,340
Is he still under your control?

134
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,419
I've already reached out.

135
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,690
He asked me to give him
some time to decide.

136
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,059
Some time to decide?

137
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,309
Is this what you call "in control"?
He's not answering your call.

138
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,750
Q,

139
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:09,419
My client actually requested Ryu.

140
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,360
So can you please get him
to come and see me?

141
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:14,159
Do you understand what I'm saying?

142
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,029
Boss...

143
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,299
Think about it.

144
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,840
Do you want to do it
your way or my way?

145
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,480
It's your choice.

146
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,720
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

147
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,850
Cheers.

148
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,889
Hello, Chogun?

149
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,759
You got home?

150
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,500
Okay.

151
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,629
Okay, First.

152
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,830
I'll celebrate on your behalf.

153
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,169
- See you later.
- How cute.

154
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,269
Guys,

155
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,139
the results
from Interhigh's game are in!

156
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:00,870
So? Is it something unexpected?

157
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:02,909
No,

158
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,580
they even won 85-42.

159
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,909
- Ooh.
- Huh?

160
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,110
That's...

161
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,250
"Outclassed".

162
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,750
What is that?

163
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,250
It's when the winner gets more than
double points of the loser.

164
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:16,820
A crushing victory.

165
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,190
It doesn't happen very often
in high school games.

166
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:21,429
Oh no.

167
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,090
What?

168
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,960
If Interhigh won,

169
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,669
then it means we'll have
to face them next.

170
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,730
- Can we even beat them?
- Hey!

171
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,600
What are you saying, Jed?

172
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,710
Everyone's stressed now.

173
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,379
Of course we can beat them.

174
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,309
Right, Coach?

175
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:48,549
Of course.

176
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,889
You only have to train
three times harder.

177
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,830
We're up for it. Come on!

178
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,230
- Cheers!
- Bring it on!

179
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,769
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

180
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,100
- Whoo!
- We'll do our best.

181
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:07,370
- Here.
- All right.

182
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,870
- Thank you, Coach.
- Thank you, Coach.

183
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,080
All right. Let's go.

184
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:13,009
Get some rest.
You did very well today.

185
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,149
- Bye, Coach.
- Bye.

186
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:22,450
- Come on.
- Ryu.

187
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,519
Yes?

188
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,129
What's the matter?

189
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,330
You played really well today.

190
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,240
You're actually quite skilled.

191
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,370
And I want to see you
get to the finals.

192
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:53,950
Well, I told Dad

193
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:56,750
about your violent tendencies
in middle school.

194
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,559
But from watching you today,

195
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:02,830
I think you're okay now.

196
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,130
I have to go. Bye.

197
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,700
- Let's go home!
- Okay!

198
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,309
Why did Coach tell you
to hang back just now?

199
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,480
It was nothing.

200
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,160
Why aren't you answering that?

201
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:37,289
Nah.

202
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,720
What are you thinking of doing?

203
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,289
You said you deleted everything.

204
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,619
I was going to at first.

205
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,390
But then I watched it.

206
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,160
You crippled those guys.

207
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,829
That's quite cool.

208
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,200
So I wanted to save the clip
to watch for fun later.

209
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,029
But now that I think about it,

210
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,170
if it gets leaked,

211
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,140
you probably won't get
to play with your friends.

212
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,210
What do you want?

213
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,980
If this clip gets leaked,

214
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,710
they'll probably ban you.

215
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,950
And you won't get to play
with your beloved school team.

216
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,319
I asked you what you want.

217
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,190
Come and meet me now.

218
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,089
I'll send you the location.

219
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:48,369
Ryu?

220
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,069
Is everything okay?

221
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,390
Hey.

222
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,630
This isn't your place.

223
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,660
Didn't you learn
your lesson last time?

224
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,200
I'm here to see Ryu.

225
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,000
This isn't your place.

226
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,430
Go home.

227
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:27,140
If I go,

228
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,210
then he has to come with me.

229
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,880
You're asking for it.

230
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,509
Don't hurt him.

231
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,190
What do you want?
Tell me, and I'll do it.

232
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,390
I want you to come back
and play for Boss Tos.

233
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,700
Why can't he just leave me alone?

234
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:54,700
I said I don't want to play!

235
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:57,329
I don't want to live
that kind of life anymore.

236
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,069
How come that came out
of your mouth so easily?

237
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,079
You made him a promise
when you wanted to play.

238
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,309
And you're just going to quit now?

239
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,309
All right.

240
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,519
I'll play.

241
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,380
But this is the last time.

242
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,589
And I want my life back after that.

243
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,130
Okay.

244
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,029
I'm playing too.

245
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,970
Zen.

246
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,269
It's dangerous.

247
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,440
If it's going to help you
end things here,

248
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,210
I'll do it.

249
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:40,710
I'm playing too.

250
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,589
As for the rules for this game,

251
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,990
it's three-on-three.

252
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,890
Three games in total.

253
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,029
Whichever team wins two
out of three first gets the money.

254
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:04,869
Hang in there!

255
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,009
Keep going!

256
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,609
Chase the ball.

257
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,619
These three

258
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,990
are burly and swift.

259
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,759
But I don't think they're precise.

260
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,160
Tell me what you want to do.

261
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,069
Force them to take shots
from a distance.

262
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,500
We'll rebound as planned.

263
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,309
Let's do it.

264
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,000
Ryu!

265
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,569
Hey, are you okay?

266
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:48,210
- Is he okay?
- So?

267
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:49,309
Can you get up?

268
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,640
What are you waiting for?

269
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,740
I'll sub for him.

270
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,819
Go and sit down.

271
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,339
Over here. Just shoot.

272
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,180
What's that?

273
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,380
That was good.

274
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,180
He's skilled.

275
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:35,619
Darn it.

276
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,819
This way!

277
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,059
Upstairs, this way.

278
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,190
After me!

279
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,500
Boss, the cops are here.

280
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:54,599
What? I thought we sorted that out.

281
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,140
They're from headquarters.

282
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,109
Darn it!

283
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,849
- Hey, you.
- Hey, the cops are coming!

284
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:04,880
Zen!

285
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:11,589
Go!

286
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,359
Freeze! I said freeze!

287
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,200
Freeze!

288
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,259
- Zen!
- Hey!

289
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,430
Hey!

290
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:24,269
I said freeze!

291
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,170
Freeze!

292
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:28,940
Hey!

293
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,920
Hey, where are they?

294
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,059
They're gone.

295
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,609
Are you okay?

296
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,400
Is it really over?

297
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,640
I don't know.

298
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,710
But I want it to be over as well.

299
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:41,509
When am I going to be able
to pay off my life debt?

300
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,519
My grandma used to tell me

301
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,759
we're indebted to a lot of people...

302
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,890
along our way to be here.

303
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
She's right.

304
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,140
She also said something else.

305
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:11,140
For certain debtors,

306
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,779
we will never forget them.

307
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,109
But for some,

308
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,079
we have to try to forget.

309
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,390
You're lucky you have her.

310
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,690
Ride safely. Let me know
when you get home.

311
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,730
Grandma, I'm home.

312
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,700
Grandma? I'll help you.

313
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:43,769
It's okay. I can handle it.

314
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:46,569
You must be tired.
You should go and rest.

315
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,410
It's okay, Grandma.

316
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,809
Have a seat. I'll help.

317
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,710
What happened to your face?

318
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:56,779
Oh.

319
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,349
There was a small accident
during practice.

320
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,190
Don't overexert yourself.

321
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,190
I have to, Grandma.

322
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,619
I need to lead the team to victory.

323
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,990
If we win the championship,

324
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,890
I'll keep my sports scholarship.

325
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,759
So I'll be able to finish school
and look after you.

326
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,529
Oh dear.

327
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,809
Hang in there, Grandma.

328
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:28,950
I'll take care of you.

329
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:31,839
(Ryu: Have you gone to bed?)

330
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:35,849
(Zen: About to.)

331
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:43,819
(Ryu, how did you feel when we...)

332
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,269
(Don't risk yourself again.)

333
00:29:55,329 --> 00:30:00,069
(I'm worried about you.)

334
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,579
(Don't play
street basketball again.)

335
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:14,980
(I'm worried about you.)

336
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,529
Hey.

337
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:34,039
Interhigh won
the championship before.

338
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:35,609
What do we have?

339
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,640
Just play like how we've been
practicing. What is there to fear?

340
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,109
Right. You've got a point.

341
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,849
We're good, especially me.

342
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,819
Sure.

343
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:51,819
We might even win the championship
after so many years.

344
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,589
We're such a dream team.

345
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,559
- What are you doing?
- What are you blathering about?

346
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
What?

347
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,569
Haven't you heard?
Dream big and make it happen.

348
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,940
- Hey!
- Whoa!

349
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:10,210
What is this?

350
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,180
- Moron.
- Look away!

351
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,309
What are you staring at?

352
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,109
Is that your "big" dream?

353
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,109
I can't unsee it.

354
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,579
Go away.

355
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,150
Darn it. That was a mistake.

356
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:23,420
You too.

357
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,259
Go on. Look away.

358
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,859
Interhigh's

359
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,990
greatest strength

360
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,960
is their swift offense.

361
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:36,200
Their main players score most
of their points. Atom, number 13,

362
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,140
and number 4, Pipo, their center.

363
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,210
The only way for us to deal with it

364
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,910
is to have a strong defense.

365
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,539
Then we have to wait counter.

366
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,880
You're all aware

367
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,420
that this game is going
to determine whether our club

368
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,019
gets to keep going or not.

369
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,519
So, tomorrow...

370
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,660
it is up to every one of you.

371
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:01,789
If you do well,

372
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,630
our club gets to continue.

373
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,930
But if you fail,

374
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,029
then it's game over.

375
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,339
Grandma, I'm home.

376
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,269
Zen, you're early.

377
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,710
Dinner's ready.

378
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,420
All right. Eat up. Go on.

379
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,220
Well then. I won't hold back.

380
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,460
Of course.

381
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,359
Zen, why aren't you eating?
Aren't you hungry?

382
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,299
He probably feels awkward

383
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,700
about us competing
against each other tomorrow.

384
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:47,640
Oh, don't worry about that.

385
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,069
I spiked Atom's water
with a laxative.

386
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:52,740
I assure you,

387
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,480
he won't be able
to compete tomorrow for sure.

388
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,250
Grandma, you can't do that!

389
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:02,019
Actually, I didn't
put it in his water.

390
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,390
I put it in his food.

391
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,859
Joking!

392
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:15,369
Eat up! There are no
laxatives whatsoever.

393
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,700
All right.

394
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:19,799
Dig in.

395
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:29,109
I'm not mad you're playing
for the opposing team.

396
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:35,180
That's a huge relief.
I thought you'd hate me by now.

397
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,359
But I think...

398
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,460
I should distance myself from you.

399
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,730
That's understandable.

400
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,670
If my team loses,

401
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,569
will your feelings
about me stay the same?

402
00:33:58,609 --> 00:33:59,779
I'm not sure.

403
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:04,380
But if you let us win,

404
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:07,150
I can assure you,
I won't talk to you anymore.

405
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,019
For sure. I'd never do that.

406
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,889
Let's do our best tomorrow.

407
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
All right!

408
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,079
You're not as good as they say,

409
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,219
sucker.

410
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:48,559
It's okay. Try again.

411
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,260
It's okay! You can try again!

412
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,920
Hey, stay on your defense!

413
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,889
Whoa! The game's only starting

414
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,360
and Interhigh's scored
their first two points

415
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:25,159
ahead of Tanwarin Wittaya!

416
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,329
They're definitely
living up to their reputation!

417
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,949
Tanwarin Wittaya was thought
to be the underdog.

418
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,679
But they might end up
as a piece of cake.

419
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,460
Go! Counter them!

420
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,679
You've got the ball. Let's go.

421
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:20,650
- Oh?
- What?

422
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,260
Ah!

423
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,239
Why didn't you pass the ball?

424
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:50,409
Hey, huddle up!

425
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:55,050
Ryu, what's up with you?

426
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,389
Why aren't you following
the game plan?

427
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,389
I'll handle this, Coach.

428
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,559
Chogun, Puth,

429
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,760
substitute for Ryu and Zen.

430
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,059
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

431
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:10,429
- Jedi.
- Yes, Coach?

432
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,840
Can you calculate
our chances of winning?

433
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,070
Of course.

434
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,909
Here it is.

435
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,219
What's wrong with you, Ryu?

436
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,289
I'm fine.

437
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:34,719
Then can you get
your head in the game?

438
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,690
You're playing
like you don't trust the others.

439
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,489
We're a team.

440
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:40,159
Do you want to win?

441
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,369
If you want to,
then let me play my way.

442
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,199
Ryu, you have
to follow the game plan.

443
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,070
Look at the state of our team.

444
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,469
We're going to lose
if we keep playing like this.

445
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,380
Ryu!

446
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:02,519
Okay.

447
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,920
Listen to me carefully.

448
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,960
There's nothing
challenging about them.

449
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,929
They're just tall and speedy.

450
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:11,559
Just play good defense.

451
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,760
Swarm number four, that Pipo.

452
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,300
He's their best scorer.

453
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,230
Intercept the ball and counter.

454
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,239
Kao, help Jed block number four.

455
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:22,199
Chogun, you can play
Prince's position.

456
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,070
Puth, hang on a second.

457
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:25,610
We'll send in Ryu and Zen.

458
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,679
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

459
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,909
Right now,

460
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,380
we're behind by a lot.

461
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:32,949
But we can still win.

462
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,480
And the only way for us to win
is to be outside

463
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,889
of the semi-circle
and score a lot of three-pointers.

464
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,519
Okay?

465
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:41,920
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

466
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Let's do it.

467
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,230
Ready?

468
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,400
- Tanwarin! Hey!
- Tanwarin! Hey!

469
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,369
- Go!
- Let's do it!

470
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,619
Look at them. They were
a piece of cake, initially.

471
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,760
But now they're ruthless.

472
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,329
We've got two minutes left.
How is this going to end?

473
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,900
Huh?

474
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,530
- Ooh!
- There's been an accident!

475
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,739
Oh no! Is that Pipo?

476
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,110
That's right. Number four, Pipo,
Interhigh's star player!

477
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,869
He probably sprained his ankle.

478
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,210
The thing is, there's
only two minutes left!

479
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,750
- Oh!
- If things are like this,

480
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,780
we'll just have to stay tuned
and keep watching.

481
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:57,969
Ryu, pass the ball!

482
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,750
Atom misses the shot.

483
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,280
And time has run out!

484
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:19,119
Tanwarin Wittaya wins!

485
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,690
That was awesome, Tanwarin Wittaya!

486
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:27,599
Both teams did equally well,
Tanwarin and Interhigh.

487
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:28,800
That's right.

488
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,800
There's no need
to be sad, Interhigh.

489
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,039
You can still try again next year.

490
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,480
Who's actually

491
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,309
the sucker now?

492
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,050
Hey!

493
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:53,989
Anyway, let's give it up
for the winner, Tanwarin Wittaya!

494
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,940
Yay!

495
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,409
Keep moving!

496
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,409
Hey, hey!

497
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,579
Easy now.

498
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,280
We won!

499
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,750
You're such a braggart, Jed.

500
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:23,190
What kind of defense was that?
They kept scoring.

501
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,289
Right?

502
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:27,059
They always towered over you
when you tried to block them.

503
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,860
Do you want a piece of me, Prince?

504
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,559
And do you think I'm scared of you,

505
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,559
- Jed?
- Are you challenging me?

506
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,469
Hey, stop! Let go!

507
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,340
- I said let go!
- Are you going to give in?

508
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,139
- What's up with you?
- Are you?

509
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,909
All right, I'll give in.

510
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:45,070
Then call me uncle.

511
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,340
- Come on.
- No, I won't.

512
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,280
That's enough.

513
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:52,210
- Are you going to keep playing?
- Come on!

514
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,980
How long are you going to
keep horsing around? Get on.

515
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,090
Jeab's been waiting for ages.

516
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:57,320
Coach?

517
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,550
What?

518
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,360
I have to go.
My apartment is close by.

519
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,889
Okay.

520
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,690
Aren't you going
to celebrate with us?

521
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,159
Right?

522
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:08,329
You helped our team win.

523
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:09,829
Are you really going to ditch us?

524
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:15,269
All right. I have to deal
with something first. I'll catch up.

525
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:16,940
Hurry up, okay?

526
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,869
Let's go.

527
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,440
All right.
And don't flake on us, Ryu.

528
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,949
I won't.

529
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:24,480
Come on.

530
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:47,070
Hey, do you think you're so tough?

531
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,309
You guys saw me on the court.

532
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,210
Shoot!

533
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:08,360
Do you think you're so tough?

534
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,090
Do you?

535
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,690
- Do you?
- Do you?

536
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:12,960
Do you really think so?

537
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,630
You punk!

538
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,300
Hello, Coach?

539
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,340
What happened?

540
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,610
Tell me.

541
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:26,539
That number four from Interhigh.

542
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:29,110
Your team's such a sore loser.

543
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:31,280
I'll deal with Pipo.

544
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:34,320
I want to prove to you that I don't
have anything to do with them, Zen.

545
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,219
You don't have to go that far.

546
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:37,420
I'm feeling guilty.

547
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,260
Then can I stay the night here?
