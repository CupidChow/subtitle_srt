1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
No?

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:06,679
Don't be so loud, Ton.

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,720
Aun, isn't there another way?

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,838
The kids defeated Interhigh.

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,199
You know it's not
easy to get this far.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,239
Of course. But I thought the board
would be on our side.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,160
They said they don't
have the budget.

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,280
They can't allocate any to sport.

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,960
They mentioned
the budget usage policy.

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,799
The budget usage policy?

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,119
And what about those other things?

12
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,000
Like when they dug up a secret
budget and burned it away?

13
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,039
Should we do it this way?

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,719
I'll donate my salary to the team.

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,159
Aun.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,159
Aun, you have to think carefully.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,960
You're also an employee like I am.

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,960
You have debt,

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,719
a wife, and kids.

20
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,079
Think carefully.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,240
But I started this.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,049
I have to take responsibility
no matter what.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Ugh.

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,409
Darn it!

25
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,599
This sucks.

26
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,239
Hey! We're at school!

27
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,640
The school that teaches kids
to dream

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,400
and then extinguishes those dreams?

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,120
They said there's no budget.

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,959
Planning to disband us
and limit our budget. Classic.

31
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,719
Ryu!

32
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,719
Well, it's true.

33
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,799
I'm really sorry.

34
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,959
It's okay, sir.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,159
You helped us survive for a year.
That's awesome already.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,799
He did everything in his power.

37
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,120
Don't belittle him.

38
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,639
I've been trying to contact
the club's alumni.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,919
Let's see who's going to respond.

40
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,530
Does that mean

41
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,840
there might be some good news?

42
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,199
I haven't had any response so far.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,240
That's okay, sir.

44
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,560
We'll help too.

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,319
(The Rebound)

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,639
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

47
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,400
Enough! Stop singing!

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,680
You'll get booed
with a voice like that.

49
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,439
We're trying to earn money
for our next game.

50
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,050
Come on, Lin. That's mean.

51
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,959
I've been warming up for ages.

52
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,680
- You're a lost cause.
- Your voice sucks, Jed.

53
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,079
Aw.

54
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,439
The worst.

55
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,959
There!

56
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,439
I don't think this is going to help.
What should we do now?

57
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,050
We're athletes, not musicians.
What else can we do?

58
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,519
What are you doing?
Are we changing the club?

59
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
You silly brat.

60
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,439
We're trying to find a way
to raise money for the club.

61
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,050
I was planning to try busking.

62
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,839
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

63
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,839
- What's that?
- Someone gave it to me.

64
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,730
It's a pamphlet for the school fair
next week.

65
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,399
I heard they just had it done.

66
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Can I see?

67
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,480
Maybe we should sell food or drinks?

68
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,639
Come on, First.

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,879
Your sunny-side-up eggs
still have shells in them.

70
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,000
What about you, Lin?
You're probably good at cooking.

71
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,240
Me?

72
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,050
Hey, instead of only relying on Lin,

73
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,240
do you want to help, First?

74
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,800
How much money do we need?

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,040
We're in the semifinals,
so there are two more games.

76
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,079
If we win, then we have to play
in the finals.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,920
But if we lose, we still need money
to compete for third place.

78
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,480
And if we lose again,
there's still another game.

79
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,959
How much money do we need, roughly?

80
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,199
Competition costs, water,

81
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,079
food, medicine,

82
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,439
contingency costs, plus we need
a reserve fund. At the very least,

83
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,120
we'll need...

84
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,959
sixty-thousand baht.

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,879
- Sixty-thousand?
- Sixty-thousand?

86
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,360
Holy moly! I don't even
have 60 baht.

87
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,439
Jeez, I only have six on me.

88
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:12,160
Should we try contacting
the alumni association?

89
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,160
Check their page and see
who we can get in touch with.

90
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,439
The president of the association...

91
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,560
Ms. Chutima Wiwatpanit.

92
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,600
That surname rings a bell.

93
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,439
Ryu the Hero's surname, of course!

94
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,720
- Ryu?
- Ryu?

95
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,480
Who's this Chutima lady?

96
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,639
I don't think we should
bother him right now.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How come?

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,839
This could save our club, Ryu.

99
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,560
Ryu?

100
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
Ryu, wait up!

101
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Ryu!

102
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Can you stop following me?

103
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,199
You know Chutima, don't you?

104
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,680
Can you talk to her for us?

105
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,959
I can't do that.

106
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,560
She's your mother, isn't she?

107
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,120
I saw it in her profile.

108
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,519
Please talk to her for us.

109
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,279
Your mom's the president
of the alumni association.

110
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,439
She definitely can help us.
Please, Ryu.

111
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,079
Please talk to her.

112
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,199
I'm begging you, Ryu.

113
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,000
- Please.
- No, Lin.

114
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,000
Why not?

115
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,519
His mom's the only one
who can save our club.

116
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,639
Please, Ryu.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,839
What's going on, Zen?

118
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,040
Why is he so mad?

119
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,879
It has to do with his family.

120
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,399
It's okay. I'll talk to him.

121
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
What are you listening to?

122
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,480
Don't be mad at Lin.

123
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,399
She doesn't know.

124
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,279
She's only doing it for the club.

125
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,159
Mm. I'm not mad. I understand.

126
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,159
Well done!

127
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,159
You really are my boyfriend.

128
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,330
Give me a hug.

129
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,120
Don't worry.

130
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,000
We'll find a way.

131
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
Do you think so?

132
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Mm.

133
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,090
This hug is nice and warm.

134
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,330
Warm? I'm burning up.

135
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,519
Play some nice music, won't you?

136
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,600
Turn around.
I'm going to lean on you.

137
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,200
Here.

138
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,439
Work hard. Let me know
when you're about to finish.

139
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,599
I'll come and pick you up.

140
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Sure.

141
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,480
Can you smell love in the air?

142
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,240
It's obvious.
I think my boy's in love.

143
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
For sure.

144
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,159
- I'm going now.
- Bye.

145
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Ride safely.

146
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,080
The new storefront
looks nice, Golf, Oat.

147
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,840
Hm? What's with him?

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,480
It's the same storefront as before.

149
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,440
Are you sure you did
the calculations right?

150
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,519
Yes, I am.

151
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,558
- There are no mistakes.
- Really?

152
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,559
Why did the customer complain
that they didn't get the order?

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,480
I don't think I miscalculated it.

154
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,600
- Really?
- Did that hurt?

155
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
Hey! You jerk!

156
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,320
Are you in love, Zen?
You look happy.

157
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,559
I'm not. This is the usual me.

158
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,120
Save it. I can see from
a mile away that you're in love.

159
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,080
Is it that obvious?

160
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

161
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,159
You're speaking nonsense, Golf.

162
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,799
We're not falling for that.

163
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,720
Oh? Atom?

164
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Zen.

165
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,399
- Hi, Golf. Hi, Oat.
- Hi there.

166
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,159
Are you closing up?

167
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,720
- Closing?
- Not yet.

168
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,440
The machine's still on.
We can make you something.

169
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,960
Oh.

170
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,240
Do you want something?
Oat can make it for you.

171
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,399
Well then...

172
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,480
Orange americano? Just like usual?

173
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,679
Sure, Golf.

174
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,878
- I'll sit at my regular spot.
- Okay.

175
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,879
Thank you.

176
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,799
The protagonist left, and now
the secondary shows up.

177
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,159
Hang on. Who's the protagonist?
And who's the secondary?

178
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,080
My boy might not have chosen yet.

179
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,639
Go one. The coffee. And quick.

180
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:06,080
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

181
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,519
Does this camera still work?

182
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,159
- Of course.
- Really?

183
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Really.

184
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,360
Your wounds have healed.
You're handsome again.

185
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,679
And do you like it? If you do,

186
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,159
I'll make myself even more handsome.

187
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,679
What are you talking about?

188
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,240
If you're going to do it,
do it for yourself.

189
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,559
It has nothing to do with me.

190
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,679
You're as hard-working
as always, Zen.

191
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Are you tired?

192
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,200
Not really.

193
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,679
I'm stingy.

194
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,240
I like it when you smile.

195
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,879
It's cute.

196
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
But I wonder...

197
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
About what?

198
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,200
When you grin, your eyes are
almost completely shut.

199
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,519
I'm curious if you can see.

200
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,639
Moron! Of course I can.

201
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,200
My eyes aren't that small.

202
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You're hurting me.

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,559
You're overacting.
It was just a little smack.

204
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,200
Can you let go of my hand now?

205
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,480
I wish I could hold your hand
like this a little longer.

206
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,840
Atom, I have to get back to work.

207
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,720
Golf's about to call me.

208
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,639
Yes? Oh. Sure, Golf.

209
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,919
Ah, okay. I'll be there right away.

210
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,080
Okay. I have to go.

211
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,519
Yes, Golf?

212
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,919
Oh? Zen?

213
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,080
- When did I call him?
- You didn't.

214
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,320
Maybe he's just acting.

215
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,279
- Scan right here, Atom.
- Okay.

216
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,759
Got it. Thank you.

217
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,080
Thank you. See you later, Golf, Oat.

218
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,798
Visit us again. Bye.

219
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,799
Bye.

220
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,279
Which one is it?

221
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,559
I bet it's the one just now.
They held hands.

222
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,960
I think it's the first one.
Zen's super giddy when he's around.

223
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,799
No, I think it's the second one.

224
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,320
Is there any trash
to throw away here?

225
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,638
- Zen.
- Golf? Hey, what?

226
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,639
Zen.

227
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,200
- Tell me now.
- Huh?

228
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,279
Who is it?

229
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,799
- Come on.
- The biker or the coffee customer.

230
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,320
- Guys!
- Tell us.

231
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,000
Zen.

232
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,600
Zen, tell us now. Who is it?

233
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,159
So is there any trash for me
to throw out or not?

234
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,480
If not, I'm going to head outside.
You got me all sore.

235
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,639
Quit the act. Which one?

236
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,120
Come on. Tell us.

237
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,639
- I'm going.
- Zen.

238
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,399
Five hundred
on the orange americano.

239
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,240
One thousand on the biker. Trust me.

240
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,320
All right. Deal.

241
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,360
- Deal.
- I'm going to get 1,000.

242
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,559
No, you're going to lose.

243
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,960
No, you're going to lose 1,000.

244
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,639
Dad, have you had dinner?
I'll cook something for you.

245
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,960
It's okay.
I'm still not that hungry.

246
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,240
How come?
Are you fed up with my cooking?

247
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,919
It's not that.

248
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Right.

249
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,519
Here.

250
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,639
What's this? Where did you get it?

251
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,279
Some old friends decided to
sponsor us. It's not a lot.

252
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,200
But it might help our team out.

253
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,759
That's great. Thanks, Dad.

254
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,170
And where's all your computer stuff?

255
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,039
Oh, uh... I fixed them all.

256
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,170
And the customers
came to pick them up.

257
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,759
Ah.

258
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,039
All right. I'm going to get changed.

259
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,890
(Pawn Ticket)

260
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,170
It's only temporary.

261
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:05,319
What's wrong, Lin?
You asked to see us quite late.

262
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,039
Did you just happen to be together?

263
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,039
Mm. I just picked him up
from the cafe.

264
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,200
Are you okay, Lin?

265
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,890
How come you're looking a bit down?

266
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,410
Dad gave me money.

267
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,559
Huh?

268
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,410
And where did he get it?

269
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,039
He pawned his computer
repair equipment.

270
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,799
- Oh, Coach!
- He's the man.

271
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,119
No more. We have
to raise the money ourselves.

272
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,680
We can't let him keep doing this.

273
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,359
That's right.

274
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,200
We have to help each other.

275
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,039
Lin, I'm sorry

276
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
about today.

277
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,759
I'm sorry too.
I overstepped my boundaries.

278
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,839
You should go home, Lin.

279
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,720
And act normal.
Don't let him find out.

280
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,680
Keep the money and don't spend it.

281
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,119
Mm.

282
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:37,650
- Yes!
- Beautiful!

283
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,200
- Chogun?
- Chogun!

284
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:44,359
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

285
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,039
But you're bleeding.

286
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,359
Jedi, get the first-aid kit!

287
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,119
Right away! Hold this, please.

288
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,960
Just wait.

289
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,440
Guys, our first-aid kit is empty.

290
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,170
Take him to the infirmary now, Jedi.

291
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Okay.

292
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,960
Here. One, two, three.

293
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,559
- Hup.
- Take it slow.

294
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,649
Okay.

295
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,358
- Go on.
- Go.

296
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,119
- Take it slow, Jedi.
- You too.

297
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,890
- Jedi, look after him.
- Okay.

298
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,799
- Ouch.
- Slowly.

299
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,240
Excuse me? Someone's hurt.

300
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Sit here.

301
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,650
Gently now.

302
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,599
I don't think anyone's here.

303
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,650
Oh? What are we going to do now?

304
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,720
Don't worry. I know what to do.

305
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
Come on.

306
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,440
We have to wash it
with saline solution.

307
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,799
- Does it sting?
- It won't.

308
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,480
Let me know if it hurts.

309
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,599
Just a little.

310
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,200
Okay.

311
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,759
That too?

312
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,279
It's a disinfectant.
It's going to sting a little.

313
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,319
Does that hurt?

314
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,319
Just a little.

315
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
All done.

316
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,920
Thanks, Jedi.

317
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,759
Why are you thanking me?
I'm happy to help.

318
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,640
For being kind to me.

319
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,680
Other people usually say I'm weird,

320
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,799
except for the guys
on the team and you.

321
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,599
I understand.

322
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,720
People used to think I'm weird too.

323
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,839
But it's not a problem at all.

324
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,400
My mom said the same thing too.

325
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
Huh?

326
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,960
What you said made me feel good,
just like when my mom said it.

327
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,640
Your mom is awesome.

328
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,839
She raised you to be so lovely.

329
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,720
Your mom is awesome too.

330
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,519
For raising you to be kind to me.

331
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,279
We have to hurry up and earn
some money before the competition.

332
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,240
Does anyone have any ideas?

333
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,119
Oh? What about your mom, Ryu?

334
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,200
We need 60,000.

335
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,960
What can people like us do?

336
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,799
We're still too young
to work at a host bar.

337
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,079
Forget about our age,
they're picky about looks.

338
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,880
- Isn't that too harsh?
- Joking.

339
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,000
Maybe we try raising money
at the outdoor markets?

340
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,599
You'd probably only get
about 300 to 400 baht.

341
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Look at this!

342
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,519
They like you when you're sweaty!

343
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,480
There's a hashtag #RyuZen too.

344
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,240
Where? Show me.

345
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
Where?

346
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,359
Here.

347
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,359
- Where?
- Here.

348
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:38,960
Why am I not included?

349
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,720
I said people are picky about looks.

350
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,160
What about you?
Is there a photo of you?

351
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,359
Here. I took it myself.

352
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,480
Did you post it yourself too?

353
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,039
- Dunk tanks?
- Dunk tanks?

354
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,559
Bingo! That's correct.

355
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,319
Think about it. A photo
of you guys all sweaty

356
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,559
could get thousands of likes.

357
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,119
What if you're completely soaked?

358
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,480
How many likes would we get?

359
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,200
Fan clubs are happy to pay
whatever in this day and age.

360
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,359
Can we not be topless?

361
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:20,920
Right? Are you really going
to use our bodies to earn money?

362
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,480
It sounds bad
if you put it that way.

363
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:26,039
Just do it for the laughs.

364
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,359
Bring it on.

365
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,079
It sounds like fun.
We get to splash around too.

366
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,279
See? Chogun thinks it's fun.

367
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,279
I'll pass. It's shameful.

368
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,240
Zen, say something.

369
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,599
Zen?

370
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,960
But this is the fastest way
our club can raise money.

371
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,240
All right then.
If it's going to bring in money.

372
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,200
I'm in.

373
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
I'll do it too.

374
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,519
- Oh? Hey!
- Okay, okay.

375
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,599
What do you say, Ryu?

376
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,039
Dunk tanks?

377
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,640
- Ryu.
- Ryu.

378
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,400
It's unanimous.
Of course I'm on board.

379
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,079
All right. Let's do it!

380
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,720
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

381
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,559
Welcome! There are
plenty of booths inside!

383
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,839
If you're done at the gun range
or ballon-popping,

384
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,960
please visit the dunk tanks.

385
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,119
Three for 50!

386
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,920
Three for 50! Three for 50!

387
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,559
You missed!

388
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,039
A little closer...

389
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,559
All right! Throw the ball!

390
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:10,160
Excuse me?

391
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,240
- Are you going to play too?
- I want to support the club.

392
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,759
I've been living in the area
for a long time,

393
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,000
but I haven't seen the basketball
team perform so well in ages.

394
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,799
My daughter said

395
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,599
we made it to the finals.
Is that right?

396
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,720
Yes, we did.

397
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,599
I don't have much,
but I want to help.

398
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,118
Thank you so much!

399
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,720
(Three for 50)

400
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,759
We'll bring home the championship.

401
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,959
Please wait for a moment.

402
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,039
Thank you, ma'am.

403
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,480
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

404
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,960
Wow.

405
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,200
You're late.
I thought you bailed on us.

406
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,359
Where were you?

407
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,558
Ryu, Zen, aren't you doing it too?

408
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,799
We want to dunk you.

409
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,920
- I'll pass.
- I'll pass.

410
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,359
What a shame. We're happy to pay
as much as you want if you do it.

411
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,519
As much as we want?

412
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,680
- That's right.
- Maybe we should start with...

413
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,599
ten rounds?

414
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,599
Deal. You can warm up
your hands while you wait.

415
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,680
Hold it.

416
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,720
We didn't agree to do it.

417
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,599
But they're happy to pay
as much as we want.

418
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,759
Do it for the team, please?

419
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,119
Get in then?

420
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,720
- Get in!
- Get in!

421
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,880
- Get in!
- Get in!

422
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,440
Three tanks. So why just us two?

423
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:58,559
True.

424
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,319
I wonder why.

425
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,559
(Tanwarin Witthaya Basketball Club)

426
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960

427
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,319
(Tanwarin Witthaya Basketball Club)

428
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,480
You're quite popular.
You had it worse than I did.

429
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,519
Took you long enough to realize.

430
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,319
Dunk tanks look like fun.

431
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,079
Atom? How did you get here?

432
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,039
It's going viral. Who'd miss it?

433
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,079
Maybe this is too effective?

434
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,559
Isn't that a good thing?

435
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,880
Ryu? Zen?

436
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Oh? Atom?

437
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,839
Hey, Lin.

438
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,960
This is really popping off.

439
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,960
I had to come
and see it with my own eyes.

440
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,960
Atom,

441
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,240
can you help me with something then?

442
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:31,640
Shoot. The water is so cold

443
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,319
once you've already gone in.

444
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,279
Hang in there.

445
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,160
It's almost the final round.
Lin only asked for two more.

446
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,599
You can take a break
if you're not up for it.

447
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,359
- I'll stay with Zen.
- Nosy.

448
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,599
Ryu!

449
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,640
Remove your hands if you dare.
Quit the flexing.

450
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,599
You do it too then.

451
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,319
Why would I? I'm not trying
to show off like you are.

452
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,440
- You do it.
- That's enough.

453
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,359
We'll do it together.

454
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,119
One, two, three.

455
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,479
Send us a gift if you want
to dunk someone online.

456
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,640
We'll do it virtually just for you.

457
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,799
Go!

458
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,640
Ryu?

459
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,119
What's wrong?

460
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,319
What's the matter?

461
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,039
I'm... just annoyed,

462
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,200
irritated, and angry

463
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,240
whenever I see you with Atom.

464
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,799
But I also don't want to overreact.

465
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,519
Calm down.

466
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,480
Listen to me.

467
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,440
I chose you. I already have.

468
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:52,200
You don't have
to try to do anything.

469
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,160
And you don't have
to help me with anything else.

470
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,960
I'm happy it's you

471
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,079
who's with me.

472
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,079
Thanks

473
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
for choosing me.

474
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,119
(Zen, something urgent came up.
I have to go.)

475
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,240
(Dry yourself off,
or you might catch a cold.)

476
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,480
We got 845 dollars
from the live stream.

477
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,400
If we convert it
to Thai baht, then it's...

478
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,400
around 25,000 baht.

479
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,039
Plus 6,520 baht in donations

480
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,839
and 33,000 baht from the dunk tanks.

481
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:21,960
And that is 64,520 in total.

482
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:25,200
- Whoa!
- We did it!

483
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,319
Well done, guys.

484
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,440
You raised like 60,000
in a day. Excellent!

485
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,319
We didn't strip for nothing!

486
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:34,799
Our club gets to keep going.

487
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Awesome.

488
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,240
Someone donated another 9,000.

489
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,839
So the new total is 73,520 baht.

490
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,839
Whoa!

491
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:51,680
We're awesome, Jedi!

492
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:55,039
Lin, can I see who sent it?

493
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,920
Do we have enough
for new uniforms now?

494
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,359
Maybe.

495
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,720
- Awesome!
- Awesome!

496
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,119
It might be
our last chance to compete,

497
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,880
so we have to be the coolest!

498
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,480
- Who says it's our last game?
- Who says it's our last game?

499
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,719
You and your mouth.

500
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,679
Jed, there are many
more games to come.

501
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,119
This isn't our last.

502
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,329
That's right.

503
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Someone punch him in the gut!

504
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,599
I'll do it.

505
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,599
Go ahead.

506
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,159
Let him have it, Ryu.

507
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:30,329
Ooh.

508
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,960
You're going to get it.

509
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:34,329
Thanks, Lin. This was
because of your idea.

510
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:37,519
I should be the one
thanking your guys. Well done.

511
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,239
- Prince. Restrain him.
- Huh?

512
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:44,239
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

513
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:45,679
Ryu, don't!

514
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:47,000
No!

515
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,199
Come on!

516
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,000
Hey!

517
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
I'm coming!

518
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,639
What's up, Zen?

519
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:17,289
Atom, did you transfer us money?

520
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,440
How did you find out?

521
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,480
I guessed. That's why I'm calling.

522
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,480
You're a good guesser.

523
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:31,960
Why did you?
You've helped me a lot already.

524
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:35,360
- Where are you? I'm giving it back.
- No need.

525
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,960
It's not my money.

526
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,840
The fans wanted to help.

527
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,079
Thanks, Atom.

528
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,639
I'm on your side, Zen.
I'm always happy to support you.

529
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,440
I guess you're happy.

530
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,960
People are complimenting you,

531
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,880
saying you're so cute.

532
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,480
It doesn't happen every day.

533
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,239
A lot of people
complimented you too.

534
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,289
See? "Ryu's the coolest!"

535
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
What?

536
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,519
Are you jealous?

537
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:45,559
When did I say that?

538
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,289
Ryu, you're heavy!

539
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:52,769
Ryu!

540
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,769
I'm jealous because
of those girls and Atom. Happy?

541
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,039
You're heavy, Ryu!

542
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,119
You deserve to be punished.

543
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Ryu!

544
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,199
You dare to retaliate now?

545
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,480
I'm not scared of you.

546
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Ryu!

547
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:25,960
Payback.

548
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,079
Easy!

549
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,920
Come on!

550
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:39,809
Ah!

551
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,400
Help!

552
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,039
Shouldn't you find a better job?

553
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,719
It's obvious it's not enough!

554
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:11,769
It is! How is it not enough?

555
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,599
Aren't you going to school today?
Why are you dressed like that?

556
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,599
- Oh? Today is...
- Go and get dressed.

557
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,639
Don't skip school.

558
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Zen,

559
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:20,289
have you seen my dad?

560
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,199
No.

561
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:25,519
Is something the matter?

562
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,960
No, nothing. I'll be right back.

563
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,840
Dad, we're at school.
Shouldn't you have stopped?

564
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,079
It's just a little bit.
I'll be fine.

565
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:52,360
You really don't remember
what day it is?

566
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,840
Dad, it's the anniversary
of Mom's death.

567
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,360
Do you really not remember?

568
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,329
Instead of taking me to her,

569
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
you decided to sit here and drink?

570
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,679
It's the day mom died,
for Pete's sake!

571
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:21,809
You're such a...

572
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
Is something wrong?

573
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
No.

574
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,329
If you say so.

575
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Wait.

576
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,199
Well...

577
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,639
Here.

578
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:52,329
Thanks.

579
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:09,679
Aren't you going to ask?

580
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:15,519
What's going on?

581
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
Today is...

582
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,960
the anniversary of my mom's passing.

583
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:33,159
But Dad doesn't remember.

584
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,480
He never cares about anything.

585
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,079
Is that why you're sad?

586
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,960
Of course. It's very important,

587
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:49,719
and my dad doesn't even remember.

588
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,360
I think he does.

589
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,559
He probably has his own problems.

590
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,679
Everyone does.

591
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:10,329
I didn't know what was
going on at first,

592
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:12,559
but I think I understand now.

593
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:16,880
Lin, trust me.

594
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:19,440
Coach didn't forget about your mom.

595
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,719
He hadn't been drinking
for a while now, right?

596
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,559
And then he started drinking today.

597
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:35,769
You're right.

598
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,920
That's how adults are.
They always lie to themselves

599
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,519
and act like everything's okay
but are super broken on the inside.

600
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,000
Dad, I'm home.

601
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,920
Mackerel salad. My favorite.

602
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,880
Thank you.

603
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,960
Is someone else here? Director Aun?

604
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
Let's eat.

605
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:37,039
I thought you forgot all about her.

606
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:41,519
I can't stop thinking about her,
even for a second.

607
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,119
These are all of your
and her favorites.

608
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,960
Dig in.

609
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:53,840
Eat up, Liu.

610
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,079
We haven't had dinner together
in a while now.

611
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,800
Do you want some of this?

612
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,960
Nice and hot.

613
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,920
Here. Take the whole thing.

614
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:20,639
Ryu!

615
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
Ryu!

616
00:45:26,679 --> 00:45:29,400
Why's the big deal?
You've already seen me.

617
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,880
Ryu, get out. Grandma might see us.

618
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,800
Grandma's not home today.

619
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,039
She went to her friend's.

620
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,079
How did you know?
She hasn't told me anything.

621
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,960
She called
while you were in the shower,

622
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:05,039
so I answered.

623
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,360
What's wrong? Are you embarrassed?

624
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,760
I thought you said we're dating now.

625
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,559
I did, but...

626
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,960
Let's make some good memories.

627
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,760
What memories now?

628
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,440
Something like this.

629
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:49,880
Ryu!

630
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,079
Ryu!

631
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:00,719
Your hand's quite warm.

632
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,880
We brought home victory
and made a name for the school,

633
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,119
yet they still insist
on disbanding our club.

634
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:56,679
Calm down, guys!
The game isn't over yet!

635
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,239
Let's write our own fate.

636
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,839
Grandma!

637
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,159
I have to find money for
Grandma's surgery no matter what.

638
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:05,558
- Zen.
- Street basketball?

639
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:09,360
Three-on-three.
You'll get 150,000 if you win.

640
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:11,320
- Zen, shoot!
- Here, Zen!
