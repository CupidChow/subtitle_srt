1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,359
I have feelings for you.

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,399
I know I treated you
badly in middle school.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,679
But it's because I didn't know
what it was called

4
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,320
and whether it's wrong.

5
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,920
But I know now.

6
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,920
Come on, Ryu. Stop messing with me.

7
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,530
Do you know

8
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,479
how what you just said

9
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,640
made me feel?

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,280
I do.

11
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,920
You're not the only one.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
I feel it too.

13
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,200
It's hard for me too.

14
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,119
I don't know what to do.

15
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,280
Are you for real?

16
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,079
Will you try going out with me?

17
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm serious.

18
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,680
Ryu, I...

19
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,680
I know.

20
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,000
You already have Atom, don't you?

21
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,879
I'm okay.

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,200
He's a good guy.

23
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,239
Well,

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,760
it has nothing to do with him.

25
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,040
So why didn't you agree
to go out with me?

26
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,799
You have to give me some time.

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,519
I'm about to say yes to
my very first boyfriend.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,359
You've never had a boyfriend?

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
No.

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,240
I'm glad

31
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,000
I got to be your first.

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,530
Hang on. I haven't said yes.

33
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,919
Then say it.

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,319
I'm waiting to hear it.

35
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,810
So?

36
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,159
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

37
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,400
But when it comes to the team,

38
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,530
I'm your captain,
and you're my teammate.

39
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,680
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

40
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,319
Ryu, if someone asks,

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,639
don't tell anyone

42
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,400
until I say
you can tell other people.

43
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,639
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,719
Mm.

45
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,560
Huh? What did you say?

46
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,280
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

47
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,360
Are you deaf?

48
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,319
I already said "mm".

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Huh? What did you say?

50
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,240
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,080
Okay.

52
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,719
- What?
- Okay!

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Well then.

54
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,439
I have to prove it.

55
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,639
What now?

56
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,318
(The Rebound)

57
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,240
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

58
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:24,279
(Ryu: What are you up to?)

59
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:43,600
(Working at the pool, of course.)

60
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,720
(Ryu: Don't let anyone get close
unless necessary, understand?)

61
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,439
(You're getting out of control.)

62
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,079
(Ryu: Whatever. I'm saying no.
You're mine.)

63
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,279
Zen, what are you smiling about?

64
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,759
Zen,

65
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,040
I quit Interhigh's team.

66
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Atom,

67
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,160
I wanted you
to sort things out with Pipo.

68
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,240
But I didn't want you
to quit school.

69
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,160
Weren't you on scholarship?

70
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Just forget it.

71
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,920
I can't play with a team
that can't accept losing.

72
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
Won't you

73
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,079
get in trouble with your family?

74
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,439
I did.

75
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,480
But I've made my decision.

76
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,439
Atom!

77
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,639
It's okay. My dad's fine.

78
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,240
He'll be able to find a school
that can give me a scholarship.

79
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,399
Zen, I'm sorry.

80
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,319
Why would you apologize?

81
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,399
I didn't get hurt or anything.

82
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,519
But I feel really bad about this.

83
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,959
I understand.

84
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,480
But I think

85
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,519
if you really want to apologize

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,639
so you can feel relieved,

87
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,079
you should apologize
to someone else.

88
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,160
So why are you here?
You said you wanted to talk.

89
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,199
Well...

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,079
I...

91
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,759
Why are you apologizing?

93
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,040
You didn't do it.

94
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,680
On behalf of my team.

95
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,079
Basketball is a team sport.

96
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,759
The whole team must take
responsibility for any wrongdoings.

97
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,160
He quit Interhigh's team.

98
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Oh?

99
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,120
Why did you do that?

100
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,680
You're good at basketball.

101
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,639
I didn't quit just because
of what happened to you.

102
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,639
Don't take it the wrong way.

103
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,079
I just don't want to play
with them anymore.

104
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,360
Do you think doing that
makes you look cool?

105
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,639
I can't help it, can't I?

106
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,919
I'm just that cool.

107
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,559
Hang on.

108
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,210
How did we get here?

109
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,240
Boys, it's time to eat.

110
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,679
- Yes, Grandma!
- Yes, Grandma!

111
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,559
All right. Eat up.

112
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,159
Okay.

113
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,639
- Here, Zen.
- Oh.

114
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,639
- There.
- Hey.

115
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,600
Eat up. Have you lost weight?

116
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,039
Thanks so much, Atom.

117
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,159
But I can serve myself.

118
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,519
It's okay. I'm happy to help.

119
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,799
Here. That's yours.

120
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,919
Thanks, but I didn't ask.

121
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,000
Eat so your arm can recover quickly,

122
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,360
and you can finally go home.

123
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Ah, you've made amends, Ryu? Atom?

124
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,879
- Yes.
- Yes.

125
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,879
The credit goes to me, Grandma.

126
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,000
It took me ages to
get them on good terms.

127
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,799
Okay. I believe you.

128
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,799
Life is short.

129
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,480
Be nice to each other, okay?

130
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,519
- Yes, Grandma.
- Yes, Grandma.

131
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,919
I will.

132
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,120
Zen.

133
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,330
What?

134
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,759
Come here.

135
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,840
What's with you?

136
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,879
Who told you to serve Atom?

137
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
What?

138
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,210
He served me. I didn't serve him.

139
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,679
Whatever. I've got
a bone to pick with you.

140
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,519
For what?

141
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,039
For smiling back at him.

142
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,519
Hold up.

143
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,919
Didn't I smile at you too?

144
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,210
I also smiled at Grandma.

145
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,559
But not at Atom.

146
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,559
You're mine.

147
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,480
Come here.

148
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,320
What's up with you?

149
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,480
A hug as a punishment.

150
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,600
No, I haven't even showered.

151
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,159
Ryu!

152
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,559
It's okay. I don't think you stink.

153
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,519
Ryu, ugh!

154
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,919
That's enough!

155
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,240
Ugh! Ryu!

156
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,919
You're going to hurt your arm.

157
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,960
Zen! Ryu!

158
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,519
Keep the noise down.
The neighbors might complain!

159
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,759
Sorry, Grandma.

160
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,039
What's wrong with you?

161
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,840
Ryu!

162
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Hey!

163
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,840
Ryu!

164
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,799
That's enough.

165
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,080
Stop it, Ryu!

166
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,639
Hey!

167
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,120
Have you eaten anything?

168
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Yes.

169
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,398
What did you eat?

170
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,399
Did you eat anything healthy?

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,240
Don't forget.

172
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,159
Even though you've quit
from Interhigh's team,

173
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,720
you still have
to keep yourself physically fit.

174
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Okay.

175
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,200
Wait.

176
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,919
I've talked to the people in Phuket.

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,440
We'll move there together

178
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,240
after this tournament.

179
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,799
That's all?

180
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,440
Yes.

181
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,639
(Dad talked to me about
the scholarship when I got home.)

182
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:03,159
(Zen: And are you okay?)

183
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,200
(Mm. Thanks for worrying
about me. Goodnight.)

184
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,960
(Zen: Goodnight.)

185
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,679
Grandma,

186
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:08,159
I'll stop to buy you ingredients

187
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,440
after Ryu gets his cast removed.

188
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,200
- Just get what's on the list.
- Okay.

189
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,519
Ryu, I hope your life gets better
after they remove the cast.

190
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,480
Thank you, Grandma.

191
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,840
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye. Ride safely.

192
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,039
I will.

193
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,279
- Oh? Atom?
- Hi, Grandma.

194
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,320
Mm!

195
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,960
You missed him by minutes.

196
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,480
Zen took Ryu to get
his cast removed.

197
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,159
It's okay, Grandma.

198
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,240
Atom,

199
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,480
you've visited me
many times already.

200
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,039
But we've never had
a serious conversation.

201
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,279
What's the matter?

202
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,159
Nothing, really.

203
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,720
I'm just curious

204
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,360
about why you wanted
to be a basketball player.

205
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,200
Like Zen, his father taught him
since he was little.

206
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,000
I had no idea he'd be this serious

207
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,919
when he grew up.

208
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,320
It's okay if you can't tell.
I understand.

209
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,200
Actually, it's not
something I can't tell, Grandma.

210
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,720
I just don't know where to start.

211
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,519
My dad taught me to play
when I was little too.

212
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,519
Just like Zen.

213
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,360
But the difference

214
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,879
is that Zen seems
to love basketball.

215
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,480
And you don't?

216
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,000
I just...

217
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,440
followed my dad's orders.

218
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Grandma,

219
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,170
is it strange

220
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,559
that I still don't know
what my dream is,

221
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,170
even at this age?

222
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,799
Do you know
why I started my dessert business?

223
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,799
No, is it because you like it?

224
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,170
Not at all.

225
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,680
It's the only thing I can do
at an acceptable level.

226
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:54,920
No way, Grandma.

227
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,650
Your desserts are the best.

228
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,240
Aw, you really have
a way with words.

229
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,480
It's true.

230
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,559
When I was little,

231
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,799
my family didn't have much.

232
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,170
I'd follow my mother to help her
with work at various places.

233
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,079
She was quite good
at finding jobs too.

234
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,119
And she'd take me along everywhere.

235
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,039
Good thing child labor laws
didn't exist back then.

236
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,039
Back then, I was happy enough
to see the next day come.

237
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,759
I grew up
without having any dreams as well.

238
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,680
I see.

239
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,170
What you see here is
everything my mother taught me.

240
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,119
I don't know

241
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,559
how much you like basketball.

242
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,039
But as far as I know,

243
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,559
you're very good at it, aren't you?

244
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,440
Perhaps

245
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,890
people can be successful

246
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,170
at things that aren't their dreams.

247
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,440
Wow,

248
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,240
that's very pretty.

249
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,480
You're very talented.

250
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,119
Really, Grandma?

251
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,039
The board didn't approve the budget.

252
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
What is this?

253
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,200
I requested it so the kids could
compete. How can they do this?

254
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,359
The thing is, our school

255
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,410
only allocated a budget
for two games.

256
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,279
No one expected our team
to get to the finals.

257
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,518
So? We got to the finals.

258
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,920
Shouldn't they keep supporting us?

259
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,440
It's not that I don't want to help.

260
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,240
But it's not my decision to make.

261
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Of course.

262
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,720
It's not a science activity.

263
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
That's why they don't care.

264
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,239
They even want to demolish
the sporting club's building

265
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,920
to construct
a science building instead.

266
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,839
This sucks.

267
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,119
- Hey!
- Shoot!

268
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:17,279
- Darn it!
- Well done!

269
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,960
Here.

270
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,200
Pass the ball!

271
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,650
Come on.

272
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,359
What are you guys doing?

273
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,480
- Ryu?
- Ryu?

274
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,279
Ryu!

275
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,839
How are you feeling?
You got your cast removed.

276
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,170
Can you use your arm as usual?

277
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,720
I don't think there's
going to be a problem.

278
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,279
Says who?

279
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,890
The doctor said you shouldn't
use your arm too much just yet.

280
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,079
No practice for you today.
Just sit and watch.

281
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,799
Oh? I don't want to do that.

282
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,960
I'm with Zen on this one though.

283
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,650
Oh?

284
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,319
Ryu, can I ask you something?

285
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,440
When you had the cast on,
how did you...

286
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,480
do it?

287
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,480
- What's "it"?
- Well...

288
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,559
It!

289
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,839
- Jerk.
- This!

290
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,119
- You pervy moron, Jed!
- What?

291
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,279
- That.
- Hey!

292
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,359
Jed, do you see me standing here?

293
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,240
- I'm a woman.
- That's right.

294
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,559
Well, I'm just curious.

295
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,839
They said the budget is exhausted.

296
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,359
How is that possible?

297
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:37,359
We made it to the semifinals.

298
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,319
I know.

299
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,838
I said all I could,
but that's what they said.

300
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,000
What else do you want me to do?

301
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,799
In any case, I'm going
to get you to compete.

302
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,319
Are you guys in this with me?

303
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
I'm in!

304
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,000
Me too!

305
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,720
Us too!

306
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,759
We'll give it all.

307
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,640
What do you want?

308
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:19,039
The gamblers requested Ryu
for the next game, Boss.

309
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,799
They threatened to go somewhere
else if he doesn't play.

310
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,400
What should we do, Boss?

311
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,079
If we don't do anything,

312
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,119
you're going to lose millions.

313
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,000
That brat.

314
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,920
Go and find Q.

315
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,440
- Yes, Boss.
- Yes, Boss.

316
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,000
Your guy had his cast removed.

317
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,039
I think he should be up for it now.

318
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,319
- Boss, well...
- Well what?

319
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,920
Well, he just had it removed.

320
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,240
I don't think he's up
for a game just yet.

321
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,519
I didn't ask you for your opinion.

322
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:15,119
I told you to go and get Ryu!

323
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,039
Can you stop disappointing me
again and again?

324
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,798
You probably know
what the consequences would be

325
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,640
if I had to take matters into
my own hands.

326
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,519
(M)

327
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,079
Who's this "M"?

328
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,039
You always reject the call
whenever it's them.

329
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,480
A loanshark?

330
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,640
No.

331
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,759
Why didn't you answer
your mom's phone?

332
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,119
I'm not going.

333
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,640
I've made
all the preparations for you.

334
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,240
And I have an errand
to run over there.

335
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,200
But I'm playing in the finals.

336
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,880
I can't abandon Zen and the guys.

337
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,359
How can a school
basketball game be so important?

338
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,000
Your future is more important.

339
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,400
I'm not going.

340
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,319
You have to.

341
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,640
I've let you have your way
for far too long.

342
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,039
If Dad was still here,

343
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,960
he'd never force me to do anything.

344
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,640
And is he with us?

345
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,759
Is he here with us?

346
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,599
Ryu?

347
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Ryu?

348
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,759
Huh? What?

349
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,640
What's wrong?

350
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,519
I was speaking to you,

351
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,640
but you ignored me.

352
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,079
I'm fine.

353
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,200
I spaced out. That's all.

354
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,759
I have to go to class now.

355
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,759
Oh. Study hard,

356
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,920
10th grader.

357
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,240
Get to class. See you.

358
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,440
Q?

359
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,480
Can I have a word?

360
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,559
Tos told me to get you
so you could compete.

361
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,200
This still isn't over?

362
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,838
I told you. That was the last time.

363
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,279
You should go.

364
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,279
That time,

365
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,440
the cops interrupted the game.
It doesn't count.

366
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,440
This really is the last time?

367
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,720
Mm.

368
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:10,000
Tomorrow night? I'll catch up
with you after practice.

369
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:14,839
You'll catch up?

370
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,559
And you're going to flake out on me

371
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,279
like last time, aren't you?

372
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,359
I'm not going to fall
for your tricks anymore.

373
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,920
- Come with me now.
- No.

374
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,400
I have to go to class.

375
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,119
I'll go if I'm going.

376
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,039
Ryu!

377
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,160
Huh? What are you doing?

378
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,640
- Hey!
- Easy.

379
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,599
- Hey, get in the van.
- Move.

380
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,039
(How are you feeling?
What are you doing?)

381
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,039
Jedi!

382
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,839
Have you seen Ryu?

383
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,960
No, I don't think
he came to school today.

384
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,200
I was about to ask you.
There's homework to hand in.

385
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,559
Give me your phone.

386
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,480
Here.

387
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,519
I set up "Find my Mobile" for you.

388
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,279
I'll be able to find you now
wherever you are.

389
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,759
Did something happen?

390
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,119
- Boss!
- Get it up!

391
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,200
Hey!

392
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,960
What are you doing over there?

393
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,079
Boss, Stop!

394
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,319
Boss, don't you want him to play?

395
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,119
Hey, stop.

396
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,440
Get him up.

397
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,839
Boss!

398
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,119
Oh? Zen?

399
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,759
What's up?

400
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,759
Do you think you're cool
for bailing on me?

401
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,079
- Let me go!
- Boss!

402
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,839
Do you know how much money
and connections I've lost?

403
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,759
But I made you a lot of money,
didn't I?

404
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,559
Shut your mouth.

405
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,079
- Hey!
- Boss!

406
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,319
I'm giving you
another chance to play for me.

407
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,200
Name your price.

408
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,799
I'm not playing.

409
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,599
"I'm not playing"?

410
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,279
- Ugh!
- Ryu!

411
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,279
Stay put!

412
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:30,799
Boss,

413
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,640
you should stop. He might die.

414
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,200
I've talked to him.

415
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,079
He's going to play for us tonight.

416
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,960
Not just tonight.

417
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,920
I want him to play forever

418
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,160
until I tell him when he can quit!

419
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,839
Your school's team is good.

420
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,880
They've gotten in quite far.

421
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:05,799
These guys are the reason you don't
want to play for me, aren't they?

422
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,680
- Leave my friends alone!
- Hey!

423
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,759
I'm going to give you
some time to reconsider

424
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,200
whether you're going to play for me

425
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,000
or you want me to go after them.

426
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,839
- Stay still!
- Ugh!

427
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,720
What are you going to do to me, Q?

428
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,039
Don't do this, Boss!

429
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,319
You really love him, don't you?

430
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,160
- Your beloved brother...
- Yes!

431
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,960
I do!

432
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,599
- Darn it!
- Q!

433
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,279
Q!

434
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,519
You have until
the end of the day to decide.

435
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,440
Tie him up.

436
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,240
- Yes, Boss.
- Yes, Boss.

437
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,039
(Atom)

438
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Ryu.

439
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,319
Q?

440
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,240
Ryu,

441
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,720
how are you feeling?

442
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,119
- What's going on inside?
- Boss tied them both up.

443
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,400
He's giving Ryu a chance
to reconsider.

444
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,160
Let's go and check the back.

445
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,240
Do you think this is the park?

446
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,720
Is that why you're wandering around?

447
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
So it's you.

448
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,359
Where is Ryu?

449
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,839
Ryu? Everyone's willing
to risk their lives for him.

450
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,160
Oh? Atom?

451
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,079
- Hi, Golf.
- Hi.

452
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,759
Hasn't Zen arrived yet?

453
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,480
Not yet. But he'll probably
be here soon.

454
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,400
Oh. Well then.
I'll have the usual, please.

455
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,559
Orange americano.

456
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,519
Sure, orange americano.

457
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,920
- Yes.
- Have a seat. I'll get it for you.

458
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,039
Okay.

459
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,160
- Golf.
- Hm?

460
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,559
- What?
- Actually,

461
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,200
I feel sorry for him.

462
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:40,039
You do? Why?

463
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,839
It's an experience to add
some flavor to his life.

464
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,160
But unrequited love is tiresome.

465
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:49,440
Hold it. How do you know
Zen isn't into Atom?

466
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,960
It's obvious who Zen's into.

467
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,960
Stop. The clock's still running.

468
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,680
This game isn't over yet.

469
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,240
Hang in there, Atom.

470
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,160
- I'm Team Atom.
- But I'm Team Ryu.

471
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,480
Okay. Go and make the coffee.
No slacking off.

472
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,240
And stop gossiping.

473
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:15,840
Zen!

474
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,960
- Zen!
- Ryu!

475
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,719
Ryu!

476
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,199
Tos, you punk!
Why did you capture my friend?

477
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:26,519
Why do you see me
in such a negative light?

478
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:28,119
I haven't even done anything.

479
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,599
He's the one that barged in.

480
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,639
So I lent him a hand
and escorted him here.

481
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,480
Hey, stop that!

482
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:40,809
Hey!

483
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,769
What?

484
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,719
Have you decided

485
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:47,920
you're going to come back
and play for me forever?

486
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,809
Gambling street basketball?

487
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,920
Ryu, don't do it!

488
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,880
Shut your mouth!

489
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,480
So, Ryu?

490
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:01,000
Are you going to come back
and play for me?

491
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,360
Or do you want me to stomp
your friend to death?

492
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,559
Choose.

493
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:10,360
No, Ryu! Don't worry about me!

494
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,769
You really love your friend.

495
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,159
I like that.

496
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,360
Hey, beat him up.

497
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,599
Hey, stop!

498
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:23,559
Hey!

499
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,329
Stay still.

500
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,119
Do you think you're so tough?

501
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,769
Come here!

502
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,400
- Ryu!
- Boss, stop!

503
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,440
- Ugh
- Ryu!

504
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,809
Ryu!

505
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,769
Ryu!

506
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,639
Are you hurt?

507
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,809
- Zen...
- Ryu.

508
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,639
I'm sorry you...

509
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,769
you got hurt.

510
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,079
Don't apologize.

511
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,440
It's worse for you.

512
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:13,599
You really love him, don't you?

513
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,039
There you go, the guy you love.

514
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,440
Boss,

515
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,559
I'm begging you.

516
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,400
Please let him go.

517
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:45,769
Shouldn't Ryu play for you?

518
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,289
I'm at your mercy now.

519
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,360
You can do anything to me.

520
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,199
I'm begging you.

521
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:54,289
Just let him go.

522
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,559
You're begging me?

523
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,920
Do you think my basketball
gambling den needs him that much?

524
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,599
Huh? Q?

525
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:04,960
I...

526
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,000
I don't need him anymore.

527
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,519
Boss, no!

528
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,119
Ryu!

529
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,679
Boss, don't!

530
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:51,039
Is this really okay, Q?

531
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:54,360
Shut your face,

532
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,360
and stay out of my business.

533
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,199
I can handle things myself.

534
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,159
But you saved us.

535
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,329
You have to come with us.

536
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,360
I'm a murderer now.

537
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,239
I don't think I can come with you.

538
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,639
No, Q.

539
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,360
You have to.

540
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,519
We promised each other,

541
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,639
as brothers,

542
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,289
that we will never
abandon one another.

543
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,679
I think you should

544
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,329
return to where you should be.

545
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,719
My time is up.

546
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,639
But you saved me.

547
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,329
Come with us, Q.

548
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,079
Please...

549
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,360
Listen to me.

550
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,559
Go.

551
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,769
And from now on,

552
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,039
live the life you want to live.

553
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,960
And you have to enjoy every moment.

554
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,559
Do you understand?

555
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,559
Eat three proper meals a day.

556
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,809
You have to eat until you're full,

557
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,119
understand?

558
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,480
Q.

559
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,039
Thank you for everything.

560
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,329
I love you.

561
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,519
He's in your hands now.

562
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:32,769
Q.

563
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Hello, Grandma.

564
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:51,679
Atom, dear.

565
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,639
Has Zen come home?

566
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,960
He has. I'm calling
so you won't be worried.

567
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,360
Did he tell you where he was?

568
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,360
Why did he disappear
all of a sudden?

569
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,960
I didn't ask him.

570
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,920
Elderly people

571
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,679
are happy enough to see
their grandkids come home.

572
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,480
He'll probably tell me
if he wants to.

573
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,000
Okay, Grandma.

574
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:20,920
Thank you for calling me,
keeping me company,

575
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:22,920
and for always worrying about Zen.

576
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,000
It's my pleasure, Grandma.

577
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,119
It's time to go to bed.

578
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,400
Don't forget to keep yourself warm,
or you might catch a cold.

579
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,280
Thank you, Grandma.

580
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:34,840
Goodnight.

581
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:12,840
I'm sorry

582
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,679
for getting you hurt again.

583
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,360
It's not a problem at all.

584
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,679
I'm happy to help.

585
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:28,239
You risked yourself to save me
loads of times too.

586
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,239
Next time,

587
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:34,719
don't risk yourself
like that for me again.

588
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
Do you know

589
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,239
how scared I was seeing you
get beaten up?

590
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:48,239
What if you got really hurt?

591
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:51,400
I'd probably...

592
00:45:57,719 --> 00:45:58,840
I know.

593
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,960
I know you're worried about me.

594
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:33,199
Zen,

595
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,440
I don't want to wait anymore.

596
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,599
I don't know what's
going to happen in the future.

597
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,039
Let's...

598
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,480
take our relationship
to the next level.

599
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:01,559
I don't want to wait any longer.

600
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,719
If something else
happens in the future,

601
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:08,320
let's get through it together.

602
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,519
Mm.

603
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,239
We'll get through it together.

604
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,840
Thanks.

605
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,599
You have to tell me
if there's anything,

606
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,880
understand?

607
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,360
Mm.

608
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,719
They said there's no budget.

609
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,039
We're in the semifinals,
so there are two more games.

610
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,960
- How much money do we need?
- Sixty-thousand?

611
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,440
Holy moly!

612
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:37,960
We have to hurry up
and earn some money,

613
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:39,320
or we won't get to compete.

614
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,159
What can people like us do?

615
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:43,400
- Dunk tanks?
- Bingo!

616
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:45,599
Let's go!

617
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,000
Aren't you going
into the dunk tanks, Ryu? Zen?

618
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:49,199
We want to dunk you.
