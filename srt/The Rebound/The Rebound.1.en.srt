00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,679
- Ryu?
- Zen?

2
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,250
Hey, Ryu! Settle your debt first!

3
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,450
- Come with me!
- What?

4
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,619
Ryu, where are you taking me?

5
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,560
You'll find out soon enough.

6
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,689
What's up with you?

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
I said stop!

8
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,299
Stop, Ryu!

9
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,929
Come back and settle
your debt with the boss!

10
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,579
What were you doing
with those people?

11
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,480
My customers' coffee. All gone.

12
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,849
And my shirt.

13
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,689
What are you doing?

14
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,659
I got your shirt dirty. Are you
going to go back to work like that?

15
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,090
Yes.

16
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Take yours off and wear mine.

17
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,099
There's no need!

18
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,400
Take it already.

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,269
Where are you going now?

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,209
And will we get to see each other
again? Ryu?

21
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,980
Oh? Ryu!

What are you guys doing?
Get your head in the game.

27
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,699
Hello, Boss.

28
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,959
Did a lot of suckers
show up tonight?

29
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,970
Exceeded expectations, Boss

30
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,199
Good.

31
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:25,970
Tell Ryu to lose believably.

32
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,939
I want to lure in a lot of suckers.

33
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,319
Hey, you know what
you have to do tonight.

34
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,970
Foul.

35
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,279
Ryu, get up!

36
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:07,379
Come on!

40
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,160
Darn it. We lost again.

41
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,660
Coach, why didn't you send in a sub?

42
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,100
They're playing rough.
We're getting injured out there.

43
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,529
Who can I send in as a substitute?

44
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,230
Don't you see? All of your seniors
have gone missing.

45
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,269
But they played all
of their starters.

46
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,740
How could you send in
all of our reserves?

47
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,839
It's okay.

48
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:25,110
No one's expecting
our team to win anyway.

49
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:26,410
Easy-peasy.

50
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,819
Coach, Zen, something happened.

51
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,919
Hey, get up!

52
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,720
Right. Check it carefully.

53
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,759
Is the game over, Coach?

54
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:39,889
Over?

55
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,929
You and I are going to be game over.

56
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,100
What do you mean?

57
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,629
Someone took a video of you guys
and shared it online.

58
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,029
Who was that?

59
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,440
Didn't I tell you to quit?

60
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:55,740
I'm sorry, Coach.

61
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:56,840
Coach.

62
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:58,779
Oh no.

63
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,240
Yes, Director?

64
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,679
How could you let this happen?

65
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,950
If you don't care
about your reputation,

66
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,289
then think about the school crest
on your uniforms.

67
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,320
- Sir.
- This is the third time

68
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:11,860
you let something like this happen.

69
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:19,129
I'm sorry.

70
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,100
What should we do, Zen?

71
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,500
This is bad.

72
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
I've handled it.

73
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:29,269
I'll inform you of the details
at the next school board meeting.

74
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:35,850
Director.

75
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,320
Will our team get to compete again?

76
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:43,690
That's enough, Zen.
We have no chance of winning.

77
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,460
Please give us another chance, sir.

78
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,129
Sir?

79
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,870
Sir?

80
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,289
Are you Lin from the journalist club?

81
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,129
Did you share a clip
of our club again?

82
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,100
Why would you do that?

83
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,639
I did it for justice.

84
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:34,610
Your club got a massive cut
of the school budget.

85
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:38,110
It's obvious you guys are
just doing it for fun.

86
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,009
It's totally unfair
to the other clubs.

87
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,450
Have you ever seen us play?

88
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,950
Have you?

89
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,659
If you haven't,
go and watch the clip.

90
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,360
Then come back and tell me

91
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:56,129
if we play

92
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,559
just for fun like you think.

93
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,240
- Welcome to Café for All.
- Welcome to Café for All.

94
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,409
Please take a seat.
Someone will take your order.

95
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,480
That's right. And have you
finished the previous order?

96
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,620
- All done. It's been delivered.
- Are you sure?

97
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,289
Zen, pick up the pace.

98
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,120
I'm sorry I'm late.

99
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,490
It's okay.

100
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:30,330
Only two minutes late.
They won't dock your part-time pay.

101
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,330
Wait for me for a second.
I have a delivery job for you.

102
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,429
Here. Two iced lattes

103
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,200
- and two americanos. Get to it.
- Sure.

104
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,370
How many points were you down by?

105
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,710
Eighteen.

106
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:47,679
You're making that drama face again.

107
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,179
You can still try again next time.

108
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,679
There probably won't be a next time.

109
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,549
How come?

110
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,720
Zen, here.

111
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Give it to me.

112
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,330
Hang in there.

113
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,169
Okay.

114
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,139
Chaokhun, are you done?
The customers are waiting.

115
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,340
Here, Zen. Deliver these.

116
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,440
- Sure.
- Two americanos, 8th Street.

117
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,139
You can save on gas and walk there.

118
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,379
- It's close.
- Okay.

119
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,710
Go on. Quickly now.

120
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,070
Ryu, I know you're in there!
Open up!

121
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,679
He's not here.

122
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,720
You two, go after him.

123
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,049
We'll ambush him downstairs.

124
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,690
- Okay.
- Let's go!

125
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,159
Hey, Ryu!

126
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:45,899
Stop!

127
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,769
Hey!

128
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Ryu!

129
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,340
Hey, Ryu! I said stop!

130
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,009
Come on!

131
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,149
- Ryu?
- Zen?

132
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,690
Watch where you're going.
You spilled my coffee.

133
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,129
- Come with me!
- What?

134
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,129
Come on!

135
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,330
Ryu, where are you taking me?

136
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,330
You'll find out soon enough.

137
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:02,940
What's up with you?

138
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,379
I said stop!

139
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,879
Stop, Ryu!

140
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,409
Come back and settle
your debt with the boss!

141
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,960
What were you doing
with those people?

142
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:25,159
My customers' coffee. All gone.

143
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,429
And my shirt.

144
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,440
What are you doing?

145
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,639
I got your shirt dirty.

146
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,370
Are you going to
go back to work like that?

147
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,840
Yes.

148
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,509
Take yours off and wear mine.

149
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,080
- There's no need!
- Take it already.

150
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,080
Where are you going now?

151
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,950
And will we get to see each other
again? Ryu?

152
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,690
Oh? Ryu?

153
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:26,789
Welcome to Café for All.

154
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Hi.

155
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,899
Oh? Is this your first time here?
I've never seen you before.

156
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,340
Yes, I recently moved into the area.

157
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,870
I saw the cafe,
so I decided to drop by.

158
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,269
Well then. Drop by often.
You're always welcome here.

159
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,840
Thank you, uh...

160
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,309
It's Golf. And you are?

161
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,480
I'm Atom.

162
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,610
Atom?

163
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:53,649
That's a cute name for a cute face.

164
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:55,149
Thank you.

165
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,519
So, what would you
like to order today?

166
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,789
I'll take an orange americano.

167
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:01,889
- Orange americano.
- Yes.

168
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,400
Great. Grab a seat,
and I'll bring it to you.

169
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,130
- Okay.
- Thank you.

170
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,680
(Dad: I've enrolled you
in a new school.)

171
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:21,650
(Don't disappoint me.)

172
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,789
Golf, I'm so sorry!

173
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,930
All of the coffee you asked me
to deliver got spilled.

174
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,799
Can you make some more?

175
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,329
I'm sorry.

176
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,230
Oh, all right.
Deliver these instead.

177
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,599
Huh?

178
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,640
- You already made them?
- Yes.

179
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,440
Why so quick?

180
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,240
A customer came by
and paid just now.

181
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,650
He said he bumped into
an employee here.

182
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,180
So we thought he meant you.

183
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,920
He looked like a bad boy
but was also super cool.

184
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,250
He wasn't wearing a shirt either.

185
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,920
And where is he now?

186
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,019
He left.

187
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,559
Can you hold onto these for a bit?

188
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,730
Zen?

189
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:22,430
Grandma, I told you to wait.

190
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,400
It's okay. I'll manage.

191
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,410
That's enough. You're going to
hurt yourself again, Grandma.

192
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,609
It's all right.

193
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,650
Are you making Khao Tom Mat?

194
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,710
Yes, I received an order
from a customer.

195
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,349
You should get something to eat.

196
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,349
Then you can finish your homework.

197
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,960
You've had a long day.

198
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,460
It's okay.

199
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,089
Let me help you first.

200
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
All right.

201
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,589
And will we get to see each other
again? Ryu?

202
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:11,069
(Journalist Club)

203
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:48,579
(Q: What's wrong, Ryu? Are you
safe? Reply back. I'm your brother.)

204
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,819
And what have you been up to?

205
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,450
Why is your shirt ripped?

206
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,450
It got snagged by some wire.

207
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,160
You don't have to do it for me.

208
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:35,259
I'll ask one of my neighbors
to sew it for me.

209
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:38,930
Hey, it's okay. I can do it.

210
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,359
Then you won't have to pay for it.

211
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,839
Where did you buy the patch?

212
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,970
I bought it ages ago.

213
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:49,369
I was going to put it on my shirt.

214
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,809
But it's okay.

215
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,079
I'll let you have this one.

216
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Mm.

217
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,160
I don't usually do this for anyone.

218
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,759
Whiner.

219
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,930
Ryu,

220
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,059
let's become middle-school
champions together.

221
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:53,759
Ton.

222
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,970
Same as usual.

223
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:01,970
Fix any computers
that aren't working properly.

224
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:04,539
Let me know if any of them
are in really bad shape.

225
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:06,009
I'll send them to the service center.

226
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,640
Leave it to me, Director.

227
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,619
- Did you...
- Save it.

228
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,890
Just save it.

229
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:18,690
What? If you sniff me again,
I'll smack you.

230
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,589
Does your daughter know
you've been drinking this early?

231
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,160
So what, Aun?

232
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,970
Shut your big mouth. A single drink
won't affect my performance.

233
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,799
Don't you have work to do, sir?

234
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
- Away with you.
- All right.

235
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,009
So who's going to coach us now?

236
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
No idea.

237
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,150
I don't even know if there's still
going to be a basketball club.

238
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,049
That's all I have to say.

239
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
What do we do?

240
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,059
We should probably go.

241
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,529
Come on.

242
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,690
What's the matter, Zen?

243
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,589
Director,

244
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,430
how did it feel to be
a legendary six-time champion?

245
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,170
It was uber awesome.

246
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:15,410
It was the best feeling ever.

247
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,809
I want to experience
that feeling too, sir.

248
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,720
But all of the seniors on the team
have been expelled.

249
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,450
Your coach's been let go as well.

250
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,660
I'm afraid everything's...

251
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,789
I know, sir.

252
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,190
But the game has to go on.

253
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,630
Can you please
give us another chance?

254
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:45,640
Please, club alumnus?

255
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,650
So? What did the director say?

256
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,450
He told me to find ten club members.

257
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,549
Then he'll allow
the club to continue.

258
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,490
What? Don't we need
twelve to compete?

259
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,990
That's right.

260
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,130
But we have to establish
a club first, don't we?

261
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,759
We can worry about that later.

262
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:17,299
Would anyone want to sign up though?

263
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,339
Our reputation's gone
down the drain.

264
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,769
We still have to try.

265
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,039
We already have three members.
We're only seven short.

266
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,750
This is the journalist club's fault.
That's why we're in this mess.

267
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,779
(Zen is so good,
and he's only in the 11th grade.)

268
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,450
(I thought he was the team captain.)

269
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,750
Oh, what have I done?

270
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,119
What would you like to order today?

271
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,519
Uh...

272
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:16,390
I'll have...

273
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,730
an iced cocoa, less sweet.

274
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,400
Is that all for today?

275
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,740
All right. Please have a seat.

276
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,339
I'll bring it to your table.

277
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,730
Dad!

278
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:52,799
What?

279
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,599
What are you doing?
I said I'd deal with it.

280
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,329
It's okay. I'll wash it for you.

281
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:02,210
What? I said I'd do it myself.
I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.

282
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,440
Lin, what's the problem? I've been
doing it since you were little.

283
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:06,640
So why can't I do it for you now?

284
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,779
And look at this. Here.

285
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,680
It's full of holes,
yet you're still wearing it.

286
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:15,549
How about this? I'll buy you some
new ones after I get paid.

287
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,349
There's no need, Dad.
It's still wearable.

288
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,960
Do you know how much
a bra cost these days?

289
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:22,730
I'll just keep wearing this.

290
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:24,460
Aren't you even embarrassed?

291
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:30,170
Come on. Let's go and eat.

292
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:40,509
The electric bill's here.
It's on the table.

293
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,980
And if you want me to pay rent,

294
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,480
just leave the money somewhere.
I'll go and do it.

295
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:49,450
Ugh, you're so bossy.
Who do you take after?

296
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,390
Are basketball players all the same?

297
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,559
So quick-tempered.

298
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,900
Former. I'm a former
basketball player.

299
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,200
But who did you mean specifically?

300
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,970
- Dad.
- Hm?

301
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,339
If I've done something
with good intentions

302
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,109
and ended up ruining
someone else's dream,

303
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,049
how do you think
I should feel about it?

304
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,089
Well...

305
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,730
Life has to go on, I guess.

306
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,160
There's nothing else
we can do about it.

307
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:43,640
And why do I feel
so horrible about it?

308
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,720
(Basketball Club
Accepting New Members At Tryouts)

309
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:07,960
Jed, why are you walking around?

310
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,430
I'm just copying you.

311
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:11,400
You guys should stop pacing.

312
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,140
You're making me dizzy.

313
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,240
I want to sign up for the club.

314
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,079
What do you want?

315
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:28,519
Well, you told me to watch the clip.

316
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,750
So I did.

317
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,089
And you guys actually did your best.

318
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,559
But we're looking
for male basketball players.

319
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,230
Sure. You guys can keep competing.

320
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,799
I'm signing up
to be the team manager.

321
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,970
- What?
- What?

322
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,240
I've resigned
from the journalist club.

323
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,809
But I need to be a member
of a club to graduate.

324
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,539
Anyway, please accept me.

325
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,250
But we don't know if the club's
going to survive or not.

326
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:01,950
And you probably know

327
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:03,720
why that might be the case.

328
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:13,359
Is this where I can sign up
for the basketball club?

329
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:35,450
This is Tle. He's from my class.

330
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,849
He's pretty good.

331
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,660
And this is Prince.
He's popular with the ladies.

332
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,289
But he's too much of a bookworm
to pay any attention to them.

333
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,730
This is Puth.

334
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,200
He's a bit hot-headed.

335
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:49,329
And this is Mai.

336
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,329
He's like a sturdy tree
on the court.

337
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,539
He's like a tree but probably
still better than you, First.

338
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:56,869
Jerk.

339
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:04,250
That's eleven.

340
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,650
How many do we need
to keep the club going?

341
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,320
Ten.

342
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,719
- Eleven?
- Eleven?

343
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,719
We get to keep the club!

344
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,260
We did it!

345
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,670
Everyone, practice starts tomorrow.

346
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,170
- Yes, Captain!
- Yes, Captain!

347
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,449
Go! Go! Go!

348
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,320
Move! Move! Move!

349
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:44,519
Go! Go! Go!

350
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,030
What's up with you guys?

351
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,139
Oops.

352
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,119
Are we going to be okay, Zen?

353
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,500
Of course. We have to be.

354
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,800
Don't we have
to submit the names soon?

355
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:31,300
We still haven't found 12 players.

356
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:33,239
We'll get to compete, won't we?

357
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:35,539
For sure.

358
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,239
We'll find a way.

359
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,179
You're running practice

360
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,650
for your teammates right now.

361
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:47,079
Do you get to practice
on your own as well?

362
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:49,619
I'll have to wait
until they go home.

363
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:51,449
Then I'll practice on my own.

364
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:53,920
Are you sure you're up for it?

365
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:57,389
Of course.

366
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,559
This is what we have to do for now

367
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:02,000
until the school can
find us a new coach.

368
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:05,369
The school's going
to find us a new coach?

369
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,539
They'd probably rather disband us.

370
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:19,679
Sir?

371
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,250
Yes, Zen?

372
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,789
Is something the matter?

373
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,590
We need a coach, sir.

374
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,309
Ton,

375
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:46,880
the school board wants to turn

376
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,780
the basketball club
into a computer room.

377
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:51,880
That's good.
I'll have more work to do.

378
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,119
But the kids need a coach
for the district playoffs.

379
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:57,690
What does that have to do with me?

380
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:01,619
It doesn't. But I want you
to train the team.

381
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,159
Aun, you know I quit
basketball for good.

382
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,030
I don't want you to play.
I want you to coach the team.

383
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,929
The board only gave
one year to the club,

384
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:16,210
so I want the legend
of our school's basketball club

385
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:18,239
to have a happy ending.

386
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,909
Are you going
to lie to the kids again?

387
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:23,179
You know basketball
doesn't help with anything.

388
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,010
I'm not going to lie to them.

389
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,119
I'm trying to give them a choice.

390
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,519
Okay.

391
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:32,090
No, I won't do it.

392
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,389
You can find someone else.

393
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,119
Think about it first.

394
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:36,929
No rush.

395
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:40,760
You'll get a salary as the coach.

396
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,199
I heard your shop hasn't
been doing so well lately.

397
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,809
I'll manage.

398
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,210
Gosh. That was a three-pointer.

399
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,389
- Is that true, Dad?
- Mm.

400
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:07,019
I thought he called me over
to discuss fixing the computers.

401
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,630
But it turns out it was
something nonsensical.

402
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:13,400
You should reconsider.

403
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,400
It's perfect for you.

404
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:18,969
Besides, you haven't played in ages.

405
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,239
I'll pass.

406
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,969
If you don't help us,

407
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,039
our club's going to be in bad shape.

408
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:33,119
Lin, don't tell me you're
part of the basketball club.

409
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,789
Well...

410
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:37,619
yes.

411
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:42,489
Lin, didn't I tell you to join
anything but the basketball club?

412
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:44,530
Well, I want to be in the club.

413
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,159
You can hate on it all by yourself.

414
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,230
Why would you
force me to hate it too?

415
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,840
Where are you going now?

416
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,940
I'm going to buy
some dish soap. We're out.

417
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,909
Lin?

418
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:18,559
Look out!

419
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,800
Are you Ryu?

420
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,139
You know me?

421
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
Of course.

422
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,940
The mysterious, good-looking guy
everyone's looking for

423
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,449
and wondering
if he's still in school.

424
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,980
I wrote this article online
for the journalist club.

425
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:44,389
So you're the one who cut
the legendary basketball club short?

426
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,190
Am I that notorious?

427
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,789
I haven't been to school,
and even I know about it.

428
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,590
Ryu.

429
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,460
Anyway, I should keep playing.

430
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,239
Let's do it.

431
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,050
"I've left for school. Enjoy."

432
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:44,409
Okay.

433
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:57,190
Hello? Yes, Director? This is early.

434
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,139
How much do I get paid
each month as the coach?

435
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,710
Everyone.

436
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:15,210
- Yes, Director?
- Yes, Director?

437
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:21,820
This is Coach Ton.

438
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,050
He's going to coach our team.

439
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Excuse me?

440
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:34,699
Isn't he the computer guy?

441
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,369
That's it!

442
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,400
This computer guy is
going to be your coach!

443
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,170
Your guy did
quite a number on me, Q.

444
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:13,840
I'm sorry, Boss.

445
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,239
There was a bit of miscommunication.

446
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,079
A bit?

447
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,179
Do you know how many millions

448
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:30,420
that "a bit" cost me?

449
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,090
Do you?

450
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:34,590
I'm sorry, Boss.

451
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,090
I won't let that happen again.

452
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,110
Are you going to take responsibility
for him every single time?

453
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,320
I don't know.

454
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,380
What's on the director's mind?

455
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,650
Why is he letting
the computer guy coach us?

456
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,650
It's such an insult.

457
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,989
- Do you have any money on you?
- No!

458
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,159
- Give me your money!
- Let go of me!

459
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,389
- First, I have to hang up.
- Open the bag!

460
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,329
- Come on!
- I said I don't have any!

461
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:14,530
What are you doing?

462
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,630
How is this any of your business?

463
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:16,829
What are you doing to her?

464
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,670
Stay out of this!

465
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,650
You punk!

466
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:38,320
Hey, you!

467
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:40,659
Jerk!

468
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,329
Here.

469
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:45,429
Wait up!

470
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,460
Are you hurt?

471
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,599
I'm okay.

472
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:55,969
Thank you and your friend
for helping me.

473
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:58,570
Otherwise, they would've
taken all of my money.

474
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,010
It's all right.

475
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,110
Anyway, you should hurry home.

476
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,210
I will.

477
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:19,599
(Hurry over, Zen.
There are a lot of orders.)

478
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,429
Head southwest.

479
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,059
I've sorted things out
with Boss Tos.

480
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,460
I'm not going to rig the game.

481
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,159
If I'm going to lose,
I'll lose on my own.

482
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,929
What on earth are you saying?

483
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,070
You have to follow the boss' orders.

484
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,639
You know I'm here today
thanks to him.

485
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:02,039
But not me.

486
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:04,340
Ryu,

487
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:07,210
do you need to see me
getting beat up by them

488
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,679
before you give in?

489
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:11,650
This is not basketball.

490
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,550
This is the real deal!

491
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:25,559
Just be prepared for your next game.

492
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:27,500
And I'll let you know

493
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:30,300
if you should win or lose.

494
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:41,480
Hey!

495
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,260
Apart from being
a basketball player,

496
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,960
and a cafe worker,

497
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,530
you're also a secret agent?

498
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:04,869
A secret agent?
What are you on about?

499
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:07,000
Get out of my way.
I have coffee to deliver.

500
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,099
Did you overhear anything?

501
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:14,639
What did you want me to hear?

502
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,449
Just keep your mouth shut.

503
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,449
You rescued me
earlier today, didn't you?

504
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,860
I recognize your helmet
and motorbike.

505
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:31,960
What are you talking about?

506
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,699
Ryu.

507
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:39,599
Is this really the life
you've chosen?

508
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,570
It's easy for you to say.

509
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,510
How can you possibly know?

510
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,980
As for basketball,

511
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:53,119
are you going to
let someone tell you

512
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,590
to win or lose a game?

513
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,219
Shut your mouth.

514
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,460
Seriously,

515
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,659
who are you

516
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,130
playing basketball for these days?

517
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:33,989
PF. The one in control of the game
who also scores.

518
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,019
I don't know who to pick
from our lineup.

519
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:40,030
Dad! Here's the power forward
you've been looking for.

520
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:43,230
I'm Atom.

521
00:47:43,329 --> 00:47:45,000
Do you like swimming?

522
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,800
No, I'm working part-time here.

523
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:49,610
You know I'll never

524
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:51,440
abandon my people,

525
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,010
even if they can't play.

526
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,909
Go and get him.

527
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,449
- Hey!
- What?

528
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:57,679
Can you substitute for my friend?

529
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,010
You'll get 2,000 baht if we win.

530
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,179
Come on.
