1
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,119
What did I ever do to you?

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,820
You didn't.

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,820
But you caused a rift
between me and my person.

4
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,399
I think you should stay put.

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,500
I have a proposition for you.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,070
Let Ryu come back
to where he should be.

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,609
Unless you want me
to beat you up

8
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,340
to the point where you'll never
be able to play again.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,250
Actually, I changed my mind.

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,119
I don't want to beat you up anymore.

11
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,450
I'm going to

12
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,119
cut your wrist with this

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,729
and you won't be able to play
for the rest of your life.

14
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:01,930
(The Rebound)

15
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:05,000
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

16
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,909
Hey!

17
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,280
Which one should I start with?

18
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,919
Maybe the right.

19
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,150
It's probably
your dominant side. Is that okay?

20
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,120
Zen! Zen!

21
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,469
Take him away.

22
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,930
Darn it! Who called the cops?

23
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,860
Let's go, Q.

24
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,460
- Come on.
- All right!

25
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,800
Zen, are you okay?

26
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,409
Atom? How did you get here?

27
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,210
Untie me.

28
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,159
Zen!

29
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,990
Zen?

30
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,600
Zen, drink some water.

31
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,410
Rest for a bit,
then I'll take you home.

32
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,649
Thanks so much, Atom.

33
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,860
I don't know how I'd be

34
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,959
if you hadn't shown up like that.

35
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,589
It's okay.

36
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,560
Consider us even.

37
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:57,170
Well, we saved each other's lives.

38
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,370
Atom, you know it's nothing
compared to what you did.

39
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,410
I misjudged the situation back then.

40
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,250
But this one?

41
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,889
Are you scared?

42
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,160
Yes.

43
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
But I wasn't scared of
something happening to me.

44
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,370
If something did happen to me,

45
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,699
who's going to take care of Grandma?

46
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,550
It's okay. I'm here now.

47
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,629
Zen?

48
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:00,470
Why didn't you tell me
you'd be home late?

49
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I was so worried.
You didn't answer my calls either.

50
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,139
I'm so sorry, Grandma.

51
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,110
We had so many customers today

52
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,709
that I switched my phone to silent.

53
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,550
- I'm sorry.
- It's good you're home.

54
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:28,660
Why aren't you answering?

55
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,230
Is it a scammer?

56
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,370
Hello?

57
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,639
I'm out front. Can you come out?

58
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,519
Huh? Did you...

59
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,889
Your face...

60
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,759
I'm okay.

61
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,060
They didn't do
anything to you, did they?

62
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,230
They kidnapped me.
I guess they didn't?

63
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,829
Why didn't you go to the police?

64
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
I was worried that if I did,

65
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,470
you'd get in trouble as well.

66
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,750
I want our team
to compete in the next game,

67
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,250
and that includes you.

68
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,389
Darn it! Why did they
have to go that far?

69
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:34,860
- Shoot!
- Hey, calm down!

70
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,899
I'm fine.

71
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,699
I'm here now.

72
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:45,240
I'm sorry. I'm the reason
why you're in this mess.

73
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,870
Stop blaming yourself.

74
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,910
You didn't cause any of this.

75
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,980
So what are we going to do now?

76
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:02,089
Just live your life as usual.

77
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,420
I'll sort those guys out.

78
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,019
I promise

79
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,829
I won't cause our team any problems.

80
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,399
You can rest assured, Captain.

81
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,370
Here, Q. Cheers.

82
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,079
Q!

83
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,519
It's okay.

84
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,889
You...

85
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
- Hey!
- Hey!

86
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,429
Do it again.

87
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,000
Just kill me already.

88
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,600
What are you waiting for?

89
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:29,769
Hey!

90
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,080
Stay away from me!

91
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,720
If I hadn't found you lying there
on the brink of death,

92
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,950
I wouldn't have wasted
my time rescuing you.

93
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,049
Moron.

94
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,289
Eat up.

95
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,360
I'm not going to poison you.

96
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,700
Take this medicine
after you're done eating.

97
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,340
Darn it!

98
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,409
Why did you do it?

99
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,049
Stay away from Zen.

100
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,549
I won't let it slide next time!

101
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,389
Do you have feelings for him?

102
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:08,210
Are you going to just let him go?

103
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,190
Bye, Grandma!

104
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,240
Oh? Why are you here so early?

105
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:48,909
I'm coming to school with you.

106
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,919
What about your motorbike?

107
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,820
I'll park it here.

108
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,789
I can pick it up later tonight.

109
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,990
What's up with you?

110
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,789
I'm...

111
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:02,289
I'm worried those guys might
come back to harass you again.

112
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,200
I don't want you to get hurt
because of me again, understand?

113
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,470
Okay.

114
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,759
Ugh!

115
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:34,960
Hurry up and start driving, Captain.

116
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,460
You're holding onto me too tight.

117
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,230
I can't breathe.

118
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,669
It's time to go.

119
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,129
- Boo!
- Hey!

120
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,399
What are you playing at?
You startled me!

121
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,070
I was just saying hi.
You're so easily spooked.

122
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,070
Is that your breakfast?

123
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,440
Or are you planning
on giving it to someone?

124
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,269
Nosy.

125
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,840
Can I see it?

126
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,350
No.

127
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,960
Why did Ryu come with Zen?

128
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,090
I know, right?

129
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:46,299
They used to be very close.

130
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,429
But Ryu suddenly disappeared.

131
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,700
I don't know
what happened between them.

132
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Really?

133
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,500
Mm.

134
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,009
Here. Put this away
for me. Thank you.

135
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,279
I'm always doing the work.

136
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:11,389
Right, you have to work at the cafe
after practice, don't you?

137
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,029
No, I have to go home and help
my grandma make desserts today.

138
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,759
Well then. I'm coming with you.

139
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,899
Why would you?

140
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:23,169
Are you trying to make it up to me?

141
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,570
That's it. I'll see you at practice.

142
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,039
Here.

143
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,679
You're so self-centered.

144
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,080
Scoot over, won't you?

145
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,220
Oh?

146
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:42,450
Quit pushing.

147
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,399
What are you up to, Ton?

148
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,840
Wow,

149
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,340
you're here early, Director.

150
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,379
I'm the director,
I can go wherever I want.

151
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,279
You've got a point.

152
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,879
You've formed
a whole team, haven't you?

153
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,279
Mhm.

154
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,519
Do you think these kids
have a chance to qualify?

155
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,659
Do you want the truth
or something idealistic?

156
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,129
If you want the truth,

157
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,759
a non-embarrassing defeat
should be enough.

158
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,799
Oh.

159
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,899
But don't forget this, Director.

160
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,100
I expect to be paid in full
once the project wraps up.

161
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,210
Ryu is so hot-headed.

162
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:43,250
He always gets into fights with Zen.

163
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,679
And not just with Zen.
He can't get along with anyone else.

164
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,120
- Is that so?
- Mm.

165
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,860
So what are you going to do?

166
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,860
I think

167
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,629
these kids need to be taught
a few tricks.

168
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,299
What's wrong with you?

169
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,669
You seem to be doing well.

170
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,370
You're not wearing
alcohol-scented perfume anymore.

171
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,679
I have to go now.

172
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,509
They used to be on the same
basketball team in middle school.

173
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,419
They even made it to the finals.

174
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,889
(Missed Out
On the Champion of the Year)

175
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,590
Why isn't Ryu in this photo?

176
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,230
What actually happened?

177
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,509
(Class 1 Grade 10)

178
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,579
Here. You solve
that problem this way.

179
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,750
L equals 32 feet, right?

180
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,519
And W is what you have to find out.

181
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,319
Put L into the equation,

182
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,289
and you'll get W equals 0.0016.

183
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,890
Multiply by 32 to the power of 12,
and divide by five.

184
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:40,400
Factorize it, and you'll get 0.0016.

185
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,369
Multiply by two to the power of five

186
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,200
and to the power of 12,
divide by five.

187
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:47,539
The factors cancel each other out.
Five cancels out five.

188
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,410
And you'll get 0.0016
multiplied by 12 to the power of 12

189
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:55,309
equals 0.0016 multiplied by 4,096.

190
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,750
And the answer to this problem
is that the whale weighs

191
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:00,450
6.5536 tons in total.

192
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,660
No need to thank me.
I'm happy to help.

193
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,029
I thought you were only good
at being a big mouth.

194
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,829
And what happened to your face?

195
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,799
I beat up a busybody.

196
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:26,279
He just got here
and is already a cool kid.

197
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:30,410
Maybe he's really going to
help our team out?

198
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,430
So?

199
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,930
If it's the rebound,
you can trust me.

200
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,700
Mai, you really are like a tree.

201
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,160
- A log?
- Jerk.

202
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,329
No, he's a toothpick.

203
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,799
Hey!

204
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,539
Can you guys take this seriously?

205
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,410
The game is less than
two weeks away!

206
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,440
- Yes, Team Manager!
- Yes, Team Manager!

207
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,190
Zen,

208
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,529
do you know what happened
to Ryu's face?

209
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
No idea.

210
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,230
If he didn't pick a fight with
someone, then it's the opposite.

211
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,799
That's it.

212
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,750
Huddle up!

213
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,779
I want to see the basics.

214
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,549
Just the simple ones.

215
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,390
A thousand dribbles on each side.

216
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,190
Only a thousand?
Isn't that like for kids?

217
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,029
For kids?
Oh, you want the adult way?

218
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,559
Give me double.

219
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,730
All right. We'll start
with the right side. Go!

220
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,740
Get lower.

221
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:07,309
Don't let the ball go higher
than your knees.

222
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:10,250
Get even lower.

223
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:12,579
Ugh.

224
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,220
All right. Switch to the left!

225
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,089
Bend your knees more! Go on.

226
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,230
Let's stop, Coach.

227
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,630
It's a waste of time.

228
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,400
Okay, okay.

229
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,809
You don't like dribbles? All right.

230
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:38,839
Well then.

231
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:41,279
Drop to the floor
and get ready for push-ups.

232
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:42,980
Down!

233
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,380
- Dad.
- Get me some ice, won't you?

234
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,589
Get ready!

235
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:58,700
Oh? You don't like push-ups either?

236
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,759
Maybe you prefer to loiter
in the streets?

237
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,670
Get ready!

238
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:11,980
Go!

239
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,750
Go lower.

240
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,390
Prince, can you turn on the shower
for me? I can't lift my arms.

241
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:31,960
Use your legs instead, dummy.

242
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,869
- You asked for it.
- Come on.

243
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,599
What's all the fuss?

244
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,299
Move over.

245
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:40,269
What? Why did you smack me?

246
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:43,109
Nice. That's much better.

247
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,039
Took you long enough.

248
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,309
Put soap on my back then.
The soap's over there.

249
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:50,349
Just use this one.

250
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:53,920
Is Coach Ton really a coach?

251
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,650
Instead of doing drills,

252
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,859
somehow we ended up
just dribbling for hours.

253
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,259
Right? It's almost game day.

254
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,359
I know. We probably left
dents in the gym floor.

255
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,529
He's so brutal.

256
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,829
Take it easy. He has his ways.

257
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,869
Maybe he's just trying
to get it over with.

258
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,869
He's always drunk. How is he
going to be able to teach anyone?

259
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,039
True that.

260
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,380
And do we even have a choice?

261
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:25,279
Just give him a chance.

262
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,279
Let's put up with it
for the sake of the team.

263
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,529
Dad,

264
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,160
what do you have in mind
for training?

265
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,059
Can you tell me

266
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,230
so I can explain it
to the rest of the team?

267
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,369
What for?

268
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:48,710
The other should know
about it, shouldn't they?

269
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:53,279
Seriously though.
Shouldn't we start planning now?

270
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,880
It's almost game day.

271
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:57,680
Lin, I have my ways.

272
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,579
If they think they're so good,
then let them train on their own.

273
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,619
Go on. It's time to go home.

274
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,359
I'll stay behind so I can...

275
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,690
come up with a training plan?

276
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,160
I hope so.

277
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,759
Don't let me catch you
drinking again.

278
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,730
I'm going.

279
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,279
Ryu.

280
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:38,289
You shouldn't make the others
think negatively about the coach.

281
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,089
Don't you?

282
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,789
Well, I do.

283
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:44,460
But I don't think it's
the right time to be saying that.

284
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,160
We have to keep
the team's spirit up.

285
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,470
You're so overly optimistic.

286
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,140
Can you at least try to understand
the team's circumstance?

287
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,279
Last time,

288
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,279
you and Ryu caused me so much pain.

289
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,019
Do you remember that?

290
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,220
Ryu was sick, Boss.

291
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:16,329
He'll come back and work for you
once he's recovered.

292
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,839
Chances usually come
to people with luck on their side.

293
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,079
Let's test your luck, shall we?

294
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,329
One,

295
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,130
two,

296
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,240
three.

297
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:08,849
You're a lucky one.

298
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,079
If Ryu flakes out
at the next game,

299
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:16,549
you'll find out
not even luck can save you.

300
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:38,309
You can go now.

301
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,650
I told you I'd help
your grandmom make desserts.

302
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:43,109
I still haven't
given you permission.

303
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,079
It's okay.
I can give myself permission.

304
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,990
And I know Grandma's going to
give me permission too.

305
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,690
But she's my grandma.

306
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,619
Mm. So?

307
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:03,799
That's too big.

308
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:05,569
- Like this?
- Not too small either,

309
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,599
- or they'll say we...
- Oh? Atom?

310
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,869
What's up, Zen?

311
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,210
Oh.

312
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,410
Why are you home early?
Don't you have practice today?

313
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,380
We finished early.

314
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:20,980
- But what's...
- Atom's been helping me

315
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,920
to get around,

316
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,819
and he's helping me
make desserts as well.

317
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:27,059
He also told me he knows you.

318
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,589
You've got quite a good friend.

319
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:37,930
Ryu? Is that you?

320
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,369
Hello, Grandma.

321
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,140
He tagged along.

322
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,740
I tried to send him away,
but he wouldn't leave.

323
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,140
Zen told me you're making desserts.
Please let me help you.

324
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,349
Wow,

325
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,819
I must be very lucky tonight.
So many helpers.

326
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:02,960
I haven't seen you in a while.
You've gotten quite handsome.

327
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:04,829
Thank you, Grandma.

328
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,400
I hope you're doing well?

329
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,599
Yes, I am.

330
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,069
Come visit me
if you have time like you used to.

331
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,799
Don't invite him, Grandma.

332
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:18,339
Sure, Grandma.

333
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,910
I'll come and visit you often.

334
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,410
Please do. You too, Atom.

335
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,519
I will, Grandma.

336
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:28,789
I'll visit you often as well.

337
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,700
Is he a friend of yours, Zen?

338
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:42,329
Mm.

339
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
They've been very close
since they were little.

340
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,869
Used to.

341
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:52,140
Anyway, now that you're back, Ryu,

342
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,349
let's have dinner together.
All of you.

343
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,150
Let me show off my cooking skills.

344
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,519
Grandma!

345
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:01,279
Atom and Ryu might have
somewhere else to be.

346
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,849
They're probably busy.

347
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:04,220
- I'm not.
- I'm not.

348
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:14,519
Shot number 315 didn't score.

349
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:27,240
Shot number 316 scored!

350
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:31,640
Chogun.

351
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:36,349
How come you're still here?
Aren't your parents worried?

352
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,750
You don't have
to worry about me, Coach.

353
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,450
It's Wednesday.
Mom's finishing late.

354
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,549
She's working overtime.

355
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,990
I have 22 minutes left
to play basketball

356
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,529
before the last bus.

357
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,960
All right.

358
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,200
Shot number 317 didn't score.

359
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:06,609
Chogun,

360
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,950
why do you like basketball?

361
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,349
I don't like basketball.

362
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:13,049
I love it.

363
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,490
Basketball is my dream,

364
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,160
and you've made my dream come true.

365
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,160
I won't disappoint you, Coach.

366
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,329
Wait.

367
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,160
Tuck your elbows in.

368
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:28,230
Bend your knees,

369
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:30,170
and follow through
to the tips of your fingers.

370
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,500
Give it a go.

371
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,470
Yes, Coach!

372
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:36,269
Tuck in, bend down...

373
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:42,349
Shot number 319 scored.

374
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,710
Thank you, Coach!

375
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,349
Thank you, Coach.

376
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,890
Chogun,

377
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:56,329
if your mother has to
work overtime again,

378
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,660
let me know. I'll keep you company.

379
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,660
Yes, Coach.

380
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,000
All right. Try again.

381
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:07,799
Beautiful.

382
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,480
Shot number 320.

383
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,180
Wonderful.

384
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:24,190
Thank you, Coach!

385
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:30,160
Here it is. Tom Kha Gai.
It's my very own special recipe.

386
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,599
Whoa, that smells lovely.

387
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,569
It doesn't just smell lovely.
It's very tasty too.

388
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,039
Here. Give it a taste.

389
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,980
Mm! It's delicious, Grandma.

390
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,849
I think I'll be coming over
to eat with you often then.

391
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,950
Come on over. The more people,
the tastier the food.

392
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,289
All right. Let's see.

393
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,930
Has my cooking changed at all?

394
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,069
I don't think so.
It's still as delicious as always.

395
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,200
Then come back for dinner again.

396
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,869
I think you've lost
quite a bit of weight.

397
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:18,940
So eat up.

398
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,710
Okay, Grandma.

399
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:22,910
All right. Dig in!

400
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,250
- Eat up.
- Okay.

401
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,190
Here you go, Zen.

402
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,410
Oh?

403
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,650
Aren't you going to eat that?

404
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:57,710
It's your favorite.

405
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,319
- You can have it.
- It's okay.

406
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,220
It's your favorite as well.

407
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,259
I'm getting full. You can eat it.

408
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,769
You don't have to, Grandma.
I'll wash the dishes.

409
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,539
You can go
and stay with your friends.

410
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:24,440
It's okay. I'll do it.

411
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,809
You already worked hard
cooking for me.

412
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,549
And now you're going
to wash the dishes too?

413
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,119
Zen, have you found out

414
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,289
where Ryu disappeared to back then?

415
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,259
How should I know?

416
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,299
Someone like him? No one knows.

417
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,569
I have no idea what he's thinking.

418
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:03,480
I looked it up.

419
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,519
That clip of yours is going viral.

420
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:07,819
What clip?

421
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,719
A clip of you playing
street basketball for gambling.

422
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:12,989
So?

423
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,159
That's a very risky business.

424
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,699
What are you trying to say?
Just spit it out.

425
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,769
Assume the risk alone.
Don't rope Zen in.

426
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Stay out of it.

427
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,940
Zen was in danger the other night,

428
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,079
and you know why.

429
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:36,579
That's why I have to come
and look after him and Grandma.

430
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,250
Leave that to me.

431
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,949
What's your relation to him?
Why are you butting in?

432
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:47,619
A friend. A good friend.

433
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,900
Zen.

434
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,570
Are you free this Saturday?
Let's go to the movies.

435
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:08,409
Uh...

436
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,980
The movies?

437
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:13,280
I have to work.

438
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,920
We can go after you're done.

439
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,690
My treat.

440
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,219
And you can pay for the popcorn.

441
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,590
Uh, well...

442
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,429
I'll pick you up from the cafe.

443
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:24,960
Okay?

444
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:31,329
I'm leaving.

445
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,320
Just relax.

446
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:51,889
Ready?

447
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,119
Okay.

448
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,000
Why did you take a break
from school for a year?

449
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,070
I got lazy.

450
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,099
Hey, you can't say that.

451
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,639
If you say that, I can't put it
on the club's page.

452
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,070
Well, it's true.

453
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,239
What do you want me to say?

454
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:15,139
Like...

455
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,550
you got sick
and had to receive treatment

456
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:21,079
or that you had to take care
of your parents.

457
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,730
By the way, you're living alone
in an apartment, aren't you?

458
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,030
Mm.

459
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,070
Why did you have
to move out on your own?

460
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,840
Did you get
into an argument with your family?

461
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,280
Well, I saw you playing
street basketball.

462
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,679
That's rather problematic, isn't it?

463
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:56,420
You don't know anything.
Don't just blurt things out.

464
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,719
We're done here.

465
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,789
Then tell me

466
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,730
what actually happened.

467
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,400
Ryu?

468
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,539
Ryu, I'm trying to help you!

469
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,650
I think Coach Ton is sus.

470
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:30,590
- I think so too.
- Right?

471
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,590
He hasn't taught us anything
since he started coaching us.

472
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,429
He just hangs around,
reeking of alcohol.

473
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:40,030
And he keeps ordering us to run.

474
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,599
All those stupid suicide sprints.

475
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,699
Switch.

476
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:46,440
Right?

477
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,139
And he brought in that no-good Ryu.

478
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,079
He let that idiot join the team too.

479
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:56,309
I don't think

480
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,949
our team's going to survive, Zen.

481
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,519
I don't know.

482
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,889
But the fact that
he's telling you guys to run

483
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:08,289
is actually beneficial for us.

484
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:10,460
Go on. It's time to run.

485
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,360
- Ugh, Zen!
- Go.

486
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:14,130
Come on. Get going.

487
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,469
Go. Move.

488
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,239
Let's go.

489
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,340
Quickly, now.

490
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,239
Why are you late?

491
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,010
I was busy.

492
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,980
Don't be late again.
The others are getting mad.

493
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:36,889
Okay.

494
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,190
I won't drag the team down.
Don't worry.

495
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:56,809
Are you going to
keep practicing tonight?

496
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,449
Oh? Why not? Didn't you say
you like basketball?

497
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:04,750
- Coach?
- Hm?

498
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,050
Well,

499
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,750
the team doesn't like me.
They don't seem to like you either.

500
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:15,059
Oh, okay.

501
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:22,570
But please don't
tell them I told you.

502
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:26,039
Okay.

503
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:27,800
Thanks a lot for letting me know.

504
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,170
Go on.

505
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,480
Thank you.

506
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,130
Come in.

507
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:00,269
Coach,

508
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,179
I'd like to consult you
about something.

509
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:07,940
Go ahead.

510
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,349
It's about the drills.

511
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,349
Mhm. What about the drills?

512
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,750
It's just that

513
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:18,920
the drills you've been making us do
haven't helped us get any better.

514
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,860
Okay. You can be quite harsh.

515
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,800
I'd prefer it if you had us
focus on strategic drills.

516
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:30,269
Not run, run, dribble, dribble.
How is that going to help us?

517
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:32,099
Okay.

518
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,570
Okay.

519
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:37,070
If you don't trust me,

520
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,980
then you can train on your own.

521
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,679
But in my opinion,
I don't think you guys are ready.

522
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,150
So when then?

523
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,920
Our next game is less than
two weeks away.

524
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,289
I don't know how serious
you are about this.

525
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:55,090
But competition is everything to me.

526
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,820
I don't like basketball.

527
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:29,389
I love it.

528
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,360
Basketball is my dream,

529
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:35,199
and you've made my dream come true.

530
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,730
I won't disappoint you, Coach.

531
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:58,420
Hello, my dear Director Aun.

532
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,860
What? A team retreat?

533
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:05,630
A retreat to prepare
for our next game.

534
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,699
Didn't you guys say
you wanted to do drills?

535
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,230
Here it is. I got some for you.

536
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:11,199
Oh, and don't worry
about your parents.

537
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:13,340
We've prepared permission slips.

538
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,670
Three days and two nights.

539
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,340
- Three days and two nights?
- Mhm.

540
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,510
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

541
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,179
Come on, Coach.

542
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,880
I have a gaming group to go to.

543
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:24,909
A gaming group?

544
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,550
You can choose between that
and practice.

545
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,920
And let me tell you something.

546
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,349
Anyone who chooses
the former over the retreat

547
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,559
will get kicked out.

548
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,190
And what about the people
who actually can't make it like Zen?

549
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,360
He works part-time.

550
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,000
It's okay. I'll come

551
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,530
if it will to help
the team get better.

552
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,000
Are you sure about that?

553
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:47,099
Yes.

554
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:50,309
See? The captain doesn't
have a problem with it.

555
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:53,239
So what about the rest of you?
Can you make it?

556
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,179
Yes, Coach.

557
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,210
Mm.

558
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,150
- I'll come.
- Sure.

559
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,480
So? What about you?

560
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:08,619
I'll be there.

561
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:10,460
Yes!

562
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,860
Okay. Well then.
Don't forget to pack your clothes

563
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,500
because I'm not letting
any of you go home.

564
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,030
- Huh?
- Ugh.

565
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:21,039
Moan and whine.

566
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:22,239
All right.

567
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,269
Give me 30 laps around the court.

568
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,179
- Ugh.
- There you go again. Fifty laps!

569
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,510
- Huh?
- Sixty! Seventy!

570
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:31,650
Eighty!

571
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,179
- Let's go!
- Ninety!

572
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:40,690
- I said the entire court!
- Ugh!

573
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,039
(Atom)

574
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,039
Are you worried
you won't get to see Atom?

575
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:02,079
Nosy.

576
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:12,050
What's your problem with me?

577
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:14,659
And how is that any of your concern?

578
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,190
Why?

579
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:21,199
Are you jealous of me and Atom?

580
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,300
We're going to train
for the entire weekend.

581
00:44:53,429 --> 00:44:56,199
Our very first important game
is coming up soon.

582
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,539
You have to practice,
practice, and practice.

583
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,599
You did that deliberately,
didn't you?

584
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,139
You made a mistake.
How could you blame me?

585
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:05,110
If that's how you're going to be,

586
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,639
then we'll do it my way.

587
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:09,179
Ever since I ran into you,
my life's been full of trouble.

588
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:10,309
How did you get here, Atom?

589
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:11,679
I bought you some desserts.

590
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,849
I know I'm horrible.

591
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,949
But right now,

592
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,590
I want to play
on the same team as you.
