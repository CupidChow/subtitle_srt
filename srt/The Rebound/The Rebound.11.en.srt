1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,560
They've been playing
since this afternoon into the night.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,720
- None of the teams are letting up.
- Exactly.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,480
We'll have to stay tuned
for the second half.

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,769
- That's right. For sure.
- If there's any surprises.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,160
Hey!

6
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,960
Shoot!

7
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,280
There's still time!

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,439
Go! Go! Go!

9
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,158
- Okay!
- Tanwarin Wittaya is showing

10
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,960
more focus as it gets darker.

11
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,280
Their form is getting better.

12
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,560
Why weren't they like this
in the afternoon?

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,640
I know, right?

14
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,799
They really are the underdogs.
You can't underestimate them.

15
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,799
Go! Go! Go!

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Go, Ryu!

17
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,159
All right, Zen!

18
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,159
Wow! And now they've scored
two more points!

19
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,480
They haven't missed a shot yet!

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,689
So that's Zen?

21
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,239
That's him.

22
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,439
What's Ton doing? Why is his team
so much better now?

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Zen!

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,159
Well done!

25
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,159
Yes!

26
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,960
(The Rebound)

27
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,318
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

28
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,000
We're now in front
of Tanwarin Wittaya School.

29
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,280
The fact that their high school
basketball team has defeated

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,240
the top dog, Palamit, is a very
significant achievement.

31
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,560
More importantly, it's been ages
since they've made it this far.

32
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,119
Excuse me. How do you feel
about your school's team

33
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,479
making it this far?

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,159
First of all, it makes me so happy.

35
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,120
I've been here since kindergarten,
and I'm a fan of the team.

36
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,399
I'm especially a huge fan
of Ryu and Zen.

37
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
Ah.

38
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,759
There he is. That's Coach Ton.

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,520
Coach Ton! Excuse me.

40
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,560
Do you mind giving an interview?

41
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,840
What's your secret for your
team's impressive comeback?

42
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm afraid I can't do
an interview right now.

43
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,199
But you do have some tricks up
your sleeves, don't you?

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,599
Can you share them with us?

45
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,879
I told you. I can't do
an interview right now.

46
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,319
A different question then.

47
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,400
How do you feel about people
saying you're a very strict coach

48
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,080
who trained his athletes
to be here today?

49
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,279
- Coach Ton?
- Oh?

50
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,639
Why?

51
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,360
He refused to give an interview.

52
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,800
He's gone.

53
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,279
Did you find anything?

54
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,050
More than we expected.

55
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,199
Both Coach Ton and the club
are done for this time.

56
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,800
He has a record of a temporary
ban due to violent tendencies,

57
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,360
followed by another ban for
narcotics,

58
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,680
which resulted in an accident
and the death of his wife.

59
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,879
How dramatic.

60
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,079
Both the parents and the public are

61
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,759
going to give their full attention
to this kind of news.

62
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,319
Scandalous former basketball player

63
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,319
trying to turn over a new leaf by
becoming a high school school coach.

64
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,240
The parents are going to wonder

65
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,680
if he's also introducing
their kids to drugs.

66
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,000
This never happened.

67
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,160
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

68
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,680
- Great.
- That was nice.

69
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,240
Next.

70
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,399
Watch your stance. There.

71
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,240
- That's good.
- Try again.

72
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,439
(Jedi, Coach Ton's in trouble.)

73
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,000
What are they staring at?

74
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,399
Lin, look at this.

75
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
What is it?

76
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
(Scandalous Coach!!)

77
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,519
(Tanwarin Wittaya’s Coach
Was Discovered)

78
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,638
(to Have Used Narcotics in the Past
Resulting in His Wife’s Death)

79
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,639
Huh?

80
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,680
What's all this about?

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,199
Dad,

82
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,639
come and take a look at this.

83
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,600
Who did this?

84
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,399
It's okay. Try again, Prince.

85
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,560
Good job, Jed.

86
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,560
Is something the matter, sir?

87
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,879
Sir.

88
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Coach Ton,

89
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,040
can you come here for a moment?

90
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,318
The school board has issued an order

91
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,720
for Coach Ton to be relieved of his
duties immediately,

92
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
pending the completion of the
investigation.

93
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,959
You can't do that, sir.

94
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,120
Our next game is coming up.

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,319
We need him.

96
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,519
That's right.

97
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,519
You should wait until after the game
to start the investigation.

98
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,240
I'm afraid we can't wait.

99
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,480
You probably don't know
how many complaints

100
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,759
we've received from parents.

101
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,279
I think we should

102
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,240
follow protocol for this matter.

103
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,000
Coach Ton, you understand,
don't you?

104
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,800
- But, sir...
- Enough.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,079
Let the grown-ups deal
with grown-up matters.

106
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,600
Your duty is to train.

107
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,439
We have a game plan,
and we know the drills.

108
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,079
You guys can do it.

109
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,879
- But...
- I said enough.

110
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,959
You can do it, okay?

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,879
Go on. Keep practicing. Lin.

112
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,519
This way, please.

113
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,199
Let's keep going, guys.

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Zen.

115
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,199
Hello, everyone.
We're currently at...

116
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,720
- Tanwarin Wittaya right now.
- Come on.

117
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,560
Something serious has happened
to the Ryu-Zen basketball team.

118
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,480
Coach Ton, the school's promising
new coach,

119
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,079
was found to have a history
of using narcotic stimulants.

120
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,800
Will Tanwarin's legendary basketball
team go forward or end here?

121
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,079
Ryu and Zen are coming.
Let's interview them.

122
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,279
Ryu? Zen? Can we
interview you for a bit?

123
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,519
Are you disappointed with your
coach?

124
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,159
Why would I be disappointed?

125
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,879
He didn't do anything wrong.

126
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,799
The investigation report hasn't even
been released yet.

127
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,240
What about you, Zen? How do you
feel as team captain?

128
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,799
I believe in him.

129
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,639
He'll return no matter what.

130
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Sir,

131
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,240
you can't do this.

132
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,159
Calm down, Zen.

133
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,330
The order came
from the school board.

134
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,919
I don't want to do it either.
But I can't defy them.

135
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,679
Aren't you going
to help at all, sir?

136
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
The decision isn't even final.

137
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,399
He might not deserve to get
kicked out for what he did.

138
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,799
He's right, sir.

139
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,279
Please help my dad.

140
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,679
It's up to the discretion
of the committee.

141
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,919
Does this "committee"

142
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,480
include the alumni association?

143
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,679
That's right. If we can get
their support,

144
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,799
then there might be hope
for Coach Ton.

145
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,879
Mom.

146
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,759
Oh? Ryu?

147
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,519
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming home?

148
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,639
You're behind what's happening
to the coach, aren't you?

149
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,639
And is he going
to affect my business?

150
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,039
I don't think so.

151
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,799
So why would I go after him?

152
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,330
Do you have any idea
who's behind this then?

153
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,879
It's none of my concern.
I'm staying out of this.

154
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,919
Can you help him?

155
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,330
You're the president
of the alumni association.

156
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,360
If I help, what are you going to
give me in exchange?

157
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
I'm serious, Mom.

158
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,759
So am I.

159
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,480
Come home.

160
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,519
Then I'll find a way to help him.

161
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,210
Mom!

162
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,759
This isn't something minor.

163
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,960
I have to figure out

164
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,159
what I can do about it.

165
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
Darn it!

166
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Ryu?

167
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,360
What's wrong?

168
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Zen,

169
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,450
I'm sorry I can't help Coach
or the team.

170
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,639
You don't have to apologize.

171
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,240
You went as far as going to
see your mom

172
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,960
despite not wanting to see her.

173
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,840
She didn't promise to help.

174
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,120
But she didn't refuse either.

175
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
That's true.

176
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Zen,

177
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,080
what's going to happen to Coach?

178
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,279
Look.

179
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
That's him.

180
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,399
Do you think so?

181
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,879
I'm sure it's him.

182
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,120
Dad, you're home.

183
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,720
Come and have dinner.

184
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,759
Come on. Let's eat.
Everything's laid out.

185
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,039
Aren't you going to eat?

186
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,639
All right. Wait here for a second.

187
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,799
Isn't this what you want?

188
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,559
Lin!

189
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,639
Come on.

190
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,080
I'll pour one for you. You have
my permission tonight.

191
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,759
There you go.

192
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,120
Lin.

193
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,799
Hm?

194
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,919
Are you embarrassed
to have me as your dad?

195
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,240
What are you on about?

196
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,159
You're super awesome.

197
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,240
But a bit too much of a drunk.

198
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,960
Come on. Let's eat.

199
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,879
Thank you.

200
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,919
It's because of this, isn't it?

201
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,559
It's the reason why you didn't
want to play again.

202
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,159
Mm.

203
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
I was worried...

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,759
this day would come.

205
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,879
Are your friends disappointed in me?

206
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,240
I don't think so.

207
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,679
They care about your feelings more.

208
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,039
Come on. Eat up.

209
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,519
I tried my very best to cook
for you tonight.

210
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,039
Dig in.

211
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,639
Coach!

212
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,120
Guys! Come in!

213
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,639
All right. Come on in.

214
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,039
Grandma cooked something
for you, Coach.

215
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,879
She said you have to eat.

216
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,120
She also told us
to join you for dinner.

217
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,559
So, do you mind if we stay?

218
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,440
Ah, okay. That's a tough one
to turn down.

219
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,200
All right. Sit down.

220
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,759
Grab a seat, guys.

221
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,320
- That looks really good.
- Coach!

222
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,159
Chogun? Jedi?

223
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,679
Can we have dinner with you?

224
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,279
Being silent for more
than two seconds means yes.

225
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,399
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

226
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,919
What is all that?

227
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,960
Three-flavor-fish
from the best shop, Coach.

228
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,159
It's your favorite.

229
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:33,360
Oh, thanks a lot. Sure.

230
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,519
Come on.

231
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,319
- Should we pour these into bowls?
- Good idea.

232
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Coach!

233
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
- First?
- First?

234
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,879
Oh? I thought I'd be the first.

235
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,480
Ugh. Okay! Just come inside!

236
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,039
Everyone's at a loss for words.

237
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,240
Just bring everyone over.

238
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,559
Come on. Over here.

239
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,480
Vegetable stir-fry
and super spicy tom yum.

240
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,840
- Coach!
- Ugh!

241
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,039
Is anyone else coming over?

242
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,440
All right. Come on in.

243
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,879
What do we have here?

244
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,360
What are we eating at this point?

245
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,879
Just put those down.

246
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Lin,

247
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,799
Puth and the others texted me.
They want to come.

248
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,039
- No!
- No!

249
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,038
We're almost on top
of each other already.

250
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,159
We have enough people now.

251
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,240
Roger that.

252
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,840
- This is wrapped up tight.
- Have a seat.

253
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,080
Sit down.

254
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,519
Where can I even sit?

255
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,559
Coach, can I have a shot of that?
I'm getting thirsty.

256
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,200
Are you crazy? That's mine!

257
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,399
Stay away. It's mine.

258
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Hey, that's too far.

259
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,279
And do you like it?

260
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,840
- Ooh!
- Aw!

261
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,799
Ugh!

262
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,519
Give me ten laps around the field.
You're getting on my nerves.

263
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,200
Come on, Coach!

264
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,799
Ugh!

265
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,759
Okay, okay!
Just for tonight. Go ahead.

266
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:00,120
Just for tonight.

267
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,080
- Coach.
- Hm?

268
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,799
Can you try Grandma's Hor Mok again?

269
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,639
She said she wanted a picture.

270
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,720
Come on, Coach. Let's take a photo.

271
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Yes, a photo.

272
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,360
A photo?

273
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,080
Okay. Let's do it.

274
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:18,159
Sure. Gather around.

275
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,039
Come on over.

276
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,759
All right.

277
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,799
Over here.

278
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,120
One second.
I have to hide this first.

279
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,559
I might get a scolding
from Grandma otherwise.

280
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,840
Who's going to take the photo?

281
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,039
- Come on.
- Here.

282
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,159
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

283
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Smile.

284
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,399
One, two, three!

285
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,240
- Yay!
- Yay!

286
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,360
Come on. You didn't say "yay".

287
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,559
Let's do it together.

288
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,320
One, two, three!

289
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,039
- Yay!
- Yay!

290
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,879
Another one.

291
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,879
One, two, three!

292
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,960
- Yay!
- Yay!

293
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,320
Do you think Coach's
going to get off?

294
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,200
He has to.

295
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Mom?

296
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,359
They're home.

297
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,200
Why are you here?

298
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,680
To come and take you home.

299
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,170
Don't you want me
to help your coach out?

300
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,759
You have to keep your end
of our agreement.

301
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,170
Here's some Bua Loi.

302
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,279
Thank you very much.

303
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,359
I'd like you to try. Ryu loves it.

304
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,650
I'm his mother,

305
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,480
yet I don't even know
his likes and dislikes.

306
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,680
Grandma, Coach Ton said the food was
very delicious last night.

307
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,480
He said he'd come over for dinner.

308
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,799
Really? That's excellent!

309
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,890
Tell them both to come,
Coach and Lin.

310
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Sure.

311
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,680
You went for dinner at his house?

312
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,890
Yes.

313
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yes, Mom.

314
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,119
Grandma cooked him something too.

315
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,079
And how is he doing?
I hope he's not too stressed.

316
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,000
He probably is.

317
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,039
But his headache's probably worse.

318
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,519
The whole club was there.

319
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,759
The kids must really love him.
That's why they're so close.

320
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,240
By the way, I checked out
the club's page yesterday.

321
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,960
I saw something
about a "ship pairing".

322
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,359
"Ryuzen"? What's that?

323
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:16,890
Oh, that's what the fans do.

324
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,890
Shipping is...

325
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,920
Like they're in a relationship?

326
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,559
Well, it's like puppy love.

327
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,000
You're just a ship pairing?

328
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,079
Not an actual relationship, right?

329
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,559
It's the latter.

330
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,410
We really are together.

331
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,200
There it is. I knew it.

332
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,410
Ma'am?

333
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Don't you think it's strange at all?

334
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,410
Why would I?

335
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,359
It's actually something
to be happy about.

336
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,759
They gave us the privilege
to know about their feelings.

337
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,119
Thanks so much for telling us.

338
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,759
You're welcome, Grandma.

339
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,480
You're not mad at me for what
happened just now, are you?

340
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,170
Mad about what?

341
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,119
Me telling Mom and Grandma
about us being together.

342
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,279
Why would I be mad?

343
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,799
It was just a bit awkward.
That's all.

344
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,920
I saw that.

345
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,039
But it feels nice

346
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,279
letting it out like that.

347
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,799
Mm.

348
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,890
Are you okay?

349
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,839
You usually can't stop yapping.

350
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,599
I'm just a bit shy

351
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,079
about everything.

352
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,680
I hope I'll be able to help Coach

353
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,119
by going back home.

354
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,319
I hope so too.

355
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,170
Mm.

356
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,170
Ryu's a good boy.

357
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
I know.

358
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,480
But he takes after you
a bit too much.

359
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,920
After me?

360
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,799
He probably hates me
and doesn't want to be like me.

361
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,640
Both of you tend
to bury your feelings.

362
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,839
I have to go, Grandma.

363
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,119
Visit me sometimes, okay?

364
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,079
I will.

365
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:08,720
Please take care of Zen.

366
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,440
Ryu, what are you on about?
Take care of me?

367
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:13,880
You can go now.

368
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,480
It's time to get in the car.

369
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,039
Please excuse us.

370
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Bye.

371
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,480
You don't have to. Thank you.

372
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,799
I agreed to come home.

373
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,200
Now you have to help Coach.

374
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,119
I'm starting to feel jealous of him.

375
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,160
You're always talking about him.

376
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,680
I have another condition for you.

377
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,400
What else do you want?

378
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,319
I want you to study in the UK
like I mentioned before.

379
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:22,960
Wow, you have such a nice bedroom.

380
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:24,759
Sir Ryu.

381
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,839
It's nice.

382
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,920
But it doesn't make me as happy
as when I'm next to you.

383
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,519
I prefer a smaller bed. It's nice
and warm when I'm next to you.

384
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
What?

385
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,880
Are you dissing my bed?

386
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,079
I'm not. I mean it.

387
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,880
It feels weird
sleeping alone in a big bed.

388
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,480
Why? Can't fall asleep without me?

389
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,759
I'm saying I'm just not used to it.

390
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:50,960
I miss you.

391
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,960
I know. I miss you too.

392
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,359
And is everything okay?

393
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,680
Of course.

394
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,759
But it's still not okay because
you're not here to drive me nuts.

395
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,440
You're driving me nuts
now that you're far away.

396
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Anyway, I should go to bed.

397
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,680
- Bye.
- Wait.

398
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,480
What now?

399
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,400
Can you stay on the phone
with me all night?

400
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,240
I want it to feel
like you're lying next to me.

401
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,599
You moron. My phone bill
will skyrocket.

402
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,400
It will take me days to work it off.

403
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,799
You know it's super expensive.

404
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,319
I have a part-time job just
to pay my phone bill.

405
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,079
I'll pay.

406
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,960
You're a rich kid, aren't you?

407
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,160
I have your account details.
One second.

408
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,079
There. Stop whining already.

409
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,680
Really.

410
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:57,976
(First: Trust me.
Everything will be okay tomorrow.)

411
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:02,494
(Coach won't be punished.)

412
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:06,279
(I hope so. But you saw it.)

413
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,119
(Most of the committee
wants to go after him.)

414
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,639
(First: It'll be fine. You should
get some sleep. See you tomorrow.)

415
00:27:16,664 --> 00:27:20,389
(Mm. See you.)

416
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,599
Coach?

417
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,599
What's the matter, Zen?

418
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,839
Nothing.

419
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,599
Ugh.

420
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,400
Is it time already?

421
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,839
Yes, sir.

422
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,519
Look at you.

423
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,799
Your eyes are completely different
from when we first met.

424
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,079
That different, sir?

425
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,519
Mm.

426
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,000
Your eyes back then

427
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,240
looked like you wouldn't
give up easily

428
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,680
and that you'd do anything
so the club could go on.

429
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,200
Zen, I...

430
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,440
I'm sorry I might not get to
keep going with you guys.

431
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,359
No, Coach.

432
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,279
You have to stay with us.

433
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,559
I don't want to leave.

434
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,559
But if I have to go,

435
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,480
please look after the club for me,

436
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,000
sonny.

437
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,519
Coach is coming!

438
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,279
Don't you all have
classes to attend?

439
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,759
Didn't you tell us
basketball is a team sport?

440
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,559
You're part of it.

441
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,079
Zen.

442
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,559
Now that you're all here,

443
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,440
I'd like to begin
Coach Ton's investigation

444
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,400
due to the complaints
we've been receiving.

445
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,599
Esteemed committee members,

446
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,119
I'm Kanin, Head of Academics.

447
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,519
I'm here as the investigator

448
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,240
for Coach Ton's attempted cover-up
of his background

449
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,119
and his lack of qualities
needed to be a good teacher.

450
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,200
Please proceed with your questions.

451
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,599
Please, Chutima.

452
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,240
Coach Ton,

453
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,480
do you have an explanation for us
before we make a decision?

454
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,880
A little bit.

455
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,519
Please.

456
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
A rebound.

457
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:55,240
In basketball, a rebound is

458
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:59,240
an attempt to take the ball back
after missing a shot

459
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,359
in order to give yourself
another chance.

460
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,000
But in real life, you can't

461
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,880
make a rebound sometimes.

462
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,640
That's right. I...

463
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,319
I was banned because they found
stimulants in my body.

464
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,519
See? He's admitted it in the end.

465
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,319
That's it.

466
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,400
As soon as you hear "stimulants",

467
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,440
you assume it's narcotics.

468
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,960
Do you mind explaining
the situation to us?

469
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,599
Jumper's knee.

470
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,640
What is that?

471
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,759
A chronic injury of the knee.

472
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,799
Back then,

473
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,160
it was the playoffs.

474
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,319
Our team was ten points behind.

475
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,559
It was the nationals.

476
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,440
So the coach sent me in
so I could score three-pointers.

477
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
But...

478
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,440
Ton, are you okay?

479
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,279
Give him a hand!

480
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,319
Careful!

481
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,279
- Ton, are you okay?
- Hey!

482
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,640
Hey, get him off the court!

483
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,240
Ton,

484
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:33,839
just one more quarter.
Can you push through?

485
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,640
I'll pay you double for it.

486
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,319
Coach,

487
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,599
look at the state of my knee.
I can't do it.

488
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,359
I can give you an injection.

489
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,279
You won't feel a thing.

490
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,960
Come on. Do it for the team.

491
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,759
All right. You have
three seconds to decide.

492
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,839
Three...

493
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Two...

494
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,039
I'll do it.

495
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,440
From then on, I'd been using
morphine to ease my knee pain.

496
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,759
One day, there was
a random drug test.

497
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,599
Then I got banned.

498
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,440
So you really were in the wrong.

499
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:36,480
And you're admitting it, aren't you?

500
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,319
Yes, I'm admitting it.

501
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,200
I made a mistake
during those three seconds.

502
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,799
I made the wrong decision,
and it's been like that ever since.

503
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,599
One mistake after another,
until one day,

504
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,720
I made a grave mistake.

505
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,960
I lost my future.

506
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,119
I lost everything.

507
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,559
I spent my days drunk.

508
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,599
To the point I ruined my life,

509
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,119
my wife's,

510
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,039
and my daughter's.

511
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,079
My life probably can't be rebounded.

512
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,039
I just want to

513
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,960
help these kids make the rebound.

514
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,000
Because they're our children.

515
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:50,400
This is the proof of treatment
for my knee

516
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:52,719
to confirm
that everything I said is true.

517
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,519
But even if it's true,

518
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,159
you deliberately concealed
your history and lied to us.

519
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,199
Is that right?

520
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,119
You're right, Kanin.

521
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,480
That's why I prepared this too.

522
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:10,329
A resignation letter.

523
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,079
I know I don't have

524
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,199
the suitable qualities
to be their coach.

525
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Director?

526
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,960
If there are no more questions,

527
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:40,119
I'd like the committee
to conclude this investigation.

528
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,559
Coach,

529
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,960
you're still our coach,
no matter what!

530
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,329
We don't want him to resign.

531
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,159
Shoot, shoot, shoot

532
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,769
Shoot, shoot, shoot
Keep shooting despite the misses

533
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,639
Never, never give up
We're much stronger than that

534
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,289
Dream, dream, dream
We share one dream

535
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,679
Rebound, again and again
Rebound, again and again

536
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:19,880
Victory awaits us

537
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:23,440
Shoot, shoot, shoot
Keep shooting despite the misses

538
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,960
Never, never give up
We're much stronger than that

539
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,400
Dream, dream, dream
We share one dream

540
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,809
Rebound, again and again
Rebound, again and again

541
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,559
Victory awaits us

542
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,159
Everyone, please keep quiet.

543
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,079
I have a proposition.

544
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,719
I'd like to propose a vote.

545
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:52,199
If you agree to have
Coach Ton dismissed,

546
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,119
please raise your hand.

547
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,400
Well then. Please raise your hand
if you disagree.

548
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,880
We've reached a conclusion.

549
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,329
Coach Ton will continue
to coach the basketball team.

550
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,960
Coach!

551
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:35,360
- Coach!
- Coach!

552
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:42,679
Thank you! Thank you, everyone!

553
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,519
Lobby all of the school
board members.

554
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
Yes, ma'am.

555
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:02,719
Let's go.

556
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,400
Thank you very much, Chutima.

557
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,289
No problem at all, Director.

558
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,769
I only did what my son
asked me to do.

559
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:20,679
Oh, I heard their next game is soon.
Is that right?

560
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,840
Yes. With the association's help,

561
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,599
the kids are going to be very happy.

562
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,039
Anyway, thank you very much.

563
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,639
You're welcome.

564
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:49,239
Give it your all, Coach.

565
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,809
Suicide sprints! Go!

566
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:04,920
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

567
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,239
Congratulations about Coach Ton.

568
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,559
Thanks, Atom.
We're very happy about it.

569
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,559
Your school's allowing the club
to continue for only a year?

570
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,400
Yes.

571
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:00,440
But I'm hoping

572
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:03,329
if we get to represent the province

573
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,960
at nationals,

574
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,960
the school might

575
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,360
extend the club's lifespan.

576
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,239
You have to make it.
I'm rooting for you, Zen.

577
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,769
Thanks, Atom.

578
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,440
Why are you so nice to me?

579
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,679
Because I like you.

580
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,079
You know

581
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,159
what kind of "like" that is.

582
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,769
- Uh, but...
- Hey.

583
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,039
Don't think too much about it.

584
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:51,199
I just want you to know how I feel.

585
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,880
At least I got to do my part.

586
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,199
I'm not expecting
anything out of it.

587
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,769
Don't feel like you're
in an awkward position, okay?

588
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Uh...

589
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,329
I don't know what to do.

590
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,840
I might take you home
if you keep getting confused.

591
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:17,880
Jerk.

592
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,840
I'm a human,
not some inanimate object.

593
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,400
By the way,

594
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:27,199
what would you do if the school
ended up disbanding the club?

595
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,440
You'd miss out on the university
scholarship, wouldn't you?

596
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:35,440
You need a portfolio spanning
your entire high school career.

597
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,159
Honestly,

598
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,679
I still don't know.

599
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,599
What if I told you I could help?

600
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:51,039
How? How can you help?

601
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,809
- You want to find out?
- Yes.

602
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
How can you help?

603
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,159
If you want to find out,

604
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,119
- then jump in.
- Huh?

605
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,960
Hey, Atom!

606
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Hey!

607
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,599
- Atom! Tell me how you can help.
- What?

608
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,769
- Catch me if you can.
- Hey, Atom!

609
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:15,960
How can you help...

610
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Hey!

611
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,519
Phuket?

612
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:34,329
Mm.

613
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:37,000
It's an awesome proposal.

614
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,960
Ah, here.

615
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,159
There. I've sent it to you.

616
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:46,559
I asked for a spot for you as well.

617
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:48,159
The scout came to watch you play.

618
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:49,440
He thought you were great.

619
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:52,920
You can decide
after reading the proposal.

620
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,960
Excuse me?

621
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:02,289
I'm from the "Cute Boys, Ahoy" page.

622
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,639
You both look very cute.

623
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:08,329
Do you mind if I take
some photos of you for the page?

624
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,000
- Sure.
- Thank you.

625
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,239
Why did you agree?

626
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,079
Your team's famous right now.

627
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:21,000
Make good use of social media.

628
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,880
You might get more donations.

629
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,239
Can you scoot closer to each other?

630
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,480
Sure.

631
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:33,920
Can you put your arms
around each other?

632
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Sure.

633
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,159
I'd rather not.

634
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:42,880
Just remember, it's for the team.

635
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Okay?

636
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,519
Come on.

637
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,440
One, two, three. Cheese.

638
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,239
Very handsome, guys.

639
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,840
Can you put your heads together?

640
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,239
Hi, Grandma.

641
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,920
Atom? I missed you.

642
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,320
I missed you too, Grandma.

643
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:04,400
Can I help you with anything?

644
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:06,159
It's okay. I'll manage.

645
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,480
Hm?

646
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,039
That won't do.

647
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,159
I've been a bother to you many times
already. Please let me help.

648
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:17,159
Well then. Can you help me change
the lightbulbs in the kitchen?

649
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,079
All done. Try turning it on.

650
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,400
Mm.

651
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,880
You should go now that you're done.

652
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,840
Oh? You're kicking me out already?

653
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,159
I was going to ask
to stay the night.

654
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,920
Oh?

655
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,480
How come?

656
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,800
What about your dad?

657
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:50,519
I already told him.

658
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:53,280
Grandma,

659
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,360
can I stay the night here?

660
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,920
Zen needs to discuss
the scholarship with me.

661
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,800
Oh. Of course you can stay.

662
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:05,760
Thank you.

663
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:11,599
Zen,

664
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:14,400
how long do you plan
to keep playing for?

665
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,239
Well,

666
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,119
until I can't play anymore.

667
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:29,840
Same here.

668
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,360
Apart from basketball,

669
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,039
do you have dreams
of doing anything else?

670
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,480
Yes, Ryu?

671
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:34,679
I thought you weren't going to call.

672
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,480
Sorry. I had to go
to this party with Mom.

673
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:41,079
You? How are you doing?
Are you safe?

674
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,599
What do you mean by safe?

675
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,920
I'm at home.

676
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,320
You texted me about Atom
wanting to stay the night.

677
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,119
So? Are you safe?

678
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,559
You moron, he's not a perv like you.

679
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,039
That's not all he thinks about.

680
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:58,400
So I'm the only one?

681
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,320
But from what I've seen,
I don't think so.

682
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,519
Ryu, you perv.

683
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,360
I miss you, and I'm jealous.

684
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,760
Don't let Atom get within
three feet of you, understand?

685
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,159
Ryu, you're overreacting.

686
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,559
I miss you too.

687
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,599
I have to go back to bed now.

688
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,519
Bye.

689
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:02,760
I'm going to teach you
about the three-second rule.

690
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,639
Judging from our previous match,

691
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:08,760
you know our team has an issue
with decision-making, right?

692
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,320
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

693
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:12,679
I understand.

694
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,360
We used to be a small team
that always got defeated.

695
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:17,960
And now, whenever you face
a formidable team,

696
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:19,960
you get nervous.

697
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:22,079
That's why we're always causing
fouls after three seconds.

698
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:24,960
So, for today's practice,

699
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,840
we'll train to score
within three seconds.

700
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,360
And that's related
to future decision-making

701
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,760
because we might not even have
three seconds sometimes.

702
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,679
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

703
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:39,840
- Yes?
- Um...

704
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,880
Our next game is soon.
Have you decided

705
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,960
who's on the starting line-up
and who's reserve?

706
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,239
Shouldn't you be focusing
on practicing?

707
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:51,960
I'll let you all know later.

708
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,960
Yes, sir.

709
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,400
Hey. Chocolate or coconut?

710
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:09,320
Who told you I felt like ice cream?

711
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:12,800
Come on. Give it a try.

712
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,359
They say when you're stressed,
something sweet will

713
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,599
make you feel better.

714
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
Which one?

715
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,880
I knew you'd pick chocolate.

716
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:24,079
You like bitter, don't you?

717
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,159
If we compare a reserve player
like me to chocolate,

718
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,679
then it's nauseatingly sweet.

719
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,280
Whoa. That's deep.

720
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,119
Can I use that as the caption
for my social media post?

721
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:36,519
Mm.

722
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,440
- Lin.
- Hm?

723
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:52,639
How should I feel? I'm always
a reserve no matter how hard I try.

724
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,480
I've never been picked
for the starting line-up.

725
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,440
Hm...

726
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,880
You should feel...

727
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:01,199
that it's okay.

728
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,039
And you can try again later.

729
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,679
That sounds so hopeful.

730
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:09,599
Hope can be cruel.

731
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,239
But I think

732
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,960
it has its positives.

733
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,079
Sometimes hope can
be the reason we keep trying.

734
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:21,840
That's deep.

735
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:24,440
So deep I won't be
able to climb back up.

736
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:29,119
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

737
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:40,519
I'm really enjoying today.

738
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,199
I got to come up here with you.
That's the best part.

739
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,280
Ryu,

740
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,480
you're not going to bail on me

741
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:02,039
like you did in middle school if we
make it to finals again, are you?

742
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,159
You have to be the first to arrive.

743
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,199
I won't let you have
your way anymore.

744
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,880
No more flaking out.

745
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,960
Sure.

746
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:30,679
I won't disappoint you.

747
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:40,119
Promise?

748
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:43,679
Come on!

749
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:48,159
Happy now?

750
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:51,880
And you have to keep your promise.

751
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:53,960
You can't go back
on your word, okay?

752
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:57,199
Sure. I promise.

753
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:13,119
Zen, how's it going?
Have you gotten a hold of Ryu yet?

754
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,639
No, one second.

755
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:18,920
He went missing
during the finals, didn't he?

756
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,280
He did.

757
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,920
But this is only the semi-finals.

758
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:24,039
He might be busy with something.

759
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,880
Okay.

760
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:32,679
It's too late.

761
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,719
All right. Hop on the bus.

762
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:36,960
Text him to catch up with us.

763
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,960
Yes, Coach.

764
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,559
Let's go, guys.

765
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:43,039
Come on.

766
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:45,519
All right.

767
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,559
Today is as exciting as always.

768
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,079
Whichever team wins
will proceed to the finals

769
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:54,519
and gets to represent the province.

770
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:58,039
These two schools, they're going to
leave it all on the court today.

771
00:53:58,119 --> 00:53:59,119
And which school are those, Earth?

772
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:01,840
The first school is
Tanwarin Wittaya.

773
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,800
They're facing off against
St. Paul's today.

774
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:08,199
- They're considered the underdogs.
- That's right.

775
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,519
They didn't get this far
just because of...

776
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,400
I haven't even finished my sentence,
and here they are.

777
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:17,880
St. Paul's is in all-black today.

778
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:21,639
Coach, I still can't reach Ryu.

779
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:38,719
I had someone check-in for you.

780
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,880
Mom,

781
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,719
please give me my phone back.

782
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,760
I have to tell Zen what's going on.
There's a game today.

783
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:47,119
No.

784
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,159
What if you change your mind and
refuse to come to Europe with me?

785
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,199
But I agreed to study over there
only after the finals, Mom.

786
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,719
You can't do this to me.

787
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,440
So what do you want me to do?

788
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:00,599
I have a business deal
to attend to over there.

789
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:03,440
So I had to sort out your studies.

790
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,519
- But you have to let me play first.
- No.

791
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,320
Okay.

792
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
We might have to play

793
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,719
this match without Ryu.

794
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:21,359
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

795
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,360
Okay.

796
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,760
Game.

797
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,519
No matter the outcome,

798
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,760
I want you to remember that
you did your best.

799
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:54,519
Can you not go?

800
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:55,800
If I had a choice,

801
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,559
would I be proud to play?

802
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,480
Let's make happy memories
together, Ryu.
