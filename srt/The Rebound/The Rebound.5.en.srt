1
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,879
Will you start high school
here with me?

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,009
(Two Years Earlier)

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,119
This school is awesome,
but I didn't get accepted.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,820
Then tell your mom
to donate more money.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,149
She's loaded.

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,429
She's running a business,
not a charity, moron.

7
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:24,960
Ryu.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,129
Hm?

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,929
Let's become middle-school
champions together.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,699
Sure.

11
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:32,670
I'll be the first

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,640
to arrive at the court
for the finals.

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,840
I hope that's the case.

14
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:39,939
Okay, okay.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,820
Oh?

16
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,020
The tap's stuck.

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,990
- I can't turn it.
- You have to do it like this.

18
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,960
Shoot! That's cold!

19
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,030
Is it strong enough?

20
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,700
Yes.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,409
Is it bubbly enough?

22
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:14,980
Yes.

23
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,079
Turn around to face me.

24
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,800
(The Rebound)

25
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,810
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

26
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,310
What's your problem with me?

27
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,650
And how is that any of your concern?

28
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,020
Why?

29
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
Are you jealous of me and Atom?

30
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,879
This is such nonsense.

31
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,209
Are you worried you wouldn't get
to go to the movies with him?

32
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:39,579
Yes, so what if I am?

33
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,620
Didn't you see
how nice he was to me?

34
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:44,620
Is that what you wanted me to say?

35
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,180
Thank you.

36
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,019
You've got quite the sweet tooth.

37
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,519
I'm addicted to sugar,

38
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,120
but I've been trying to cut back.

39
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,589
Good.

40
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,560
It's better for your health.

41
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,660
I'm worried about you.

42
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:23,730
All right. I'll keep eating sugar

43
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,259
so you'll be even
more worried about me.

44
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,670
Naughty, naughty.

45
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,430
It was a joke.

46
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:30,970
By the way,

47
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,500
your grandmom's cooking is so good.

48
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,009
For sure.

49
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,639
She's pretty much
the best in the world.

50
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,750
Oh, right. What should we
watch this Saturday?

51
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,449
I have a bunch in mind,

52
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,420
but I'm not sure
which genre's your favorite.

53
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
Oh.

54
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,990
I've been meaning to tell you.

55
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:55,730
Our coach told us to go on
a training retreat at the school.

56
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,230
I don't think I can come
with you anymore.

57
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,670
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,069
It's okay. Train hard, okay?

59
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,800
Of course.

60
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,009
There's a game coming up soon.

61
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,439
More importantly, we can't
lose again with this one.

62
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,319
You're an athlete too.
You probably understand.

63
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,420
Yes, I understand that well enough.

64
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,990
Anyway, I should go back to work.

65
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,139
Ugh, it's the weekend, but we
couldn't even stay in bed at home.

66
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,269
Right?

67
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,269
I've been waiting for a new manga.

68
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:44,980
It's going
to come out this Saturday.

69
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,149
Oh? Are you addicted to mangas?

70
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,310
So?

71
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,220
How is that any trouble to you, Jed?

72
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,379
Do you want to find out
what the trouble is?

73
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,019
- What?
- This!

74
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,189
Did you just kick me?

75
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,660
I think it's going
to be fun though.

76
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,360
Fun?

77
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,560
It's the weekend. Instead of...

78
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,029
Hang on. Jedi?

79
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,430
Why are you here?

80
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:06,629
I told him to come.

81
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,329
He got so excited when he heard
we were staying at the school

82
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,269
that he asked to tag along.
I already asked Coach.

83
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:13,699
That's right.
I've also signed up for the club.

84
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:18,709
All right. That's okay
since you've asked Coach.

85
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,360
Whoa.

86
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
Look at the state of all of you.

87
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,800
We're going train
for the entire weekend.

88
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,230
As we all know,

89
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,439
our very important game
is coming up soon.

90
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,670
And do you know
what's going to help you win?

91
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:56,310
Okay. There's no shortcut in sports.

92
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,089
You have to practice, practice,
and practice.

93
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,759
Get off your lazy butts already.

94
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,459
Do you know the club's future

95
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,360
is in your hands now?

96
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:15,699
All right. Go put your things away,
get changed, and come down.

97
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,199
We'll start training right away.

98
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,699
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

99
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,180
Ryu, I'll wait outside.

100
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,220
Zen?

101
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Let's go.

102
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,700
What are you staring at?

103
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:46,929
Come on.

104
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,509
Ryu,

105
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,509
is something the matter?

106
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,049
You've been strangely quiet.

107
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,320
Nothing. I'm fine.

108
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,830
Give me 30 laps around the court
in less than ten minutes!

109
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,169
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

110
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:31,240
Go! Go! Go!

111
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,990
Eight minutes.

112
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
And 11 minutes for the rest of you.

113
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,230
Go back and train
until you pass, understand?

114
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,259
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

115
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,429
Shoot against the backboard
100 times in less than five minutes!

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,710
One, two,

117
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,110
three, four...

118
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,409
fifteen, sixteen,

119
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:06,879
seventeen,

120
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,149
eighteen,

121
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:09,779
- nineteen...
- Eighty-three,

122
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,149
- eighty-four, eighty-five...
- Ah!

123
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,950
That's a foul!

124
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,120
You didn't get to 100.
That's considered a fail.

125
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,490
- Ugh!
- Coach!

126
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,929
You did that deliberately,
didn't you?

127
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh? You made a mistake.
How could you blame me?

128
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,149
What's the point of this argument?

129
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,419
Do you have strength to spare?

130
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,120
All right! I'll help you spend it!

131
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,460
This mission is
considered a failure.

132
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,820
The punishment

133
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,730
is 100 push-ups.

134
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:57,429
Get into position.

135
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,529
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

136
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,470
Are you deaf, Ryu?

137
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,139
Didn't you hear what I ordered?

138
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,740
I passed, didn't I?

139
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:13,039
I got through the finishing line
at the eight-minute mark.

140
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,779
And I didn't miss a single shot.

141
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,750
That's right. You passed.

142
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,789
But your team didn't,

143
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:22,950
so you have
to share the responsibility.

144
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,690
They failed. I didn't.

145
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,159
You jerk! As if you're so good.

146
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,289
Hey, easy!

147
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,460
Coach,

148
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,830
I think that's enough for now.

149
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,769
They're so tired
a fight's about to break out.

150
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,669
We've been doing drills
since morning,

151
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,870
and we haven't even
started on strategy.

152
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,309
We're basketball players.
Not track and field athletes.

153
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:45,980
You want to play basketball?

154
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,279
All right.

155
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,220
This is going to be a two-on-two.

156
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:58,519
Score three out of five to win.

157
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,990
And the team that loses?

158
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:01,889
Well...

159
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,129
you're on court cleaning duty.

160
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,570
You don't have
to go that far, Coach.

161
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,330
Oh? Captain?

162
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,240
Didn't you say
you want to play basketball?

163
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:13,539
Deal.

164
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,679
Zen can pair up with me.

165
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,279
And who are you going
to pair up with, Coach?

166
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,580
Coach, I'm happy to play.

167
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,120
Chogun,

168
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,860
can you pair up with me?

169
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,789
Coach asked to play with me.

170
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,399
Coach asked to play with me.

171
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:45,399
Just don't accuse me
of being advantageous, Coach.

172
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:47,570
Oh.

173
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,169
If I score right away,
the game continues.

174
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,740
Ready?

175
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,759
Holy moly.

176
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,330
Coach is so brutal.

177
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,629
Man-to-man defense.
You have to handle Coach.

178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,730
Okay, I know.

179
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,210
- Chogun!
- Gotcha!

180
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,080
Chogun, the ball!

181
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,210
Do you want to know
how to play basketball?

182
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,980
Stay with Coach.
I'll stay with Chogun.

183
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,049
Okay.

184
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,320
Chogun, "Be a Buffalo"!

185
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,889
Be a Buffalo!

186
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,230
Huh?

187
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,909
Whoa, absolute victory.

188
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,669
What is the "Be a Buffalo" strategy?

189
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,940
It means "stupid".

190
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,110
It was just a translation.

191
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,220
Be a Buffalo.

192
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,049
It's a trap for stupid people.

193
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,860
Be a buffalo.
Buffaloes have to be trapped.

194
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,519
We have to trap the buffalo.

195
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,460
I'm declaring two iron-clad rules,
effective immediately.

196
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,960
First,

197
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,100
no matter what happens,

198
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:24,500
the team always comes first.

199
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,039
Second,

200
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:29,470
if there's even the tiniest mistake,

201
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,610
everyone on the team has to bear
the responsibility together.

202
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,039
Understood?

203
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,649
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

204
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:39,149
Basketball is a team sport.

205
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,480
You're not flying solo.

206
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,360
And right now, you're all part
of our school's basketball team.

207
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,990
If you're going to compete
against other teams

208
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:48,559
but still behave this way,

209
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,389
no team spirit whatsoever,

210
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,000
you've already lost right
from the start.

211
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,129
Do you understand?

212
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,970
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

213
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,399
Go and drink some water.
Then we'll get back to practice.

214
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,370
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

215
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:03,870
- Come on.
- Wait.

216
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,610
- You two.
- Be a Buffalo.

217
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,809
Don't forget.

218
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,120
You lost. So you're
on cleaning duty.

219
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,850
Oh.

220
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,889
And I don't want
to see a single speck of dust.

221
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,870
You suck.

222
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,669
You didn't block Coach at all.

223
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,039
You're the one that sucks.

224
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,740
How could you let Chogun score?

225
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,980
Ouch! What are you playing at?

226
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,120
Shut your yap already.
It's annoying.

227
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,549
Do you think I want to speak to you?

228
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,990
Honestly,

229
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,220
if I had the choice,
I wouldn't want to see you again.

230
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,490
You're such a...

231
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,059
I'm such a what? Spit it out.

232
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,759
A loser.

233
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:02,730
I can't trust you with anything.

234
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,070
You keep running away,
leaving your problems behind.

235
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,139
Just like the day you disappeared.

236
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:11,710
What was wrong with you
not showing up at the finals?

237
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,080
Tell me!

238
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,110
What's the use in that?

239
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,049
The team was going
to lose that day anyway.

240
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,419
We lost because you didn't come.

241
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,789
I had nothing to do with it.

242
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,299
Shut up if you don't know anything.

243
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,240
Running away from problems as usual!

244
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:42,970
- Hey!
- It's none of your business!

245
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,809
- So?
- Zen.

246
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:47,750
Ryu, Zen,
please don't start a fight.

247
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,029
I taught you about teamwork
only less than an hour ago,

248
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,430
yet you're still
at each other's throats.

249
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:10,799
Especially you, Zen.

250
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,269
You're the team captain.

251
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,109
Is the team going
to be able to get through this?

252
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,180
All right. Does anyone
want to apologize?

253
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,920
Hey, just say it, please.

254
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,619
This is really tiring.

255
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,359
Seriously,

256
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,190
I don't know
what you were fighting about,

257
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:36,589
but I'm done listening to you two
play the blame game.

258
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,700
Basketball is

259
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,000
a team sport.

260
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:45,069
You have to fight against
an opposing team during a game.

261
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,140
We fight over this.

262
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,309
We fight on the court,
not fighting among ourselves.

263
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,009
But since this is how you behave,

264
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,450
I'm going to do things my way.

265
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:07,019
There are tons of other ways
to punish us,

266
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,589
so why do I have to
be stuck with you for 24 hours?

267
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,089
Stop complaining already.

268
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,029
I agreed to come here
with you, didn't you?

269
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, if you refused,

270
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:16,599
I'd just pee on the court

271
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:18,440
so we could be embarrassed together.

272
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,970
Hurry up and pee, won't you?

273
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,609
Ryu!

274
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,650
Why would you tug on my hand?

275
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,279
Stay still.

276
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,079
This is my dominant hand.

277
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,750
Come on, Ryu.

278
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:36,990
How long are you
going to keep whining?

279
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,960
I've told you so many times
that it's annoying.

280
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,890
You're annoying me too.

281
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,259
You know what? Ever since I met you,

282
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,099
my life's been full of trouble.

283
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:47,759
But my life's improved.

284
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,670
See? I used to pee with two hands.
Now, I get to use three.

285
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,869
Look.

286
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,240
You're such a menace.

287
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,410
Hurry up and pee.

288
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,849
One-ball dribbling

289
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:07,150
is to dribble with two hands.

290
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,690
Ouch!

291
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,089
- Ryu!
- What are you doing?

292
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:17,529
I was dribbling.
Why did you pull me away?

293
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,900
You're holding me back.

294
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,230
Hey!

295
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,869
You're doing it again!

296
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,230
Haven't you learned your lesson?

297
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,829
Whoa, perfect timing.

298
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,039
Moron!

299
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,180
You're like a burden.

300
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,609
You're the burden.

301
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,950
- Do you want a piece of me?
- Hey, hey!

302
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,519
Still going?

303
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,890
Are you still bickering?

304
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,190
Come on.

305
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:31,470
- Catch.
- Hey.

306
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,269
Why do we have to put these away?
We're going to practice later.

307
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:36,769
What's Coach thinking?

308
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,440
What are you looking at?

309
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:40,109
Go away if you're not going to help.

310
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,049
Oh?

311
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:46,920
He actually left.

312
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:48,589
You...

313
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,150
You selfish jerk!

314
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,259
Why does it have to be me?

315
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,329
Huh?

316
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,369
- My nose...
- Jed?

317
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,650
You're such a crybaby.

318
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,880
Come on. Let's eat.

319
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,279
Get up.

320
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,279
Stop lying around.

321
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,650
Come and help me. Prince?

322
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:28,059
Help me put away the balls, Prince!

323
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,140
Can you eat properly?
Stop tugging on my arm.

324
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:48,750
Easy for you to say.
It's your left arm,

325
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,910
but it's my right arm.
Of course it's harder for me.

326
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,880
You don't understand anything.

327
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:58,819
Here.

328
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,190
Hurry up. My arm's getting tired.

329
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:07,359
Come on.

330
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,839
And why are you feeding me?

331
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:14,369
You were complaining
it was hard for you.

332
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,670
And I want to leave here
as soon as possible.

333
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,210
Hurry up and eat. Come on.

334
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:27,720
Simple.

335
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:34,289
Here.

336
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,430
I'm still chewing.

337
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,960
Then chew faster.

338
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,569
Come on.

339
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
Ugh.

340
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
Here.

341
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,009
You can start feeding yourself now.

342
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,849
I'm getting full.

343
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,359
Ryu.

344
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:13,359
What?

345
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,640
Do we really have to stay like this?

346
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,609
What are you actually
trying to say? Just say it.

347
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,109
I don't like it when someone
beats around the bush.

348
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,349
How did things end up
like this between us?

349
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,509
Huh?

350
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,920
Ryu,

351
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,519
can you help me with something?

352
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,230
Ryu, that's too much!

353
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,529
Oh? It might not
be convincing otherwise.

354
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,500
I want it to look like
I was sweating.

355
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,140
Now I look like I went for a swim.

356
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,970
That's enough.

357
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,339
Sure.

358
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,509
Atom, what's up?

359
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,220
Nothing. I just feel
like talking with you.

360
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,920
I'm going to be a bit busy.
It's almost game day,

361
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,619
so we have to practice hard.

362
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,960
Zen, what happened to your face?

363
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:51,089
Zen, the coach's calling
for another practice. Come on.

364
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,400
I'm coming!

365
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,829
Atom, I have to go.

366
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:02,069
That was close.

367
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:03,869
You weren't convincing.

368
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,839
I don't really lie to people, do I?

369
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,119
Where are you going?

370
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,059
I'm going out for a bit.

371
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,759
Don't you have practice today?

372
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:28,500
No, I don't.

373
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,029
You don't have practice?

374
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,369
Then can't you practice on your own?

375
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,839
Make the most of your days off.

376
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,710
You're an athlete.

377
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,009
You can't stop training.

378
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,980
You have to be better
than other people, understand?

379
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:47,349
Yes, Dad.

380
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,430
Here. Let me help.

381
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:05,970
I'm good.

382
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,940
Just hand it over.

383
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,509
All right, all right.

384
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,730
By the way,

385
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,869
what's going on between you and him?

386
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,799
Stay out of it.

387
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,039
You moron,

388
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,809
I went out of my way
to help you just now.

389
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:47,079
Thanks.

390
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,180
But it has nothing to do
with what you're asking me.

391
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,150
- You can dry yourself off then.
- Oh?

392
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,250
What's up with you?

393
00:26:58,589 --> 00:26:59,589
Whatever.

394
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:07,329
Lin.

395
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,829
Oh, First? What's up?

396
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:11,170
What are you doing?

397
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,869
Oh, I bought food for Ryu.

398
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,670
I tried to interview him
the other day,

399
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,309
but he got angry and walked off.

400
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:22,380
Do you have a crush on Ryu?

401
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,049
What?

402
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,779
That's silly.

403
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,519
That was a little too frank.

404
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,990
But...

405
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,230
don't tell anyone, okay?

406
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,789
Sure.

407
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,829
I'm good at keeping secrets.

408
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:42,900
Great.

409
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,019
Here. Someone asked me
to bring this to you, Ryu.

410
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,319
Who?

411
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,019
They didn't give it to you
in person.

412
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:07,359
That means they don't want
to reveal themselves just yet.

413
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:09,059
Just accept it already.

414
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,990
Bye.

415
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,000
(Ryu, eat up so you have
energy to train.)

416
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:24,109
That's nice.
Someone got you snacks as a gift.

417
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:27,640
I'm good-looking.

418
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,279
I can't help it.

419
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:30,950
(Ryu, eat up so you have
energy to train.)

420
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,559
Oh?

421
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,630
How did you get here, Atom?

422
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,869
You said you were going
on a training retreat here.

423
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,200
So I decided to come visit.

424
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,240
Oh, here.

425
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:53,970
I bought you snacks.

426
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,809
There. Have them
whenever you're hungry.

427
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,210
Thanks.

428
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,839
I've actually
been craving for these.

429
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,619
What kind of game are you playing?

430
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,319
It's not a game.

431
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,819
We're being punished.

432
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:13,789
Excuse me,

433
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,660
but are you two done talking?
It's hot in here.

434
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:21,000
Zen? Ryu? What are
you guys doing here?

435
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,769
Oh, we was about to go out
and buy snacks.

436
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,500
But Atom brought me some.

437
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,109
Zen, I just remembered.

438
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,740
Coach Ton asked
to see us in the club room

439
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,509
- right now.
- Huh?

440
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:35,609
- Let's go.
- Uh...

441
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:37,680
Atom, we'll talk later, okay?

442
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:43,250
Are you a friend of Zen's?

443
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,430
All right. That's all for today.

444
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,470
Rest, take a shower,
and get ready for bed.

445
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:59,400
But tomorrow, I'm warning you now.

446
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:00,740
It's going to be a lot more intense,

447
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,410
so get as much rest
as possible tonight.

448
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:04,670
Okay. You can go.

449
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,210
- Yes, Coach.
- Yes, Coach.

450
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:07,309
Go on.

451
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,180
You can get up first.

452
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,759
- Come on.
- Wait. Where are you two going?

453
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,359
Oh? Didn't you tell us
to go and rest?

454
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,329
I'm going to take a shower
and go to bed.

455
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,099
The order was
for the others, not you two.

456
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,900
Both of you can go
and clean up the club room.

457
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,109
- What?
- What?

458
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,410
Hey, can you pull back gently?

459
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,549
When is it going to be 24 hours?

460
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,920
Why? Are you that upset
to be stuck with me?

461
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,960
That's right. Look.

462
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:59,000
See what my life's like?
Now we're stuck doing this.

463
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:03,200
But you challenged me to a game.

464
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,869
It was you who butted into my life.

465
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,970
Get up.

466
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:39,970
What's your problem?

467
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,210
Hurry up and mop
so we can finish up.

468
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,680
You can go ahead and mop.

469
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,460
Darn it. The beds are
on different sides.

470
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,059
What's your plan?

471
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,430
Oh? Why are you standing there
looking confused?

472
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,400
We probably won't
get to sleep tonight.

473
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,000
Come on. Help me move.

474
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:12,240
Move what?

475
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:13,700
And to where?

476
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,140
Move your bed, obviously.

477
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,839
You can sleep next to me.

478
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,839
Oh.

479
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,910
Ugh, that explains. Be a Buffalo.

480
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,380
With a captain like you,

481
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,380
I'd rather quit basketball
and join a buffalo rodeo.

482
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,220
Come on. Get moving.

483
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:37,359
There. Step over.

484
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,740
Oh.

485
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,940
I haven't taken the vest off yet.

486
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:49,410
Are you going to take yours off?

487
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,769
Obviously.

488
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,549
How can I take it off?

489
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,619
All right. I'll do it first.

490
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,500
Here.

491
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,160
There you go.

492
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,119
Here.

493
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,130
Here.

494
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,799
This is tiring.

495
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:55,440
Can you step over there?

496
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:00,579
Should we sleep then?

497
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,309
I'm exhausted.

498
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,109
Sure.

499
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,809
Ryu,

500
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,110
can you come with me to pee?

501
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,010
I can't hold it in anymore.

502
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,980
At this hour?

503
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:05,579
Hey!

504
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,079
Who's that?

505
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,610
What?

506
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,050
Who are they?

507
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,420
Here!

508
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:16,849
Be a Buffalo!

509
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,289
What on earth is that?

510
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,360
- Take the shirt!
- Be a Buffalo!

511
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,030
- Be a Buffalo!
- Come and take it!

512
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,969
Can't reach it?

513
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,000
It's okay, Chogun.

514
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,239
Come on.

515
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,309
Give it back!

516
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:40,380
- Give it to me!
- Hey, what are you doing?

517
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:43,610
Zen,

518
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,280
you still recognize your seniors?

519
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,519
Why are you guys doing this?

520
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:54,519
I heard you accepted the girl
who shared that clip of us.

521
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,789
Mm. So?

522
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,929
We got expelled because of her.

523
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,829
Don't you remember?

524
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,369
Or did you two work together
to do this to us?

525
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Huh?

526
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,070
Lame.

527
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:12,480
And how is this any
of your business, street rat?

528
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,780
So, Zen?

529
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,920
If you hadn't done drugs,
the clip wouldn't exist.

530
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,449
Stop blaming others.

531
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,949
- Hey.
- Let go!

532
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,119
Let Chogun go!

533
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,219
- Jedi!
- Jedi!

534
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,619
Let go of me!

535
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,889
Let go.

536
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,559
Shut up!

537
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:33,230
I'll knock you out.

538
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,599
Quit being a jerk.

539
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:37,730
If you want to settle things,
then settle them with me.

540
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,139
Don't hurt my friends.

541
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,309
You really love
your friends, don't you?

542
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,710
Ryu!

543
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,880
- Zen!
- Hey, let's rumble!

544
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:54,750
Ryu!

545
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,019
You!

546
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,489
No!

547
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:05,360
Don't hurt us!
We're on the school team! Don't!

548
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,329
Chogun!

549
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,030
Hey, guys!

550
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,670
Use the strategy!

551
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:13,900
Be a Buffalo!

552
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,440
- Yes, Captain!
- Yes, Captain!

553
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,670
Come on.

554
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:20,880
Zen, untie me and let me
beat these jerks up.

555
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,510
No, we can't. Rules are rules.

556
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,179
You always make things complicated.

557
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,550
Are we done
with your stupid "Buffalo" plan?

558
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,789
Hey!

559
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:35,460
Come on!

560
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,199
Hey!

561
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,969
Catch! Come on!

562
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:44,199
Bring it on!

563
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,539
Hey.

564
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,940
Hey!

565
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,539
Hey.

566
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:03,250
That's it!

567
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,159
Yes!

568
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,789
Over here!

569
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,289
All right!

570
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:14,699
Hey!

571
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,940
Bring it on!

572
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:25,639
Come on!

573
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,719
- Whoa!
- Zen!

574
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,349
Do you think you're so tough?

575
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,389
Huh?

576
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:41,190
Security! Over there!

577
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,429
- Have you called the police?
- Yes!

578
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,800
- Hey!
- Let's go!

579
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:47,960
Hey!

580
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,099
Run!

581
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,199
Scaredy cat!

582
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:59,239
How are you guys doing?
Is anyone hurt?

583
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:02,710
Thanks so much
for calling the cops, Lin.

584
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,480
I didn't. It was a bluff.

585
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,119
You're so cool, Lin.

586
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:12,489
I know.

587
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:16,730
Chogun, how are you doing?

588
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,389
Be a Buffalo.

589
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,159
Well done.

590
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,400
It's good you're okay.

591
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:23,900
Great.

592
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,110
This is serious,

593
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,780
yet no one thought of telling me?

594
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,349
What were you thinking?
Dealing with it on your own.

595
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:41,820
It was very chaotic.

596
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,989
So?

597
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:46,820
What if something serious happened?
Who's going to take responsibility?

598
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,429
I'll take responsibility, Coach.

599
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:04,610
As the team captain,

600
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,239
I'd like to take
full responsibility.

601
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,789
Do you think you alone can
handle everything?

602
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,989
They brought weapons.

603
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,730
That means you could've been killed!

604
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,139
I'd like to take
responsibility as well.

605
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,050
Me too.

606
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,750
Me too.

607
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,650
- Same here.
- And me.

608
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,789
- Me too.
- Me too.

609
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,019
- Me too.
- Me too.

610
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:57,030
- I'd like to as well.
- Oh.

611
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,260
And you,

612
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,699
why didn't you come and get me then?

613
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,329
You're all so...

614
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:16,010
You're lucky no one got hurt.

615
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,679
But you want to bear
the responsibility together?

616
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:22,789
Good. That's the team spirit.
You're starting to get it now.

617
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,320
Since all of you said you wanted
to share the responsibility,

618
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,920
then I'll let you have it.

619
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,559
Give me 100 laps then. Go!

620
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:36,170
Go!

621
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:38,369
- Yes, Coach!
- Yes, Coach!

622
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,480
What are you smiling about?

623
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,579
Oh?

624
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,809
Do you think you don't have to run?

625
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,519
Collective responsibility.

626
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,980
- Uh-huh!
- Me too?

627
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,190
- That's right! Get going!
- Dad!

628
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,750
- You're hurting me!
- Go on!

629
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,590
Great.

630
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,929
Hey, Chogun.

631
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,829
What's wrong? You're so quiet.

632
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,900
Jed, stop it. You're trying
to bully him again, aren't you?

633
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,139
I'm not.

634
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:17,610
I want to apologize.

635
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,139
I'm sorry, Chogun.

636
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,510
Wow, that's very touching.

637
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,019
You're not just Jed.

638
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,550
You're Jesdaporn Pholdee!

639
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,519
Hardy har har.

640
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,159
Anyway,

641
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,630
we're sorry, Chogun.

642
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,329
- We didn't rush in to help you.
- Mm.

643
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:43,429
You're all friends with me, right?

644
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:46,969
Yes, you're our friend.

645
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,610
I've made friends!

646
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,409
Ryu, Zen,

647
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:56,409
you guys can be
my leaders, not friends.

648
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,110
Leader Ryu and Leader Zen.

649
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,550
What about Leader Jed?

650
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:02,579
- Ha.
- Shut up.

651
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,760
Well then. This is a special night.

652
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:09,559
So we have to throw
a special celebration party.

653
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:10,730
Boom!

654
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,429
Isn't that a good idea?

655
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,329
What do you think, Zen?

656
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,670
You're the captain.

657
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:20,070
We'll sip it like adults.

658
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,300
Right?

659
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,940
- Hey!
- Take it easy!

660
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,920
Is it okay to let this slide?

661
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,360
Come on. We'll let it go for now.

662
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,420
And we'll bust them for it tomorrow.

663
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:46,159
I think 100 laps should
teach them a lesson.

664
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,260
I have nothing to do with this one.

665
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
I reported it to you.

666
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:50,699
I know that.

667
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,340
I should go. It's making me thirsty.
I need to get my fix.

668
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:00,739
Hold it there, Dad.

669
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:02,710
- Goodnight.
- Dad!

670
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,320
Are they going to wake up
in time for practice tomorrow?

671
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:24,269
Ryu,

672
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,639
have another one.

673
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:28,840
Come on.

674
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,610
- Here.
- I'll pass.

675
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:35,139
I'll save my strength for when
Coach punishes us tomorrow.

676
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,280
He's a drunkard.
Do you think he won't know?

677
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,650
I know that.

678
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,920
Well, go ahead
and sleep if you want.

679
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:59,940
Go to sleep.

680
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:57,360
Zen,

681
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,159
you can hate me if you want.

682
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:25,320
As for the past,

683
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,389
I know I was horrible.

684
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:33,300
But right now,

685
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:37,570
I want to play
on the same team as you.

686
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,579
I want to be
on the same team as you too.

687
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,329
My client actually requested Ryu.

688
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:39,559
Do you want to do it
your way or my way?

689
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:43,500
What do you want?
Tell me, and I'll do it.

690
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,170
I want you to come back
and play for Boss Tos.

691
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:47,300
When am I going to be able
to pay off my life debt?

692
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,800
I want it to be over as well.

693
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:51,340
Shoot!

694
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:52,170
Hey!
