1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,039
Mom, what are you doing?

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,719
I'm throwing these out.
Why should we keep them?

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,160
They're destroying your future.

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,199
No, Mom!

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,609
Dad gave this to me for the tryouts.

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,000
Don't ever mention
your father to me again.

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,679
- Mom, Mom!
- Ryu!

8
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,839
I'm the one here now, not him!

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,920
- Restrain him.
- Yes, ma'am.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,438
Mom? Mom!

11
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,119
- Excuse us.
- Let go of me!

12
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,560
- Sir. Calm down, sir.
- Mom!

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,759
Mom, let me go!

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,880
Mom! Let go of me!

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,159
- Sir!
- Mom!

16
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,960
Mom! Let me go!

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
Mom!

18
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,439
(The Rebound)

19
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,439
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,280
- Hey!
- Hey!

21
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,439
All right.

22
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,639
- Ah!
- So good!

23
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,120
That is so true.

24
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,840
Take your glasses.

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,479
Ryu's not here yet?

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,280
I called him many times,
but he didn't answer.

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
This is new to me.

28
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,639
Don't expect much from him.

29
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,879
He'll come if he's coming.

30
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,530
- Cheers.
- Ryu's like a ninja.

31
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,000
He's always popping in and out.

32
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,280
He's like a hero, Chogun.

33
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,719
He appeared to rescue you.
Then he's gone.

34
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,960
Here. Cheers.

35
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,800
- Cheers.
- Right on. Cheers.

36
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,639
- Cheers.
- Bring it over.

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Gotcha.

38
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,360
Do you think you're so tough?

39
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,879
- Huh? Do you think so?
- Do you?

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,960
Come on, tough guy.

41
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey, let's make a toast.

42
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,800
- Hey.
- Come on. Drink up.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
More?

44
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,279
Why didn't you stay
with your friends and celebrate?

45
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,050
I'll pass, Grandma.

46
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,519
I wanted to come home to you.

47
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,730
I was gone for days,

48
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,839
and you had to make
the desserts all by yourself.

49
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,839
I feel guilty.

50
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,879
Why would you?

51
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,240
I should be one to feel that way.
I wasn't there to cheer for you.

52
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,959
I was too busy dealing
with customers.

53
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,879
Should I cheer from the sidelines
for your next game?

54
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,199
Sure, Grandma.

55
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,079
So how did it go?

56
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,000
Weren't you competing
against Atom's team?

57
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,730
They were really good.

58
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,879
But it was like
our team was possessed.

59
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,120
We fought tooth and nail

60
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,319
and somehow ended up winning.

61
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,480
And it wasn't because
Atom let you win, right?

62
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,839
No way!

63
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,079
Our team was excellent.

64
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,079
Not to mention Ryu. He kept scoring

65
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,730
despite the fact
that he likes to fly solo.

66
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,519
Yes, I believe you.

67
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,800
Just like when you two played
in middle school, right?

68
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
It was incredible, Grandma.

69
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,079
Our team actually won twice.

70
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,319
We even get
to represent the district.

71
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,639
(Coach Ton)

72
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,680
Hello, Coach?

73
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,279
You're up.

74
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,959
Indeed.

75
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
How come...

76
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,199
you slept here? Who told you?

77
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,639
Coach Ton.

78
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,879
The person who found you
noticed your uniform.

79
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,199
They probably informed the director.

80
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,759
Wow, news gets around quickly.

81
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,120
I was planning
on escaping the hospital tonight.

82
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,040
Huh? You've got to be joking.

83
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,600
Escape?

84
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,800
So what happened?

85
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,720
Tell me.

86
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,160
I can't do that now.

87
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,079
Oh? Why not? I'm curious.
Spit it out, already.

88
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,680
You have to tell me right now.

89
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,519
- Zen!
- What?

90
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,720
I said I can't tell you now.

91
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,360
I'm your captain.

92
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,800
So you have to tell me.

93
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,439
No.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,800
I want to know. Tell me.
Don't leave me hanging.

95
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,959
I need to pee.

96
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,160
I have to go right now.
Do you understand?

97
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,399
My arm hurts, so you have
to take me to the bathroom.

98
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,439
Huh?

99
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,040
You're the captain.

100
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,720
Isn't it your duty
to look after your teammates?

101
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,120
Haven't you finished
taking off your pants?

102
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,160
You'll pee your pants.

103
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,079
I'm trying.

104
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,639
My arm's injured.
Be patient, won't you?

105
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,920
You're all talk and no help.

106
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,839
You've still got quite the mouth
despite being injured.

107
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,120
Whiner.

108
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,159
Why is this on so tight?

109
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,559
Let me see. How tight can it be?

110
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,759
Come on.

111
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,039
It is tight.

112
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,878
See? I told you.

113
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,279
Give me a second.

114
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,600
- Zen.
- Huh?

115
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,919
Hurry up.

116
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,360
I can't hold it in much longer.

117
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm about to burst.

118
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,519
- Right here.
- Is there anything...

119
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,639
Come on.

120
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,450
Ah! I'm sorry!

121
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,000
Wait.

122
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,840
It's nothing.

123
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,330
I'm just helping my friend

124
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,210
untie his pants.

125
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,210
- He needs to pee.
- Oh, I see.

126
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,480
And have you managed to untie it?

127
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,450
Oh, almost.

128
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,679
I need to get back to my rounds.

129
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,960
Let me know if there's anything.

130
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,480
Okay.

131
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,519
Come on!

132
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,799
- Here. Go ahead and pee.
- Okay.

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,210
Zen,

134
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,919
you should go home.
Isn't Grandma alone?

135
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,519
She ordered me
to come and look after you.

136
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,639
She probably loves you
more than me by the looks of it.

137
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,840
Jealous much?

138
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,639
What?

139
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,559
Just shut up.

140
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,279
What's up, First?

141
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,360
Zen, how's Ryu doing?

142
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,480
Tell him I'm not dead yet.

143
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,480
Mm. Did you hear that?

144
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,919
He's not dead.

145
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,519
Can you let us see him?

146
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,039
- What?
- It's Ryu!

147
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,360
- Ouch!
- Zen!

148
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,559
Sorry!

149
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,360
Can you see him now?

150
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,279
Ryu, how's your body?

151
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,090
- How hurt are you?
- Right? How are you doing?

152
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,600
I heard they tried
to break your arms.

153
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,090
It was brutal.

154
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,840
I'll probably have
to rest for three weeks.

155
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,480
I have a small fracture in my arm.

156
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,759
- Shoot!
- Oh no!

157
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,679
Will you be able to recover in time
for our next game?

158
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,559
Piece of cake.

159
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,840
I was hurt even more during street
basketball and still played.

160
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,399
Zen, are you staying there
to keep an eye on him?

161
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,559
Yes.

162
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,879
He can't even pee on his own.

163
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I feel sorry for him.

164
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,080
I can pee.

165
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,440
My pants were tied
a little too tight.

166
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,000
Were you ambushed, Ninja Ryu?

167
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,480
Mm. But I'm fine, Chogun.

168
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,120
Ryu the Hero is the best.

169
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
By the way, who hurt you?

170
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,279
So? Do you know?

171
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,720
We'll deal with them.
How could they do that to you?

172
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,919
It was that number 4 from Interhigh.
I recognized him.

173
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,480
- Whoa!
- Shoot!

174
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,039
Zen,

175
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,799
hang up. I want to sleep.

176
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,960
But they're worried about you.

177
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
That's all for now.

178
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,120
I'm going to sleep.

179
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,840
Well then. Get some rest.

180
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,919
See you guys tomorrow.

181
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

182
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,720
Get well soon.

183
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,720
- Get well soon, Ryu.
- Get well soon.

184
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,960
- See you later.
- Ryu the Hero.

185
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,480
Zen, you can go home and rest.

186
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,039
It's not uncomfortable
to sleep here.

187
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,159
Hey, it's okay.

188
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,759
I'll manage.

189
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,120
I want to stay.

190
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,960
You want to sleep with me?

191
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,200
No! Well...

192
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,399
I'm the captain.

193
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,399
I have to look after
my team, don't I?

194
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,240
Take good care of me, Captain.

195
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,240
Are you still hurt?

196
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,039
It's okay now.

197
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,399
Can you try

198
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,120
wiggling your fingers?
Is that possible?

199
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,879
Of course. My arm's fractured,

200
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,200
not broken.

201
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,519
How are you doing, boys?

202
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,679
Grandma?

203
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,159
I'll get that for you.

204
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,759
Hi, Grandma.

205
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,240
How are you, Ryu?

206
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,440
I'm okay.

207
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,399
That's good to hear.

208
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,559
I made your favorite.

209
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,080
Thank you.

210
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,440
By the way, did the doctor
mention any food restrictions?

211
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,159
I don't think so.

212
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,080
But I'll double-check
with the nurse.

213
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,759
- Thanks.
- No problem.

214
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,840
- Hey, Coach.
- Quick recovery, tiger.

215
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,159
I've got thick skin.

216
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,480
- Coach Ton, this is my grandma.
- Oh.

217
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,080
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello, Coach.

218
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,480
Do you have any updates?

219
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,600
I've talked to the police.

220
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,399
But it's difficult because there
weren't any security cameras.

221
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,240
So the case was tabled
and filed as a regular disturbance.

222
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,759
But Ryu knows who beat him up.

223
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,279
I know too, Zen.

224
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,440
But they have powerful backing,
so the police are doing nothing.

225
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,080
What is this country coming to?

226
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,480
The powerful ones prevail.

227
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,399
If I was the prime minister,

228
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,559
I'd give them a good rap
on the noggin.

229
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,879
Grandma, easy there.

230
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,679
Ryu, who do you live
with at the moment?

231
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
- Alone, sir.
- Alone?

232
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,080
Will you be okay
on your own like this?

233
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,600
Let's do it this way.

234
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
He can stay at my house.

235
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,678
- Zen and I can keep an eye on him.
- Grandma,

236
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,879
no way.

237
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,000
Is that going to be
an inconvenience?

238
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,240
But Grandma...

239
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,679
Not at all.

240
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,720
The more, the merrier.
I'd like that.

241
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Okay.

242
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,240
All right.

243
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,039
Please look after him.

244
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,200
He might be able to recover
in time for our next game.

245
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,399
Oh, as you wish!

246
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,960
Here. You can sleep
in Zen's bedroom.

247
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,559
- Yes, Grandma.
- Grandma!

248
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,279
Why won't you let him
sleep downstairs?

249
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,919
Oh? His arm is hurt.

250
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,960
It might get worse
if he walks into things.

251
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,038
But...

252
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:28,039
Don't you want him
to recover in time?

253
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,039
Okay.

254
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,679
Are you worried about someone else
more than your grandson now?

255
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:45,799
It's not a bother at all, Ryu.
Get some good rest.

256
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,639
Let Zen know if you need anything.

257
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,879
Yes, Grandma.

258
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,080
I'll cook something
delicious for dinner.

259
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,759
Thank you.

260
00:16:58,919 --> 00:16:59,919
Zen,

261
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,639
does your family sell donuts too?

262
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,279
Ah! Shoot!

263
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,559
What's wrong?

264
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,559
Stop being a crybaby.

265
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,119
It's only a fracture.

266
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,240
Oh? Grandma said
you have to look after me.

267
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,480
Do you want
to have a cast on both arms?

268
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,799
Stop teasing me already.

269
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,680
Speaking of which,

270
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,960
your bedroom's quite homey.

271
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,890
Maybe I should stick around.

272
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,799
Just you wait.

273
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,119
I'll kick you out
once the cast comes off.

274
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,920
- Whoa.
- Just you wait.

275
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,890
Très harsh.

276
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,960
Ugh.

277
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,079
Oh? What's wrong now?

278
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,119
Well, my shoulder's sore.

279
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,680
It's a bit... sticky.

280
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,200
Sticky?

281
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,440
Right. It's sore.

282
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,680
Around here?

283
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,200
Zen,

284
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,079
can you massage here too?

285
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,890
It's sore as well.

286
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,480
Right here.

287
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,359
Ouch!

288
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,799
Zen! Was that deliberate?

289
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,839
I can't move my arm anymore.
You have to give me a massage now.

290
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,650
And do it properly.

291
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,680
Massage!

292
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,920
Those guys are so horrible.

293
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,920
They lost but refused to accept it.

294
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,559
Right?

295
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,410
How can they call
themselves athletes?

296
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,279
Coach said there were
no security cameras in the area.

297
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,960
They also have powerful backing,

298
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,319
so no one can do anything.

299
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,279
That really sucks.

300
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,599
Zen, should we give Interhigh
a piece of our mind?

301
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,319
That's right.
Let's bash their heads in.

302
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,650
I agree. That number 4.

303
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,440
I've hated his guts since the game.

304
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,039
Acting all high and mighty.

305
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,960
You guys have my support.

306
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,240
But I'm worried
our team might get banned.

307
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,279
We made history
for our back-to-back winning streak.

308
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,279
Right. Our page's engagement
has increased by 20 percent.

309
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,920
See?

310
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,759
But are we going
to let things end this way?

311
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,410
Zen, what do you say?

312
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,119
Hey.

313
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,839
Don't pressure him, guys.

314
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,319
I'll sort this out myself.

315
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,410
What's it about?

316
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,559
Your team is a sore loser.

317
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,319
Why did you guys beat Ryu up?

318
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,480
What? Ryu got beaten up?
And my team's responsible?

319
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,559
Yes!

320
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,119
Take me to number 4 on your team.

321
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,650
You mean Pipo?

322
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,519
- Take me to him right now!
- Zen!

323
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,240
You don't have to!

324
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,839
Are you still going
to defend your team?

325
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,279
Is this what you call
being a friend to me?

326
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,440
You misunderstood me.
I'm not defending them.

327
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,960
I want to protect you.

328
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,680
What do you mean?

329
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,720
I'll deal with Pipo.

330
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,759
I don't want you
to get hurt as well.

331
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,890
Ryu already got beaten up.

332
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,759
And your team still has to compete.

333
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,079
What would they do
if something happened to you?

334
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,079
I don't care. I have to settle this.

335
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,559
Wait, Zen! Stop!

336
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,519
Let me handle this.

337
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,759
If it doesn't get settled,
then you can meet him.

338
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,720
Okay?

339
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,720
Trust me.

340
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,720
- It's okay. We'll...
- Hey!

341
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,170
- What?
- Huh?

342
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,079
What on earth is wrong with you?

343
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,319
I'm wrong, just like you are!
You enjoy hurting people, don't you?

344
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,519
What are you on about?

345
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,839
You and the guys beat up Ryu
from Tanwarin, didn't you?

346
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,680
Oh, that. And how is that
any of your business?

347
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,039
Why did you do it?

348
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,959
Leave it on the court.

349
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,359
He was rough with me first.

350
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,039
Do you think I'd let that slide?

351
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,440
You were rough too.

352
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,170
But I didn't see anyone coming
to pick a fight with you.

353
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,359
- Stay out of this.
- Hey!

354
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Do you know who gave you
the scholarship to transfer here?

355
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,319
My dad.

356
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
It was him.

357
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,079
And didn't he teach you

358
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,599
how real basketball players play?

359
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,119
(I can do it!)

360
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,960
What are you doing?

361
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,799
You kept this jacket?

362
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,279
Yes.

363
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
Anyway, it's good you're here.

364
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,359
I want you to take me home
to get some more clothes.

365
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,720
When do you want to go?

366
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,000
- Maybe...
- Right now.

367
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,359
- But it's...
- Just come. Let's go.

368
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
You're back.

369
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,880
I couldn't reach you at all.

370
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,319
I've been busy.

371
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,119
I went to a retreat
and had a game to play.

372
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:21,359
And what happened to your arm?

373
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,519
It's nothing.
I'll get better eventually.

374
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,920
Good to see you back.

375
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,519
I think we should

376
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,240
drink until the sun rises tonight.

377
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:34,839
We can celebrate your return.

378
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,279
I'll pass.

379
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,519
Why?

380
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,960
Are you chickening out?

381
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,119
It's hardly an injury.

382
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,119
Can't you just drink with me?

383
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,960
I'll make order it.

384
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,279
Hey.

385
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,240
Did you come back
to pack your things?

386
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,720
Mm.

387
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,599
Ryu,

388
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,200
where are you going?

389
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,799
I'm staying at Zen's.

390
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:32,920
Zen,

391
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,319
let's go.

392
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,960
Huh?

393
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,160
You still have that jacket?

394
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,799
I... haven't had time
to throw it out.

395
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,920
Lies.

396
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,559
You wouldn't be able
to throw that away.

397
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,799
Let's just go.

398
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,720
Ryu.

399
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,960
Zen.

400
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,480
Take care of Ryu for me.

401
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,079
- And about last time...
- I didn't go to the police.

402
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,000
I was worried Ryu might
get roped in if I did.

403
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,039
But if there's a next time,

404
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,319
I definitely will.

405
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,559
Whatever.

406
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,119
I was just testing Ryu.

407
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,000
I didn't do anything to you.

408
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,079
Don't do that again

409
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,720
if you still want my respect.

410
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,440
Okay.

411
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
I know.

412
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,440
Let's go, Zen.

413
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,519
Zen,

414
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,319
can you take a photo of me and him?

415
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,960
- Huh?
- Huh?

416
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:51,880
Go on!

417
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,079
So I can show it to Tos.

418
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,720
Then he'll know your arm's injured
and that you can't play.

419
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,319
One, two, three.

420
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,680
- There.
- One more.

421
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,559
Come on.

422
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,000
Just in case.

423
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,160
One, two, three.

424
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,359
Anyway, I should go.

425
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,400
Mm.

426
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Come on, Zen.

427
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,759
Let's go.

428
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,559
By the way...

429
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,519
About Ryu...

430
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,440
This is my relaxing time.

431
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,480
I don't want to listen.

432
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,799
Okay, Boss.

433
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,920
That time when my dad
wanted me to take over from him,

434
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,400
If you hadn't told me,

435
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,119
I'd have run away
to somewhere overseas.

436
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,640
- Right?
- Boss,

437
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,079
I said it

438
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,039
because I really believed it.

439
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,319
Q,

440
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,079
Do you still trust me?

441
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Of course.

442
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,799
And you?

443
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,119
Can I put my trust in you?

444
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,119
This is for you, Ryu.

445
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,519
- Thank you.
- Tell me what you like and don't.

446
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:39,559
You're spoiling him!

447
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,599
All right.

448
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,160
This is yours, Zen.

449
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,279
I should get more than he does.

450
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,519
Oh? Here. Take the whole squid.

451
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:53,200
There.

452
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,279
Oh my!

453
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,880
I almost didn't get to eat it.

454
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,359
I nearly missed it.

455
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,319
Everything you cook
is delicious, Grandma.

456
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
Here.

457
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,119
Eat up.

458
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,160
So you can take your meds.

459
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:25,920
Mm.

460
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,880
Oh? Who's here at this hour?

461
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,359
Zen, I've sorted that out.

462
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,559
You got into a fight
with those guys?

463
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,319
Yes. They were in the wrong.

464
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
Besides,

465
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,799
I wanted to prove to you

466
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,559
I really had nothing
to do with them.

467
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,000
You didn't have to go that far.

468
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,119
I feel guilty now.

469
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,359
You don't need to
settle things with them anymore.

470
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
It's over.

471
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,160
What do you mean?

472
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,240
How's Grandma?

473
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,000
She's fine.

474
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,759
She's having dinner with Ryu.

475
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,519
Ryu's here?

476
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,519
Mm.

477
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,160
His arm is hurt.

478
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,960
So Coach told him

479
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,160
to stay with me until
he gets better.

480
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,440
Oh.

481
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,039
By the way,

482
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,480
have you eaten?

483
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,160
Do you want to join us?

484
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,559
I've already had something.

485
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,720
Well then.
I should head back inside.

486
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,799
Wait, Zen.

487
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,559
Hm? What's up?

488
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,319
I'm tired.

489
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,119
I took a lot of painkillers.

490
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:39,359
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

491
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,880
I'm worried
I might fall asleep on my way home.

492
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,079
Then you have to come inside.

493
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,039
You can't ride back now.
It's dangerous.

494
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
It's already late.

495
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,079
Come inside.

496
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,079
Then can I stay the night?

497
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,720
What a shame. We could've had
dinner together if you came earlier.

498
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,640
It's okay, Grandma.

499
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,079
I'm already bothering you
by asking to stay the night.

500
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,319
Not at all.

501
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,799
Thank you.

502
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,480
Grandma, should I help you
prepare the banana leaves.

503
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,519
It's okay.
Keep your friends company.

504
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,079
I'll take it from where we left off.

505
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,079
Zen,

506
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,559
here. I'll help.

507
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,680
Come on.

508
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Oops.

509
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,759
You can squeeze
the water out a little.

510
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,279
My bad.

511
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,119
- Hey!
- Ah, sorry!

512
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,769
Atom!

513
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,039
Hey, I think that was deliberate.
It's inside out.

514
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,329
No, it wasn't.

515
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,440
- Was too.
- Was not.

516
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,559
Oh? What now?

517
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,960
Come on.

518
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,719
Are you messing with me?

519
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,039
Take your meds.

520
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,400
Ouch.

521
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,679
Oh, I'll do it.

522
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,000
Jerk.

523
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,159
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

524
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,840
Why were you embracing me?

525
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,479
I should ask you the same question!

526
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,159
You embraced me!

527
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,000
- You did!
- What's wrong with you?

528
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,559
And what's wrong with you?

529
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,039
Why were you embracing me?

530
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,329
- How entertaining.
- Get away from me.

531
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,480
You get away from me.

532
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:22,480
- I'll help you, Grandma.
- I'll help you, Grandma.

533
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,038
- Huh? All right.
- Here.

534
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,159
- Take this.
- Okay.

535
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,360
Be careful. It's hot.

536
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:38,239
Hey, Tomcat.

537
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,880
Your phone's ringing.
Answer it. It's annoying.

538
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,159
- My name is Atom.
- Oh.

539
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,440
Hello?

540
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,880
Yes, Dad.

541
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:53,289
Sure.

542
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,518
- Grandma.
- Yes?

543
00:37:58,519 --> 00:37:59,639
Zen,

544
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
I have to go home.

545
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,119
My dad wants to see me.

546
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,159
All right. Ride home safely.

547
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:06,639
Bye.

548
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,159
Oh? Leaving already?

549
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,679
Ride safely.

550
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,840
I'm worried about you.

551
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:17,639
Jerk.

552
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,119
Ryu,

553
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,079
if you have enough energy
to mess with people,

554
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:26,400
come and help me set the table.

555
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,599
Yes, Captain.

556
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:29,289
Come here.

557
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,719
A student on a sports scholarship
got into a fight with his teammates.

558
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,289
You punched someone in the eye,
and he ended up in the hospital.

559
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,480
What on earth was
going on in your head?

560
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:47,559
They beat up my friend.
He ended up in the hospital too.

561
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,559
And did you really have
to involve yourself?

562
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,079
Do you realize

563
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,400
your scholarship's
about to be terminated?

564
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,920
Go and apologize
to the deputy and his son.

565
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
No.

566
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,679
You dare to defy my orders?

567
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,880
You're always ordering me around.

568
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,119
Have you ever asked
what I want to be?

569
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:14,289
This dream
of becoming an athlete is yours.

570
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,769
And I've made it come true.

571
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:20,559
Everything I do is

572
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,039
for you.

573
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,079
Go on. Get dressed.

574
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:28,639
You and I are going to apologize
to the deputy and his son.

575
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,559
You taught me to be an athlete.

576
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,289
You taught me
how to be a good sport.

577
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,239
If you do something wrong,

578
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:40,719
you should be punished, right?

579
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:44,599
What are you trying to say?

580
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:48,440
I can't keep playing on this team.

581
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,769
I'm quitting.

582
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,599
Shot number 37 scored.

583
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,679
Shot number 38 didn't score.

584
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:19,359
Chogun,

585
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,329
if you have a stronger stance,

586
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,960
you'll be able to make the shot.

587
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,039
Hm?

588
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:25,639
I've been watching you.

589
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:27,360
That's what the stats say.

590
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,719
Is it true, Jedi?

591
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:30,400
- Try it.
- Okay.

592
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,289
- Like this?
- That's it.

593
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Left leg...

594
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,119
Shoot!

595
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,769
- I made the shot!
- I told you.

596
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:40,809
That's so awesome!

597
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,809
I told you. You'd make it.

598
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,158
Thanks.

599
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,360
No worries.

600
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,599
Seeing you smile

601
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,480
makes me happy, Chogun.

602
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:11,440
- I should keep practicing.
- Sure.

603
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,329
I'll keep you company.

604
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,480
I'll sit over there
and do my homework.

605
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,679
- Mm.
- Go and get the ball.

606
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,519
Jedi,

607
00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:28,920
is this the right way to stand?

608
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,440
A little bit further apart.

609
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:31,960
Like that.

610
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:34,880
Bend down, set...

611
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,599
And jump!

612
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:50,239
Why are you so clumsy,
Your Highness?

613
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:56,079
Huh? You collect these too?

614
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,119
Give them back.

615
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,289
- Let me peek a little.
- Hey!

616
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,519
You have quite the collection.

617
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,840
I said give them back.

618
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,840
Why are you keeping these tickets?

619
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,400
They're keepsakes

620
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:22,639
of when I get to hang out
with my crush.

621
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,079
Oh?

622
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,400
Huh?

623
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,960
But these are the tickets
for the movies and games

624
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,400
I went to with you.

625
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:37,639
That's right.

626
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,960
Prince,

627
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,480
what do you mean by that?

628
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:47,480
What do you think I mean?

629
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,480
It's okay if you're disgusted.

630
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,039
I understand.

631
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:01,880
How can I be disgusted?

632
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:05,199
When I...

633
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:08,679
probably feel the same way.

634
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:11,159
Jed?

635
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,519
Maybe we should...

636
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,769
go out?

637
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,840
Jed,

638
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,239
are you for real?

639
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,199
It's already come to this.
What do you think?

640
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:37,360
Do you agree?

641
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,559
Mm.

642
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,960
But if our relationship
doesn't survive,

643
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,920
you have to promise me

644
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,280
we'll stay friends

645
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,000
no matter what.

646
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Do you understand?

647
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,320
Mm.

648
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,400
That's for sure.

649
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:33,039
Ton, about the new building,

650
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:35,199
I’ve filed an objection.

651
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,480
There's a board meeting
this coming Monday.

652
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,239
Ugh...

653
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,039
Aun,

654
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,960
I have a question,
and you have to answer honestly.

655
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:48,639
Do you think

656
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,960
the board will give in?

657
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,639
Ton,

658
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,480
do you remember the finals
when you were captain?

659
00:44:57,559 --> 00:44:58,840
What are you on about?

660
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,760
Can you answer the question?

661
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,280
During the first quarter,

662
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,079
Interhigh trampled us 30-8.

663
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:10,960
That's right. You guys were nervous
and were so clumsy

664
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,760
that you made a bunch of mistakes.

665
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,920
I still remember your words.

666
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,280
You said there are
four quarters in basketball.

667
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,320
"I can't fight solo
if the game hasn't ended."

668
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,480
"Will you guys join me
in this battle?"

669
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,199
And we managed to win.

670
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:33,559
I don't know
how much of a chance we have.

671
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:36,280
But no matter what the situation,

672
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,320
there's still hope.

673
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:44,679
I don't know what
the board is thinking.

674
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,679
They keep insisting on allocating
the budget to the sciences

675
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,159
and cutting back on sports.

676
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:54,639
By the way, how are the kids?

677
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,440
The kids?

678
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,760
Ugh.

679
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,519
I feel sorry for them.

680
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,760
How come?

681
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,599
It's like they're stuck
in a nice dream, you know?

682
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,000
I'm worried
how they'll feel if they wake up

683
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,719
and have to face the truth.

684
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,480
The hospital said

685
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,280
your mom's handled all the expenses.

686
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:38,639
I think...

687
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,760
Mom visited me that night.

688
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,599
Does that mean

689
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:46,639
she's been keeping an eye on you
after all this time?

690
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,480
I guess.

691
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:52,639
What really happened
between you and her?

692
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,199
And when you didn't
turn up for the finals,

693
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:58,880
what happened?

694
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:02,559
Was I the reason you didn't come?

695
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,960
It was nothing.

696
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,320
It was a long time ago.

697
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:13,800
I can't remember anymore.

698
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,400
Ryu,

699
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,760
can you tell me about it?

700
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
You should go to sleep.

701
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,559
Don't you have to
work early tomorrow?

702
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,440
Ryu!

703
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,800
Next time, let me know

704
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,599
if there's anything.

705
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,599
You're acting
like an elementary school kid.

706
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,199
Come on.

707
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,480
Promise me, okay?

708
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Please?

709
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:17,440
You gave me your promise.

710
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:20,639
Remember it.

711
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,920
Do you want
to wipe yourself down now?

712
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,039
I have to go out later.

713
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:33,679
In a bit.

714
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,679
Are you trying to stink yourself up?

715
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,079
Have you been...

716
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:44,960
sniffing me in secret?

717
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,519
Moron.

718
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,199
Hello, Atom.

719
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,880
Sure. I'll be there.

720
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:15,039
Is something the matter?
You didn't reply to my texts.

721
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:16,679
Nothing's the matter.

722
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:19,039
I just had to
sort out some problems.

723
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:22,800
Oh? Does that mean
everything's sorted?

724
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:24,440
Is that why you were
able to come over?

725
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,840
Zen,

726
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,559
the thing is

727
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,320
I want to tell you something.

728
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:34,199
Well, I...

729
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,760
I probably have feelings...

730
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:40,840
Hey, Zen!

731
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,400
Why didn't you check your messages?

732
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,639
There's something urgent
I want to discuss.

733
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:45,400
Hey, Atom.

734
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,920
Apologies, but it's really urgent.

735
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:51,960
Zen, I should go.

736
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:53,239
Huh?

737
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:55,280
And what about
what you were going to tell me?

738
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,119
We'll meet again later.

739
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,440
I'll let you know.

740
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,400
Bye.

741
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,239
Oh?

742
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,480
And what's the urgency?

743
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:13,239
What prank are you
going to play on me now?

744
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,719
You deliberately
sent Atom away, didn't you?

745
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,000
Seriously,

746
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,800
why did you do that?

747
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:32,960
I have feelings for you.

748
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,960
I know I treated you
badly in middle school.

749
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,480
But it was because I didn't know
what it was called

750
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,000
or whether it's wrong.

751
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,599
But I know now.

752
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,960
Come on, Ryu. Stop messing with me.

753
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:05,039
Do you know

754
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,079
how what you just said

755
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,199
made me feel?

756
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,840
I do.

757
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:16,400
You're not the only one.
I feel it too.

758
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,360
It's hard for me too.

759
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,239
- Uh...
- I don't know what to do.

760
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,320
Are you for real?

761
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,559
Will you try going out with me?

762
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,599
I'm serious.

763
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,719
(Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit)

764
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,119
- Here, Zen.
- Thanks so much, Atom.

765
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:12,519
Who told you to serve Atom?

766
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:13,639
What?

767
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,360
I think he should be up for it now.

768
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,079
Can you stop disappointing me
again and again?

769
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:20,558
You probably know
what the consequences would be

770
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,519
if I had to take matters into
my own hands.

771
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:24,079
- Hey!
- Ugh!

772
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,919
- Have you seen Ryu?
- Everyone's willing to

773
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
risk their lives for Ryu.

774
00:52:27,921 --> 00:52:29,238
- Argh!
- Zen!

775
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:30,519
I'm sorry

776
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:32,280
you got hurt.
