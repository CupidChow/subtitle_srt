00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,482
All characters and events depicted
in this series are fictitious.

2
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,068
Child actors were filmed safely
in the presence of their guardians.

3
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:02,688
-Uh…
-Oh.

4
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,065
-Hello.
-Hello.

5
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,235
Are you sick?

6
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,781
Get better soon, so we can play together.

7
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,534
I'll pray for you to get better soon.

8
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:54,824
Chan-hee!

9
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,457
Chan-hee, look at this.

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,919
Parents said they'll bring me here.

11
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,091
I'm sorry for going by myself, Chan-hee.

12
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,136
But you can't go now because you're ill.

13
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,348
Chan-hee, I'll be back.

14
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,644
Chan-hee.

15
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,731
What's wrong?

16
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:48,419
Chan-hee!

17
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,844
Oh, be careful on your way down.

18
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,256
Have you been staying here?

19
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:00,676
It's not so bad.

20
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,517
Oh, you're hungry, right?
We only have ramyeon.

21
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,810
Do you want some?

22
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:14,940
Just wait a moment.

23
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,026
Wait.

24
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:18,944
Wait.

25
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,133
That's why…

26
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,387
That's why you were holding
onto me back then.

27
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,183
That's why you were unwell.

28
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,024
No, I'm sorry.

29
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,359
I…

30
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,447
thought you were dead.

31
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,283
I should've searched till the end.

32
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,036
But because I was incompetent…

33
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,414
I'm sorry.

34
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,166
No.

35
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,251
I…

36
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,379
I'm sorry for leaving you by yourself.

37
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,091
Let's

38
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,426
not part again from now on.

39
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,178
You and I…

40
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,390
let's stay together.

41
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,602
Okay?

42
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,886
It's okay.

43
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,141
Where is Seung-joon?

44
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,600
Where is Seung-joon?

45
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,727
-Where is Seung-joon?
-I'm so sorry!

46
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,980
Where is Seung-joon?

47
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,809
It's been a long time, my brother.

48
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,859
Gungtan.

49
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,738
You've come to the right place.

50
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,990
It was you, as expected.

51
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,168
It seems like you're not happy
that I've woken up.

52
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,212
Even though I missed you.

53
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,424
You've been hiding so well
for someone who missed me.

54
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,634
It's not like you.

55
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:30,969
I'm disappointed.

56
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,306
I was always next to you.

57
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,602
You were needlessly talkative back then,
and you still are.

58
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,439
I'd appreciate it
if you thought of it as a thrill

59
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,483
of seeing my brother
for the first time in a long time.

60
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,567
Is that so?

61
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,070
I guess we thought alike.

62
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,073
The thought of cutting you down

63
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,784
drives me crazy with excitement.

64
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,757
I only came because I had a question.

65
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,844
I don't wish to fight you.

66
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,346
Why should we fight?

67
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:58,849
We are brothers.

68
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,103
You should ask that of those you killed.

69
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,064
Did you forget?

70
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,484
You and I were both used and betrayed.

71
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,362
Wonjeong deceived us.

72
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,117
But what happened in the end?

73
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,496
It was you who killed Wonjeong, not me.

74
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,462
So, this time…

75
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,840
when are you going to kill her?

76
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,594
Shut up and take your sword out.

77
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,098
Do you still think…

78
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,227
that Wonjeong didn't know?

79
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,984
So, is that why
you're still protecting her like a fool?

80
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,802
This is my room.

81
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,817
Why don't you sit over here?

82
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,322
You can just rest here for tonight.

83
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,367
Tomorrow, let's find a place
where we can stay together.

84
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,503
Mi-ho must be here.

85
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,464
Mi-ho!

86
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,344
Oh.

87
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:00,846
You must be…

88
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,598
This is my brother.

89
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,683
She's Mi-ho.

90
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,728
I'm Kang Chan-hee.

91
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,026
I called a few times before,
but I couldn't get through to you.

92
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,654
I wanted to stay together,
so I brought him.

93
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,115
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you beforehand.

94
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,284
It's okay.

95
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,078
I had a lot going on today.

96
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,457
I'm really happy for you.

97
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,084
Rest comfortably.

98
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,630
Thank you.

99
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,591
Get some rest, Mi-ho!

100
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,991
Do those clothes fit you well?

101
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,910
Yes.

102
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,627
Should we get the same tattoo right here?

103
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,092
Should we?

104
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,725
You really hated going to church.

105
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,935
And now you're a priest.

106
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,521
I prayed every night.

107
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,148
I didn't know when,

108
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,442
but I knew He would listen to my prayers.

109
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,071
Chan-hee, we…

110
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,534
have only lost a lot of time

111
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,994
we could've spent together.

112
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,331
Let's not lose any more of it.

113
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,749
Okay.

114
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,419
It seems like you lived well,

115
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,714
so I'm relieved, Chan-hyeok.

116
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,551
-Chan-hee.
-Yes?

117
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,762
Chan-hee!

118
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,265
What is it?

119
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,771
Chan-hee.

120
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,149
Hey, my name is going to wear out.

121
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,985
I'm just calling you because I'm happy.

122
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:25,740
Let's continue to laugh,

123
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,368
talk, and spend time together like this.

124
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,036
Nothing more, nothing less.

125
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,746
Let's just be like this.

126
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,041
Okay, let's do that.

127
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,376
Okay.

128
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,879
Wait, I'm filthy.

129
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,214
It doesn't matter.

130
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,842
I washed but it's not coming off.

131
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,595
Hey, it's fine.

132
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,756
I'll tell you

133
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,301
how you can be free from the pain.

134
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,095
Find Wonjeong.

135
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,641
Find her and take what is hers.

136
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,227
Then your pain

137
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,731
will be gone forever.

138
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:02,999
It's no use.

139
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:27,816
Chan-hee.

140
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,610
Chan-hee!

141
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137
Chan-hee!

142
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,644
Hold on. Hear me out.

143
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,481
Wait.

144
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,859
That's just a lust demon.

145
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,988
What happened to you, Van?

146
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,926
I could've killed that bitch
for sure this time.

147
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,802
Was that the reason

148
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,306
you turned that priest's brother
into a lust demon?

149
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,146
Look at yourself now.

150
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,232
You've become weak.

151
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:38,112
I get that you want to be human
because of that woman.

152
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,531
But the more you want it,

153
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,159
the more you will be worn out

154
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,828
and become dull.

155
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,293
Isn't it funny?

156
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,672
That the more you protect her,

157
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:57,924
the weaker you'll become.

158
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,556
Make your decision
by the next time we meet,

159
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,601
whether you'll die at my hands

160
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,022
or hold my hands.

161
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:56,733
Johan!

162
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,029
What happened here?

163
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,158
Are you okay?

164
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,494
What about your brother?
Did he go somewhere?

165
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,955
I need to go somewhere, Mi-ho.

166
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:13,916
Johan.

167
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,626
Johan!

168
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:52,807
BOX OF CONDOLENCE MONEY

169
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,053
Van.

170
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:34,932
Van!

171
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:40,938
Van!

172
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,234
I came to ask you something.

173
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,448
I'm so angry,

174
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,158
I feel aggrieved,

175
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,118
and I just don't understand.

176
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:00,541
But I couldn't think of anyone but you
to ask questions.

177
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,379
Van!

178
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,257
Can you hear me?

179
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:11,719
Please answer me.

180
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,820
You are…

181
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,033
the reincarnate of a saint
called Wonjeong.

182
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,120
What did you say?

183
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,705
You mustn't…

184
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,463
You mustn't be awakened.

185
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,508
That's why lust demons
are trying to kill you before then.

186
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,720
What are you talking…

187
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,975
Why is it me? Huh?

188
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,395
-Of all people--
-It was the fate you were born with.

189
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,147
And it is unfinished work…

190
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,276
from your past life.

191
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,738
Okay. Then…

192
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,245
What about your fate… no.

193
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,623
What is your work?

194
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,169
I had no choice
but to kill you with my hands.

195
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:33,884
So I cannot even die
and have to live this painful life.

196
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,219
What is it?

197
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,557
I am waiting

198
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,350
for a promise.

199
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,601
A promise?

200
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,408
I don't believe in gibberish

201
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,953
like "Enjoy it if you cannot avoid it."

202
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:04,749
I'll unravel it.

203
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,836
My fate, work, or whatever it is.

204
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,756
I'll remember it again,

205
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,091
the promise you're waiting for.

206
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,928
So until then, stay next to me.

207
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,264
No…

208
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,558
Please stay next to me.

209
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,227
-If I stay by your side--
-What?

210
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,312
It'll be dangerous?

211
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:30,524
Then why do you continue to be near me?

212
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,901
Why do you keep saving me?

213
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,200
I'll tell you one last time,
so listen up closely.

214
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,496
I don't care even if you're a lust demon.

215
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,332
I don't care when I might end up dying.

216
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,463
I…

217
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,092
trust you.

218
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,305
What is it? How did it get--

219
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:02,556
Don't come near me!

220
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,682
Don't come any closer.

221
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,395
To a terrible fate,

222
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,688
you don't need to add filth.

223
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,982
You stupid fool. What are you saying?

224
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,362
-Because of me…
-Don't get the wrong idea.

225
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,239
This is my burden.

226
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,491
So go back.

227
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:26,956
Van.

228
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:55,317
Hello, Director. This is Won Mi-ho.

229
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,195
Yes, how have you been?

230
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,240
Yes.

231
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,872
I wanted to ask you a question.

232
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,666
By any chance, have you heard…

233
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,002
of "Wonjeong?"

234
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,632
Yes.

235
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,259
Yes.

236
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,526
So, one of them knows about Wonjeong.

237
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:56,921
That old lady again?

238
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,005
Take care, everyone.

239
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,300
Hello!

240
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,137
Do you remember me?

241
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,557
I'm Yeom-ji's teacher.

242
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,977
I wanted to ask you something.

243
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,150
I heard you lived in Jeju Island
for a long time.

244
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,861
And that you know a lot

245
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,113
about the myths and legends
in ancient books.

246
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,078
Then…

247
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,456
do you happen to know

248
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,292
about a person called Wonjeong?

249
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,505
Why do you want to know about it?

250
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,509
People keep getting hurt because of me.

251
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,678
Because I don't know anything.

252
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,266
If an object is old and worn out,
it will break.

253
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:53,060
What do you do with broken things?

254
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:54,937
They must be fixed.

255
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,816
Wonjeong is a person
who fixes broken things.

256
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,901
Fix?

257
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:03,404
What did she fix?

258
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,323
The Barrier Stone.

259
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,660
From a long time ago,
the demons of the world

260
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,788
were captured and locked up in Tamra.

261
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:17,626
So the Barrier Stone is broken,
and that's why lust demons are appearing?

262
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,880
And Wonjeong is the person
who fixes that Barrier Stone?

263
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,382
That's right.

264
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,342
When Wonjeong is awakened,

265
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,595
she can fix anything.

266
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,930
She will fix the Barrier Stone.

267
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:31,890
And fix that punk as well.

268
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:38,439
-Van?
-That punk is also exhausted now.

269
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,191
His wounds are not healing easily anymore.

270
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,948
If I become Wonjeong,

271
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,036
can I really save Van?

272
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,917
What should I do?

273
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,047
You must establish the Barrier.

274
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,590
How do I establish the Barrier?

275
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,052
Ma'am, what are you…

276
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,975
If a light shines from your body,

277
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,811
and when that light embraces Tamra…

278
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:19,647
Sorry?

279
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,524
You already know it too.

280
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:24,485
Benjulle.

281
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:26,862
How did you feel back then?

282
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,616
How do you…

283
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,078
I know it because I should know.

284
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:37,498
So how did you feel back then?

285
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,671
I just don't know.

286
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,423
Seeing someone else hurt because of me

287
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,093
is so painful.

288
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:50,844
So hurry up and awaken.

289
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,013
But how can I awaken?

290
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:55,140
If an egg is broken from the outside,

291
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,517
then the chick inside dies.

292
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,436
That is your burden.

293
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,315
No one else can help you with it.

294
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,275
Granny!

295
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,778
Come and eat, Granny! Dinner is ready.

296
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,946
You should go now.

297
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,448
And come back when you remember something.

298
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,452
Why don't you eat with us?

299
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,162
No, I'm fine.

300
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,123
Why did you come all the way here?

301
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,252
What if you fall and hurt your back?

302
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,380
By the way, Granny,
what did she ask about?

303
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,250
You did all of this.

304
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,587
All the murders reported on television,

305
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:08,589
and Seung-joon too.

306
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,301
Was it all you?

307
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,306
From when?

308
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,558
I don't know either.

309
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,729
I have no recollection.

310
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,450
You know it too, don't you?

311
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:39,953
I…

312
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,208
have changed weirdly.

313
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,961
Chan-hyeok.

314
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:52,800
Please…

315
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,469
kill me.

316
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,888
I don't want to live like this.

317
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,229
No.

318
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:09,274
Something's definitely wrong.

319
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:11,485
We can fix it.

320
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,030
There must be a way, right?

321
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,324
Right? Chan-hee.

322
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,368
I really don't know anything.

323
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,081
How did I end up like this?

324
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,712
I'll try to find a way.

325
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,423
I…

326
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,469
will make sure I convert you back.

327
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:51,149
Saint Michael, the archangel,
be our guardian through this war.

328
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,737
Be our protector
from the malice and deceit of Satan.

329
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,908
Glory be to the Father,
and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

330
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,619
As it was in the beginning,

331
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:07,791
is now,

332
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:10,919
and ever shall be.

333
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,382
Amen.

334
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:18,886
Chan-hee.

335
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:20,721
It will hurt a little.

336
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,182
I'll begin.

337
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,253
I believe in God, our Father,

338
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,341
who created all things in heaven
and on earth, visible and invisible.

339
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:10,896
The root of evil,

340
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,815
I command in the name of Jesus Christ.

341
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,067
Leave this person's body.

342
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,907
I ask you in the name of Jesus, the Lord.

343
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,868
Leave the creation of God.

344
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:30,582
I command you
in the name of the Almighty, the Holy One.

345
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,505
Be afraid. Fear the Lord who was crucified
on the cross as a man and resurrected.

346
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:38,757
Fear Him!

347
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,431
I command you
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,

348
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,267
say your name.

349
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:51,645
Chan-hyeok.

350
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,648
-Stop it.
-Say it.

351
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,233
It's too painful, Chan-hyeok.

352
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,237
-Please, just…
-Say your name.

353
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,363
Please, just kill me.

354
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,281
Say it.

355
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,201
Say your name. Say your name!

356
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,321
The Lord of Heaven's armies,

357
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,115
thrust into hell
Satan and all evil spirits

358
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,700
who wander through the world.

359
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,182
The punishment of wicked you will see.

360
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,726
You have the Lord for your refuge.

361
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:15,854
And it is because

362
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:21,943
you made the Most High

363
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:23,779
your refuge.

364
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:53,892
Chan-hyeok.

365
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,064
Just…

366
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:02,984
kill me.

367
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,447
Please…

368
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:12,911
kill me.

369
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,002
Chan-hyeok.

370
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,046
How much longer
will you shut yourself up in here?

371
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:50,842
You are a protector,

372
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:54,221
but all you're doing is sighing heavily.

373
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,808
I said to be careful as it's dangerous.
Why did you come here?

374
00:41:58,892 --> 00:42:01,770
I came to check if you'd blame yourself
until you became a ghost

375
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,899
and whether I needed
to add another stone tower.

376
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,737
I know you too well.

377
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,409
That child came to see me

378
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,163
to ask me if I knew Wonjeong.

379
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,207
She said she's Wonjeong,

380
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,167
but she didn't know what to do.

381
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,258
The shell of karma seems quite hard,

382
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,927
so I don't think it will be easily broken.

383
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:39,140
But she said she must protect it herself.

384
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,024
Van!

385
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,737
Van!

386
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:55,824
Van!

387
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,035
Van!

388
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,581
Van!

389
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,470
Won Mi-ho almost died because of you.

390
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:21,516
Teach me

391
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:25,270
how to live like you.

392
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:27,897
There is a way, right?

393
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:30,859
Right?

394
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,780
There is nothing like that in the world.

395
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:39,326
My brother…

396
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,038
My brother looked at me
with a smile, then in tears.

397
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:46,916
You are the same, aren't you?

398
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,670
A lust demon, but just like a human…

399
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,593
That isn't your brother.

400
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,305
You'd know it better than anyone else.

401
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,389
No.

402
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:03,308
You're wrong.

403
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,437
I'll make a promise.

404
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:12,901
If I cannot convert my brother back,

405
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,404
then I'll kill--

406
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:20,533
If you could do that,
you wouldn't have come here to find me.

407
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:24,204
Please.

408
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,288
Please!

409
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,462
It will only be harder for you.

410
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:50,230
Mi-ho.

411
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,981
Can we talk?

412
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:54,859
Sure, come in. Sit over here.

413
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:04,828
What do you want to talk about?

414
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:07,872
I have a favor to ask.

415
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,290
A favor?

416
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,543
Please help

417
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:14,129
my brother.

418
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,674
You're the only one who can save him.

419
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,300
What do you mean?

420
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,719
My brother…

421
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,057
is possessed by an evil spirit.

422
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,312
What?

423
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:41,489
So the reason
why the villa is like this…

424
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,039
-Johan.
-I know too.

425
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,253
To you, it's all the same lust demon.

426
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:58,590
But to me…

427
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,678
He's my brother,
who I found after ten years.

428
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:07,557
My brother was deceived by bad people,

429
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,560
had his organs taken from him,

430
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:14,939
and lived a hard life all his life.

431
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,862
No matter how much I think…

432
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:23,823
Back then,

433
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,702
you saved Su-ryeon from Benjulle.

434
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:33,291
Only with your help…

435
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,711
we can convert my brother back.

436
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,798
Johan, I don't know
how I did it back then.

437
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:41,883
In that case…

438
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,554
just meet him once, please.

439
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:50,225
Then that power may awaken again.

440
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,105
Please.

441
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,775
Please, I beg you.

442
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:00,735
Just once.

443
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,239
I can't lose my brother

444
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,367
without trying something.

445
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,495
Please help me just once.

446
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:15,458
Please?

447
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:17,544
Just once.

448
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:22,632
Wonjeong is someone
who fixes broken things.

449
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:32,475
All right, let's try it.

450
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,395
If I can save someone,

451
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,021
then I'll give it a go.

452
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,379
Is your brother here?

453
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,089
Yes.

454
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,342
I thought it might be safer
since there's no one around here.

455
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,012
Let's go.

456
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:19,480
He's here.

457
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,090
Chan-hee.

458
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,470
-Chan-hyeok.
-Yes.

459
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,320
Please try.

460
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:18,373
Please…

461
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,168
save me.

462
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:40,853
I'll give it a go.

463
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:12,385
You've come.

464
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:47,170
Johan!

465
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,757
Johan!

466
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,633
Are you okay?

467
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,650
Johan.

468
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:43,744
Chan-hyeok.

469
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,164
Why?

470
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,048
I didn't want to be in pain,
not even for a day.

471
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,635
If I took Wonjeong's for mine,

472
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:02,179
apparently, I would be free from pain.

473
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,143
I was so close.

474
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:19,947
Chan-hyeok.

475
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:22,366
Dear Chan-hyeok.

476
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,374
My kind brother.

477
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,088
Let me hear…

478
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,260
Let me hear your voice just once.

479
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:51,437
Chan-hee.

480
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,024
Please rest peacefully.

481
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,726
From the bottom of the pit,
Lord, I cry out to you.

482
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:34,105
Forgive the young lamb
who departed this world.

483
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:38,526
At the mercy of the Lord,
may all those who passed away be at peace.

484
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:41,654
Amen.

485
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,212
Chan-hee.

486
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:01,924
Chan-hee.

487
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:05,177
Chan-hee…

488
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:07,847
Chan-hee.

489
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:12,685
Chan-hee.

490
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,354
Chan-hee…

491
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,984
Let's go out. Let him be alone.

492
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:33,956
Chan-hee.

493
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:36,477
Where have you been?

494
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,065
Uncle.
