1
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,357
All characters and events depicted
in this series are fictitious.

2
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,317
Child actors were filmed safely in
the presence of their guardians.

3
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:35,995
There once was a time when all beings
used to live in harmony in the land,

4
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,079
Tamra.

5
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,958
But the harmony did not go long.

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,421
Chaos emerged as gods and beings clashed.

7
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:49,175
A newcomer watched on from the beginning.

8
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,346
The 46 children of god
had their blood sealed away.

9
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,683
As a result, the chaos subsided.

10
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:03,647
In order to stop the monsters
from coming out of this Hell's Gate,

11
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:07,401
the god made each of its 46 children
into a Dol Hareubang,

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,069
and blocked off the Gate.

13
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,782
That is how the Dol Hareubang
appeared on Jeju Island.

14
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,993
But why are there more than 46?

15
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:21,248
In order to hide the 46,
the god made many fakes to disguise it.

16
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,959
-That's why there's a lot of it.
-Photographer!

17
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,211
Are we there yet?

18
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,464
We are almost there.
Just a little more to go.

19
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,801
The groom seems weaker than he looks!

20
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,969
Tonight will be your first night together.

21
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,514
Will you be able to do it?

22
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,850
What's wrong? Are you having a hard time?

23
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,102
My hobby is mountain climbing.

24
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,943
-It seems like you like it.
-Is that it?

25
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,569
Look at this.

26
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,072
This… Dol Hareubang.

27
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,824
Are you listening to me?

28
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,575
This…

29
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,954
The Dol Hareubangs should not be
like this, side to side.

30
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,205
Wow!

31
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,040
This place is amazing.

32
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,124
This is good.

33
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,835
These Dol Hareubang statues,

34
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:10,214
being together side by side
is extremely rare to find.

35
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,050
Yes. The Dol Hareubang on the right…

36
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,391
That moss…
why is there spring moss when it's autumn?

37
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,475
Honey.

38
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,186
I heard if you touch its nose,
you'll get a son.

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,312
Oh, really?

40
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,859
You guys love it!
I knew you guys would love it here.

41
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,235
Excuse me.

42
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,361
Please get ready now.

43
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,240
I really should hire an assistant.

44
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,909
It's difficult doing all of this alone.

45
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,787
Honey.

46
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,873
These Dol Hareubangs…

47
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,250
Don't you feel a strange energy from it?

48
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,379
It feels like… it is very powerful.

49
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,884
Let's change our shoes.

50
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,641
Honestly, thinking about it makes me sad.

51
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,730
Not just one or two children.
All of the children into Dol Hareubangs…

52
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,025
The feelings of the mother
who needed to close the Gate.

53
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:16,030
That is why I always tell this legend
to the people who come up here.

54
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,783
Man, I told them to fix this.
It is still broken.

55
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,995
What's happening?

56
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:24,788
What was that?

57
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,665
Did you do something?

58
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,231
Let's see here…

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,743
Groom?

60
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,245
Bride?

61
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,165
Where did they go?

62
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,543
What is this?

63
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,049
Why is it…

64
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,013
What is this?

65
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,268
I've never seen this before.

66
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,819
You scared me!

67
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:41,031
Where did you go?
You should tell me before you go anywhere.

68
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,700
Are you hurt somewhere?

69
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,048
Go get Giovanni.

70
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,716
Yes, Father.

71
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,731
You… a dead man breathing fine.

72
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,568
You were abandoned by your parents, right?

73
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,612
Do you know why?

74
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,533
Because… your mother was a whore!

75
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,871
Chan-hyeok, I still live in hell…

76
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,165
But you're so easygoing.

77
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,335
It's so dark here.

78
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,380
There is a strange smell.

79
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:03,966
Let me live!

80
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,970
Save me! Take these off!

81
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,389
Release me now!

82
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,474
Okay, hold on.

83
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,228
It is all ready now. Wait a little more.

84
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,813
Let's start off with this.

85
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,158
Damn you…

86
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,076
Leave me alone! Release me!

87
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,455
Damn you, you bastard!

88
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,250
You son of a whore!

89
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,463
Get away from me!

90
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,180
Father Giovanni!

91
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,485
Father Giovanni, there is a big issue.

92
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,688
Who is this woman in the white robe?

93
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,274
A long time ago,
there was a time when the world

94
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,401
almost became engulfed
by the power of evil.

95
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,238
This woman…

96
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,616
She was the only hope and savior

97
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,826
for the balance and protection
of this world.

98
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,953
The savior?

99
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,832
Sadly,
she couldn't fulfill her mission and died.

100
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,089
The man in the black robe killed her.
Am I right?

101
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,882
Yes.

102
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,388
This man did not die
and is still alive and well.

103
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,391
He is somewhere on the island.

104
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,017
So he is not human…

105
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,519
Giovanni.

106
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:27,818
This is a sign that the world will be
endangered again by evil beings.

107
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,319
Is there any way to stop him?

108
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,572
Long ago, we found a new savior.

109
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,450
We have been watching over her ever since.

110
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,535
Is that so?

111
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,209
Look here.

112
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,007
Is it this woman?

113
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:54,594
Fate will lead her back to the island.

114
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,264
Giovanni…

115
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,102
Giovanni, go there.

116
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,815
Go there and help her
to save the world from crisis.

117
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,945
This is the will of the Lord.

118
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,700
-Amen.
-Amen.

119
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:26,793
As if it is trying to wash away
all of the stains and dirt…

120
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,715
Can you see the scenery
of this majestic cascading waterfall?

121
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,968
-A unique and dynamic expression--
-Chairman?

122
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,179
-I have a question.
-Reporter…

123
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,972
There's time for questions later--

124
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:42,851
I heard Daehan Group has spent a lot
in order to open this collection.

125
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,436
How much is that exactly?

126
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,858
As you may know,

127
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:54,154
an artist's painting
is not about the price tag.

128
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,782
Please,
just consider only the value of the work.

129
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,785
I heard other than this artist's artwork,

130
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,954
famous artist's pieces were also bought
counting up to 100 pieces.

131
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,041
Is it true that this is used for
Daehan Group's slush fund?

132
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,334
Hold on, sir.

133
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,629
Those artworks.
Every single one of them…

134
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,049
will be displayed
in all of the rooms in Daehan Hotel.

135
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,260
We plan to allow all customers
during their stay at the hotel

136
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,013
to be able to freely
appreciate and enjoy the paintings

137
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,140
without any sort of restrictions.

138
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,976
Do you mean those expensive paintings?

139
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,438
Using those expensive paintings
to provide the best service to customers

140
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,190
is Daehan Hotel's ultimate goal.

141
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,151
You're Reporter Choi
from Jinmyung Daily, right?

142
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,655
Looking at your SNS,
it seems you often stay at our hotel.

143
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,118
If there is a painting you like,
please let me know.

144
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,583
Miss, you did a great job today.

145
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,128
I did the hard work today
stopping the reporters.

146
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,212
You did well.

147
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,381
Why didn't you come?

148
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,551
You are doing well alone
without this old man.

149
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,386
Of course I do well!

150
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,346
I still feel uneasy without you.

151
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,765
Why would you feel uneasy
when I am here?

152
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,059
I am nearing retirement age.

153
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,938
These days,
many people get employed after retirement.

154
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,523
-No.
-Why not?

155
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,607
It's tiring.

156
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,735
I also have a life plan.

157
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,865
I will go to Jeju Island
and start a Hallabong farm.

158
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,326
Farm in Seoul.
I will build you a significant arboretum.

159
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,871
Hallabongs taste the best
at Halla Mountain--

160
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,205
Sir!

161
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,640
Who do you think I am?

162
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,144
We will leave you two to talk.

163
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,938
Let's go.

164
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,652
I still have food left…

165
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,743
How did you know I was here?

166
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,411
I'm impressed you found me.

167
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,206
-I asked, who do you think I am?
-My aunt.

168
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,542
Yes. I am your aunt.

169
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,838
I am your aunt as well as
Daehan Hotel's owner.

170
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,381
But despite me being the owner,

171
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,176
why do I hear news
about my hotel through articles?

172
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,178
Thanks to my smart nephew.

173
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,721
I know, right?

174
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,557
-I wish I didn't know better too.
-What?

175
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,726
17% negative growth last year.

176
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,853
22% negative growth this year.

177
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,897
5th place in the domestic hotel rankings.

178
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,193
Daehan Hotel is the only hotel
that has a negative growth rate each year.

179
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,030
I'm too worried to leave it alone.

180
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,114
Hey.

181
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,535
If anyone is to worry, it is me.
It is my hotel.

182
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,872
My aunt… No, wait.

183
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,292
Daehan Hotel's owner must have forgotten.

184
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,670
40% of Daehan's shares
belong to Daehan Group.

185
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,589
25% belongs to my father
and you have 17% of the shares.

186
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,383
And I…

187
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,635
I almost forgot…

188
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,930
-18%--
-Are you really doing this to your aunt?

189
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,933
I'm the only daughter and successor
of the CEO, Won Tae-han.

190
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,103
It's not wrong for me to check up
on the groups in advance, right?

191
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,229
Mi-ho.

192
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,106
Just mess up one time.

193
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,150
Not twice, but only just once.

194
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,194
I will be waiting.

195
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,324
I won't be far.

196
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,414
Secretary Kang, go to the art museum.

197
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,332
What? The art museum at this time?

198
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,418
Shall I take the local route then?

199
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,310
-What was that?
-Are you okay?

200
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,938
Damn it, what's up with the lousy driving?

201
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,818
I can't believe this.

202
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,990
Step out of the car.

203
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,451
What's wrong with your driving?

204
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,416
Damn it, are you driving with your feet?

205
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,004
Wait, you sped in to change lanes.

206
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,674
Obviously, you failed
to maintain a safe distance.

207
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,551
What will you do about this?

208
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:30,680
Let's call car insurance.

209
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,307
What?

210
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,893
Are you saying this wasn't your fault?

211
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,064
No… both parties' fault?

212
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,440
What did you say?

213
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,400
Say it again!

214
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,112
Secretary Kang!

215
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,366
I apologize.

216
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,745
That's not how this should go.

217
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,830
The person who drove
should be apologizing.

218
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,084
Why should someone
who is not involved be apologizing?

219
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,628
I can't believe you guys.

220
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,797
-You merged in recklessly--
-Secretary Kang.

221
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,174
Apologize to them.

222
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:09,719
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,138
Where's your bow?

224
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,851
-I'm sorry.
-You're not bowing down enough.

225
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,229
You should bow down like this!

226
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,524
You should stop this now.

227
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,526
I'm only doing this to finish this.

228
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,445
It's your fault
for not disciplining your employee well.

229
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,502
Car repair fees and hospital bills…
I will send it to you once you request it.

230
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,046
Secretary Kang. Give them a business card.

231
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,258
Okay.

232
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,844
Did you record it well?

233
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,432
What are you guys doing?

234
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,058
Get on quickly!

235
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,021
Hey!

236
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,067
A third-generation chaebol
assaulting people was caught on video…

237
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,777
The perpetrator was revealed to be

238
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,487
Won Mi-ho, the most potential heir

239
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,948
and daughter of CEO Won Tae-han
of Daehan Group.

240
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,660
The media and public are showing
strong criticism and are boycotting…

241
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,871
The stock market mood
surrounding Daehan Group

242
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,207
is seen to be unfavorable after
the recording and news were released.

243
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,461
Daehan Group's shareholders
called for an emergency meeting

244
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,214
despite the regular general meeting
that was scheduled for three weeks later.

245
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,924
Aunt, is this your work?

246
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,343
I'm disappointed.

247
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,345
Do you think I would do that obviously?

248
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,932
I just figured you had
a lot of enemies here and there.

249
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,187
Aunt, you sound very excited.

250
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,982
Maybe it's because I didn't get any sleep.

251
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,234
Hey, go inside now.

252
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,696
The CEO is very angry.

253
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,949
Your outfit looks nice today.

254
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,660
It looks fantastic!

255
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,712
We will take action to make sure
the issue goes under the surface.

256
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,088
Dad.

257
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,175
Let me explain what happened.

258
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,270
-Dad, what happened was--
-Forget it!

259
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,398
We live in a world that only sees results.

260
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,360
A failed process… is just an excuse.

261
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,695
But, Dad, you should know.

262
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,947
What I need to know is…

263
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,908
how much the stocks
will plummet because of you,

264
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,118
how much loss
will be caused by the boycott,

265
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,204
and how much time and money will be needed

266
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,665
to restore this issue
and appease the shareholders.

267
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,750
Aunt is behind all of this.

268
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,382
Don't make this a family issue
or a fight for management rights.

269
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,717
-It's not that--
-Butler Chang.

270
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,262
-Yes.
-What do you think we should do?

271
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,973
I have submitted
a handwritten apology

272
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,432
to the newspaper company.

273
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,395
And Miss…

274
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:10,483
you should put your title down and
go away to let it settle down for a while.

275
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,985
Do as he says.

276
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,698
People will say I am running away
from the issue if I go abroad.

277
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,450
The issue doesn't settle down
if you go abroad nowadays.

278
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,412
I will make up for it.
That works too, right?

279
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,748
-How will you do that?
-I will just show good results.

280
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,334
You told me
we live in a world that only sees results.

281
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,009
Secretary…

282
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,429
please investigate the two men
who caused this incident.

283
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,265
Yes.

284
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,059
As soon as possible, please. Thank you.

285
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,688
Mister!

286
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:52,984
But I have to say--

287
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,194
If you're going to nag--

288
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,615
The flipping technique
was executed perfectly.

289
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,284
Really?

290
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,162
It is all thanks to your teachings.

291
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,332
Next time, make sure to
reach in your right hand a little deeper.

292
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,125
The right hand deeper?

293
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:15,173
Miss,
you did teaching during university, right?

294
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,467
-Yes.
-Then using that…

295
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,345
How is volunteering at the school?

296
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,430
The school?

297
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,600
No way.

298
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,562
Mister, are you being serious?

299
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,745
Why? Was I snoring?

300
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,581
Just go back to sleep.

301
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,126
-You scared me.
-Go to sleep.

302
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,549
Jeju Island?

303
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,220
I will try to fast-forward my life plans.

304
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,347
Mister…

305
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,809
Is this really the best option?

306
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,852
Of course, it is the second-best option.

307
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,398
But isn't this better than going abroad?

308
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,949
Okay. Then let me go to Tamra High School.

309
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,450
Tamra?

310
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,120
Is this really right?

311
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,165
My life is so dramatic.

312
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:35,837
You scared me.

313
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,639
You are not moving.
Why do you have so much luggage?

314
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,725
This is not much. Let's hurry and go.

315
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,352
You have to buy me something good to eat--

316
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,354
Wait!

317
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,857
Don't come near! Stop taking photos!

318
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,027
Please wait!

319
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,319
Hurry and go on first.

320
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,114
Don't come near!

321
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,035
-Secretary Kang! Where's the car?
-Parking lot D!

322
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,791
Get away! Do not come near!

323
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:25,845
The sun set already.

324
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,542
Secretary Kang, you still couldn't escape?

325
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,296
Wow. I am at parking lot D now.

326
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,966
Wait a moment. Where is the car?

327
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,554
Okay, I found it.

328
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,056
Hurry up and get out of there.

329
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,016
Okay.

330
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,403
Excuse me.

331
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:27,657
Are you okay?

332
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,213
So it's you.

333
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,360
Miss?

334
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,490
Miss, are you okay?

335
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,326
What happened to me?

336
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,205
The airport…
Woman wearing a wedding dress.

337
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,541
Right! The man in the black suit.

338
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,878
There was a man wearing a black suit.

339
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,297
You are scaring me!

340
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,757
What do you mean by a wedding dress?

341
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:20,676
A black suit?

342
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,679
Was he wearing a black gat as well?

343
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,141
I'm not sure.
Did you not see anyone with a black suit?

344
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,350
I didn't see anyone.

345
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,312
You were unconscious in the parking lot.

346
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,814
It was hectic over there.

347
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,691
I don't care about that!

348
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:40,696
Did you really not see anyone
wearing a black suit?

349
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,156
I'm not sure about that.

350
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,950
But the truck was destroyed.

351
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,828
Anyways,
it is a relief that you are not hurt.

352
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,624
Where is this place?

353
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,336
Miss, this is where you
will be staying from now on.

354
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,937
This place looks like a secret fortress.

355
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:16,023
Must I stay in a place like this?

356
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,777
Butler Jang said the hotel
will have too many eyes watching.

357
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,404
That's true.

358
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,031
-Secretary Kang.
-Yes?

359
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,200
Didn't you see
anyone with a black suit?

360
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,410
At the airport.

361
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,330
What's wrong with you?

362
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,587
Where are you going? Go with me!

363
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,557
You are up to this again?

364
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,269
You can stop it now.

365
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:54,979
What brings you here?

366
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,481
I came to ask you something.

367
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,278
Last night,
the whole earth and water began to shake.

368
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,239
The wind started blowing
from all directions.

369
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,033
My heart began pounding.
It troubled me. It felt familiar.

370
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,661
It is because you lived for too long.

371
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,121
Lying through your teeth…

372
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,499
The child is here, right?

373
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,169
Does the child look the same as her?

374
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,551
I guess that's how you recognized her.

375
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,555
Did she recognize you?

376
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:31,640
No.

377
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,270
Is she not fully awoken yet?

378
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,982
Why is she here at Tamra, then?

379
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,026
This place is not that far.

380
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,447
Do you still not get it
after living for so long?

381
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,241
Humans have causation

382
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,410
and must have fate connected to meet.

383
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:57,708
It is best if she were not just a shell…

384
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,128
The lust demon targeted her.

385
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,507
I guess she is not just a shell.

386
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:10,095
But… why do you look like
you aren't welcoming of her at all?

387
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:17,269
Your stagnant fate
can finally move on forward now!

388
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,362
TAMNAGUK- ANCIENT JEJU

389
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,925
They all seem to have died.

390
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,010
Let's return.

391
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,561
There is a child who lived!

392
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,316
He was the sole survivor
from the lust demon attack.

393
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,986
His entire family was slaughtered.
He seems to have no repercussions.

394
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:12,282
Five days later
when the red moon rises, let's proceed--

395
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,076
Jongryeong, stop what you are doing.

396
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,998
Baek-ju, you came.

397
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,297
I heard about everything.

398
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,385
Are you trying to raise
children into Demon Slayers again?

399
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,304
You have failed countlessly.

400
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,516
All you have done
is taking the lives of innocent children.

401
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,601
Jongryeong, please stop.

402
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:46,734
If I were to stop…
is there another way then?

403
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:54,658
Already, an entire village
was slaughtered by a lust demon.

404
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,202
The barrier will not hold out much longer.

405
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,623
We have no choice
but to take the necessary action.

406
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:02,958
Jongryeong!

407
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:08,255
It is for the greater cause
and Taejang Buddhism's will.

408
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,426
And this is my royal order!

409
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,395
Do you know what this is?

410
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:53,902
An evil spirit that has existed
on this earth since the beginning…

411
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,489
A lust demon.

412
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,454
These wicked beings take unclean desires

413
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,916
or evil thoughts to feed itself.

414
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,296
These monsters
mercilessly slaughter all living things.

415
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:20,095
Tamra is a holy place that was made
in order to seal these wicked beings.

416
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:27,227
However, it is impossible
to fight them off with human strength.

417
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:33,358
How much blood was shed
to catch this just one!

418
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,488
You all…

419
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,743
Things might be different
if you can endure it.

420
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,966
Let go of me!

421
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:42,886
I said let go of me!

422
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:47,766
Let go of me!

423
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,412
You have endured it well.

424
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,790
You two are the only ones
who have survived it.

425
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,627
From today onwards,
you two will be reborn

426
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,255
as Demon Slayers at this Taejangsa Temple.

427
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,300
From now on, your name will be Van.

428
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,302
It means one who has stone flesh.

429
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,056
And your name… will be Gungtan.

430
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,725
It means one who has swallowed an arrow.

431
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:17,105
The blood of a lust demon
is already flowing through your bodies.

432
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,858
Half-human, half-demon.

433
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,111
You cannot live as a human anymore.

434
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,364
Thus, empty your minds as a human.

435
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,702
Wonjeong!

436
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,709
Do you not need to take a little break?

437
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,827
I was looking all over for you!

438
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:15,372
Miss!

439
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,125
What are you doing here? Come quickly.

440
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,586
Are you still growing taller?

441
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:25,549
I tried to decorate it the best I could,
but it is still lacking.

442
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,010
Hello.

443
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,265
Welcome back.

444
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:35,642
Hello.

445
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,395
I am the principal
of Tamra High School, Lee San-il.

446
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,648
It must have been
difficult coming out this far.

447
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:48,238
-Nice to meet you.
-Thank you. Please have a seat here.

448
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,326
-Have a seat.
-Yes.

449
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,372
As mentioned earlier,

450
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:02,169
our CEO is very interested
in the development potential

451
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,087
of Tamra High School.

452
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:09,384
Somehow, our Tamra High School
and Daehan Group became connected.

453
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,679
I'm not sure what to do.

454
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:17,350
I'm sure if the school cooperates well,
it will help the development for both--

455
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:18,852
Is this a bridegroom meeting?

456
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:23,773
As you may know,
I am here due to an unfortunate issue.

457
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:27,360
Nonetheless,
I will work to the best of my ability.

458
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,529
Principal,
please give me a lot of guidance.

459
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:31,573
No, I should be thanking you.

460
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,285
I heard you will be building
a new auditorium for us.

461
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:39,998
Upgrading all of the toilets
to the latest one too.

462
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,249
Water purifier…

463
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:45,128
I even heard you will be placing
new lawns for the sports field.

464
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,673
I am so grateful
that I am at a loss for words.

465
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,760
The children are our new future.

466
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,595
They should not be getting hurt.

467
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:59,142
-You have such an inspiring purpose too.
-Is there anything else you need?

468
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,480
But… who is this?

469
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,942
-I am--
-Okay, shall we go meet the teachers?

470
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,027
Yes, let us go.

471
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,782
Hello. My name is Won Mi-ho.

472
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:23,500
As you may have seen in the news,
I am here to reflect upon myself.

473
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:27,128
If possible, please spread the word
that I am doing well.

474
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,755
-That's a good idea--
-Principal!

475
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:35,345
After Miss Im retired,
the guidance counselor spot is vacant.

476
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,723
I am aware.
But there is no suitable teacher yet--

477
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,892
How about we let Won Mi-ho take it?

478
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,728
All of a sudden?

479
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:47,482
Miss Im used to be the ethics teacher,
and Miss Won Mi-ho here--

480
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,945
I'm not exactly sure what it is.
But I will do it. Guidance counselor.

481
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,363
Secretary Kang.

482
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,157
Yes?

483
00:42:56,658 --> 00:43:00,078
I will take a look around the school.
You should stay in the car.

484
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,246
Yes, I will do that.

485
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:24,269
COUNSELING ROOM

486
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,295
Excuse me.

487
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:52,589
I'm not good at beating around the bush.

488
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,467
-You don't like me, right?
-Yes.

489
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,801
-Why?
-You don't know?

490
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:58,636
-I don't know.
-Then I'll tell you.

491
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,934
A person should not do that
to another person.

492
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,437
What did I do?

493
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,607
You shouldn't be surprising people
without any notice like this.

494
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,154
I'm sorry.

495
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,699
It's good you are sorry… you fox!

496
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,827
Hey!

497
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:26,164
I thought you were kidding
when you said you're coming to our school.

498
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,874
I wish it was a joke too.

499
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,961
It's so nice seeing you though.

500
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,340
The sun is setting.
How about we go tomorrow?

501
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:40,053
Su-jin is waiting at the cafe for dinner.
We haven't met for a long time.

502
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,429
I am just a little worried.

503
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:58,530
What is this?

504
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,365
DAEHAN HOTEL OWNER WON BO-RAM

505
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,867
BECAME CHAIRMAN FOR
DAEHAN GROUP CULTURAL FOUNDATION

506
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,536
She must be crazy…

507
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,503
Dad, how did this happen?

508
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,548
Your plan to connect
the Cultural Foundation and the hotel.

509
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:19,592
Your aunt said she will lead it.
Give her a chance.

510
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:22,512
How is this a chance? This is stealing!

511
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,721
Won Mi-ho!

512
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:27,934
Okay.

513
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,145
I will turn a blind eye to her chance.

514
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:32,480
Only until I return to Seoul.

515
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,899
Just wait, it will not take long.

516
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,951
Miss, shall we return to the villa?

517
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:47,912
No, Su-jin is waiting for me.

518
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:49,497
Just go to the cafe.

519
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,749
Okay.

520
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:03,678
Yes, Secretary.

521
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,723
I did some investigating as you ordered.

522
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:10,685
But this was a bit unexpected.
I will send you the photo now.

523
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,520
Good job.

524
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:32,332
-Secretary Kang, stop the car.
-Sorry?

525
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,417
Why? Are you feeling uncomfortable?

526
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,229
Miss, are you okay?

527
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:56,356
Secretary Kang.

528
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,692
-I'm such a fool, right?
-Sorry?

529
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,862
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

530
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,243
You need two palms to clap.

531
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:11,162
-I was only looking at one hand.
-What?

532
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,164
The men from the car accident.

533
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:14,749
How did they know?

534
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:18,211
Mister didn't know
I was on my way to the art museum.

535
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,797
Only Secretary Kang and I knew.

536
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:23,716
-Miss…
-What did my aunt offer you?

537
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,927
Did she offer you a billion won?

538
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:29,889
Miss, what are you talking about?
Why would I…

539
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:42,318
Miss, let me explain everything!

540
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:43,403
For me…

541
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,533
I have always hated relatives and family.

542
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,245
All they do is try to take away
and pull you down.

543
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:58,001
Rather… Mister and Secretary Kang
were more like family to me.

544
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,753
Whether it was empty words or the truth,

545
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:04,007
if something happened to me,
you both would worry for me first.

546
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,594
I thought that's what family is.

547
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,600
Honestly, I want to know the reason.

548
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:19,272
But it's obviously either money
or something about family again.

549
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:21,733
If I hear that, I might feel bad.

550
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,651
Our fate ends here.

551
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,403
I will do this job alone.

552
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:28,573
If word gets around,
Secretary Kang can not get employed.

553
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,325
I have never betrayed you.

554
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:33,953
If this is not betrayal, what is?

555
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,257
I was always on that side.

556
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,886
So I didn't really betray you.

557
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:54,599
Miss.

558
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,311
Do you think this is the end?

559
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:04,233
Still… thinking about the time
spent together as your secretary,

560
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:06,402
I will tell you.

561
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,488
This is only the beginning.

562
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:10,948
Those people…

563
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,328
Do you think they are doing this
just to bring you down?

564
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:18,081
-You don't mean…
-The world is easy for you, right?

565
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,166
Miss…

566
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,086
you are living in a well.

567
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,923
The small world you see from the well?

568
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,591
A world the size of your palm?

569
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,385
The world outside…

570
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:35,973
is much colder than you think.

571
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,522
Won Mi-ho!

572
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:45,692
Get your head together!

573
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,652
Do you understand me?

574
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,989
Put your right hand deeper.

575
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,565
This car… you can take it.

576
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,777
It should be enough for the severance pay.

577
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,255
It's not just you!

578
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,507
It was difficult for me too!

579
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:53,885
I meant to tell you first…

580
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,430
Miss, I'm sorry…

581
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,897
Why am I even crying?

582
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,769
-Yes, Miss?
-Mister!

583
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,565
Please send a car to where I am now.

584
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,861
Well…

585
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,240
It's a bit complicated to tell you now.

586
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,534
I am at the…

587
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:02,411
I came straight down from Bijarim-ro

588
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:04,372
-Please come quickly.
-Miss?

589
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,041
-Hello?
-Miss?

590
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,127
-Hello? Mister?
-Miss? Can you not hear me?

591
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:14,966
Why is this happening?

592
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:18,010
Why is even my phone service not working?

593
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:43,870
Secretary Kang?

594
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,921
Why?

595
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:56,048
Do you have more to say to me?

596
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,594
You can not leave here.

597
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:01,012
What?

598
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,682
Secretary Kang.

599
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,727
Do you still not
understand the situation?

600
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,394
Secretary Kang…

601
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:54,982
It's… me.
