1
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,488
That concludes Round 1 of Exit Strategy 2.

2
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,699
KAIST AND YONSEI TAKES THE WIN
The white team wins.

3
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,660
We need a strategy for going first.

4
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,203
TEAM WHITE GOES FIRST IN ROUND 2

5
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,874
TEAM BLACK PLACES 4 PIECES IN A CORNER
This idea is the GOAT.

6
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,292
It's out of this world.

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,296
We can take the game by ourselves
regardless of their gameplay.

8
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,840
I have to get out of the way.
Otherwise, we'll lose.

9
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:53,053
They will score 2 points in 4 turns,
while we can only score 1.

10
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,680
White 4, please make your move.

11
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,057
GI-HYEON THWARTS TEAM BLACK'S STRATEGY

12
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,851
That White 4 move was totally insane.

13
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,770
You need to quickly come up with a plan.

14
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,232
Team White's first piece
has exited the board.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,985
How are they so good?

16
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,113
It could have been a landslide
if we hadn't messed up Black 2.

17
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,701
Team Black's first piece
has exited the board.

18
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,245
- They can't do much, can they?
- No, not really.

19
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,039
We have the upper hand, thanks to White 4.

20
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,750
Man, how did it end up like this?

21
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,045
What are they trying to do?

22
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,922
I honestly can't tell
what they're trying to do.

23
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,717
NEXT TEAM TO EXIT THEIR LAST PIECE WINS

24
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,222
White 1, please make your move.

25
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,558
White 1, please make your move.

26
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,686
What? Again?

27
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,104
WHITE 1 MOVES UNEXPECTEDLY

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,023
Hang on. Is White 1 moving?

29
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,526
What is their plan?

30
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,028
Why would they want White 1 to move?

31
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,363
THE UNEXPECTED MOVE SURPRISES TEAM BLACK

32
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,824
Hold on. Our teammates
must be getting shaken up.

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,993
What are they planning?

34
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,503
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

35
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,255
Should we have White 3 retreat?

36
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,923
HOPES TO USE BLACK 4
TO GET WHITE 3 TO MOVE

37
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:17,095
Wait, they must've called White 1
expecting us to move Black 4.

38
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:21,599
That can only mean they devised a way
to finish the game before us.

39
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,602
What did they see that we missed?

40
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,188
Black 4, please make your move.

41
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,982
POSTECH'S MIN-SU MOVES
AS INITIALLY PLANNED

42
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,447
Let's bring White 5 down here.

43
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,825
White 5, please make your move.

44
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,788
What did you see?

45
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,172
Black 6, please make your move.

46
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,340
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON IS CALLED TO MOVE

47
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,805
White 1, please make your move.

48
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,475
White 1? What the heck are they thinking?

49
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,977
Are we going down like this?

50
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,898
Hurry, Su-han. Team KAIST...

51
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,318
What's going on? What route did they find?

52
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,074
Black 1 should move up, right?

53
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,993
Black 1 is Gyu-min, isn't it?

54
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,580
He'll know that he needs to move up.

55
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,796
Black 1, please make your move.

56
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,095
White 5 should go up.

57
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,722
Then, when Black 1 moves to the center...

58
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,724
- White 5 come home.
- Exactly.

59
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,061
We've only kept White 5 here
to secure the column in the center.

60
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,270
DECIDES TO MOVE WHITE 5

61
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,399
White 5, please make your move.

62
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,028
- This game is so well made.
- You have ten seconds left.

63
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,822
I agree. It's really fun.

64
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,074
We'd be done already
if we hadn't missed Black 2.

65
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,159
White 5, please make your move.

66
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,372
WHITE 5, YONSEI'S HYEON-SEUNG,
IS CALLED TO MOVE

67
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,503
Wait, White 5 just moved up.

68
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,213
Hold on.

69
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,926
If we call Black 4 and Black 1,
can Team White block their paths somehow?

70
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,430
Let's suppose we moved Black 4
and then moved Black 1 to the center.

71
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,641
Team White can't finish the game
while we take those two turns, can they?

72
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,268
Can they?

73
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,062
Hold on. Let's take a look.

74
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,608
How could they have missed
such a simple move?

75
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,279
Hey, we're in big trouble.

76
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,447
What do you mean?

77
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:45,076
TEAM WHITE IS LATE TO NOTICE
THE ROUTE BLACK 4 CAN TAKE

78
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,080
Black 4, please make your move.

79
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,206
POSTECH'S MIN-SU IS CALLED TO MOVE

80
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,381
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

81
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,300
Have we lost?

82
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,387
Once Black 1 moves,
either Black 1 or Black 4 can come home.

83
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,224
You have 30 seconds left.

84
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,605
- They won't miss. They've won.
- You have ten seconds left.

85
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,024
- We're out of options.
- How about White 4?

86
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,529
Your time is up.

87
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,782
YOUR TURN EXPIRES
IF YOU FAIL TO CALL WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT

88
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,618
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

89
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,162
They're so strict.

90
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,707
- Let's move Black 1.
- Let's do that.

91
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,800
TEAM BLACK CAN EXIT THE BOARD
ON THEIR NEXT TURN

92
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,469
What a shame.

93
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,595
Let's just call White 4.

94
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,013
Let's get ready for the next one.

95
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,265
I can't believe it.

96
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,647
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

97
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,400
Who should we shine the spotlight on?

98
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,486
Let's call Min-su.

99
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,739
Gyu-min had his moment of glory
in the Pyramid Game.

100
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,409
All right. Let's go with Black 4.

101
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,039
Well done.

102
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,752
Black 4, please make your move.

103
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,719
TEAM WHITE: 1, TEAM BLACK: 2

104
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,847
Team Black's second piece
has exited the board.

105
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,059
The second round goes to Team Black.

106
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,811
TEAM BLACK WINS ROUND 2

107
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,232
We'll now begin Round 3
of Exit Strategy 2.

108
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,193
- That was amazing!
- Calm down.

109
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,653
It's not over yet.

110
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,280
We still have another round left.

111
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,032
In case they copy our strategy--

112
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,950
Yeah, we need a plan for that.

113
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:53,121
Considering how close it was,
they might not choose to copy our plan.

114
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,999
Because Team White ended the game
so quickly when they went first.

115
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,085
- We barely managed to win.
- Yeah, they might not think much of it

116
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,796
- and stick to their original plan.
- We have to consider that.

117
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,092
- Why didn't you call White 3?
- We totally should've done that.

118
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,260
Why didn't you catch that?

119
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,220
We missed Black 1 and Black 4's formation.

120
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:13,808
You should've considered every possibility
as Team Black made their moves.

121
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,605
The easy win from Round 1
must've gone to our heads.

122
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,025
Tell me if you think
we should switch the leaders or not.

123
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,030
- No, let's not do that. It'd only--
- It'd only be confusing, right?

124
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,448
Don't worry. You did great.

125
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,701
We'll get to go first again,
so let's use the strategy from Round 1.

126
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,828
Should White 4 move toward the exit again?

127
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,247
- And take the central row again?
- Yeah.

128
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,749
But think about this.

129
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,293
They could make way for us
to give us one point

130
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,253
and take two points
with the least number of moves.

131
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,172
LURING WHITE 4 TO THE EXIT...
Once I come home,

132
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,341
they could take control
of the central row.

133
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,634
So, Black 4 could move here.

134
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,470
...TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE CENTRAL ROW
Then, other black pieces could follow.

135
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,930
They could just exit the board, then.

136
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,973
2 PIECES OF TEAM BLACK COULD
EXIT THE BOARD SAFELY

137
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,768
But would it be easy for them
to sacrifice one point?

138
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,104
I think doing so would be
too risky for them.

139
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,524
They'd need to have some serious guts
to pull off a strategy like that.

140
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,443
Try playing as Team White
copying our plan.

141
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,695
So, go first using our formation?

142
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:07,654
Like this?

143
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,697
Do your best to beat me.

144
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,615
PREPARING FOR TEAM WHITE'S COPYCAT MOVE

145
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,286
How would we stop them
from making successive exits?

146
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,707
There's a good chance
for the game to end quickly.

147
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,670
We have to let them score a point
and go for the win afterward.

148
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:28,758
LETTING ONE PIECE EXIT THE BOARD
AND THEN TAKING OVER THE CENTRAL ROW

149
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,885
No way. That's too risky.

150
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,554
Remember, we're going second.

151
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,351
If it starts like--

152
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,020
I have an idea.

153
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:48,028
I'm not so sure about these pieces
being placed near the edges like this.

154
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,321
Why don't we place them in these two rows

155
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,575
so they can charge ahead
if we get the chance?

156
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,995
- I think that could be a good offense.
- He has a point.

157
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,290
The pieces placed in the corner
are useful when taking a detour.

158
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,125
But if we place them like that,

159
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,753
they can be deployed quickly
when we have a situation.

160
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,713
We'll end up using one less turn.

161
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,716
- So, have we decided to block these two?
- Yeah, we did.

162
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,426
TAKE CONTROL OF THE CELLS
ABOVE AND BELOW THE EXIT

163
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,304
If White 6 moves across the central row...

164
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,473
Then, Black 6 could use it
to go around like this.

165
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,392
USING A WHITE PIECE AS A STEPPING STONE
TO EXIT THEIR PIECES

166
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,144
We now have a definite solution.

167
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,064
But what if they try the same thing as us?

168
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,733
So, what's our initial placement?

169
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,235
I thought we were trying this.

170
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,987
SIMILAR LAYOUT TO TEAM BLACK'S PLACEMENT

171
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,614
And what's our first move?

172
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,324
Move White 6 next to White 2.

173
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,034
What if Black 6 moves in like this?

174
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,328
When he does, White 6 will move across.

175
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,621
- What if Black 3 comes here?
- Then--

176
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,872
Do I exit the board, then?

177
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,123
No, you can't do that.

178
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,667
White 4 moves down so Black 3 can exit,

179
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,211
then, we'll take the cells
on either side of the exit.

180
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,879
Don't exit the board right away.

181
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,172
Man, this is confusing.

182
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,882
If Black 3 doesn't move in...

183
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,258
IF TEAM BLACK DOESN'T TAKE THE CENTRAL ROW

184
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,968
...wouldn't it be better to move White 5?

185
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,887
- Right.
- The central row is the key.

186
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,722
We need to take these two cells.

187
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,849
That's how they won Round 2.

188
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,852
I think it will boil down
to who claims 2 of these 4 cells first.

189
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,980
Right, we won Round 1
after claiming these cells, too.

190
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,942
Exactly. Taking these cells
will be so important.

191
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,821
You have one minute left.

192
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,365
Who's going to be our leaders?

193
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,118
Why don't we try it together, Ji-seong?

194
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,453
- Us two?
- Obviously, Su-han would need to agree.

195
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,539
Let's swap. A change would be good.

196
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,665
Wait. Take that off.

197
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,126
Su-han and Gyu-min
are trading their positions.

198
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,379
Let's show them
that we can win while going second.

199
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,505
Of course.

200
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,966
I felt optimistic
about our chances for Round 3.

201
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,094
Gyu-min had never disappointed us so far

202
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,888
when he felt confident
about the tasks we had.

203
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,099
I trusted him
because I knew Gyu-min could do well.

204
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,018
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

205
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,979
- Let's go, SNU and POSTECH!
- Let's go, SNU and POSTECH!

206
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,897
Let's go, KAIST and Yonsei!

207
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,232
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

208
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,528
The game will be resumed.

209
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,909
It'll be fine as long as we don't mess up.

210
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,038
You and I
are the youngest ones here, right?

211
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,498
TEAM BLACK IS BEING LED
BY ITS 2 YOUNGEST MEMBERS

212
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:10,920
Pieces of both teams,
please take your positions.

213
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,051
Only the sixes are positioned differently.

214
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,387
I wonder what their plan is.

215
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,892
We'll now begin Round 3
of Exit Strategy 2.

216
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,729
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

217
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,190
- We'll move White 6 first, right?
- Sure.

218
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,735
TEAM WHITE PROCEEDS AS PLANNED
White 6, please make your move.

219
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,076
I bet Black 5 will move down.

220
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,911
TEAM WHITE EXPECTED BLACK 5 TO MOVE...

221
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,121
- Let's push forward.
- Let's go with Black 2.

222
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,039
...BUT BLACK 2 MOVES INSTEAD

223
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,665
Let me adjust the stones.

224
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,877
Black 2, please make your move.

225
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,384
TEAM BLACK MAKES AN UNEXPECTED MOVE

226
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,344
What's going on?

227
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,431
It must be this.

228
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,683
SEUNG-CHAN NOTICES THEIR PLAN

229
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,934
So, he'd take the center?

230
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,144
But we could move White 2 here, right?

231
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,313
- We got to go first, after all.
- Yeah.

232
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,191
But then, Black 5 would go around
and exit the board.

233
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,943
You have 30 seconds left.

234
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,408
But White 2 has to move.
We can't afford to have Black 4 there.

235
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,118
Black 3 could block us, too.

236
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,454
Both of those pieces
could make things bad for us.

237
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,254
- You have ten seconds left.
- Black 3 will move in.

238
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,715
- How about moving White 2?
- White 2, it is.

239
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,509
Damn, they're really good.

240
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,721
They have the advantage,
even though we went first.

241
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,432
White 2, please make your move.

242
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,686
White 2 would have a hard time
deciding where to go.

243
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,024
WHITE 2 CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN 3 DIRECTIONS

244
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,405
Would White 2 move forward or backward?

245
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,657
Moving backward could be better.

246
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:03,783
Do you think so?

247
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,202
Right, doing so won't affect
our offensive moves.

248
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,787
Right. Black 3 would go here.

249
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,668
WHITE 2 MOVES FORWARD

250
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,086
He's moving forward.

251
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,757
Didn't we expect that to happen?

252
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,217
Can't we have Black 1 move up now?

253
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,094
Could that be a problem?

254
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,095
Shall I call Black 1?

255
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,517
Black 1, please make your move.

256
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,525
I'm sure Su-han will understand our plan.

257
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,243
CONTRARY TO THE LEADERS' WISHES,
SU-HAN MOVES BACKWARD

258
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,411
What just happened?

259
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,500
It's so difficult to play
with sentient pieces.

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,293
What are they planning?

261
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,961
Why did Black 1 go there?

262
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,297
Have we oversimplified things?

263
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,257
No, I don't think that's the case.

264
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:06,012
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

265
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,181
Moving White 4 seems like a good idea.

266
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,683
- Next to Black 5?
- Yeah.

267
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,519
DECIDES TO MOVE WHITE 4 NEXT
Okay, let's roll with that.

268
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,021
White 4, please make your move.

269
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,485
We can't move Black 3 now.

270
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,737
IF BLACK 3 MOVES TO THE CENTER,
WHITE 4 CAN EXIT THE BOARD

271
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,074
Our only option is moving Black 1.
Could that cause any problems?

272
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,993
It won't be a problem,
but it feels like a loss.

273
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,996
I think we need a timeout.

274
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,750
Su-han might have an idea.
Let's hear him out.

275
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,128
We need to proceed with caution.

276
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,549
Team Black requested a timeout.

277
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,845
- I wonder why.
- Why did you move backward?

278
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,097
- Who was Black 1?
- I have a question, too.

279
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,849
Was your goal earlier a quid pro quo?

280
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,642
Weren't you going to go here?

281
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,020
- Take the central row?
- That was our intention.

282
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,106
But what if White 6 moves in next to me?

283
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,275
Then, White 4 would move like this
to score a point.

284
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,401
You're absolutely right.

285
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,111
WHITE 2 COULD ALSO FOLLOW SUIT

286
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,364
Things don't look good.
We can't make any moves.

287
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,993
If I move up,
White 6 will inevitably move in.

288
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,161
Like so.

289
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,288
- That will definitely happen.
- I agree.

290
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,416
Is there any to stop White 2
from going around and exiting?

291
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,460
Let's say White 2 moves across the board.

292
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,170
Then, Black 4 can follow him.

293
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,171
But once that happens,

294
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,714
- White 2 will move down.
- Right. He'll run.

295
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,841
Then, we can have our trade-off.

296
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,801
BOTH TEAMS CAN EACH EXIT A PIECE

297
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,595
That seems to be our best option.

298
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:33,016
Since we would take over the central row,
giving them a point wouldn't be so bad.

299
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,143
In this case...

300
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,645
We have to consider
Team Black's best moves.

301
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,773
Once Black 1 moves up,
White 6 should box him in.

302
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,982
What if Black 2 goes here?

303
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,193
Can't we then move White 5?

304
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,612
If it blocks Black 2's path,
the game will be ours.

305
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,280
ABLE TO TAKE CELLS OVER AND UNDER THE EXIT

306
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:50,825
Can't we have White 1
move around to the exit?

307
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,494
- We can.
- But they would counter us.

308
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,205
- We should stop them with the White 1.
- Oh, okay.

309
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,417
In case Black 1 moves up,
we'll definitely move White 6.

310
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,586
If Black 2 moves, White 5 will follow him.

311
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,630
Our maneuvers for these two cases are set.

312
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,091
If another piece moves around the board
or if we're unsure,

313
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,217
White 1 should move down.

314
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,843
WHITE 1 WILL MOVE FOR ALL OTHER SITUATIONS

315
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,221
Your time is up.

316
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,306
Ask for a timeout
if you feel unsure about anything.

317
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,600
- Okay.
- Right, we haven't used ours yet.

318
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,519
Even then, White 2 might stay put.

319
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:18,603
DISCUSSING MOVES UNTIL THE END

320
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,230
You'll need to consider that, too.

321
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,530
Black 1, please make your move.

322
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,204
- This is our best option, right?
- Yeah.

323
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,373
Are we sure about this?

324
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,666
Let's pray.

325
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,584
- Press number 6 for me
- You have 30 seconds left.

326
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,545
- at the 10-second warning.
- Okay.

327
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,758
White 6, please make your move.

328
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:49,843
KAIST'S JI-SEONG IS CALLED TO MOVE

329
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,181
He moved toward Black 1.

330
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,268
We agreed to move Black 6 first, right?

331
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,895
Black 6, please make your move.

332
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:01,980
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON IS CALLED TO MOVE

333
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,944
Why don't we move White 1 over?

334
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,822
- Like our plan earlier?
- Right. Go all the way across.

335
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,241
White 1, please make your move.

336
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,284
PROCEEDING AS PLANNED

337
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,785
ANOTHER UNEXPECTED MOVE BY TEAM WHITE

338
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,828
Come on. Not again.

339
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,496
What's their plan?

340
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,667
What are they intending to do?

341
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,673
They've got no other option
other than moving back.

342
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,718
Can't we just have
Black 6 move to the left?

343
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,136
Let's think it over.

344
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,638
I think calling Black 6
is the right choice.

345
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,516
Moving Black 1 won't do anything for us.

346
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,809
The same goes for Black 4.

347
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,854
Between Black 5 and Black 6,
6 would take 1 less turn.

348
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:45,440
- Let's choose Black 6.
- That's the right call.

349
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,818
Black 6, please make your move.

350
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:49,903
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON IS CALLED TO MOVE

351
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,613
I bet he'll go forward to the left.

352
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,534
- Do we move White 3?
- Yeah, it needs to go to Black 6.

353
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,453
But there's no guarantee
Se-hwan will go there.

354
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,081
Won't he, though?
It's kind of obvious, isn't it?

355
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,751
White 3, please make your move.

356
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,544
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN IS CALLED TO MOVE

357
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,381
He has two options now,
and those two routes...

358
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,591
Neither of them would cause any problems.

359
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,889
MOVES TO THE CELL NEXT TO BLACK 6

360
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,058
We should call Black 5, right?

361
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,560
We could call Black 2 out of the way
and have Black 3 move.

362
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,230
Once Black 2 moves out,
a path opens up for Black 6.

363
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,147
Right.

364
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,233
But is that for the better?

365
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,277
I'm not sure. Moving Black 5
might not be a bad idea.

366
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,029
We still have 30 seconds,
so let me reconsider.

367
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,657
It's either Black 5 or Black 2.

368
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,617
We could reassess after calling Black 5.

369
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,993
Good idea.

370
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,538
Black 5, please make your move.

371
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,206
POSTECH'S JU-YEONG IS CALLED TO MOVE

372
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,170
Shouldn't we move White 4 next?

373
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,464
We should.
He can then come home in two turns.

374
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,801
I get what they're trying to do.

375
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,345
Once White 4 moves, they'll bring
Black 6 home using Black 3.

376
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,431
What should we do?

377
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:00,849
Shall we request a timeout?

378
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,183
- Or call White 4.
- Really?

379
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,852
- No, let's request a timeout.
- Okay.

380
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,397
Team White requested a timeout.

381
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:08,898
Guys, look.

382
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:13,028
We requested the timeout
because things got too complicated.

383
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:17,782
We have many options, including
having White 4 or White 3 move around.

384
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,617
But White 4 has to stay put.

385
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,202
It's holding everything together.

386
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,787
You must never move White 4.

387
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,915
If Team White calls White 4 to move,

388
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:30,378
Team Black will only need 6 turns
to bring 2 pieces home.

389
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,504
TEAM BLACK COULD WIN IN 6 TURNS

390
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,299
But we don't have any moves
to win the game at the moment.

391
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,134
So, let's have White 3 move down.

392
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,386
Then, what if Black 5 makes a move?

393
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,473
- We'll block with White 5.
- That seems to be our best bet.

394
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,850
Team Black can't do much after that.

395
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,102
Let's go with blocking their 5 with our 5.

396
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,479
And that's the right call.

397
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,813
Let's settle with that.

398
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,565
Hold on. What if Black 6 moves down?

399
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,900
White 4 can block him in.

400
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,360
WHITE 4 TO DEFEND AGAINST BLACK 6

401
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,613
Team White can only move
White 3 or White 4 around.

402
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,739
If they move White 4,

403
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,367
since we couldn't move Black 3
because of White 4,

404
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,994
that would ultimately be in our favor.

405
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:04,120
- Understood.
- Next.

406
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,623
- What if they move White 3?
- In that case,

407
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,958
we'll have Black 2 mark White 3.

408
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,044
What if White 3 takes another direction?

409
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,214
Black 6 is a good option.
That was the idea I had earlier.

410
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:17,092
And if White 2 moves toward White 3,
we'll send Black 4.

411
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,843
That was the initial plan.

412
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,012
Your time is up.

413
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,806
The game will be resumed.

414
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,683
TEAM WHITE DECIDES TO MOVE WHITE 3

415
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,017
Yes, move down one cell.

416
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,936
Let's go with that plan.

417
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,105
If they call White 3,
Black 6 will mark him, right?

418
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:38,029
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

419
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,739
- Let's move White 3.
- Okay.

420
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,868
White 3, please make your move.

421
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,328
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN IS CALLED TO MOVE

422
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,247
White 3, please make your move.

423
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,748
- White 3?
- They're moving him around.

424
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,542
We decided to move Black 6
if that happens.

425
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,460
TEAM BLACK DEFENDS USING BLACK 6

426
00:20:57,132 --> 00:21:00,635
But shouldn't we keep Black 6 there
if we want Black 5 to go around?

427
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,595
- Won't this be better?
- So, move Black 5 instead?

428
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,014
Black 5?

429
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,016
- Black 5.
- You have ten seconds left.

430
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,106
Black 5, please make your move.

431
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:17,110
MOVING BLACK 5 WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN

432
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,575
I was called out of the blue.

433
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:27,537
That threw me off.
I kept wondering, "Why was I called?"

434
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,416
"Are they expecting me
to make an offensive move?"

435
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:40,842
JU-YEONG GOES TOWARD BLACK 6

436
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,262
TEAM WHITE DECIDED
TO COUNTER BLACK 5 WITH WHITE 5

437
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,223
White 5, please make your move.

438
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,517
We could move Black 4 around.

439
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,105
White 2 could always come back
to its previous cell.

440
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,860
- There's no drawback.
- Let's call Black 5.

441
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,403
- Let's mark him with White 5.
- Go ahead.

442
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:05,241
THE TWO TEAMS KEEP COUNTERING
EACH OTHER'S MOVES

443
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,496
- This is it.
- Exactly.

444
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,957
If we can only keep
Black 2 stationed there,

445
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,793
things will look up for us.

446
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,422
Black 2, please make your move.

447
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:35,313
BLACK 2, SNU'S CHO JUN-HYEONG,
MAKES AN UNEXPECTED MOVE

448
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:36,690
What?

449
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,943
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

450
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,737
- What happened?
- He moved down the board.

451
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:43,863
Who was Black 2?

452
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:47,659
Was there any reason
he couldn't take the cell above the exit?

453
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,453
Black 2 just moved to the bottom.

454
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,789
- Did we miss something again?
- Hold on.

455
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,416
Now, we have Black 2 down here.

456
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,170
I wonder why he did that.

457
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,798
Why don't we have
White 5 tail him for now?

458
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,967
- Should we block Black 2?
- Yeah.

459
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,970
White 5, please make your move.

460
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,393
- I get it now.
- What?

461
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:14,811
He opened up the way for Black 3.

462
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,896
BLACK 3 CAN NOW TAKE
THE CELL ABOVE THE EXIT

463
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,314
That's brilliant.

464
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,649
We should call him the GOAT.

465
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,569
Black 3, please make your move.

466
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,072
Black 3? So this was their plan.

467
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,242
We sent White 5 down for nothing.

468
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,120
Let's send White 4 down here.

469
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,164
HYEONG-SEOK TRIES TO DEFEND USING WHITE 4

470
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,710
WHITE 4, KAIST'S GI-HYEON,
CUTS OFF BLACK 3'S ESCAPE ROUTE

471
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:41,713
Since we can't stop White 3 anyway,
we must send Black 5 down there.

472
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:45,759
This may not be a good move,
but it's an unavoidable one.

473
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:50,805
I'm inclined to send White 4 there.

474
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,515
Move it next to Black 3?

475
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,768
- You have ten seconds left.
- Black 2 could block him.

476
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,478
But let's try moving White 4.

477
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,692
I considered moving Black 5.

478
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,277
Let's suppose we moved Black 5.

479
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,529
Then, White 4 would move in.

480
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,657
- Do we call Black 5 next?
- We're in a deadlock.

481
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:14,120
- I can't think of any way out.
- You have ten seconds left.

482
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,790
1 HOUR PASSES

483
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,875
NOT A SINGLE PIECE HAS EXITED THE BOARD

484
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,550
What if White 1 moves down?

485
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,845
- Do we block him with Black 2?
- No, that should go up.

486
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,305
But Black 2...

487
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,349
Well, that's up to Jun-hyeong to decide.

488
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,519
- Wait.
- I already called number two.

489
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,021
But moving Black 2 can...

490
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,357
Black 2, please make your move.

491
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,566
SNU'S CHO JUN-HYEONG IS CALLED TO MOVE

492
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,877
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

493
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,088
Let's use White 5 as a stepping stone.

494
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,466
TEAM WHITE FOUND A WAY OUT FOR WHITE 4

495
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,468
- You got my plan, right?
- Sure, I like it.

496
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,179
White 5, please make your move.

497
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:15,932
No, then White 4 can come home!

498
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,268
JI-SEONG NOTICES TEAM WHITE'S ESCAPE PLAN

499
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,650
TEAM WHITE SECURES A PATH
FOR WHITE 4 TO EXIT THE BOARD

500
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,861
How could we make a mistake?

501
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,784
How should we respond?

502
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,370
- We could move Black 6.
- Okay.

503
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:44,127
We should've gone with Black 6
and left Black 5 alone.

504
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:47,005
Black 6, please make your move.

505
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,298
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON IS CALLED TO MOVE

506
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,846
BLACK 6 MOVES
AGAINST THE TEAM LEADERS' EXPECTATION

507
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,099
- Did Black 6 just go here?
- What's up with him?

508
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,434
What's going on?

509
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,772
TEAM WHITE EXITS THE BOARD
AS A SAFE OPTION

510
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:06,524
Let's have White 4 exit the board for now.

511
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:09,944
White 4, please make your move.

512
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:15,867
TEAM BLACK CAN'T STOP
WHITE 4 FROM EXITING THE BOARD

513
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,120
Black 5, please make your move.

514
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:27,379
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

515
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,594
There was a route we could take
that would get us the win.

516
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,222
I would act as a screen as White 5

517
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,432
and have White 6 move all the way down.

518
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:42,519
WHITE 4 AND WHITE 6 CAN EXIT THE BOARD
USING WHITE 5 AS A STEPPING STONE

519
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,313
I was sure that we could end the game.

520
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:49,025
TEAM WHITE CAN WIN
IF WHITE 6 IS CALLED TO MOVE

521
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:50,235
Team White.

522
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,655
White 5, please make your move.

523
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:58,743
I was bewildered
when I was called to move.

524
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:03,915
I couldn't understand
what our leaders' plan was.

525
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,877
- I think I found something.
- How about moving White 2 back?

526
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,547
But if White 5 moves up,
and Black 2 goes to White 4,

527
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,757
White 5 can move back down.

528
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,342
If White 1 moves across the board,

529
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:17,262
we can have 2 pieces ready
to come home in 2 turns.

530
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,179
Press number five.

531
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,889
THE LEADERS HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA

532
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,434
White 5, please make your move.

533
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:26,896
It dawned on me that my winning strategy

534
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,233
could have been different
from what the leaders had thought of.

535
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,031
You have ten seconds left.

536
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:43,204
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

537
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:45,248
Don't worry. We're still in good shape.

538
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,045
- It's time to move Black 2, right?
- That's right.

539
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:53,173
Black 2, please make your move.

540
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,926
White 5, please make your move.

541
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,393
I don't understand the implication.

542
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,396
Let's push Black 4.

543
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:12,233
- Let's send White 1 over.
- Okay.

544
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:16,571
Let's move Black 3.

545
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,156
Man, we almost lost.

546
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,659
TEAM BLACK CUTS OFF WHITE 1'S PATH

547
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,078
- Let's move White 5.
- Okay.

548
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,162
Let's call Black 3.

549
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:25,830
White 5 can block him.

550
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,749
THE TEAMS ARE IN ANOTHER DEADLOCK

551
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,584
Shall we send Black 4 here?

552
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,003
Shall we move White 5?

553
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:33,963
Let's have Black 3 go up.

554
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:38,635
NO PIECES HAVE EXITED THE BOARD SO FAR

555
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,679
- You know...
- Let's call White 1.

556
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,013
Hold on.

557
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,769
Look. If we call White 1,
Black 6 will move down.

558
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,437
We White 4 can exit the board.

559
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:53,066
White 5 can move forward,
but that would bring Black 3 home.

560
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:54,776
Can we afford to give them one point?

561
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,319
TEAM WHITE HAVE FOUND A WINNING MOVE

562
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,529
Do you get it?

563
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,281
- Let's call White 1, then.
- All right.

564
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,161
You need to focus
on exiting the board, Yu-chan.

565
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,090
- Let's not give them any time to think.
- Call Black 6.

566
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,174
UNAWARE OF TEAM WHITE'S PLAN

567
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:21,386
Black 6, please make your move.

568
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,642
White 4, please make your move.

569
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,982
Team White's first piece
has exited the board.

570
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,609
- We need to call Black 3 now.
- Black 3? All right.

571
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:38,028
TRIES TO SCORE WITH BLACK 3

572
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:42,782
- White 5, right?
- Yeah.

573
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,743
- I'm sure Hyeon-seung will get it.
- Right.

574
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,120
White 5, please make your move.

575
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,832
Wait a second.

576
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,459
Damn...

577
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:59,382
WHITE 1 CAN EXIT THE BOARD
IN 2 TURNS AS PLANNED

578
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:04,721
TEAM BLACK HAS NO WAY TO STOP WHITE 1

579
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:14,272
Black 3, please make your move.

580
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:18,318
Team Black's first piece
has exited the board.

581
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:19,569
TEAM WHITE: 1, TEAM BLACK: 1

582
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,323
- Was that the right button?
- Of course.

583
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:25,575
You can't miss
if you're as good as me at video games.

584
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,245
White 1, please make your move.

585
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,125
Let's just get it over with.

586
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,546
Black 1, please make your move.

587
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:43,677
White 1, please make your move.

588
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,559
Team White's second piece
has exited the board.

589
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:57,565
The final winner of Exit Strategy 2
is Team White.

590
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:00,193
...has exited the board.

591
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,736
Great work, man.

592
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,988
I can't believe those two misses, though.

593
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:08,368
I'd like to thank Hyeong-seok
for suggesting that we team up first.

594
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:10,662
We made up for any mistakes
either of us made,

595
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:13,540
and I'm glad that our efforts paid off.

596
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:18,628
I called the shots as one of the leaders,
so I felt responsible for the outcome.

597
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:23,925
I felt bad for the teammates
who were on the board for so long.

598
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:30,390
That concludes the main match,
Exit Strategy 2.

599
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,685
The final results will now be revealed.

600
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:37,439
Team KAIST and Yonsei won the match.

601
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:42,318
Team SNU and POSTECH has lost.

602
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:45,280
Please go to the Deathmatch Hall.

603
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:10,722
I thought the Deathmatch was a trial
we had to overcome to win this season.

604
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:14,100
I knew my team's journey
would never stop at fourth place.

605
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:15,518
We're Team SNU, after all.

606
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,354
I felt pretty confident.

607
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,398
Now that we played as a team
with Team SNU...

608
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:22,233
We learned that they're not so special.

609
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,153
I thought that we could win
as long as we played our cards right.

610
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:29,949
I wanted to teach them a lesson
so that they would never forget.

611
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:33,703
The Deathmatch will now begin.

612
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:42,420
Today's Deathmatch is Rainbow Sequence.

613
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,050
Will they be asked to find sequence rules?

614
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,968
This also looks pretty fun.

615
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,221
In Rainbow Sequence,

616
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:55,433
you will have to memorize a board
filled with numbers and question marks.

617
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:59,104
You must then guess the right numbers
after the board has turned blank.

618
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:00,438
What the heck?

619
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,606
Are you serious?

620
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:07,946
Rainbow Sequence uses a 7-by-7 board,

621
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:11,408
and its cells are filled
with the seven colors of the rainbow.

622
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:15,120
Cells of the same color
belong to the same number sequence.

623
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:17,539
...in seven shades...

624
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:19,457
So, the cells are all color-coded.

625
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:22,210
The sequences progress from left to right,

626
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:25,630
and the seventh term of each sequence
will remain hidden.

627
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:29,718
The contestants must deduce its value
by working out the sequence's rule.

628
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:31,803
Here is an example.

629
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:34,723
The rule behind the sequence in red cells

630
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:40,729
is that each term progresses
by multiplying the previous value by two.

631
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:46,860
By applying this rule, we can calculate
that the red hidden number is 256.

632
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:50,780
Once the game starts,

633
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:53,700
the game board
will be shown to the contestants.

634
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:56,369
You will have five minutes
to memorize the board.

635
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,164
Jeong-hun would have
gotten everything right.

636
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:00,790
Five minutes should be enough.

637
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:01,916
MEMORIZED PI TO THE 504TH DIGIT

638
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,461
The players will be given 1 minute

639
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:07,005
to give the coordinates
and the value for a cell.

640
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:12,427
You will earn different amounts of points
depending on the cell you choose to guess.

641
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:15,722
Cells without a question mark
grant you one point,

642
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:19,517
whereas cells with a question mark
grant you four points.

643
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:23,104
Completing the board
concludes one round of the game.

644
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:25,065
THE ROUND ENDS WHEN ALL CELLS ARE FILLED

645
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:28,026
The game consists of three rounds,

646
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,862
and if you get a correct answer
for Rounds 1 and 2,

647
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,782
you can continue to call out
additional guesses in succession.

648
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,742
CORRECT ANSWERS CAN LEAD
TO SUCCESSIVE GUESSES

649
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:38,244
But even if you make
a correct guess in Round 3,

650
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,914
you may only give
three answers in a row at most.

651
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:43,583
After that,
your opponent will take their turn.

652
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:47,212
However, if you guess the hidden number
in any of the three rounds,

653
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:50,548
the turn will be immediately handed over
to your opponent.

654
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:55,178
Your opponent will also take their turn
if you make an incorrect guess.

655
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,265
Won't that give
the first player a huge edge?

656
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:02,727
You'd have to get all the cells right
when you get to go first.

657
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:05,605
Each round will be played
on a 1-on-1 basis.

658
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:09,651
Different contestants must play
in Rounds 1 and 2.

659
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:13,029
But those who participated in either
can play again in Round 3.

660
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:15,073
At the end of the three rounds,

661
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:18,827
the team with the higher total score
will be declared the winner.

662
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:23,373
The method of deciding
which team goes first will be revealed

663
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:25,792
after your strategy meeting
before the match.

664
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,460
- We have a shot at winning.
- Yeah.

665
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:28,378
It's great.

666
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:31,715
- I like our chances.
- We have an actual shot at winning.

667
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:35,385
Gyu-min is excellent at memorization,

668
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,387
and Jun-hyeong is quite good at it, too.

669
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,223
I felt sure that we'd win the Deathmatch.

670
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,892
Both teams,
please return to your base camps

671
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,228
and start discussing your strategies.

672
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,063
You will have 20 minutes.

673
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:48,732
This is absolutely fantastic.

674
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,275
This place feels like home.

675
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:52,694
Don't you feel more at home here
than in the Main Hall?

676
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:55,613
First of all,

677
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,033
this isn't a memorization game.
We need to find the rules.

678
00:35:58,241 --> 00:35:59,951
Let's sum up the points.

679
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,661
You can get 42 points
from the unmarked cells

680
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:03,955
and 28 points from the marked cells.

681
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:07,500
Score 42 points in a row,
and the round will be ours.

682
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,794
They can't do anything about it.

683
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,505
We don't know who goes first yet, do we?

684
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,507
The match hinges on who goes first.

685
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,551
But that will only be decided later on.

686
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:20,347
If we get to go first
and play our cards right,

687
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,184
we could deprive Team SNU
of a chance to even play the game.

688
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:27,354
We felt certain we would win
as long as we got to go first.

689
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:31,316
Don't guess a four-pointer early on.
It'll only give them the turn.

690
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:34,069
Finish the 1-pointers first,
then move on to the 4-pointers.

691
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,403
That's all we have to do.

692
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:38,865
We wouldn't need to memorize the numbers
if we could work out the rules.

693
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:42,202
That's why we decided to focus
on figuring out the rules.

694
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:44,037
So, we need to memorize three things.

695
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,125
The first terms, their colors,
and the rules used in the sequences.

696
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,960
The board will show you the colors.

697
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,629
So, you're all good as long
as you remember the first terms.

698
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:53,755
THE CELLS WILL STAY COLORED

699
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:55,799
You won't have to memorize the colors.

700
00:36:55,882 --> 00:37:01,012
Memorize the 7 numbers in Column A
and the 7 rules. Then, you're all set.

701
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,889
We just have to find the rules.

702
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:05,850
Memorizing all the numbers
would be too much.

703
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,060
TEAM SNU WILL FOCUS ON RULES

704
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,813
At least three sequences
will have insane rules.

705
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:12,107
It'd be overwhelming
just to figure it out.

706
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,942
I suggest memorizing 14 numbers.

707
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:17,028
TEAM POSTECH WILL FOCUS ON NUMBERS
Let's aim to memorize 14 to 21 numbers.

708
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,030
Memorizing the whole board
is too inefficient.

709
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,616
They could never memorize everything.

710
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,785
They'll probably memorize numbers
from Column A.

711
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:26,287
If we end up going second,
memorize backward from Column G.

712
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:29,332
MEMORIZE BY AVOIDING OVERLAPS
TO MINIMIZE THE DISADVANTAGE OF GOING 2ND

713
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:32,502
Just don't let them gain too much headway.

714
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:34,713
Let's have a think about something.

715
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:38,091
What kind of ridiculous sequences
can you think of?

716
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:40,385
First, there may be sequences
where different rules apply

717
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:42,554
to the odd-numbered terms
and the even-numbered ones.

718
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:45,223
The rules for these three squares

719
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:48,059
could be different
for these three triangles.

720
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:50,520
- So, the last one would be a square.
- I've seen those.

721
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:51,771
That's quite possible.

722
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:56,026
If you consider the odd-numbered terms
and the even-numbered ones separately,

723
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,528
finding the rules becomes much easier.

724
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:03,742
There are also things
we don't usually consider for sequences.

725
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:07,203
For example, listing the decimal places
of the square root of a number.

726
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:11,124
- Something like Pi? 3.1415926535...
- Yeah, exactly.

727
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:12,584
PREPARING FOR IRRATIONAL NUMBERS

728
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:16,254
We tried to think of as many sequences
with elusive rules as we could

729
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,840
and discussed strategies
for memorizing them.

730
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,343
We need to be prepared for anything.

731
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:24,179
I'm sure they've prepared
all sorts of perverse sequences.

732
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:26,264
And we must be ready to memorize them.

733
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,851
PREDICTING RULES JUST LIKE TEAM POSTECH
Can you think of any weird rules?

734
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:31,936
Hit me with your craziest ideas.

735
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,646
Twenty minutes is a lot of time.

736
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:35,940
Give me all sorts
of bizarre sequences that you know.

737
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:37,192
I doubt they'd go this far, but...

738
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,825
These numbers form a cycle.

739
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,870
The rule of this sequence requires you

740
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:52,332
to sum up the squared numbers
of each digit of a term.

741
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:54,918
The resulting number is the next term.

742
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:57,212
Let us repeat the process with 16.

743
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:59,381
The squared number of 1 is 1,

744
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:02,050
and the squared number of 6 is 36.

745
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:04,886
Add the numbers together,
and you get the next term, 37.

746
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:08,890
The bizarre thing is
that if the first term is set as 4,

747
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:13,144
the eight numbers shown
are repeated in an infinite loop.

748
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,815
It just happens to be eight numbers.

749
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:19,317
Guys, try figuring this one out.

750
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:22,278
Let's try as many things as we can.

751
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:24,114
Try this one.

752
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,207
The denominators are even numbers,
and the numerators are prime numbers.

753
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,668
NUMERATORS: PRIME NUMBERS
DENOMINATORS: EVEN NUMBERS

754
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,170
Did you get that from 5, 7, and 11?

755
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:40,213
Not really.

756
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,173
I got a hunch the denominators
would be even-numbered,

757
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:45,427
so I tried changing them
to 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.

758
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,929
Let us change
the first 2 denominators to 4 and 6.

759
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:51,433
Then, we would need to change
the numerators to 2 and 3.

760
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:56,896
It becomes evident that the denominators
are even numbers from 4 and above,

761
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,941
whereas the numerators are prime numbers.

762
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:02,318
Gyu-min never ceases to amaze.

763
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:04,612
I knew he would win
if only he could find the rules.

764
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:07,866
Once I find a rule, I rarely forget it.

765
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:10,827
You know what?

766
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:13,955
Losing is not in my vocabulary.

767
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,500
Gyu-min basically said
that he would definitely win.

768
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:22,088
Gyu-min isn't the type to say such a thing
if he isn't fully confident.

769
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:27,093
The moment I heard the game's name,
I knew we would probably take the win.

770
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,097
As we were listening
to the rules of Rainbow Sequence,

771
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:34,017
the first emotion that hit me
was a sense of guilt.

772
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,688
I knew I would win against anyone
that Team POSTECH put forth.

773
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:41,107
I was so sure of it.

774
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,486
This is fun.

775
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:47,947
You have three minutes left.

776
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:50,158
We need to finalize our roster.

777
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:52,285
We know Jin-hyeon is playing
in Rounds 1 and 3.

778
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,122
My specialty is memorization,

779
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,041
and I have a good grasp
of number sequences, too.

780
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:00,335
So, I thought that I could win
if I didn't make any mistakes.

781
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:03,129
Jin-hyeon is a memorization freak.

782
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:06,049
Knowing that assured me
that we could win the Deathmatch.

783
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:08,134
The player for Round 2 is also important.

784
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:10,929
- I think Ju-yeong could do well.
- I agree.

785
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,723
I'm putting my faith in you, Ju-yeong.

786
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,266
I have faith in myself, too.

787
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,353
And let's face it.
Team SNU is too hyped up.

788
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:20,230
Compared to their team from last season,

789
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:21,648
- they're just not as good.
- Agreed.

790
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:24,734
And when we eliminate them,
their ancestors will roll in their graves.

791
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:34,202
- Who wants to play in Round 1?
- Well...

792
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:39,040
Let me take Round 1
just in case things go wrong.

793
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:41,459
Then, Gyu-min can back us up in Round 2.

794
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:44,629
It'd be best for Gyu-min to take Round 2,
just in case it gets more difficult.

795
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:45,839
- So you'll tackle Round 1?
- Yeah.

796
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:47,799
ROUND 1: YUK JUN-HYEONG
ROUND 2: KIM GYU-MIN

797
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:50,218
The time for the strategy meeting is up.

798
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:53,888
We will now begin the Deathmatch,
Rainbow Sequence.

799
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:57,017
Let's make it through another day.
We can do it.

800
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,476
One, two, three.

801
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,394
- POSTECH!
- POSTECH!

802
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:03,815
Let's do this.

803
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:05,734
- Say, "We, SNU, will win!"
- All right.

804
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:06,901
Down, down, and up.

805
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:10,280
We became much more serious
after ending up in the Deathmatch

806
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:13,074
because the possibility of elimination
was looming over us.

807
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:14,826
We even changed our chant.

808
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:17,203
- We, SNU, will win!
- We, SNU, will win!

809
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:19,080
Let's go!

810
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:20,915
Here we go.

811
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,667
Let's go.

812
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:33,261
I don't think Team POSTECH
would go down without a fight.

813
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:36,014
Won't Gyu-min ace this game?

814
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,517
We want Team POSTECH
to defeat Team SNU here, don't we?

815
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:42,228
Sure, things would be easier
if Team POSTECH survived.

816
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,689
- Good luck, Team POSTECH.
- Good luck, guys.

817
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:48,360
The Deathmatch does tend
to light a fire under you.

818
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:50,612
You never know
how that will affect Team POSTECH.

819
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:53,656
We'll decide which team
will take a turn first

820
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,326
with a quiz on a number sequence.

821
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:01,915
A representative from each team
will solve the problem on stage.

822
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:05,752
The winner's team
will go first in Rounds 1 and 3.

823
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:09,547
The other team will go first in Round 2.

824
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:13,176
The first player has a clear advantage
in a game like this.

825
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:14,803
They'll probably get
a tough question, right?

826
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:21,434
Both teams, please select a representative
to solve the sequence problem.

827
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,397
It seemed like you knew
more about sequences than me.

828
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,774
I don't mind going for it.

829
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:31,403
- What do we do?
- I'll go.

830
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,155
I knew how brilliant Gyu-min was,

831
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,659
but I also knew he was an obstacle
I had to overcome at least once.

832
00:43:37,742 --> 00:43:41,746
The representatives of both teams,
please come forward to the stage.

833
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,376
Good luck.

834
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,387
Won't Team SNU take the win now?

835
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,556
Gyu-min must be an expert on sequences.

836
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:02,183
It'll likely be a landslide win.

837
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:07,647
Why am I getting nervous?

838
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:10,567
Here's your question.

839
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,946
PROBLEM TO DECIDE THE FIRST PLAYER

840
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:19,367
I can't find a rule at all.

841
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,176
This is difficult.

842
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:38,428
I haven't got the faintest idea.

843
00:44:38,803 --> 00:44:41,306
I thought I was pretty good at these.

844
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:43,099
Even Gyu-min is struggling.

845
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:49,397
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

846
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,525
My answer is 294.

847
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:54,694
Two hundred ninety-four.

848
00:44:58,615 --> 00:44:59,699
That is correct.

849
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:06,581
How did he figure that out?

850
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:08,625
Why is the answer 294?

851
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,460
I have no idea.

852
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:12,796
It started with 0, 4, and 18.

853
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:15,840
Seeing how the small numbers grew large,

854
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,343
I knew it had to do with multiplications.

855
00:45:18,426 --> 00:45:20,345
And then I saw these were multiples
of squared numbers.

856
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:26,017
So, I concluded that all terms
were n squared times (n-1).

857
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:27,686
7TH TERM, N=7

858
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:35,985
- How did he do that in his head?
- That was so fast.

859
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:38,697
I thought Gyu-min would be faster
when doing calculations.

860
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:41,533
But Jin-hyeon is damn fast
at crunching numbers, too.

861
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:46,246
Team POSTECH will go first
in Rounds 1 and 3,

862
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:49,207
and Team SNU will go first in Round 2.

863
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:54,546
I grew confident about the Deathmatch
after beating Gyu-min.

864
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:57,215
Please return to your places.

865
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:04,597
I was so proud of Jin-hyeon.

866
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,225
I'll just memorize numbers in Round 2.

867
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,853
Are we changing our roster?

868
00:46:09,936 --> 00:46:12,230
We're going second in Round 1.

869
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:15,066
I'll take Round 1.
Let's just keep it as is.

870
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:18,153
- What do you say?
- Either is fine by me.

871
00:46:18,236 --> 00:46:20,363
You can crush them in Round 2
with your memorization skills.

872
00:46:20,947 --> 00:46:23,825
I'll figure out the rules
and do my best in Round 1.

873
00:46:25,076 --> 00:46:28,621
SNU'S YUK JUN-HYEONG
VS. POSTECH'S CHOI JIN-HYEON

874
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:36,087
We didn't get to go first, but I believed
I could make up for that disadvantage

875
00:46:36,171 --> 00:46:38,465
if I could seize the chance
the moment Jin-hyeon slipped up

876
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:40,467
to fill up the remaining cells.

877
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,679
Deathmatches are all about attitude.

878
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:46,389
I was glad I started off with a win,

879
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:48,933
and I wanted to keep the momentum going.

880
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:53,480
We'll now begin Round 1
of Rainbow Sequence.

881
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:56,274
Here's your board.

882
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,244
This game is insane.

883
00:47:11,122 --> 00:47:14,000
Even with the first terms
and their colors memorized,

884
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:17,128
remembering the right rules
will be so confusing.

885
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:19,589
Going first might not be enough to win
like we expected.

886
00:47:19,923 --> 00:47:22,676
What's up with the navy sequence?
The differences are 2, 4, 2, 4, and 6.

887
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:24,761
The violet sequence is a mystery to me.

888
00:47:25,178 --> 00:47:28,014
What sort of a sequence
is 1, 2, 4, 4, 9, and 8?

889
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,934
This is really difficult.

890
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:33,937
I'm so glad we're not in there.

891
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,983
Here I am, feeling grateful
about avoiding yet another Deathmatch.

892
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:41,277
You have ten seconds left.

893
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:48,201
The time for memorization is over.

894
00:47:52,205 --> 00:47:54,749
Please, heaven above. Hear my prayer.

895
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:58,753
Dear God, Buddha, and Allah.

896
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:00,505
Please let us win this once.

897
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:04,300
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.
Please state a coordinate and its number.

898
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:07,262
I'll go with 11 in A4.

899
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:09,931
A4, 11. That is correct.

900
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:12,809
TEAM SNU: 0, TEAM POSTECH: 1

901
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:16,479
I'll go with 13 in B1.

902
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:19,774
B1, 13. That is correct.

903
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:23,069
I'll go with 17 in C4.

904
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:25,280
I'll go with 19 in D4.

905
00:48:25,363 --> 00:48:28,116
I'll go with 0 in A6.

906
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,535
I'll go with 4 in B3.

907
00:48:30,618 --> 00:48:32,996
I'll go with 1 in C5.

908
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:34,581
That is correct.

909
00:48:34,664 --> 00:48:37,042
TEAM SNU: 0, TEAM POSTECH: 7

910
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:41,880
It seemed like Jin-hyeon
might complete the entire board,

911
00:48:41,963 --> 00:48:43,340
and that made me antsy.

912
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:46,968
It won't be so difficult for 1 person
to get 42 cells in a row.

913
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:50,722
I only had to memorize the rules
for the easier sequences.

914
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:52,766
So, I memorized their first terms
and cast them aside.

915
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:55,101
Then, I memorized
the sequences with elusive rules,

916
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:57,479
so I could fill their cells up first.

917
00:48:57,562 --> 00:49:00,065
Won't it be better
to fill up Column A first?

918
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:02,484
But that comes with a risk.

919
00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:04,027
It could actually help the opponent.

920
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:06,112
I think he's trying
to get the first 4 terms

921
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,907
because he can fill in the rest
by following the rules.

922
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,618
It seems like a good strategy to me.

923
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,914
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.
Please state a coordinate and its number.

924
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:18,833
I'll go with 4 in D7.

925
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:21,836
D7, 4. That is incorrect.

926
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:29,678
I thought, "We're in big trouble.
Why did Jin-hyeon just say that?"

927
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:33,473
I got C7 and D7 mixed up.

928
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:37,602
I should've called C7,
but I ended up naming D7 instead.

929
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:38,937
That is incorrect.

930
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,481
Jin-hyeon just fumbled, big time.

931
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:47,112
I thought going first would be
a definite advantage in this game.

932
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:49,656
But when Jin-hyeon made a mistake,
I remember thinking,

933
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:51,366
"This is it."

934
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:55,829
I'll go with 4 in A1.

935
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,207
A1, 4. That is correct.

936
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:03,795
I'll go with 2 in A3.

937
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:06,256
I'll go with 1 in A5.

938
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:08,174
I'll go with 10 in A7.

939
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:09,884
That is correct.

940
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,302
TEAM SNU: 4, TEAM POSTECH: 7

941
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:13,722
- Look at that.
- He completed Column A first.

942
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:16,474
I'll go with 5 in B4.

943
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:19,394
I'll go with 7 in C6.

944
00:50:19,477 --> 00:50:20,353
That is correct.

945
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:25,775
Now that Column A is done,
he's going through the yellow cells.

946
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:29,362
I'll go with 11 in D3.

947
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:32,115
I'll go with 19 in E7.

948
00:50:32,198 --> 00:50:35,869
I'll go with 35 in F2.

949
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:38,580
I figured out seven rules quickly

950
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:43,168
and filled up the cells of the same color
using the memorized rules.

951
00:50:44,627 --> 00:50:45,587
That is correct.

952
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:50,342
TEAM SNU: 9, TEAM POSTECH: 7

953
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:53,595
I'll go with 14 in B6.

954
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:56,264
That is correct.

955
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:01,686
I'll go

956
00:51:02,979 --> 00:51:04,397
with 37 in C2.

957
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:08,193
That is correct.

958
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:12,864
I'll go with 71 in D1.

959
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:14,741
That is correct.

960
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:17,702
The red sequence is interesting.

961
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:21,915
The differences are 12, 23, and 34,
so 45, 56, and so on.

962
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:28,630
I'll go with 116 in E5.

963
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:32,050
I'll go with 172 in F7.

964
00:51:32,717 --> 00:51:33,760
That is correct.

965
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:37,138
TEAM SNU: 14, TEAM POSTECH: 7

966
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,558
Jin-hyeon's done for.

967
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,395
All he can do now is to pray
that Jun-hyeong messes up.

968
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:46,773
I told myself to stay calm
and avoid making a mistake.

969
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:49,025
I'll go with 2 in B2.

970
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,111
That is correct.

971
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:55,865
I'll go with 4 in C7.

972
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:56,783
That is correct.

973
00:51:56,866 --> 00:51:58,702
I'll go with 4 in D2.

974
00:51:58,785 --> 00:51:59,661
That is correct.

975
00:51:59,744 --> 00:52:01,788
I'll go with 9 in E4.

976
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:03,373
He's right.

977
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:04,624
That is correct.

978
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,084
18 CORRECT GUESSES IN A ROW

979
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:07,627
All right, Jun-hyeong.

980
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:08,712
You're the man.

981
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:12,257
This is a true test of memorization.
You have to remember everything.

982
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:15,802
I'll go with 23 in E6.

983
00:52:16,928 --> 00:52:17,762
That is correct.

984
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:19,014
TEAM SNU: 19, TEAM POSTECH: 7

985
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:22,976
Jun-hyeong kept scoring points
without making a single mistake,

986
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:24,936
and that made me anxious.

987
00:52:25,645 --> 00:52:29,315
We had the huge advantage of going first,

988
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:32,193
but we ended up losing that edge.

989
00:52:32,277 --> 00:52:36,281
And so I kept praying
that Jun-hyeong would make a mistake.

990
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:39,492
I'll go with 29 in F3.

991
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:41,244
That is correct.

992
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:43,788
Is the navy sequence
just a list of prime numbers?

993
00:52:43,872 --> 00:52:45,248
Hey, you're right.

994
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:46,833
I was thinking of a 2, 4, 2, 4 pattern.

995
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:47,917
LIST OF PRIME NUMBERS FROM 11

996
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:50,587
It's not easy to notice
that they're prime numbers.

997
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,964
I'll turn things around.

998
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:56,593
I'll go with 5 in D7.

999
00:52:57,093 --> 00:52:59,012
D7, 5. That is correct.

1000
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:01,306
- Five, two...
- This one's easy.

1001
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:04,100
The differences shift between +4 and -3.

1002
00:53:07,854 --> 00:53:09,773
I'll go with 2 in E2.

1003
00:53:09,856 --> 00:53:12,192
I'll go with 6 in F5.

1004
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:14,235
I'll go with 4 in B5.

1005
00:53:14,861 --> 00:53:16,780
I'll go with 4 in C1.

1006
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:18,823
I'll go with 10 in D6.

1007
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:21,993
I'll go with 22 in E3.

1008
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,704
I'll go with 40 in F6.

1009
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:25,872
That is correct.

1010
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:29,000
SNU'S JUN-HYEONG WINS 28 POINTS IN A ROW

1011
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:37,092
TEAM SNU: 28, TEAM POSTECH: 7

1012
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:40,095
The game wasn't over yet,
so I tried to pull myself together,

1013
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:42,097
telling myself to believe in myself.

1014
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:43,598
REMAINING CELLS FOR ROUND 1

1015
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:45,183
GREEN, UNMARKED: 1

1016
00:53:45,266 --> 00:53:46,935
VIOLET, UNMARKED: 6

1017
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:48,937
MARKED CELLS: 7, WORTH 4 POINTS EACH

1018
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,357
- What's with the violet sequence, though?
- I don't get it either.

1019
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:55,527
I'll go with 71 in A2.

1020
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:56,653
NAMING THE FIRST VIOLET CELL

1021
00:53:57,028 --> 00:53:58,238
A2, 71.

1022
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:00,115
That is correct.

1023
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:06,162
He knew that one, too.

1024
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,958
I'll go with 48 in B7.

1025
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:14,796
B7, 48. That is incorrect.

1026
00:54:16,464 --> 00:54:17,382
That is incorrect.

1027
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,135
He got it wrong.

1028
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:22,137
- That is incorrect.
- What?

1029
00:54:22,512 --> 00:54:25,015
Maybe he never figured out
the rule for the violet cells.

1030
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:27,392
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

1031
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:30,353
I'll go with 8 in F1.

1032
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:35,108
F1, 8. That is correct.

1033
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:36,651
You won 1 point.

1034
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:37,777
TEAM SNU: 29, TEAM POSTECH: 8

1035
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,867
THE VIOLET CELLS
ARE THE ONLY REMAINING UNMARKED 1-POINTERS

1036
00:54:45,326 --> 00:54:46,828
I'll go with 64 in G7.

1037
00:54:46,911 --> 00:54:50,582
JIN-HYEON NAMED A HIDDEN NUMBER,
TRIGGERING A TURN CHANGE

1038
00:54:57,797 --> 00:54:58,715
That is correct.

1039
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:00,884
You won four points.

1040
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,427
TEAM SNU: 29, TEAM POSTECH: 12

1041
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:08,141
PROGRESSION DIFFERENCES INCREASE BY 6

1042
00:55:08,224 --> 00:55:09,517
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong.

1043
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:11,019
NAMING A HIDDEN NUMBER CHANGES TURNS

1044
00:55:11,102 --> 00:55:13,480
I'll go with 31 in G3.

1045
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:17,400
G3, 31.

1046
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:20,278
That is correct. You won four points.

1047
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:21,821
TEAM SNU: 33, TEAM POSTECH: 12

1048
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:23,198
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

1049
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:25,200
WINNER IS DECIDED
BY THE TOTAL SCORE OF ALL 3 ROUNDS

1050
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:29,454
I'll go

1051
00:55:30,955 --> 00:55:32,165
with 67 in G1.

1052
00:55:32,874 --> 00:55:34,334
G1, 67.

1053
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:36,795
That is correct. You won four points.

1054
00:55:38,254 --> 00:55:42,884
DOUBLE THE PREVIOUS TERM AND SUBTRACT 3

1055
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:45,720
TEAM SNU: 33, TEAM POSTECH: 16

1056
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:53,520
I'll go with 239 in G4.

1057
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:55,605
G4, 239.

1058
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:56,690
That is correct.

1059
00:55:57,107 --> 00:55:58,525
You won 4 points.

1060
00:55:58,608 --> 00:55:59,609
TEAM SNU: 37, TEAM POSTECH: 16

1061
00:55:59,901 --> 00:56:01,319
I'll go with 3 in G5.

1062
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:04,531
That is correct. You won four points.

1063
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:07,826
TEAM SNU: 37, TEAM POSTECH: 20

1064
00:56:07,909 --> 00:56:10,245
I'll go with 16 in G6.

1065
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:13,373
That is correct. You won four points.

1066
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:20,672
ODD NUMBERS: N SQUARED
EVEN NUMBERS: 2 TO THE POWER OF N

1067
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:22,966
I'll go with 83 in D5.

1068
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:25,635
D5, 83.

1069
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:31,808
That is correct. You won one point.

1070
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:33,268
TEAM SNU: 41, TEAM POSTECH: 21

1071
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:35,145
- Darn it.
- You won one point.

1072
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:40,400
I'll go with 47 in B7.

1073
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:44,821
B7, 47.

1074
00:56:46,656 --> 00:56:47,615
That is incorrect.

1075
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:50,326
What is it, then?

1076
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:52,829
So, they didn't memorize the violet cells.

1077
00:56:58,251 --> 00:57:00,128
I'll go with 42 in B7.

1078
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,633
B7, 42. That is correct.

1079
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:07,427
You won one point.

1080
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:10,180
What's the rule for that sequence?

1081
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:14,476
So, what's the violet sequence's rule?

1082
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,437
I'll go with 12 in C3.

1083
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:21,024
C3, 12. That is correct.

1084
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:23,568
TEAM SNU: 43, TEAM POSTECH: 21

1085
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:26,696
- That is correct. You won one point.
- He figured it out.

1086
00:57:27,405 --> 00:57:29,282
I just couldn't get it.

1087
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:34,871
Then, I noticed multiples of seven
sprinkled in the violet sequence.

1088
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:37,040
So, I split the numbers into two.

1089
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:40,794
I saw a train of multiples of 7,
starting from 7, 14, 21, and so on.

1090
00:57:41,294 --> 00:57:43,213
I'll go with 54 in E1.

1091
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:45,298
E1, 54.

1092
00:57:45,382 --> 00:57:47,967
TEAM SNU: 44, TEAM POSTECH: 21
That is correct. You won 1 point.

1093
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:49,761
It's over.

1094
00:57:49,844 --> 00:57:51,805
I'll go with 24 in F4.

1095
00:57:51,888 --> 00:57:53,932
I'll go with 95 in G2.

1096
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:57,268
That is correct.

1097
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,439
TEAM SNU: 49, TEAM POSTECH: 21

1098
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:05,735
I can't believe he worked out the rule.

1099
00:58:06,903 --> 00:58:07,737
You're amazing.

1100
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:12,450
I felt terrible for my teammates.

1101
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:15,036
Round 1 should've been ours,

1102
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,914
but a tiny blunder
shifted the tide in Team SNU's favor.

1103
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:21,167
I'm sorry.

1104
00:58:21,584 --> 00:58:23,169
It's okay.

1105
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:26,756
I'm so sorry.

1106
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:30,927
Damn it.

1107
00:58:33,763 --> 00:58:35,348
Hey, Jin-hyeon.

1108
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:36,683
Jin-hyeon.

1109
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:39,019
Don't worry about it.

1110
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,521
I'm still here.

1111
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:45,900
That concludes Round 1
of Rainbow Sequence.

1112
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:49,529
Team POSTECH won 21 points in total,

1113
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:51,573
and Team SNU won 49 points in total.

1114
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,993
Both contestants.
Please return to your places.

1115
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:00,248
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1116
00:59:00,915 --> 00:59:02,792
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

1117
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:06,546
Take it easy in the next round, Gyu-min.

1118
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:08,298
You killed it, Jun-hyeong.

1119
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:14,304
We were rooting for Team POSTECH,
but one mistake cost them the game.

1120
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:16,931
I thought they might win
because they got to go first.

1121
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:20,852
The contestants for Round 2,
please come forward.

1122
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:29,527
SNU'S KIM GYU-MIN
VS. POSTECH'S LEE JU-YEONG

1123
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:32,238
- There he is.
- The man we've been waiting for.

1124
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:33,990
Gyu-min might complete the whole board.

1125
00:59:34,532 --> 00:59:36,618
I won't like him if he does.

1126
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:38,995
We get to go first in Round 3 again,

1127
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:41,664
so if Ju-yeong manages to keep
the score gap lower than 20,

1128
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:44,459
we can still win the game no matter what.

1129
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:49,214
WINNER IS DECIDED
BY THE TOTAL SCORE OF ALL 3 ROUNDS

1130
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,883
I felt confident about my abilities,

1131
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:54,678
so I was convinced I would win the round.

1132
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:57,347
I kept praying in my head.

1133
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:01,643
"Please make Gyu-min mess up
so I can complete the board instead."

1134
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:05,313
Take your time to reconsider
before answering, Ju-yeong.

1135
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:09,818
We'll now begin Round 2
of Rainbow Sequence.

1136
01:00:10,568 --> 01:00:12,612
Here's your board.

1137
01:00:20,161 --> 01:00:21,579
What the heck?

1138
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:24,082
It's way more difficult now.

1139
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:26,126
Goodness. It just got much harder.

1140
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:46,980
The time for memorization is over.

1141
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:49,482
I have no idea about this one.

1142
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:50,942
- Did you get anything?
- No.

1143
01:00:51,693 --> 01:00:55,530
If you can't figure out the rule,
you have to memorize the whole thing.

1144
01:00:55,905 --> 01:00:57,574
I couldn't figure out any of the rules.

1145
01:00:57,657 --> 01:00:59,826
Then, the score gap won't be so big.

1146
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:02,537
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min will go first.

1147
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,080
TEAM SNU GOES FIRST IN ROUND 2

1148
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:07,792
I'll go with 17 in A1.

1149
01:01:09,669 --> 01:01:12,881
A1, 17. That is correct. You won 1 point.

1150
01:01:12,964 --> 01:01:15,467
I'll go with 24 in B2.

1151
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:16,384
That is correct.

1152
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:17,302
TEAM SNU: 2, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1153
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:20,305
I'll go with 32 in C4.

1154
01:01:20,388 --> 01:01:21,765
C4, 32.

1155
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:23,308
That is correct.

1156
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:24,601
TEAM SNU: 3, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1157
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:29,105
I'll go with 38 in D2.

1158
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:31,316
I'll go with 62 in E7.

1159
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:33,860
I'll go with 74 in F5.

1160
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:35,362
That is correct.

1161
01:01:35,445 --> 01:01:37,614
TEAM SNU: 6, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1162
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:40,992
GYU-MIN FILLED UP EVERY RED CELL

1163
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:42,952
Do you think he knows the rule?

1164
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:46,039
He's probably going to use
all the patterns he figured out.

1165
01:01:47,582 --> 01:01:51,628
To tell you the truth,
I didn't manage to work out the rules

1166
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:54,506
for the red sequence
and the sky blue sequence.

1167
01:01:55,256 --> 01:01:58,593
So, I had their numbers memorized

1168
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:02,681
and called them first
before I forgot them.

1169
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:05,475
I'll go with 8 in A5.

1170
01:02:05,558 --> 01:02:07,560
I'll go with 4 in B3.

1171
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:09,854
I'll go with 4 in C7.

1172
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:11,606
I'll go with 6 in D4.

1173
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,150
I'll go with 12 in E6.

1174
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:16,403
I'll go with 30 in F3.

1175
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,154
That is correct.

1176
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:21,574
TEAM SNU: 12, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1177
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:25,286
GYU-MIN MEMORIZED ALL THE CELLS
HE DIDN'T KNOW THE RULES FOR

1178
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:29,708
I'll go with 51 in B1.

1179
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,752
B1, 51. That is correct.

1180
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:33,795
TEAM SNU: 13, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1181
01:02:33,878 --> 01:02:37,340
Seeing how he named B1 first,
he might not recall what goes in A7.

1182
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:40,677
GYU-MIN SKIPPED THE FIRST TERM
OF THE VIOLET SEQUENCE

1183
01:02:42,262 --> 01:02:44,597
I thought, "What's going on?
Did he forget it?"

1184
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:47,600
I got my hopes up
and thought I could still win.

1185
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:49,978
I'll go with 4 in C1.

1186
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:51,730
I'll go with 10 in D1.

1187
01:02:56,943 --> 01:02:57,902
That is correct.

1188
01:02:58,361 --> 01:03:01,239
TEAM SNU: 15, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1189
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:04,826
How did he memorize it like that?

1190
01:03:04,909 --> 01:03:06,619
I never imagined
memorizing numbers that way.

1191
01:03:06,703 --> 01:03:09,497
That's such a Gyu-min way of doing things.

1192
01:03:10,248 --> 01:03:12,125
I'll go with 72 in F1.

1193
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:14,794
That's such a random cell to name.

1194
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:17,255
This would mean that he forgot
what goes in E1, right?

1195
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:18,923
Yeah, that must be it.

1196
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:21,468
F1, 72. That is correct.

1197
01:03:21,926 --> 01:03:23,470
TEAM SNU: 16, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1198
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:26,056
That's just insane.

1199
01:03:26,514 --> 01:03:28,350
So, he hasn't memorized any of the rules.

1200
01:03:28,433 --> 01:03:30,435
- He memorized it in rows.
- It's crazy.

1201
01:03:30,518 --> 01:03:31,728
What's up with him?

1202
01:03:32,395 --> 01:03:34,314
It was all intentional.

1203
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:36,608
I filled up the cells
starting from the first row.

1204
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:39,736
Even if I made a mistake along the way,
the opponent would see

1205
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:44,449
a random set of revealed numbers
that are scattered out of sequence.

1206
01:03:44,532 --> 01:03:47,702
I was hoping to confuse my opponent.

1207
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:49,954
I'll go with 11 in A2.

1208
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:52,749
I'll go with 42 in E2.

1209
01:03:52,832 --> 01:03:54,918
I'll go with 75 in F2.

1210
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:56,294
That is correct.

1211
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:57,712
TEAM SNU: 19, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1212
01:03:57,796 --> 01:03:59,756
I'll go with 7 in A3.

1213
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,758
I'll go with 12 in C2.

1214
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:04,094
I'll go with 81 in C3.

1215
01:04:04,177 --> 01:04:05,887
I'll go with 2 in E3.

1216
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:07,764
That is correct.

1217
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:12,143
TEAM SNU: 23, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1218
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:13,770
He just memorized the whole thing.

1219
01:04:13,853 --> 01:04:15,313
He must be insane.

1220
01:04:15,397 --> 01:04:17,524
How is that even possible?

1221
01:04:17,607 --> 01:04:19,818
He couldn't have memorized
more than three rows.

1222
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:20,819
I know, right?

1223
01:04:20,902 --> 01:04:23,071
Even for a monster like him.

1224
01:04:26,324 --> 01:04:28,743
I remember wondering
if he would get the entire board.

1225
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:30,412
I had a bad feeling about it.

1226
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:32,956
I'll go with 2 in A4.

1227
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:34,708
I'll go with 3 in B4.

1228
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:37,168
I'll go with 36 in E4.

1229
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:38,253
That is correct.

1230
01:04:38,336 --> 01:04:39,587
TEAM SNU: 26, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1231
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:42,966
- He really memorized it.
- Why would he do it like that?

1232
01:04:43,049 --> 01:04:44,968
I'll go with 6 in B5.

1233
01:04:45,051 --> 01:04:47,137
I'll go with 17 in C5.

1234
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,847
I'll go with 9 in D5.

1235
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,598
I'll go with 25 in E5.

1236
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:52,017
TEAM SNU: 30, TEAM POSTECH: 0
That is correct.

1237
01:04:53,601 --> 01:04:54,978
He's a monster, all right.

1238
01:04:56,229 --> 01:04:57,147
That's just unreal.

1239
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:59,607
I've never seen anyone
memorize numbers that way.

1240
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:02,569
Seriously, though. How much of it
did he actually memorize?

1241
01:05:02,652 --> 01:05:04,362
I'll go with 6 in A6.

1242
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:05,321
That is correct.

1243
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:06,698
I'll go with 3 in B6.

1244
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:07,866
That is correct.

1245
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,618
TEAM SNU: 32, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1246
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:14,748
I'll go with 5 in C6.

I'll go with 12 in D6.

1248
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,834
I'll go with 7 in F6.

1249
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:18,835
That is correct.

01:05:18,918 --> 01:05:21,463
TEAM SNU: 35, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1251
01:05:21,546 --> 01:05:22,756
Will he really get them all?

1252
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:24,841
I'll go with 21 in A7.

1253
01:05:24,924 --> 01:05:26,968
I'll go with 13 in B7.

1254
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:28,845
I'll go with 5 in D7.

1255
01:05:28,928 --> 01:05:30,013
I'll go...

1256
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:36,478
with 31 in F7.

1257
01:05:36,561 --> 01:05:37,479
That is correct.

1258
01:05:37,562 --> 01:05:39,022
TEAM SNU: 39, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1259
01:05:39,105 --> 01:05:40,023
He's killing it.

1260
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,776
Whatever. Just finish it.

1261
01:05:43,651 --> 01:05:45,612
ONLY 3 UNMARKED CELLS REMAIN

1262
01:05:45,695 --> 01:05:48,406
Did he take a picture or something?

1263
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,658
How can all of that
fit in your head in one go?

1264
01:05:57,248 --> 01:05:59,250
I'll go with 25 in D3.

1265
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:01,461
That is correct.

1266
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,589
TEAM SNU: 40, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1267
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:09,010
I'll go with 32 in E1.

1268
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:13,014
That is correct.

1269
01:06:13,098 --> 01:06:14,766
TEAM SNU: 41, TEAM POSTECH: 0

1270
01:06:17,227 --> 01:06:19,312
How is this even possible?

1271
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:22,524
To be honest, this seems surreal to me.

1272
01:06:22,607 --> 01:06:25,068
ONLY 1 UNMARKED CELL REMAINS

1273
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,533
I'll go with 37 in F4.

1274
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:33,451
F4, 37.

1275
01:06:39,624 --> 01:06:40,750
That is correct.

1276
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:42,877
SCORED 42 POINTS IN A ROW
He's incredible.

1277
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:44,295
I'm at a loss for words.

1278
01:06:48,466 --> 01:06:51,052
That was insane.
Ju-yeong didn't get to say anything.

1279
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,596
Seriously.

1280
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,056
That's unbelievable.

1281
01:06:55,598 --> 01:06:56,933
What a legend.

1282
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,059
He sure is good.

1283
01:06:58,143 --> 01:06:59,519
He's kind of intimidating.

1284
01:06:59,602 --> 01:07:01,604
He really doesn't seem human to me.

1285
01:07:02,022 --> 01:07:05,316
ONLY 7 MARKED CELLS REMAIN

1286
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:10,530
Rainbow Sequence's winner is decided
by the total score after all three rounds.

1287
01:07:10,613 --> 01:07:14,284
If the sum of the remaining points
of Round 2 and Round 3 is not enough

1288
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:16,411
for the losing team
to turn the game around,

1289
01:07:16,494 --> 01:07:20,123
the mercy rule will apply,
and the game will end before Round 3.

1290
01:07:20,665 --> 01:07:24,753
The current score gap
between the 2 teams is 70.

1291
01:07:24,836 --> 01:07:26,671
ACCUMULATED SCORE
TEAM SNU: 91, TEAM POSTECH: 21

1292
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:32,969
He'll probably just solve it.

1293
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:37,265
I'll go with 47 in G3.

1294
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:42,312
That is correct. You won four points.

1295
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:46,483
For this sequence,
the terms must be split into two.

1296
01:07:46,566 --> 01:07:48,276
The two numbers must be added

1297
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,948
and the original number must also be added
to find out the next term in the sequence.

1298
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:59,287
To find the hidden number,
3 and 7 must be added to make 10,

1299
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:02,248
and 37 must also be added,
resulting in a sum of 47.

1300
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:04,042
Team POSTECH's Lee Ju-yeong.

1301
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:05,418
NAMING A HIDDEN NUMBER CHANGES TURNS

1302
01:08:08,546 --> 01:08:11,299
That would leave
anyone demoralized, wouldn't it?

1303
01:08:11,383 --> 01:08:14,552
Gyu-min only left him six empty cells.

1304
01:08:15,178 --> 01:08:18,473
Still, I was determined to do my best.

1305
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:20,725
I'll go with 3 in G6.

1306
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:25,230
G6, 3. That is correct.

1307
01:08:25,313 --> 01:08:26,606
You won four points.

1308
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:27,816
TEAM SNU: 95, TEAM POSTECH: 25

1309
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:30,318
The terms of this sequence
are multiples of three,

1310
01:08:30,402 --> 01:08:32,237
written in reverse order.

1311
01:08:33,613 --> 01:08:34,906
According to the rule,

1312
01:08:34,989 --> 01:08:38,910
we have to write 30 in the reverse order,
making the hidden number 3.

1313
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,251
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min.

1314
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:49,796
I'll go with 186 in G2.

1315
01:08:50,755 --> 01:08:53,591
TEAM SNU: 99, TEAM POSTECH: 25
That is correct. You won 4 points.

1316
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:56,011
What is the rule for that sequence?

1317
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:57,595
BEATS ME

1318
01:08:57,929 --> 01:09:02,142
For this sequence, subtraction
and multiplication is applied alternately.

1319
01:09:02,767 --> 01:09:07,939
The numbers subtracted or multiplied
are increasing natural numbers from one.

1320
01:09:08,732 --> 01:09:10,108
According to this rule,

1321
01:09:10,191 --> 01:09:14,237
we have to multiply 31 by 6
to get the hidden number,

1322
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,031
which makes it 186.

1323
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:19,993
Team POSTECH's Lee Ju-yeong.

1324
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:27,667
I'll go with 80 in G7.

1325
01:09:31,087 --> 01:09:32,464
Is that right, though?

1326
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:33,965
G7, 80.

1327
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:35,050
That is incorrect.

1328
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,430
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min.

1329
01:09:40,513 --> 01:09:42,390
I'll go with 0 in G5.

1330
01:09:43,016 --> 01:09:43,850
That is correct.

1331
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:46,144
TEAM SNU: 103, TEAM POSTECH: 25
You won 4 points.

1332
01:09:46,227 --> 01:09:50,148
The odd-numbered terms of this sequence
are subtracted by two,

1333
01:09:50,231 --> 01:09:53,777
whereas the even-numbered ones
are added by two.

1334
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:55,779
According to this rule,

1335
01:09:55,862 --> 01:09:57,989
since the hidden number
is an odd-numbered term,

1336
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:00,867
we have to subtract 2
from the fifth term, making it 0.

1337
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:06,706
I'll go with 125 in G4.

1338
01:10:07,832 --> 01:10:09,167
G4, 125.

1339
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,460
That is incorrect.

1340
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:12,504
What is it, then?

1341
01:10:14,506 --> 01:10:16,841
I'll go with 90 in G1.

1342
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:21,471
THE MERCY RULE COULD BE APPLIED
TO END THE GAME EARLY

1343
01:10:21,554 --> 01:10:22,889
G1, 90.

1344
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,934
That is correct. You won four points.

1345
01:10:26,017 --> 01:10:28,395
ACCUMULATED SCORE
TEAM SNU: 107, TEAM POSTECH: 25

1346
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:31,856
In this sequence,
each term is multiplied by a fraction

1347
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:36,069
where the denominator stays at 2,
and the numerator increases by 1.

1348
01:10:36,695 --> 01:10:37,862
Isn't it over now?

1349
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:39,114
The game's over.

1350
01:10:39,197 --> 01:10:41,616
POSTECH will still lose
even if they get everything right.

1351
01:10:46,371 --> 01:10:52,002
Even if Team POSTECH won points
for all remaining cells of Rounds 2 and 3,

1352
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:54,087
they cannot win the game.

1353
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:57,215
As such, we will conclude the game now.

1354
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:01,720
I can't believe it.

1355
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:04,556
Both contestants,
please return to your places.

1356
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:08,852
Good job.

1357
01:11:08,935 --> 01:11:10,478
- I'm sorry.
- Don't say that.

1358
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:13,106
Make sure to win, okay?
We're all good as long as you win.

1359
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:23,241
- Great work.
- That was amazing.

1360
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:25,910
It's just...

1361
01:11:25,994 --> 01:11:27,537
- I feel so bad.
- What? Why?

1362
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:30,373
I can't really explain it.

1363
01:11:30,665 --> 01:11:33,001
Ju-yeong didn't lose
because he wasn't good enough.

1364
01:11:33,084 --> 01:11:34,878
He just never got a chance to compete.

1365
01:11:34,961 --> 01:11:38,673
I felt so bad
because it was such a futile end.

1366
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:41,092
Good job.

1367
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:42,927
It's all good.

1368
01:11:43,803 --> 01:11:45,638
- Good job, everyone.
- It wasn't easy.

1369
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:47,015
We did well, too.

1370
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:48,391
Team POSTECH...

1371
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:51,019
At least we enjoyed ourselves, right?

1372
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:56,483
That concludes the Deathmatch,
Rainbow Sequence.

1373
01:11:57,025 --> 01:12:00,362
The total score of Rounds 1 and 2
will now be announced.

1374
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:02,447
Team SNU won 107 points.

1375
01:12:03,531 --> 01:12:06,201
Team POSTECH won 25 points.

1376
01:12:06,284 --> 01:12:08,328
Team SNU wins the Deathmatch.

1377
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:09,913
TEAM SNU WINS RAINBOW SEQUENCE

1378
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:12,457
Team SNU was incredibly good.

1379
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:15,710
- They were ridiculous.
- Tell me about it.

1380
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:17,921
Losing by so much
could be easier to accept.

1381
01:12:18,004 --> 01:12:19,589
Right. I thought so, too.

1382
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:23,468
The fourth team to be eliminated
from Elite League, Season 2,

1383
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,929
is Team POSTECH.

1384
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:29,516
If the team that beat us
goes on to be the champions,

1385
01:12:29,599 --> 01:12:31,017
it would be less disappointing.

1386
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:34,479
So I'll be rooting for Team SNU to win.

1387
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:38,817
Team POSTECH, please exit the grounds.

1388
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:53,498
We weren't satisfied with the result,
but we did the best we could.

1389
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:57,252
I think we might be remembered
as the most cheerful team on the show.

1390
01:12:57,335 --> 01:12:59,129
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon wins.

1391
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:06,761
I was mentally quite fragile
during the games.

1392
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:10,098
But thanks to my optimistic teammates,

1393
01:13:10,181 --> 01:13:12,183
I was able to have fun
throughout our journey.

1394
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:13,852
I want to thank my teammates

1395
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:17,772
for respecting my opinions,
even though I was the youngest member.

1396
01:13:19,607 --> 01:13:23,528
I think devising strategies
and facing opponents head-on

1397
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:25,613
helped me mature as a person.

1398
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:31,703
I think I'll be able to bravely face
anything that the world throws at me now.

1399
01:13:33,997 --> 01:13:34,831
POSTECH!

1400
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:38,251
Make your pick. Up or down?

1401
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:39,919
- Up!
- All right!

1402
01:14:03,985 --> 01:14:07,155
Team SNU, as the winner of the Deathmatch,

1403
01:14:07,238 --> 01:14:11,242
please return to the Main Hall
for the next match.

1404
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:13,953
So, that's what happens
when Team SNU gets riled up.

1405
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:16,289
All I could think
was that we were in trouble.

1406
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:31,221
- They're so intimidating.
- How are they so relaxed?

1407
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:46,611
Oh, look. We're back.

1408
01:15:30,196 --> 01:15:32,198
