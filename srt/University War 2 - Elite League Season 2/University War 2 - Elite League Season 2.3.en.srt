1
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,194
I'll now announce
the results of the extra round

2
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,196
of Signal Investigation 2.

3
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,240
Team KU.

4
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,369
Please.

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,997
Please.

6
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,168
You...

7
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:45,879
failed.

8
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,714
TEAM KU FAILS TO APPREHEND THE CULPRIT

9
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,673
We failed.

10
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,841
We must've been wrong.

11
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,259
We got it all wrong.

12
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,846
...failed.

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,227
I never saw this coming!

14
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,189
- Seriously?
- No way!

15
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,817
- Is it over if Team MIT got it?
- Please.

16
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,611
Team MIT.

17
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,036
- Come on.
- You...

18
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:19,829
suceeded.

19
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,874
TEAM MIT SUCCEEDS
IN APPREHENDING THE CULPRIT

20
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,632
I guess we rushed things.

21
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,718
- Too bad we couldn't get to show them.
- Damn it.

22
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,846
We must've gotten something very wrong.

23
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,139
It wasn't the left hand.

24
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,810
I think it's him.
He's the only one with glasses.

25
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,478
KU'S CULPRITS
But he's using the wrong hand.

26
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,647
CULPRIT: SUSPECT 4

27
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,941
The counts don't match.
"Afite" might not mean right hand.

28
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,402
- I think it means left hand.
- In that case,

29
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,570
- it's this guy.
- A book in the left hand? It's him.

30
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,613
Shall we submit it now?

31
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,907
TEAM KU FAILS BY CHOOSING SUSPECT 6

32
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,827
10 MINUTES AGO
MIT

33
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,830
MIT'S FINAL 2 SUSPECTS

34
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,000
So, "ntago" means "not,"
and we're still sure it's a man, right?

35
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,585
CULPRIT: SUSPECT 4
So, the person's not wearing glasses.

36
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,045
EXCLUDES SUSPECT WITH GLASSES
Then it must be him.

37
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,922
- That person...
- Is it him?

38
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,215
- That's the guy.
- It has to be.

39
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,550
MIT APPREHENDS THE CULPRIT

40
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,553
Good job.

41
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:18,888
I can't believe it.

42
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,102
- Are you crying?
- We need to get it together.

43
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,520
We have one more game to play.

44
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:34,362
That concludes the first Deathmatch,
Signal Investigation 2.

45
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,990
The team to be eliminated

46
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,409
is Team KU.

47
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,744
FIRST TEAM TO BE ELIMINATED: TEAM KU

48
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,664
I've never even considered
the possibility of being sent home first.

49
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,332
Damn it.

50
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,378
I didn't expect to fail so soon.

51
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,464
I wasn't expecting this.

52
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,507
They placed second last year.

53
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,178
It feels like my moments of indecision

54
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,848
was what affected the team's progress.

55
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,308
Are you sure it's not a woman?

56
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,101
Well, I never said I was.

57
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
I don't know.

58
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,729
Structures matter less...

59
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,939
Everyone had different opinions.

60
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,985
We needed a leader with a clear vision.

61
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,198
In hindsight,
I should've played that role.

62
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,450
I wish I realized that sooner.

63
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,620
Team KU,

64
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,663
please exit the grounds.

65
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,842
I really wanted to do well.

66
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,512
It's such a shame that we were eliminated.

67
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:46,434
I still believe in my team's competence
despite our early elimination.

68
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:51,147
If another opportunity presents itself,
I'll do my best to prove myself.

69
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,775
- Korea University!
- For the nation!

70
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,446
- Let's go!
- We've got this!

71
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,633
The win certainly put us on a roll.

72
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,135
I wanted to make use of this.

73
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,179
We were determined to beat Team KAIST.

74
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,932
This is going to be fun.

75
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,768
We were the first
to go through the first Deathmatch,

76
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,396
so I was convinced
we could win another one.

77
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,691
The second Deathmatch
will now be revealed.

78
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,904
The next Deathmatch is...

79
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,743
Rock-Paper-Scissors Chess.

80
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,829
Chess?

81
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,582
TEAM OXFORD'S BASE CAMP
I told you.

82
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,917
I'm so jealous!

83
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,294
I wish we were playing the Deathmatch.

84
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,879
Don't you dare say that.

85
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,838
Even if we had...

86
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,757
How is the game supposed to work?

87
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,884
Maybe they move a piece
if they win at rock, paper, scissors.

88
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,053
Rock-Paper-Scissors Chess

89
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:07,140
will be played on an 8-by-8 board.

90
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,768
The player who removes
all of the opponent's pieces

91
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,728
will be declared the winner.

92
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,106
- I could never play that.
- Same here.

93
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,569
Each team will be given the same four dice

94
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,655
with two sets
of rock, paper, and scissors shapes.

95
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,285
The initial layout of the dice
will be the same for both teams.

96
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:31,998
They will be placed in the order
of scissors, rock, paper, and scissors.

97
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,001
The shape shown on the top
decides the number of moves.

98
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,629
Three moves for scissors, four for rock,

99
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,298
and five for paper.

100
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,342
That's crazy.

101
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,593
This is ridiculous.

102
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,179
This is a crazy game.

103
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,639
Once the game starts,

104
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,767
the player to make the first move
will be given one minute

105
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,229
to select and move 1 of their 4 dice.

106
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,358
If they fail to complete the move
within the time limit,

107
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,111
the chosen piece must return
to its original position,

108
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,530
and one of their remaining dice
must be removed.

109
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,326
While the dice can be moved
to all four directions,

110
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,079
it cannot return to its previous position.

111
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:16,793
Additionally, while your die can pass
an opening between your opponent's dice,

112
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,422
it cannot be placed at rest between them.

113
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,673
DIE CAN'T STOP BETWEEN OPPONENT'S DICE

114
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,051
If your die comes into contact
with an opponent's after the move,

115
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,470
a game of rock, paper, scissors
will take place.

116
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,807
The die with the winning shape survives,

117
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,936
while the die with the losing shape
will be immediately taken away.

118
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:40,400
The player who removes
all their opponent's dice

119
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,944
by games of rock, paper, scissors
wins the round.

120
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:48,450
However, the following rules will apply
when both have a single die left.

121
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,327
You must either win
a game of rock, paper, scissors

122
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:57,083
or survive two turns or more at the row
closest to your opponent's camp.

123
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,418
BLUE PLAYER WINS

124
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,338
Each round will be played
on a one-on-one basis.

125
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,506
Out of the three rounds,

126
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,968
the team to secure two wins is the winner.

127
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,680
Different contestants must play
in the first two rounds.

128
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,642
But those who participated in either
can play again in the third round.

129
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,608
Team KAIST will choose
who will play first in the first round,

130
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:26,071
as the winner of the first Deathmatch.

131
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:31,743
The losing team will decide
which team plays first in the next round.

132
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,246
Both teams,
please start discussing your strategies.

133
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,918
Whoever manages to come back from this
will be unstoppable.

134
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,552
So, from here?

135
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,014
ROCK, 4 MOVES

136
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,350
We call it a "pair" in English.

137
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,103
If the rock-die is placed
on a black tile initially,

138
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,980
it will end up on another black one
whichever way it moves.

139
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,190
POSSIBLE NUMBER OF MOVES

140
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,400
As for scissors or paper,

141
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,902
they'll end up on a tile
in a different color.

142
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:11,074
The scissors-die can never attack this
since it can only land on a black tile.

143
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,869
SCISSORS-DIE ON A WHITE TILE
CAN ONLY END UP ON A BLACK TILE

144
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,957
THEREFORE IT CANNOT MAKE CONTACT
TO ATTACK ANOTHER DIE

145
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,085
I don't think we should be too defensive.

146
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,637
At the same time,
we shouldn't just barge into their camp.

147
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,524
I also think it would be better
to have more paper-dice.

148
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,822
Having more paper-dice
improves your position.

149
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,283
Since paper can move five tiles,

150
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,369
it has a larger area of attack
compared to the others.

151
00:08:56,453 --> 00:09:00,457
We considered it a major priority
to have as many paper-dice as possible.

152
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,292
This is a definite win.

153
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,210
- Rock guarantees a win.
- We should use that.

154
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:08,006
Changing all the shapes to rock would help
if we're stuck for options.

155
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,258
- Because it's a finisher?
- Exactly.

156
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,635
10 MINUTES AGO

157
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,803
With a rock-die,

158
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,140
you can land on any tile
that is two tiles away diagonally.

159
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,601
See these tiles
that are diagonal to the die?

160
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,853
We can land on it with any shape we want.

161
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,147
Depending on the route you take,

162
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,774
you can get scissors,

163
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,234
rock...

164
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:35,533
or paper on the 4 tiles
that are diagonally 2 tiles away.

165
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,618
POSSIBLE TO TAKE ON ANY SHAPE

166
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,162
If the opponent's die is here,

167
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,915
we can remove it
by going to this tile in a diagonal line.

168
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,210
That's why it's vital
to place a rock-die here.

169
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,878
USE THE DIAGONAL ROUTES TO ATTACK

170
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,382
I think it'd be an excellent strategy
to have all our dice show rock.

171
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,343
Who wants to go first?

172
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,427
How about you, Gi-hyeon?

173
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,888
Wouldn't it be best for you to go first?

174
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,557
All right, then.

175
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,767
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

176
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,102
Write down your name.

177
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,522
I checked all the routes
rocks and papers could take,

178
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,108
so I felt good about my chances.

179
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,443
- What are you going to do first?
- Well, yes.

180
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,821
- I'll turn the scissors into rocks first.
- Okay, good.

181
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,116
TEAM MIT HASN'T DECIDED
ON THEIR ROSTER YET

182
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,660
How about we have a tournament
and let the winners play?

183
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,706
One, two,

184
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,749
three, four.

185
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,298
One, two, three.

186
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,384
He's good.

187
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,468
You really are.

188
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,971
- You should go first.
- Play in the first round.

189
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,807
- You should put on the pressure.
- I'll go first, then.

190
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,850
Min-seok it is.

191
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,894
TEAM MIT'S PAPER VS. TEAM KAIST'S ROCK

192
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,188
The time for the strategy meeting is up.

193
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,982
STRATEGY MEETING OVER

194
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,280
Hold on. I'm drawing a blank.

195
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,283
Let's do this.

196
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:04,497
We'll now begin the second Deathmatch,
Rock-Paper-Scissors Chess.

197
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,084
The first round will be a match

198
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,254
between Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon
and Team MIT's Park Min-seok.

199
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,089
- Good luck.
- You've got this.

200
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:20,055
I thought I'll just do my best,

201
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:24,059
but my nerves got to me
when I sat down at the table.

202
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,188
I'd say that we're evenly matched.

203
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:37,822
I swear, this Deathmatch game
will go down in history.

204
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,867
They must be so nervous.
I can't imagine the pressure.

205
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,453
It must be nerve-wracking
to play a one-on-one game.

206
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,165
Your honor depends on every move,
as well as the fate of your team.

207
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,129
Team KAIST will now decide
which team will make the first move.

208
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,049
I'll play first.

209
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,177
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon
will make the first move.

210
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,390
Please move your die.

211
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,863
TEAM KAIST PLACES A ROCK-DIE FIRST

212
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,659
Team MIT's Park Min-seok,
please move your die.

213
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,000
One of my strategies

214
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,253
was to quickly turn
the two scissors into papers.

215
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,630
That's pretty aggressive.

216
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,466
That was a good move.

217
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,095
TEAM MIT CAN LAUNCH AN ATTACK
IN THE NEXT TURN

218
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,141
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please move your die.

219
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,654
I noticed him shaking quite a lot.

220
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:03,491
So I thought
I might have the upper hand here.

221
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,550
MOVES A ROCK-DIE
TO HAVE IT SHOW ROCK AGAIN

222
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,135
He's being very defensive.

223
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,471
Doesn't that defeat
the point of going first?

224
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:28,808
Team MIT's Park Min-seok,
please move your die.

225
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,025
MOVES A SCISSORS-DIE TO HAVE IT SHOW PAPER

226
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,738
BOTH TEAMS FOLLOW THEIR INITIAL STRATEGY
OF UTILIZING PAPER AND ROCK

227
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,116
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please move your die.

228
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,309
What? He could've taken that
by turning it into scissors.

229
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,311
He could've taken that die.

230
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,359
I could see that Gi-hyeon made a mistake.

231
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:32,330
Team MIT's Park Min-seok takes a die
from Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

232
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,248
TEAM MIT: 1, TEAM KAIST: 0

233
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,085
- He did well.
- That was good.

234
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,628
He's doing well.

235
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,548
I told you that would be taken.

236
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,759
- That must've shaken him.
- I would be if I were him.

237
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:48,304
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please move your die.

238
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:01,026
Team MIT's Park Min-seok,
please move your die.

239
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,620
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please move your die.

240
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,206
He needs to retreat.

241
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,126
You have to pull back.

242
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,502
TEAM KAIST IS OPEN TO AN ATTACK

243
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,213
You have 30 seconds to finish your move.

244
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,898
Team MIT's Park Min-seok,
please move your die.

245
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:53,036
Team MIT's Park Min-seok takes a die
from Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

246
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,455
He's really good.

247
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,416
- It's over.
- I think so, too.

248
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,337
I thought I'd have the upper hand
by going first,

249
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,924
but Min-seok made
an unexpectedly bold first move,

250
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:10,929
which fazed me,
and I ended up getting my dice taken.

251
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:16,267
Even so, I believed I could turn it around
with the two remaining dice.

252
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:19,354
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please move your die.

253
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:40,750
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon takes a die
from Team MIT's Park Min-seok.

254
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,338
Team MIT's Park Min-seok,
please move your die.

255
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,021
You have ten seconds.

256
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,158
That was a wrong move.

257
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,119
He shouldn't have done that.

258
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,245
That was a mistake.

259
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,331
KAIST'S PAPER CAN TAKE OUT MIT'S ROCK
Gi-hyeon can take one now.

260
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:36,806
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon takes a die
from Team MIT's Park Min-seok.

261
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,185
What? This isn't playing out
like we expected it to.

262
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,979
They're neck and neck.

263
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,776
When I first started, I thought rock
was the best shape to be used,

264
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:53,156
but losing my dice helped me realize
that paper was the best.

265
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,202
Paper seems to be quite useful.

266
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,871
We didn't know that,
and Gi-hyeon was taken by surprise.

267
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,581
We need to see how it works.

268
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,625
- Paper-dice can do so much damage.
- Right.

269
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,586
Turning the dice into papers
might be the right call.

270
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,425
I told myself,
"Be calm and turn it around."

271
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,220
I thought I could win
if I didn't make any more mistakes.

272
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:19,099
Team MIT's Park Min-seok,
please move your die.

273
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,570
I couldn't see
any offensive moves I could make.

274
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,950
We have the upper hand.

275
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,411
Whatever Min-seok decides to do,
he can't take our dice.

276
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,917
You have ten seconds.

277
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,804
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please move your die.

278
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:25,790
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon takes a die
from Team MIT's Park Min-seok.

279
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,835
- He should've secured more paper-dice.
- What?

280
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,754
Having more paper-dice would have helped.

281
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,633
Team MIT's Park Min-seok,
please move your die.

282
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,473
Isn't his die on a white tile?

283
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,892
Our dice need to be on a white
for them to take it.

284
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,061
- He can't take anything.
- You're right.

285
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,323
Oh, no!

286
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,283
That should've been placed as a rock.

287
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,078
Gi-hyeon can take that in five moves.

288
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:08,124
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please move your die.

289
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,220
TEAM KAIST WINS THE 1ST ROUND
Two teams' dice made contact.

290
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,055
In the ensuing game
of rock, paper, scissors,

291
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,973
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon takes a die

292
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,560
- from Team MIT's Park Min-seok.
- You did the team a huge favor.

293
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,187
- Great job.
- Thank you.

294
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:35,110
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon takes a die
from Team MIT's Park Min-seok.

295
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,199
I was so disappointed,
and I felt bad for letting my team down.

296
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,742
I felt terrible.

297
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:44,661
I didn't see that coming.

298
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,372
I'm so impressed by Gi-hyeon.

299
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,791
I'm impressed by how well he improvised.

300
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,295
We'll now begin the second round
of Rock-Paper-Scissors Chess.

301
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,633
The second round will be played
by Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong

302
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,302
and Team MIT's Jeon Hyeon-u.

303
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:02,887
Please step forward.

304
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,559
Paper is better than rock.
Use it as much as you can.

305
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,229
Please step forward.

306
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,693
Team MIT's going home if he loses.

307
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,111
Good luck, Team MIT!

308
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,320
You got this, Team MIT!

309
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,574
Let's see how well
Ji-seong manages the chessboard.

310
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,243
Team MIT,
the losing team of the first round,

311
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,912
will decide
which team will make the first move.

312
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,247
I'll play first.

313
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,082
Team MIT will go first.

314
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,502
Team MIT's Jeon Hyeon-u
will make the first move.

315
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:40,925
Having lost the first round,
we couldn't afford to lose another one.

316
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,347
Please move your die.

317
00:21:57,275 --> 00:22:01,196
It's the same as before.
They must've decided to use paper-dice.

318
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:12,165
MOVES A ROCK-DIE TO HAVE IT SHOW PAPER

319
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,084
THE TWO TEAMS
Team MIT's Jeon Hyeon-u,

320
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,127
HAVE THE SAME STRATEGY
please move your die.

321
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:35,271
I hope Ji-seong will try
to take the scissors-die.

322
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,190
The one away from the others.

323
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,708
Two teams' dice made contact.

324
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,209
Why didn't he avoid that?

325
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,837
Team MIT must be flustered.

326
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,132
Please move your die.

327
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,356
TEAM MIT: 1, TEAM KAIST: 1

328
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,483
Oh, I see.

329
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:29,409
I was actually relieved by that.

330
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,662
The strategy obviously mattered,

331
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:36,249
but not as much as my ability
to picture my die's path.

332
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,085
So, I planned out routes
for how my dice would move.

333
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,963
As soon I moved the first die,

334
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,716
it became easier for me
to remember those routes.

335
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,261
I devised about 20 possible routes
within 60 seconds

336
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:52,891
and realized it was easier
to manage the board with fewer dice.

337
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,728
That's why I actually welcomed
losing one die.

338
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,484
We each had three dice left,

339
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:05,612
and I felt pretty good
about the layout of the board.

340
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,782
We have three paper-dice.

341
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,452
We need to change those scissors around
as soon as we can.

342
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,537
TEAM MIT HAS 3 PAPER-DICE

343
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,040
TEAM KAIST HAS 1 PAPER-DIE

344
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:32,764
MOVES A SCISSORS-DIE TO HAVE IT SHOW PAPER

345
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,779
Please move your die.

346
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:56,079
Team MIT's Jeon Hyeon-u,
please move your die.

347
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:08,341
My goal was to place my dice
where the opponent's dice couldn't reach.

348
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:10,510
I wanted to play defensively.

349
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,429
He's being way too defensive.

350
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:14,347
Being defensive is much easier.

351
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:17,183
Please move your die.

352
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,826
This will never end at this rate.

353
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,454
Are they waiting for the other to mess up?

354
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,751
You have 30 seconds.

355
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,097
- The first one to mess up will lose.
- I know.

356
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:59,768
The way I see it,
they should keep on playing defensively.

357
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:02,771
Given how things are going,
it won't hurt to attack first, right?

358
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,522
- I think he should.
- I thought so, too.

359
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,649
He has to come out swinging.

360
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,401
Holding out won't work.

361
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:12,405
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong,
please move your die.

362
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,291
Both scissors are vulnerable.

363
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:24,918
Right. He could get either of them.

364
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,920
One of them will be taken.

365
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,883
TEAM KAIST'S ROCK-DIE COULD TAKE
EITHER OF TEAM MIT'S SCISSORS-DICE

366
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,010
Couldn't that be blocked with a paper?

367
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,762
Look at where the paper is.

368
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,181
Our rock-die is bound to get taken.

369
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,683
There's no way out.

370
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:43,478
TEAM MIT'S PAPER-DIE COULD TAKE
TEAM KAIST'S ROCK-DIE

371
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:47,691
I was actually in a position
where one of my dice could be taken.

372
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,235
Since both of us kept playing defensively,

373
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:54,406
it seemed like
we'd never see the end of it.

374
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,908
So, I slid my rock-die
into enemy territory.

375
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,496
Instead of continuing
to suss each other out,

376
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,581
I took a more aggressive approach.

377
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,049
You have ten seconds to finish your move.

378
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:16,928
Please.

379
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:23,935
Come on, get to it!

380
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,770
Hyeon-u has to take this one.

381
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:39,284
What did he just do?

382
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,298
He can win it now.

383
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:56,217
Ji-seong can take the scissors-die
without any risks.

384
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:59,095
Please move your die.

385
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,809
TEAM MIT: 1, TEAM KAIST: 2

386
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,687
JI-SEONG CAN LAUNCH
ANOTHER CONSECUTIVE ATTACK

387
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,690
- I think Team KAIST will be joining us.
- It's too early to tell.

388
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:13,193
Gi-hyeon took the game
after losing two dice first.

389
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:17,822
Team MIT's Jeon Hyeon-u,
please move your die.

390
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,827
He should've taken one just now.

391
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,842
You have ten seconds to finish your move.

392
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,279
Your time is up.

393
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,447
As a penalty,

394
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:03,243
Team MIT's Jeon Hyeon-u,
please remove one of your dice.

395
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,495
- Move up two tiles!
- Your time is up.

396
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,288
- No!
- As a penalty,

397
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,165
- What?
- Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong...

398
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,126
He has to remove one of his dice?

399
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,461
Didn't he make his move
within the time limit?

400
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:16,256
He needed to finish his turn
before the clock ran out.

401
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:19,592
A DIE MUST BE REMOVED
IF A MOVE IS NOT FINISHED WITHIN 1 MINUTE

402
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,347
My nerves cost me the chance
to take advantage of Ji-seong's mistake,

403
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,057
and it led to my own mistake.

404
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,936
It's over. We won.

405
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:36,109
Team MIT's Jeon Hyeon-u,
please remove one of your dice.

406
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,114
TEAM MIT: 1, TEAM KAIST: 3

407
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:44,701
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong,
please move your die.

408
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,170
TEAM MIT: 1, TEAM KAIST: 4

409
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,172
Two teams' dice made contact.

410
00:29:57,255 --> 00:29:59,174
In the ensuing game
of rock, paper, scissors...

411
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,259
- Ji-seong is really good.
- He's really calm.

412
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,053
He really lives up to his name.

413
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,181
The teams with red banners are all out.

414
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,516
- So, will Team POSTECH be next?
- I guess.

415
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,143
Team MIT must be devastated.

416
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,437
- Are they really going back to the US?
- I guess.

417
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,441
The winner of the second round
is Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong.

418
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:19,569
That last move...

419
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,196
Having one die taken out

420
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,490
- helped me to clear out the whole board.
- Right.

421
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,452
You did really well.

422
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:28,953
I mean it.

423
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,832
It's all right. You did great.

424
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:39,589
That concludes the second Deathmatch,
Rock-Paper-Scissors Chess.

425
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:43,510
The final score of the game was 2 to 0.

426
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:46,096
The winning team is Team KAIST.

427
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,599
I was so glad to be advancing
to the next phase.

428
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,184
We almost got eliminated.

429
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,977
That won't ever happen again.

430
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:57,107
I felt terrible for my teammates
after all of their hard work.

431
00:30:57,732 --> 00:31:00,485
All I felt was a deep sense of regret.

432
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:04,489
The second team to be eliminated
from Elite League, Season Two,

433
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:05,949
is Team MIT.

434
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,534
SECOND TO BE ELIMINATED: TEAM MIT

435
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,619
It's such a shame for Team MIT.

436
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:13,289
- I guess we have to win now.
- Let's avenge Team MIT.

437
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,208
Any regrets?

438
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:18,545
You don't have any? Then, we're good.

439
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,172
How about you? Any regrets?

440
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:25,802
We should've won it.

441
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:29,681
We all did well. It was such a tough game.

442
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:34,310
Team MIT, please exit the grounds.

443
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:44,612
I dreamed of competing
in a show like this all my life.

444
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:48,158
I nursed that dream even longer
than my dream of studying at MIT.

445
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:51,953
I'm so grateful for this opportunity.

446
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,831
The experience of losing myself
in solving new problems

447
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,459
was such a new and refreshing feeling.

448
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,170
I had such a blast.

449
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:03,757
My only regret
is that we couldn't advance further

450
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,925
and enjoy all the other games.

451
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:10,388
I want to thank my teammates
for all their hard work,

452
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:14,434
and for being my partners
throughout this journey.

453
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,115
It feels so empty now.

454
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,284
The lights are turned off.

455
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:32,827
I know. It just went straight out.

456
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:35,580
I knew Team KAIST would make a comeback.

457
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,706
Me too.

458
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:38,500
We should have a head-to-head.

459
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:43,380
Team KAIST,
as the winner of the Deathmatch,

460
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:48,009
please return to the Main Hall
for the next match.

461
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,396
We managed to come back.

462
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,814
You made it back.

463
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:07,404
Facing the Deathmatch
stoked up our desire to win.

464
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:08,947
You're all done.

465
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:10,949
You'd better be ready.

466
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,243
They had this look in their eyes.

467
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,079
They came back
looking completely different.

468
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:17,956
They were giving us a death stare,

469
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,500
and frankly, it was intimidating.

470
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:24,045
I thought Team KAIST may use
this opportunity to their advantage.

471
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:26,423
I have so much respect for them.

472
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,968
Brainpower survival challenge,
Elite League, Season Two.

473
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:32,679
The remaining teams are

474
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:33,847
Team Oxford,

475
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:35,598
Team SNU,

476
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,308
Team Yonsei,

477
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,144
Team KAIST,

478
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,813
and Team POSTECH.

479
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,816
All of the teams look intimidating now.

480
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:48,153
Everywhere you look,
we're surrounded by star players.

481
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:49,362
We can do this.

482
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,322
Don't forget it. We're Team POSTECH.

483
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,158
We can't ever end up in Deathmatch again.

484
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,702
But now that we've clawed our way up
from the Deathmatch...

485
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:57,328
- Nothing can scare us now.
- Totally.

486
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:58,663
We can face anything.

487
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:02,417
The benefit match will now begin.

488
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,462
Today's benefit match is...

489
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:07,756
What is it?

490
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,050
Pyramid Game.

491
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,051
What?

492
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:12,344
What now?

493
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,387
I can't imagine what it could be.

494
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:16,681
- "Pyramid Game."
- Pyramid...

495
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,768
In Pyramid Game,

496
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:23,730
you will be assigned a tier
by participating in one-on-one games.

497
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,191
The tiers will be converted into scores

498
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:29,361
which will be summed up by the team
to decide on the overall rank.

499
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:30,737
THE TEAM WITH THE HIGHEST SCORE WINS

500
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,197
We're going head-to-head?

501
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:37,243
There are six tiers in Pyramid Game.

502
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:41,247
All contestants will start at Tier 4.

503
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:43,249
Your tier will go up or down

504
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,211
depending on your performances
in the one-on-one matches.

505
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:49,005
So, we need to advance to the upper tiers.

506
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,299
Pyramid Game will test you

507
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:53,426
on calculation, memorization,

508
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,762
reasoning, and spatial awareness.

509
00:34:55,845 --> 00:35:00,308
The game has 28 questions in total,
with 7 questions per category.

510
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,937
If a category has no questions remaining,

511
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,815
the category cannot be chosen anymore.

512
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,858
Once the game starts,

513
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:12,779
the first question that will decide
the host will be revealed.

514
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:17,117
A representative from each team will start
to tackle that question simultaneously.

515
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:22,872
The first contestant to get the answer
will move up to the next tier

516
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,249
and become the new host,

517
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:27,252
which will give them the right
to choose the next category.

518
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:28,169
HOST, TIER 3

519
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:29,879
CHALLENGER, TIER 4
Starting from the next game,

520
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:33,341
the host will face the contestants
in one-on-one matches.

521
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,220
So the winner gets to compete
in the next one.

522
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:42,058
The contestants are able
to challenge the host to a match.

523
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,144
If multiple challengers come forward,

524
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:49,149
the host will select one of them
as their opponent.

525
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,694
If the host reaches Tier 1
after the rounds of games,

526
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:56,322
they can cede the host title
to one of their teammates.

527
00:35:57,073 --> 00:36:01,703
If the host has already reached Tier 1
and wins their next match,

528
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:05,123
their team will gain an extra point.

529
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:09,753
If a contestant on Tier 6,
the lowest tier, loses a match,

530
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:14,215
they will be immediately eliminated
and be barred from the following games.

531
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,301
Once the game is over,

532
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:19,721
each contestant will be given a score
depending on their tier.

533
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:23,141
And points will be taken away
for any eliminations.

534
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:28,063
The team with the highest number of points
will be declared the winner.

535
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:33,109
They will be given a substantial benefit
that can be used in the next main match.

536
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:35,070
"A substantial benefit."

537
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,489
If it's so substantial, we should get it.

538
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:41,659
The team with the lowest number of points
will be declared the loser.

539
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:44,996
If a tie occurs,
the sum of the tiers will be compared.

540
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,292
The team with the larger number
will be declared the loser.

541
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:54,839
And the losing team will be
immediately sent to the Deathmatch.

542
00:36:58,468 --> 00:36:59,719
Hold on.

543
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:02,639
- What was that?
- That's insane.

544
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:06,518
In other words,
1 of the 5 teams will not be allowed

545
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,145
to participate in the main match.

546
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:17,153
We will now reveal the four types of games
you'll be facing in the Pyramid Game.

547
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:22,200
In the calculation category,
you will be tested with Day Formula.

548
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:26,830
You will be shown a formula,
made up of the days of the week.

549
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:29,082
You must imagine
the corresponding calendar

550
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,168
and find dates
to complete a numerical formula.

551
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:35,463
The first contestant
to complete the formula wins the game.

552
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:37,966
What?

553
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:40,677
Hold on. How does that make any sense?

554
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,931
In the memorization category,
you will be tested with Link the Colors.

555
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,933
In Link the Colors,

556
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:51,479
you must memorize
a 5-by-5 colorized board.

557
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,524
You'll then name one cell
that has the displayed color

558
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:56,776
with another one
that can be linked to that cell.

559
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:59,696
So, we have to create a chain?

560
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:02,365
It's like a word chain game,
but with colors.

561
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:05,785
The board will have four different colors,

562
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:09,789
and one cell consists of two blocks,
each in different colors.

563
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,834
Once the game starts,
the board will be displayed,

564
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:16,755
and you will have two minutes
to memorize the entire board.

565
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:19,883
Then, the colors
will be replaced by numbers,

566
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:22,010
and you'll be given a starting color.

567
00:38:22,677 --> 00:38:25,055
The player who goes first

568
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:28,266
must name the cell that has
the starting color on the left side.

569
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:31,561
Then, they must name another cell

570
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:36,149
that can be linked to the color
on the first one's right side.

571
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,862
If both cells meet the requirements,
the contestant will be given one point.

572
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:43,573
The screen will continue
to display the named cells,

573
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:46,910
and the opponent
will take their turn next.

574
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,537
But if an incorrect cell is called,

575
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:52,874
the incorrectly named cell
will be displayed for three seconds,

576
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:55,710
and the opponent will take their turn.

577
00:38:56,753 --> 00:39:01,007
The contestant who earns four points first
wins the game.

578
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,718
- Wait.
- We have to memorize a picture?

579
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:04,844
Are you up for it?

580
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,555
I seriously doubt I can do this.

581
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:12,686
In the reasoning category,
you will be tested with Hidden Algorithm.

582
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:14,979
In Hidden Algorithm,

583
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:17,899
you must figure out the hidden algorithm
that will create a route

584
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:21,069
from the assigned starting point
to the destination.

585
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:22,779
RED: STARTING POINT
GREEN: DESTINATION

586
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,656
The algorithm refers

587
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:29,661
to an assigned rank of priority
to numbers from 1 to 4.

588
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:31,579
1, 2, 3, AND 4 ARE GIVEN A PRIORITY RANK

589
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:35,458
The algorithm currently on screen
values number two the most

590
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:38,211
and number one the least.

591
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:42,298
If the algorithm values 2, 3, 4, and 1
in descending order,

592
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:46,386
the algorithm will move you down to two
from the starting point.

593
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:50,390
In Hidden Algorithm,
you can't return to your previous tile.

594
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:53,268
You will need to proceed
to one of the other three tiles

595
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:55,645
that is ranked the highest
in the priority list.

596
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,480
Here, that is the tile with three.

597
00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:02,861
Next, the same method
will take you to the tile with two.

598
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:05,113
2 TILES WITH 3

599
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:09,409
However, if there are two or more tiles
with a number of a higher rank,

600
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,870
you must stop on that spot.

601
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:15,123
Additionally,
you must not pass through the destination.

602
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:16,583
PASSING THROUGH WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED

603
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,626
And you must find
the exact rank of priorities

604
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,421
that will have you stop exactly
at the destination.

605
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,882
- We have to figure out the hierarchy?
- Right.

606
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:25,884
Just from that board with the numbers?

607
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,677
Right. From the starting point to the end.

608
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:28,720
This is so tricky.

609
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:31,931
- We have to quickly find one that works?
- Right, out of the possible 24.

610
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:37,145
In the spatial awareness category,
you will be tested with Ladder Assembly.

611
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,022
In Ladder Assembly,

612
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:43,026
you'll be presented with five ladders
that are placed out of sequence.

613
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:45,028
They must be rearranged

614
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:48,281
to find a match for the starting points
to their destination.

615
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:51,534
EXAMPLE QUESTION'S SOLUTION: 4, 5, 1, 2, 3

616
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:53,203
How are we supposed to do that?

617
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:54,204
That's crazy.

618
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:56,456
Today's games are no joke.

619
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:58,291
That sounds so difficult.

620
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,001
All four of them are no joke.

621
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:04,673
Please go to your base camps
and start discussing your strategies.

622
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:07,425
- It's been a while.
- It's nice to be back.

623
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:10,887
We made it back from the dead,
and they gave us deathly difficult tasks.

624
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,181
I came up with a trick
to help us memorize.

625
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:15,684
If this is the colored board,
let's call this cell "AB,"

626
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,687
there's a high chance
that "BA" will be there, too.

627
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,771
- That's what I saw.
- Right.

628
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:22,941
If I have the mirror-pair memorized
and name its two components,

629
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:26,361
my opponent will have to answer
the same question but with fewer options.

630
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:29,739
If two cells with a mirror image
are the only ones to be named,

631
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:33,618
the starting color of the opponent's cells
can be limited to one color.

632
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,580
By excluding the two cells
that were already named,

633
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:40,041
the starting cells
that your opponent can name

634
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:43,795
can be limited to 5
out of the 23 remaining cells.

635
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:44,838
TEAM KAIST'S STRATEGY

636
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:47,966
In Link the Colors,
the first to gain four points will win,

637
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:50,468
so lowering the possible options
for your opponents

638
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:54,347
to force them to make a mistake
could be a good strategy to follow.

639
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:56,016
Let's memorize it like this.

640
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,560
If there's a blue and yellow cell,

641
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:02,897
- we'll memorize 1, 25, and 24.
- I see.

642
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,983
- Let's memorize the numbers.
- Yes, I get it.

643
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:08,028
That should give us a cycle of 25 numbers
ending with this one.

644
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:08,945
Right.

645
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:11,239
Team Yonsei's strategy

646
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:14,743
is to memorize a chain of numbers
that are linked to each other

647
00:42:14,826 --> 00:42:17,871
that will create a cycle
of 25 numbers in total.

648
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:21,374
If the opponent
finishes their turn on Cell 16,

649
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,752
- I would name the next cell in the set.
- Right.

650
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:26,087
Let's do it like that.

651
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:30,258
If there's a pair that starts with red,
the other color doesn't matter.

652
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:32,927
As long as we remember
it's connected to something,

653
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,971
the opponent will deal
with the last color.

654
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:37,766
So we don't have to worry
about remembering the second color.

655
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:39,351
Team SNU's strategy

656
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:42,354
doesn't involve memorizing
all the colors in the cell pairs.

657
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,689
They will focus
on the first color of the cell

658
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:47,567
and the fact
that it has another connected cell

659
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,277
and only memorize those two aspects.

660
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:51,863
We don't need to know the color
that connects the two cells.

661
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:53,573
Just remember the first color.

662
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:55,367
As for me,

663
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,453
the only way
I could tackle Link the Colors

664
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:01,247
is to convert everything into numbers.

665
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:02,832
...everything into numbers.

666
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:06,670
Let's assign 1 to red, 2 to yellow,
3 to green, and 4 to blue.

667
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:08,922
I'll memorize the whole board like that.

668
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:10,006
TEAM OXFORD'S STRATEGY

669
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:13,051
Can you memorize
every 2-digit number in 2 minutes?

670
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:14,761
I can, actually.

671
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:21,017
Are there any reasoning tools
we could use for Hidden Algorithm?

672
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,395
We should come up
with a few ways before we go.

673
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,897
- Any ideas?
- Reverse thinking?

674
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,650
- Reverse thinking?
- For the route to end at the destination,

675
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:32,445
the destination is likely surrounded
by three identical numbers.

676
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:34,239
In Hidden Algorithm,

677
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:38,034
the algorithm you're tasked to find
must end the route at the destination.

678
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:41,454
The rule demands that if one number
is placed in multiple directions,

679
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:45,000
the route must come to an end
at that exact spot.

680
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,419
The odd number out
has to be the entry point.

681
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:51,715
To continue the route to 3 from 2,

682
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:56,136
3 must have a higher priority
than that of 1 or 4.

683
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:59,180
If we consider the case
where 3 ranks lower than 1,

684
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:02,726
as the number with a higher priority
is placed in two directions,

685
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:04,769
the route must end there.

686
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:08,356
If 4 ranks higher than 3,
the route will proceed to the tile with 4,

687
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,443
which will not end the route
at the pre-determined destination.

688
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:16,031
When we're working with the ladders,
we usually start from up here.

689
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:18,783
Most people would try
to work their way down,

690
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,244
but we could actually save time
by working our way up.

691
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:24,664
- That's my strategy for this game.
- That's what I thought, too.

692
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:28,126
We'll start down here and work our way up.

693
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:30,253
Then, we'll always know what this one is.

694
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:31,755
We could take them one by one.

695
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:34,341
SNU TAKES A SIMILAR APPROACH
Look. We'll start from here.

696
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:35,300
We'll go up like this.

697
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:37,510
Then, we'll move on to the branch
on ladder four.

698
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:40,096
We'll keep going
until we move on to ladder five.

699
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,389
So, this one would be five.

700
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:44,059
If you work your way down,

701
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:47,771
you have to keep remembering
the destination of the first ladder

702
00:44:47,854 --> 00:44:51,524
while working on the remaining ladders.

703
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:55,862
Since your task for Ladder Assembly
is to list the numbers at the bottom

704
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:58,406
in the order presented
in the disassembled state,

705
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:03,203
working your way up can be
a more efficient approach.

706
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,747
Remember. You can cede the host's post.

707
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,542
Getting bonus points at Tier 1 is great,
but if you lose, you lose 2 points.

708
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:10,752
Just hand it over then.

709
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:14,589
The loss is greater when your tier drops
from 1 to 2, right?

710
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,716
So, are we ceding once we reach Tier 1?

711
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,844
Let's make the decision when we're there.
Let's see how it goes.

712
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:21,638
You should keep going
if you feel confident.

713
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:24,057
I don't think we need
to have that set in stone.

714
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:25,767
At the end of the day,

715
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,228
you won't lose anything
by participating in the first game.

716
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:30,021
If you become the host, you win a point.

717
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:33,358
- But it'd be best if you won.
- Even if you lose, we'd break even.

718
00:45:33,441 --> 00:45:34,859
- Should I go first?
- Yes.

719
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:37,862
We hoped Gyu-min could become the host,
earn some points,

720
00:45:37,946 --> 00:45:39,989
so I thought being the host
was really important.

721
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:42,742
That was how we hoped
to win the benefit match.

722
00:45:43,618 --> 00:45:45,912
Let's be honest.
No one would ever challenge you.

723
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:46,830
He's right.

724
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:48,581
- It's obvious, isn't it?
- Totally.

725
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:50,917
I think there may be a few.

726
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,504
We need a special action plan for Gyu-min.

727
00:45:54,587 --> 00:45:58,049
Everyone will react differently
if he becomes the host.

728
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:00,635
I think Gyu-min
is going to be on a rampage.

729
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,887
Our plan is not to get in his way.

730
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,180
Just keep your heads down.

731
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:06,391
- Let's stay put.
- Don't do anything.

732
00:46:07,225 --> 00:46:12,022
Obviously, we saw Team SNU's Gyu-min
as our biggest threat.

733
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:14,816
What we must keep in mind is

734
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:17,485
that everyone will target you
if you're at Tier 6.

735
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:19,154
We can't ever go down that low.

736
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:22,449
We should only step up
once someone drops down to Tier 6.

737
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:25,994
- Our goal is to avoid being last.
- This is so nerve-wracking.

738
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:28,288
Don't worry. We got this.

739
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:31,082
The time for the strategy meeting is up.

740
00:46:36,963 --> 00:46:42,427
All teams, please gather
in the Main Hall for the benefit match.

741
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,762
This won't be easy.

742
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:47,098
But everyone will be wary of us.

743
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:52,771
I'm so nervous.

744
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:56,441
- It'd be a shame to go home so soon.
- Agreed.

745
00:46:56,524 --> 00:46:57,859
Are we going to be okay?

746
00:46:58,526 --> 00:47:00,737
We can do it.
We won't be the only ones struggling.

747
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,155
I bet everyone feels the same.

748
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:04,783
- Team SNU is laying it on too thick.
- What did they say?

749
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:06,910
"We won't be the only ones struggling."

750
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,038
I bet they'll do well.

751
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:16,086
We'll now begin the benefit match,
Pyramid Game.

752
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,963
The first game to start Pyramid Game

753
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:21,132
is Day Formula.

754
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:23,843
FIRST GAME OF THE BENEFIT MATCH
DAY FORMULA

755
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:25,095
...is Day Formula.

756
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:27,764
A SINGLE REPRESENTATIVE
CAN COMPETE IN THE FIRST GAME

757
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:31,184
Contestants to play Day Formula
to test your calculation skills,

758
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:33,228
please step forward.

759
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:34,729
- You're up.
- Be quick, okay?

760
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:36,022
Take them all out.

761
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:38,191
TEAM YONSEI, IM JEONG-HUN

762
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:39,651
- Let's go, Team KAIST!
- Let's go, Team KAIST!

763
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:43,780
TEAM KAIST, PARK JI-SEONG

764
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:45,115
There goes our kid!

765
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:47,701
You can do it, Jin-hyeon.

766
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:49,035
Hit the button quickly.

767
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:52,789
TEAM OXFORD, HAH EUN

768
00:47:52,872 --> 00:47:54,165
TEAM POSTECH, CHOI JIN-HYEON

769
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:55,875
You're up.

770
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:58,044
What?

771
00:47:58,128 --> 00:47:59,295
You've got this.

772
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:00,797
- Did you hear him?
- Yeah.

773
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,382
TEAM SNU, KIM GYU-MIN

774
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:04,009
Show them who's the boss.

775
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:06,761
- Hello.
- Hello to you, too.

776
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:08,430
Take a few steps forward.

777
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:12,100
I was determined to beat Gyu-min
during this benefit match.

778
00:48:12,183 --> 00:48:16,271
It was quite exciting to get a chance
to compete against such a talented person.

779
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:19,107
Will Gyu-min be good at formulas?

780
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:24,571
Gyu-min showed exceptional performance
throughout the first benefit match,

781
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:27,574
so I thought
we had a good chance of winning.

782
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:30,076
If you become the host first,

783
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,204
you can choose the game
that you feel most confident in,

784
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:35,790
so I thought getting the post
was really important.

785
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,669
We'll now begin the benefit match,
Pyramid Game.

786
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:42,756
Here is your question.

787
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:46,801
JANUARY 1ST IS A MONDAY
{(SAT/WED)^TUE-THU}/MON-FRI=2

788
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:52,891
JANUARY 1ST IS A MONDAY
{(SAT/WED)^TUE-THU}/MON-FRI=2

789
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,853
First off, the quotient
must be a natural number.

790
00:48:57,854 --> 00:48:59,522
Next to consider was the exponent.

791
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:02,150
It wouldn't be anything higher
than the power of 2 or 3,

792
00:49:02,233 --> 00:49:03,985
so I'd determine those first.

793
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,656
If the first day of the month is a Monday,
there are only three cases

794
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,117
where the date of Saturday and Wednesday
divides into a natural number.

795
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,161
3 CASES WHERE THE QUOTIENT
IS A NATURAL NUMBER

796
00:49:13,244 --> 00:49:15,038
By breaking down the formula

797
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:18,041
and narrowing down possibilities
for each section,

798
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:20,960
the formula can be completed.

799
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:25,340
However, all such processes
must be carried out mentally

800
00:49:25,423 --> 00:49:27,550
without the help of any visual aids.

801
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:32,597
JANUARY 1ST IS A MONDAY
{(SAT/WED)^TUE-THU}/MON-FRI=2

802
00:49:33,014 --> 00:49:36,267
Saturday divided by Wednesday
taken to the power of Tuesday is 81.

803
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:42,315
JANUARY 1ST IS A MONDAY
{(SAT/WED)^TUE-THU}/MON-FRI=2

804
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:45,819
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min,
please state your answer.

805
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:53,952
Twenty-seven, three, two,

806
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:55,495
twenty-five,

807
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,498
eight, and five.

808
00:49:58,581 --> 00:50:04,421
SAT: 27, WED: 3, TUES: 2,
THURS: 25, MON: 8, FRI: 5

809
00:50:04,504 --> 00:50:06,548
He got them all right.

810
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:08,258
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min.

811
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:09,342
That is correct.

812
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,552
TEAM SNU GETS THE ANSWER

813
00:50:10,635 --> 00:50:15,223
SAT: 27, WED: 3, TUES: 2,
THURS: 25, MON: 8, FRI: 5

814
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,893
I just thought,
"That's Gyu-min doing his thing."

815
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,938
- That game's way too difficult.
- You can say that again.

816
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:25,025
- I came up with the first three numbers.
- What will I get?

817
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:26,359
It is really rough.

818
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:29,863
It's okay. What matters is that you tried.

819
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:33,950
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min
will now be acting as the host.

820
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:36,077
You will also be moved up a tier.

821
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:37,287
GYU-MIN GOES UP TO TIER 3

822
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,331
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min.

823
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:43,043
As the first host,
please select the next game category.

824
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:47,881
What do you think he'll choose?

825
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,133
He'll be good at all of them.

826
00:50:51,217 --> 00:50:54,888
- Pick something you feel comfortable in.
- Try the Day Formula again.

827
00:50:56,222 --> 00:50:57,974
I'd like to play Hidden Algorithm.

828
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:04,731
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min
selected Hidden Algorithm.

829
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:08,485
I could've gone with Day Formula again.

830
00:51:08,568 --> 00:51:12,697
But I couldn't imagine
what Hidden Algorithm was like,

831
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:14,949
so I wanted to check it out.

832
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:17,869
If you want to challenge
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min,

833
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:19,245
please raise your hand.

834
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:23,750
We should've made up a list
of all the weak contestants.

835
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:26,461
Someone who avoids eye contact.

836
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,676
- We're not volunteering, right?
- Let's sit this one out.

837
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:35,595
I doubt there'd be any challengers.

838
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:39,891
I wonder who he'll choose
if no one raises their hand.

839
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,936
- He's such an amazing crutch.
- There's no one.

840
00:51:48,316 --> 00:51:52,445
TEAM OXFORD, CHANG MUN-HYEOK

841
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:55,573
Anyone else?

842
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:01,079
TEAM YONSEI
YANG HYEON-SEUNG, PARK SE-HWAN

843
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:03,915
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min,

844
00:52:03,998 --> 00:52:06,584
please choose your opponent.

845
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:11,047
I'll go with the challenger
who volunteered first.

846
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:14,092
I would like Team Oxford's
Chang Mun-hyeok to join me.

847
00:52:14,926 --> 00:52:16,094
- Good luck.
- Nice.

848
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:19,222
He's got guts.

849
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:22,350
Who I was up against didn't matter to me.

850
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,894
The whole point
of participating in the show

851
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:26,688
was to test my wits with the games

852
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:30,567
and to compete
against the cream of the crop.

853
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:34,279
So, this felt like a golden opportunity
that I shouldn't miss.

854
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,741
- I think he'll do well.
- He'll do great.

855
00:52:38,908 --> 00:52:40,660
Here's your question.

856
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:44,789
RANK THE NUMBERS BY PRIORITY
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

857
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,332
Do you see how it is?

858
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,585
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

859
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:51,713
This kind of question
was completely new to me.

860
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,257
I'd never seen anything like it before.

861
00:52:54,632 --> 00:52:56,259
It still seemed doable enough.

862
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:58,762
It looked like a fun challenge.

863
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:04,517
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

864
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:07,145
- Do you see the way?
- Yes, I do.

865
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:19,449
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok,
please state your answer.

866
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:21,659
My answer is 3, 1, 4, 2.

867
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:25,538
TEAM OXFORD, CHANG MUN-HYEOK
ANSWER: 3, 1, 4, 2

868
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:30,251
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok.
That is correct.

869
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:32,545
That is correct.

870
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:38,551
You could say Mun-hyeok's brain operates
on algorithms in his day-to-day life.

871
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:41,388
I naturally thought he'd bring us a win.

872
00:53:42,305 --> 00:53:44,474
TWO POSSIBLE ANSWERS

873
00:53:44,557 --> 00:53:47,268
3, 1, 4, 2 OR 1, 3, 4, 2

874
00:53:47,852 --> 00:53:50,814
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok
will now be acting as the host.

875
00:53:50,897 --> 00:53:53,358
You will also be moved up a tier.

876
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:56,236
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min.

877
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,655
You'll be moved down a tier.

878
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:01,700
You'll also be barred
from playing in the next game.

879
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:03,618
Good game.

880
00:54:05,286 --> 00:54:06,287
Well done.

881
00:54:07,872 --> 00:54:09,207
I guess he's not invincible.

882
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:12,669
He's pretty fast.

883
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:16,381
Team Oxford, Chang Mun-hyeok.

884
00:54:16,464 --> 00:54:19,134
As the new host,
please select the next game category.

885
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:21,428
I will choose Hidden Algorithm.

886
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:25,098
If you want to challenge
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok,

887
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:26,391
please raise your hand.

888
00:54:26,474 --> 00:54:29,686
Let's stand back and join them
if more than two raise their hands.

889
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:33,189
It won't be so bad to win a few points
when everyone's trying to play it safe.

890
00:54:33,606 --> 00:54:36,943
But seeing how Mun-hyeok
challenged Gyu-min,

891
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:38,862
- he must feel really confident.
- Yeah.

892
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:42,866
- Let's play it safe and not take risks.
- I agree.

893
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,204
We have a contestant challenging
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok.

894
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:50,915
Team SNU's Woo Su-han.

895
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:56,129
As he is the sole challenger,
his challenge is automatically accepted.

896
00:54:58,631 --> 00:55:00,133
Here's your question.

897
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:04,262
RANK THE NUMBERS BY PRIORITY
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

898
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:21,696
Team SNU's Woo Su-han,
please state your answer.

899
00:55:22,113 --> 00:55:23,698
My answer is 1, 3, 4, 2.

900
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:25,158
TEAM SNU, WOO SU-HAN
ANSWER: 1, 3, 4, 2

901
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:26,409
Team SNU, Woo Su-han.

902
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:27,619
That is incorrect.

903
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:30,372
Your opponent will now get
the chance to answer.

904
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:31,956
You have ten seconds.

905
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:43,051
- Mun-hyeok figured it out.
- So, that's why...

906
00:55:44,552 --> 00:55:47,180
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok.
Please state your answer.

907
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:50,058
You got this, Mun-hyeok.
You're a damn genius.

908
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:51,851
My answer is 3, 1, 2, 4.

909
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:55,647
TEAM OXFORD, CHANG MUN-HYEOK
ANSWER: 3, 1, 2, 4

910
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,148
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok.

911
00:55:58,274 --> 00:55:59,359
That is correct.

912
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:10,453
PYRAMID GAME, CURRENT STANDINGS
Chang Mun-hyeok will be moved up a tier.

913
00:56:10,537 --> 00:56:13,206
OXFORD: 1ST PLACE
Please select the next game category.

914
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:14,582
My choice is Hidden Algorithm.

915
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:18,503
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok
selected the Hidden Algorithm.

916
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:22,549
We have some here, too.

917
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:25,010
- We have some here, too.
- Stop it.

918
00:56:26,177 --> 00:56:28,138
I'll play against Choi Yu-chan.

919
00:56:30,765 --> 00:56:33,435
- I'm sure he'll do well.
- Yu-chan's not a pushover.

920
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:36,688
I'd love it if the host gets replaced.

921
00:56:37,147 --> 00:56:38,773
Here's your question.

922
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:41,693
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

923
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,695
My answer is 2, 1, 3, 4.

924
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:45,238
Team KAIST's Choi Yu-chan.

925
00:56:45,321 --> 00:56:46,489
That is correct.

926
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:51,369
Team Yonsei's Im Jeong-hun.

927
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:53,413
My answer is 2, 4, 3, 1.

928
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,206
That is correct.

929
00:56:57,876 --> 00:56:59,502
Jeong-hun is the boss.

930
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:02,380
- Jeong-hun is the boss.
- He's the boss.

931
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:05,425
It's now become clear
that you can't keep winning

932
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:07,302
all the way up to Tier 1.

933
00:57:07,385 --> 00:57:11,890
Challenging the host doesn't mean much
if you can't win two questions in a row.

934
00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:15,685
Team Yonsei's Im Jeong-hun.

935
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:18,396
As the new host,
please select the next game category.

936
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,190
My choice is Day Formula.

937
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:23,818
That's the game
I felt most comfortable with.

938
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:27,906
I chose it with a determination
to win a couple of points for my team.

939
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:30,825
- Do you want to try it?
- Yes.

940
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:33,995
If you want to challenge
Team Yonsei's Im Jeong-hun,

941
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,497
please raise your hand.

942
00:57:39,876 --> 00:57:41,252
Look who it is.

943
00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:43,963
I'd hate to be Jeong-hun.

944
00:57:44,422 --> 00:57:45,465
They're the 1st and 5th contestants.

945
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:47,175
EUN: 5TH IN ACE SELECTION
GYU-MIN: 1ST IN ACE SELECTION

946
00:57:49,844 --> 00:57:52,555
I'd feel so helpless
if those two challenged me.

947
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:55,183
What do we do? Should I keep still?

948
00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:59,145
He's already eying the other team.

949
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:01,815
He's already eying the other team.

950
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:04,776
I'll play against Team Oxford.

951
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,570
Team Oxford's Hah Eun will be challenging
Team Yonsei's Im Jeong-hun.

952
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:09,280
Please step forward.

953
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:14,077
No one would choose Gyu-min.

954
00:58:15,036 --> 00:58:16,246
Go get him.

955
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,920
It's almost suffocating.

956
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:26,840
Here's your question.

957
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:29,676
Look, they used factorials.

958
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,177
JUNE 1ST IS A THURSDAY
THURS/(SUN+WED)+MON+SAT!+FRI=57

959
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:33,179
Factorials are Jeong-hun's specialty.

960
00:58:34,222 --> 00:58:37,308
I knew so many factorials by heart.

961
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:40,520
So I could decide early on
that Saturday is the 3rd.

962
00:58:41,354 --> 00:58:44,065
POSSIBLE DATES FOR SATURDAY: 3, 10, 17, 24

963
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,568
THE THREE BIG NUMBERS ARE RULED OUT

964
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:49,738
SATURDAY IS CONFIRMED TO BE 3

965
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:55,660
JUNE 1ST IS A THURSDAY
THURS/(SUN+WED)+MON+SAT!+FRI=57

966
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:01,082
You can do it.

967
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:06,546
Team Oxford's Hah Eun,
please state your answer.

968
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,924
Thursday is 22,

969
00:59:10,467 --> 00:59:11,885
Sunday is four,

970
00:59:11,968 --> 00:59:13,720
Wednesday is seven,

971
00:59:13,803 --> 00:59:15,305
Monday is 26,

972
00:59:15,388 --> 00:59:16,765
Saturday is three,

973
00:59:16,848 --> 00:59:18,767
and Friday is 23.

974
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,561
THURS: 22, SUN: 4, WED: 7,
MON: 26, SAT: 3, FRI: 23

975
00:59:21,644 --> 00:59:23,229
Team Oxford, Hah Eun.

976
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:24,439
That is correct.

977
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:29,819
THURS: 22, SUN: 4, WED: 7,
MON: 26, SAT: 3, FRI: 23

978
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:35,367
One of the strategies I came up with
was using the concept of MOD.

979
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:36,826
HAH EUN'S STRATEGY

980
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:39,621
MOD FINDS THE REMAINDER
OF THE DIVISION OF TWO NUMBERS

981
00:59:39,704 --> 00:59:41,664
OFTEN USED IN PROGRAMMING OR CRYPTOLOGY

982
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:46,294
There are 7 days in a week.
Let's say Monday is the 1st.

983
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:48,171
So, Monday will be our baseline of zero.

984
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:51,091
Tuesday would be one,
Wednesday would be two,

985
00:59:51,174 --> 00:59:53,218
and I'll assign up to three.

986
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:55,970
Rather than keep going
to assign numbers up to six,

987
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:58,390
I'll use -3, -2, and -1 to spare trouble.

988
00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:01,434
I thought calculation would get easier

989
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:03,895
SIMPLE CONVERSION BEFORE CALCULATING
once the MOD table was set.

990
01:00:06,314 --> 01:00:08,233
Team Oxford is doing well.

991
01:00:08,817 --> 01:00:10,819
We're currently in first place.

992
01:00:10,902 --> 01:00:14,322
PYRAMID GAME, CURRENT STANDINGS
TEAM OXFORD: 1ST PLACE

993
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:17,158
Team Oxford's Hah Eun.

994
01:00:17,242 --> 01:00:19,661
As the new host,
please select the next game category.

995
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:26,042
My choice is Day Formula.

996
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:26,960
FOUR GAMES LEFT

997
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:29,254
He was staring at Gyu-min just now.

998
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:33,383
I wondered,
"Would he choose me as his opponent?"

999
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,511
If you want to challenge
Team Oxford's Hah Eun,

1000
01:00:36,594 --> 01:00:38,138
please raise your hand.

1001
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:41,182
- Let's volunteer together.
- Go ahead.

1002
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:45,353
Though many raised their hands,

1003
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:48,189
I only had one person in mind.

1004
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:51,776
I'll play against Kim Gyu-min of Team SNU.

1005
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:53,611
How can you resist?

1006
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:56,197
He's an adrenaline junkie.

1007
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:58,283
- Man, that was cool.
- Nice.

1008
01:00:58,366 --> 01:00:59,534
This is great.

1009
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,372
Since we're aiming for the win,

1010
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:07,667
we'd have to beat Team SNU
at some point down the road.

1011
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:09,169
I thought I should do that now

1012
01:01:09,252 --> 01:01:12,047
by playing Day Formula,
a game that I was good at.

1013
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:21,973
I felt good about my chances
because it was Day Formula.

1014
01:01:24,601 --> 01:01:26,227
Here's your question.

1015
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:32,317
FEBRUARY 1ST IS A MONDAY
(WED+TUE)xSUN+SAT+THU!+MON=143

1016
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:49,584
Team Oxford's Hah Eun,
please state your answer.

1017
01:01:50,251 --> 01:01:51,878
Wednesday is three,

1018
01:01:51,961 --> 01:01:55,590
Tuesday is 9, Sunday is 11,

1019
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,050
Saturday...

1020
01:01:58,051 --> 01:01:59,177
That would be five,

1021
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:02,430
Thursday is 1, and Monday is 1.

1022
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:05,392
- The numbers don't add up.
- I think 11 is off.

1023
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:08,436
Team Oxford, Hah Eun. That is incorrect.

1024
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:13,775
I used the MOD concept again,
which I mentioned earlier.

1025
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:17,904
But I got 1 and -1 mixed up
and ended up getting the wrong result.

1026
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:23,868
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min,
please state your answer.

1027
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:26,204
Wednesday is three,

1028
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:28,248
Tuesday is nine,

1029
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:32,085
Sunday is 7, Saturday is 27,

1030
01:02:32,627 --> 01:02:34,087
Thursday is four,

1031
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,839
and Monday is eight.

1032
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:37,507
That's correct.

1033
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,217
- Right.
- He got it.

1034
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,511
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min. That is correct.

1035
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:46,975
Thank you.

1036
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:51,938
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min,
you'll be moved up a tier.

1037
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,234
I was worried losing Hidden Algorithm
might've shaken him up.

1038
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:58,611
He must have a computer in his head.

1039
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:00,030
All hail Gyu-min.

1040
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:02,741
My choice is Day Formula.

1041
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:06,286
I wanted to secure my team's victory,

1042
01:03:06,369 --> 01:03:09,414
so I selected Day Formula,
the game that I was good at.

1043
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,212
I would like Team Yonsei's
Park Se-hwan to join me.

1044
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:17,839
Here's your question.

1045
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:22,719
MAY 1ST IS A THURSDAY
(FRI+SAT)!/MON+THU+TUExWED=165

1046
01:03:22,802 --> 01:03:24,179
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min.

1047
01:03:24,262 --> 01:03:28,516
Two, three, five,

1048
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,311
fifteen, six, and twenty-one.

1049
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:33,021
That is correct.

1050
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,316
NOW IN TIER 2
You'll be moved up a tier.

1051
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:38,360
He's a monster.

1052
01:03:38,443 --> 01:03:41,613
- Let's leave him be.
- We should stay away from him.

1053
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:44,282
Let's keep it down
before the king of beasts.

1054
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:46,201
He'd choose Day Formula.

1055
01:03:46,284 --> 01:03:47,285
Let's go again.

1056
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:51,956
My choice is Day Formula.

1057
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:55,293
I'm not playing.

1058
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:58,088
- I'm too scared.
- I think you should try.

1059
01:03:58,171 --> 01:03:59,964
Don't go if you're scared.

1060
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:04,052
Even as I kept stacking up scores
with Day Formula,

1061
01:04:04,135 --> 01:04:07,055
a few contestants kept challenging me.

1062
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:11,476
TEAM OXFORD, HAH EUN

1063
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:13,853
TEAM YONSEI, IM JEONG-HUN

1064
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:16,815
I'm seeing the same familiar faces.

1065
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:21,820
I guess they're not done yet.

1066
01:04:21,903 --> 01:04:24,072
- I think that's admirable.
- Right.

1067
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:32,372
I would like
Team Oxford's Hah Eun to join me.

1068
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:36,835
THE SECOND ONE-ON-ONE GAME
BETWEEN HAH EUN AND KIM GYU-MIN

1069
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:41,297
I wanted to earn a point
against the opponent who once beat me.

1070
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:44,676
That's what motivated me
to keep challenging Gyu-min.

1071
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:49,514
If I saw someone dominating a field,
getting consecutive wins like that,

1072
01:04:49,597 --> 01:04:52,809
I'd also feel the temptation
to challenge them and win.

1073
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:56,271
Here's your question.

1074
01:04:56,354 --> 01:04:59,816
OCTOBER 1ST IS A THURSDAY
{(SAT^SUN)/FRI}xTUE/MON+WED=43

1075
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:07,365
I think my nerves got the better of me
on our first one-on-one.

1076
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:10,535
But I felt certain I could win,
considering my calculation speed.

1077
01:05:10,618 --> 01:05:14,914
OCTOBER 1ST IS A THURSDAY
{(SAT^SUN)/FRI}xTUE/MON+WED=43

1078
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:18,084
If Gyu-min wins,
I'll probably fall in love with him.

1079
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,004
- I'm already crushing on him.
- I suppose I am.

1080
01:05:21,379 --> 01:05:25,258
OCTOBER 1ST IS A THURSDAY
{(SAT^SUN)/FRI}xTUE/MON+WED=43

1081
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:35,393
Please state your answer.

1082
