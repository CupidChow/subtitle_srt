1
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,277
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 9
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 10

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,195
There is one cell remaining.

3
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,699
SE-HWAN COULD WIN THE POINT
TO INITIATE ANOTHER RE-MATCH

4
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,909
How can the game still be going
with only one cell left?

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,080
Their heads are going to spin
if they have another re-match.

6
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,167
I hope they get exhausted after this
and give up the final round.

7
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,753
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

8
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,673
I'll go with 1 in A2.

9
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,178
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 9
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 10

10
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,890
A2, 1.

11
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,183
That is correct.

12
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:05,398
TEAM POSTECH'S CHOI JIN-HYEON WINS

13
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,909
- We look like a train.
- Keep it going.

14
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,415
Damn it.

15
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,877
First, it was 10 to 10,
and now it's 11 to 9.

16
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,255
Jin-hyeon seems pretty good, too.

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,384
GI-HYEON GETS READY FOR THE FINALS

18
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,387
- Good luck.
- Gi-hyeon looks to be in his best shape.

19
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,599
Please return to your base camps.

20
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,694
Today's our day!

21
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,449
Do you want to see the dance moves
we came up with to help you memorize?

22
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,575
Don't break my focus.

23
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,625
This is really getting to us.

24
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,628
We lost the chance
to show our full potential again.

25
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,465
The winner of Group A,
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,

26
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,970
will play against the winner of Group B,
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

27
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,388
It's a rival match.

28
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,389
KAIST versus POSTECH.

29
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,808
- Here it is.
- POSTECH versus KAIST!

30
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,476
We've never lost against POSTECH.

31
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,274
The final round of the benefit match,
Blind Sudoku, will now begin.

32
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,569
The two contestants,
please come to the Main Hall.

33
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,571
Go get him, Jin-hyeon.

34
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,197
Bring it home, Jin-hyeon!

35
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,160
- Let's go, Team KAIST!
- Let's go, Team KAIST!

36
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,458
It was a rival match
between KAIST and POSTECH.

37
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,919
A rival match against KAIST
is something we take very seriously.

38
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,297
I had to win at all costs.

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,924
I was going to do whatever it took to win.

40
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,846
TEAM POSTECH'S CHOI JIN-HYEON
VS. TEAM KAIST'S HWANG GI-HYEON

41
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,601
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon won.

42
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,603
I'll go first.

43
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,731
TEAM KAIST WILL GO FIRST
AND TEAM POSTECH WILL GO SECOND

44
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,691
Jin-hyeon might actually
favor going second.

45
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,735
He's crazy like that.

46
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,112
One mistake could be the end.

47
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,281
- This won't be an easy fight.
- You're right.

48
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,077
Here's your board for Blind Sudoku.

49
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,789
You have 2 minutes and 30 seconds
to memorize the board.

50
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,045
This one's trickier
than the last two boards.

51
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,089
This one's really difficult.

52
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,132
The board looks especially difficult.

53
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,260
They've prepared a super difficult one
for the last match.

54
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,596
It's fitting for the final round.

55
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,730
The time for memorization is over.

56
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:55,193
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please name a location and a number.

57
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,529
I'll go with 1 in D6.

58
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,280
D6, 1.

59
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,490
That is correct.

60
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,410
I'll go with 1 in D5.

61
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,453
D5, 1.

62
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,959
- That is incorrect.
- I just said it wrong.

63
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,087
- One mistake could be fatal.
- That is incorrect.

64
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,633
One incorrect answer
would completely ruin his flow.

65
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,885
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 0
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 1

66
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,804
I'll go with 3 in A5.

67
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,723
A5, 3.

68
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,599
That is correct.

69
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,852
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 0
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 2

70
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,896
I'll go with 5 in D5.

71
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,314
D5, 5.

72
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,943
MADE A MISTAKE FOR D5 ON HIS LAST TURN
I'll go with 1 in D5.

73
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,656
- That is incorrect.
- What?

74
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,283
I must've memorized it wrong.

75
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,410
What's gotten into him?

76
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,204
We can't lose this round to Team KAIST.

77
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,165
I'll go with 4 in D5.

78
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,250
GI-HYEON PROMPTLY NAMES D5 ON HIS TURN

79
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,794
D5, 4.

80
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:55,962
That is correct.

81
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,883
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon won one point.

82
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,344
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon won one point.

83
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,387
- How is he so good?
- Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

84
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,184
Even if Se-hwan had won,
he'd have gotten buried. Gi-hyeon is good.

85
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,103
He's just too damn good.

86
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,647
We're only down by three points.

87
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,524
He can easily make up for it.

88
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,027
Jin-hyeon will turn it around somehow.

89
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,906
I'll go with 5 in F5.

90
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,657
F5, 5.

91
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,326
That is correct.

92
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,205
It's still doable.

93
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,500
I'll go with 4 in B6.

94
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,377
I'll go with 4 in F2.

95
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,713
I'll go with 1 in E2.

96
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,257
I'll go with 4 in E3.

97
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,218
I'll go with 6 in D1.

98
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,053
That is correct.

99
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,890
- Gi-hyeon is killing it.
- I'm so glad he's on our team.

100
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,809
- Team POSTECH is doing well.
- You're right.

101
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,269
He didn't let the two mistakes get to him.

102
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,688
Will there be a dramatic twist?

103
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,691
I'll go with 2 in D1.

104
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,611
That cell is already occupied.

105
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,447
That cell is already occupied.

106
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,867
I don't think he solved everything.

107
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,911
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 3
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 6

108
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,705
Jin-hyeon's confused now.

109
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,457
I'll go with 4 in C4.

110
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,501
I'll go with 5 in B4.

111
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,169
That is correct.

112
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,048
KAIST'S GI-HYEON
GAINS 8 CONSECUTIVE POINTS

113
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,675
He hasn't made a single mistake.

114
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,011
- The puzzle itself was pretty tough, too.
- He's a monster.

115
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,597
It's amazing how he solved everything
and even memorized it all.

116
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,017
How is this even possible?

117
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,102
How could he get
eight consecutive answers?

118
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,148
It feels like I'm watching
the edited highlights on TV.

119
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,065
Tell me about it.

120
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,109
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 3
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 8

121
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,654
Since all the other contestants
were focused on this game,

122
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,698
I wanted to show them that Team KAIST

123
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,909
is a formidable contender
that's not to be messed with.

124
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,995
I'll go with 6 in B3.

125
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,747
B3, 6.

126
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,040
That is correct.

127
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,835
I'll go with 6 in A2.

128
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,378
That is correct.

129
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:06,301
KAIST'S GI-HYEON WON 10 CONSECUTIVE POINTS
WITHOUT MAKING ANY MISTAKES

130
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,554
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 3
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 10

131
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,723
- He's on a roll.
- Ten points.

132
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,059
This is insane.

133
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,854
I'm completely speechless.

134
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,607
He said memorization wasn't his thing
but still got everything right.

135
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,025
We have a shot at winning this season.

136
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,194
- We have to win it.
- Right, I agree.

137
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,863
I should have a face-off with Gi-hyeon.

138
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,573
Yeah, go teach him a lesson, Gyu-min.

139
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,533
He needs to be dealt with.

140
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,329
Team KAIST needs to be nipped in the bud.

141
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,209
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

142
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,795
I'll go with 2 in C1.

143
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,381
C1, 2.

144
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,965
That is correct.

145
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,843
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 4
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 10

146
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,680
KAIST'S GI-HYEON CAN TAKE THE GAME
WITH 1 MORE POINT

147
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,307
I'll go with 1 in A4.

148
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,102
The game ends with one more point, right?

149
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,728
He'll definitely get it right.

150
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,647
A4, 1.

151
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,649
That is correct.

152
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,858
KAIST'S GI-HYEON GETS IT RIGHT

153
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:04,901
That is correct.

154
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,820
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 4
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 11

155
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,993
KAIST'S GI-HYEON WINS THE MATCH
BY SCORING 11 CONSECUTIVE POINTS

156
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,453
A4, 1.

157
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,917
- We got the benefit again.
- This is incredible.

158
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,587
Eleven correct answers in a row?

159
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,256
Is he some sort of a monster?

160
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,967
The Deathmatches transformed Team KAIST.

161
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,635
How is this possible?

162
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,637
He can't be human.

163
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,389
That was an inhuman performance.

164
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,308
He did better on a more difficult board.

165
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,643
If he's playing in the finals,

166
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,021
then I'm going to be there to defeat him.

167
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,106
I'm going to keep trying until I win.

168
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,570
Why did it have to be Team KAIST?

169
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,946
It was Team KAIST again.

170
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,323
They took first place again.

171
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,034
If Gi-hyeon was an opponent...

172
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,745
WE WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE

173
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,247
He's obviously great
and doesn't even make any mistakes.

174
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,042
As long as you can keep
Gyu-min in check with calculations,

175
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,879
- Gi-hyeon will handle the rest.
- That concludes Blind Sudoku.

176
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,005
I'll announce the results.

177
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,216
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon won the game.

178
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,845
Please look forward
to my team's journey to victory

179
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,514
as we keep up this winning streak
and place first in every match.

180
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:21,102
All contestants,
please gather in the Main Hall.

181
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,691
Great job, Gi-hyeon!

182
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,692
You were amazing.

183
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,236
- I didn't make a mistake, did I?
- Are you a computer?

184
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,993
- How is this possible?
- How on earth are you so good?

185
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,746
How did you get 11 points
without a single mistake?

186
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,623
- You did great.
- I thought so, too.

187
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,500
- Good work.
- You were amazing.

188
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,085
There's no need to be sorry.

189
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,754
Team KAIST is definitely on a roll.

190
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:52,467
As the winner of Blind Sudoku,

191
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,928
Team KAIST has secured the benefit.

192
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,806
TEAM KAIST RECEIVES
THE BENEFIT TWICE IN A ROW

193
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,890
You were amazing.

194
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,067
We'll now begin the main match.

195
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,987
Today's main match is

196
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,157
Exit Strategy 2.

197
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,247
This was last season's final game.

198
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,332
They had to move in a straight line.

199
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,793
- I remember it being difficult.
- Yeah, it really was.

200
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,670
In Exit Strategy 2,

201
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,965
all contestants will act
as game pieces on the board.

202
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:36,386
The team that has two people
exit the board first wins the game.

203
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,972
TEAM WHITE WINS

204
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:43,351
The board for Exit Strategy 2
contains an exit and multiple obstacles.

205
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:47,063
All contestants, be ready to form
an alliance with one other team.

206
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,773
2-ON-2 COALITION BATTLE

207
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,236
Assign 2 members as the leaders
and 6 others as the pieces

208
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,196
before going into the game.

209
00:10:55,905 --> 00:11:00,201
The leaders will choose which piece
will make a move on their team's turn.

210
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:05,081
The chosen piece will then travel
in the direction they see fit.

211
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,502
The leaders select a piece,
which then has to make its own decisions.

212
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,547
That's interesting.

213
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,051
The pieces can only move in straight lines

214
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:22,015
and must continue on their path
until they meet an obstacle or a piece.

215
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,224
MUST STOP BEFORE OBSTACLES AND PIECES

216
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,479
A special rule applies to Exit Strategy 2.

217
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:31,232
The two assigned leaders
must remain in the base camp

218
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,736
while the other six
must stay on the game board.

219
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,989
The two groups will be set apart
to prevent communication.

220
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,076
- Hold on.
- Seriously?

221
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,121
I felt the need to have a good strategy.

222
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,664
Once the game begins,

223
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:50,210
only the leaders in the base camp
can communicate with each other.

224
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,255
The pieces on the board must stay silent.

225
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,215
INCOMMUNICADO

226
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,217
If anyone speaks out loud,

227
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,304
that piece will immediately be
removed from the board.

228
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,894
We can't talk? It's kind of similar
to last season's Silent Human Chess.

229
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:12,273
Aside from the middle row and column,

230
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:17,904
you can place two pieces
per column in your camp.

231
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,156
2 PIECES PER COLUMN

232
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:25,036
If the leaders fail to decide
which piece to move in one minute,

233
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,788
the other team will take their turn.

234
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,542
If the designated piece fails to complete
the move within the time limit,

235
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,378
they will be immediately removed
from the board.

236
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:40,969
Each team can request
a 5-minute timeout per round.

237
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,472
Please note that the request
can only be made by leaders.

238
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,434
There will be three rounds in total,

239
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:51,021
and the team that secures two wins first
will be declared the winner.

240
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:55,358
The two losing teams
will face each other in the Deathmatch.

241
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,027
Come on.

242
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,115
We just have to win 2 out of 3 rounds.

243
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,284
We'll have to make
appropriate strategy changes.

244
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,495
The benefit could be
choosing our partner--

245
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,956
The benefit of the game
will now be revealed.

246
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,210
The team with the benefit

247
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,964
will decide which team goes first.

248
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,718
Okay, that's great.

249
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,928
Goodness.

250
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,847
Going first gives you the upper hand

251
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,266
because we only have
to bring two pieces home.

252
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:34,647
Team KAIST, please decide
whether you wish to play first or last.

253
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,733
We'd better go first, right?

254
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,193
I think that's for certain.

255
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,487
We'll go first.

256
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:45,116
Team KAIST will make the first move.

257
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,619
I knew Team KAIST had a huge advantage.

258
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,246
I thought we had to team up
with KAIST at all costs.

259
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:55,293
Please form an alliance
with a team of your choice.

260
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,254
You will be given
ten minutes to negotiate.

261
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,549
- The key players will be the leaders.
- You're right.

262
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,093
- Since that's the case--
- Hey, guys.

263
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,386
Why don't we team up?

264
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,351
We thought the team that went first
would have an undeniable advantage.

265
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,895
That's why we wanted
to go with Team KAIST.

266
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,022
- Wait.
- Hold on.

267
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:19,526
- But the rules--
- Let's go to them first.

268
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:24,155
We thought Team KAIST would have the edge
because of their benefit.

269
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,616
We saw going first
as a definite advantage.

270
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,411
That's why we sought
an alliance with Team KAIST.

271
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,331
ALL 3 TEAMS GATHER AROUND TEAM KAIST

272
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:37,794
A situation like this never occurred to us
when we were faced with the Deathmatches.

273
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,963
So, it felt really good.

274
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,383
Does anyone have a strategy to propose?

275
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,011
We don't know where the other team
would place their pieces,

276
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,596
so it's not easy to come up with one
right off the bat.

277
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,016
I actually have a couple of ideas.

278
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,602
Please consider our position.
What if we disclosed our plans and...

279
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,480
Right. We might end up on different teams.

280
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,524
- Things might fall through.
- We won't ask for details.

281
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,859
But we do have some ideas.

282
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,112
In some ways, this is a pathfinding game.

283
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,865
We should consider the ways
we can modify the board, our map,

284
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,408
and figure out the cells we must avoid

285
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,910
and the cells we should lure
the opponent into.

286
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,455
I think these two are the points
we must bear in mind.

287
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,668
Once the leaders decide
which piece to move,

288
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,338
the chosen piece will only have
four possible directions to take.

289
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,049
Common sense would show
that there aren't many directions to take.

290
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,925
So, the leaders' decisions
will be critical.

291
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,510
- He has a point.
- Trust us on this one.

292
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,474
Please give us a moment to talk it over.
We'll be back.

293
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,225
- The time is--
- That's a wrong approach.

294
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,728
He could cost us the game.
Let's go with Team Yonsei.

295
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,521
Four directions are plenty to choose from.

296
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,899
Being careless like that
could ruin everything.

297
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,944
Would we get less competent leaders
if we went with Team Yonsei?

298
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,907
Let's choose Team Yonsei
rather than negotiating with others.

299
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,576
- Do you want to team up?
- How about it?

300
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,455
We have the advantage
of going first, you know.

301
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,664
- Thanks.
- Let's have a good run.

302
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,083
KAIST AND YONSEI TEAM UP

303
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,252
While Team SNU had
a few outstanding star players,

304
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:06,549
we thought Team Yonsei was better,
considering their overall competence.

305
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,885
SNU AND POSTECH TEAM UP

306
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,346
- Let's do this.
- I look forward to working with you.

307
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,390
- Let's have a good run.
- All right.

308
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,393
- Whatever. Let them team up.
- Let's go there.

309
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,104
It'd be more fun
to get one of them eliminated.

310
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,313
Yeah, that's appealing.

311
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,816
If one of them gets sent home,
that'd be great.

312
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,360
EXIT STRATEGY 2, COALITIONS

313
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,446
TEAM BLACK: SNU, POSTECH
VS. TEAM WHITE: KAIST, YONSEI

314
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,408
Ji-seong has a plan for the early stages.

315
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,326
Let's hear him out.

316
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,161
First of all,

317
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,288
we must claim these two cells
next to the exit.

318
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,374
- Right.
- If we control one of them...

319
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:43,586
Then, they won't claim this spot
as it would help us exit.

320
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,048
If Team White claimed
the cell underneath the exit first,

321
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:51,052
Team Black will not
place a piece on the cell across it.

322
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,638
That is because once Team Black
places a piece there,

323
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:58,810
Team White can exit a piece
on their next turn.

324
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,980
OCCUPY CELLS ABOVE AND BELOW THE EXIT
We need to take these cells.

325
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,982
- You want the center column?
- Right.

326
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,318
Getting hold of the center column
would obviously be advantageous.

327
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,279
Here are other spots that could also help.

328
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,198
If we have a piece here,
Team Black can't utilize it.

329
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,701
I agree that this cell
is the most important one.

330
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,995
Placing a piece next to the exit
in your opponent's camp

331
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,789
can be useful to have
your team's piece exit the board.

332
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,001
Your opponent, however,
would find it difficult to utilize it.

333
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,254
It's almost impossible
to take a detour like this.

334
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,882
For Team Black to make use of White 2,

335
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,593
they would have to use
multiple turns to take a detour.

336
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,721
Team White could easily block off
Team Black in this case.

337
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,640
But reaching that point
won't be easy for us.

338
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,060
But what if
their initial placement is like this?

339
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,437
IN CASE TEAM BLACK TAKES
A FLANKING PLACEMENT

340
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,605
What if they spread out?

341
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,482
That will make things better for us.

342
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,151
If we move into them like this,
Black 1 can't do anything.

343
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,736
ABLE TO LIMIT THEIR MOVEMENTS
The same goes for this one.

344
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,905
- All they can do is move down.
- I see.

345
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,949
Once we block the middle,
those two can't move to the center.

346
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,410
It's just like in soccer.
If the midfielder is in the middle,

347
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,662
we can drive our opponents to the side
and away from the center.

348
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,831
Then, the striker can do its job
and the ball comes back down.

349
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,625
This seems to be the key location.

350
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,461
Let's play a mock game.

351
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,713
I want to point out one thing
before we begin.

352
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,882
If we have someone
on the third column from the right,

353
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,176
someone else can come home
using them as a springboard.

354
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,932
Placing one of our own in their column
will prove to be quite useful.

355
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,393
The obstacles give this row an edge.

356
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,895
If the obstacles were not in place,

357
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,690
in order for a team
to place a piece next to the exit,

358
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,900
they would need to use three pieces.

359
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,778
But thanks to the obstacles,

360
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:37,075
they would only need two pieces
to place a piece right next to the exit.

361
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:40,370
No one can come home
even if we have two cells in this column.

362
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,623
But the obstacles
make claiming this row more advantageous.

363
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,418
I think we should keep
all six pieces on the board

364
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,962
until we can have
two pieces exit together.

365
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,172
DOMINATE THE EXIT
It'd be better than leaving one by one.

366
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,967
AND BRING HOME 2 PIECES CONSECUTIVELY
That would leave us outnumbered.

367
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,387
Like I said, we should be careful
not to let them claim this cell.

368
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,556
HYEONG-SEOK GUESSES TEAM BLACK'S PLAN
They could move like this.

369
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,017
Since we'll be going first,
we should force them to go back.

370
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,060
- They'd waste a turn, then.
- Right.

371
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,063
As Team White
has the upper hand of going first,

372
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,025
they can counter Team Black
if they claim the cell next to the exit.

373
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,236
By placing White 1 across Black 1
on their next turn,

374
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:18,199
they can force Black 1 to move back
from the cell next to the exit.

375
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,826
We can force them back
and do our own thing.

376
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,038
I want you to maintain hold
on these two columns as much as possible.

377
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,331
Three connected stones are important
in winning Connect Five, right?

378
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,501
Just like that, holding on to this area
will be our foundation for victory.

379
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:29,878
Here's what I think.

380
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:34,466
I don't want our pieces
in any of these four cells.

381
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,596
- Because Team Black could exploit them?
- Exactly.

382
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,684
PIECES ON DIAGONAL LINES FROM THE EXIT
CAN BECOME A STEPPING STONE

383
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,811
Avoid these two cells as much as you can.

384
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,606
You never know.
Let's not use these two diagonal cells.

385
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,108
I drew up the board for reference.

386
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,986
Cells marked with a circle
are the ones we can benefit from.

387
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,821
Claim them if you can get there.

388
00:19:56,905 --> 00:20:00,075
Occupy the triangles if they're open,
but avoid them if they're not.

389
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,785
Lastly, avoid cells marked with an X.

390
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:05,622
You might have to wing it out there
with this as our baseline.

391
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,167
TEAM BLACK IS PLAYING A MOCK GAME
Blocked. We could place this here.

392
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,336
If we occupy here...

393
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:15,757
UNLIKE TEAM WHITE, TEAM BLACK WANTS
THE CELLS DIAGONAL FROM THE EXIT

394
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,470
Then, we can use Jun-hyeong's trick
by moving Black 5 around like this.

395
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,930
We should have moved the 5.

396
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:26,685
Create a window shape first
and have another piece approach it?

397
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:31,314
- That's a window.
- Team White can't do anything about it.

398
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:36,194
Rather than looking for ways
to exploit Team White's pieces,

399
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,406
we focused on moving our own pieces.

400
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,121
To bring a piece home,
we need to secure 1 of these 4 cells.

401
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,373
Let's suppose Team White
occupies most of them.

402
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,751
Then, even if we place
a piece here to make an exit,

403
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,796
we can't bring Black 1 home
because they'll move White 2 back.

404
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,464
That's why I came up with this.

405
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,550
We can always place a piece here.

406
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,886
If we can place two others
to create a window shape...

407
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,306
I proposed forming a window shape.

408
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,685
The window shape is
one of the common formations in Go.

409
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:09,811
Once we have that setup,

410
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:13,398
we can bring one of our pieces home
by having them go around.

411
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,400
We saw it as the best option

412
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,528
that wouldn't require any pieces
to be placed in the central row.

413
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,196
WINDOW SHAPE STRATEGY

414
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,407
USING A WINDOW SHAPE FORMATION
TO FIND A WAY TO THE EXIT

415
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,242
WITHOUT MAKING USE
OF THE OPPONENT'S PIECES

416
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,202
Using that strategy could be useful.

417
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,455
It could also work as a barrier
against Team White's attack.

418
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:32,500
In summary, our priority
is forming a window in the center.

419
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:36,171
The players can figure out
offensive moves from the board.

420
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:37,672
It'll be easy to see a way to the exit,

421
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,758
but not the placement
that can benefit Team Black.

422
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,719
- They have to be careful.
- So, I think the leaders' responsibility

423
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,138
is to find moves that can't be exploited.

424
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,806
If you think you might cost us the game,

425
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,892
speak and get eliminated.

426
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,728
If you think Team White
could use you to exit the board,

427
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,438
stay still for the whole minute.

428
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,273
- So we can get kicked out?
- Point them out.

429
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,901
But that would put us
at a disadvantage moving forward.

430
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,486
I'll use a timeout if it happens.

431
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,571
We have to use one in that case.

432
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,450
You have three minutes left.

433
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,619
We're running out of time,
so let's choose the leaders.

434
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:08,828
Okay, let's do that.

435
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,164
- What do you think, Team Yonsei?
- Well...

436
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,751
I would love to be one,

437
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,504
but I'm not really sure if I should.

438
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,923
What about you, Team KAIST?
Do two of you want to try it?

439
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,258
- I wouldn't mind playing either role.
- Me neither.

440
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,804
Well, is there anyone
who definitely wants to play as a piece?

441
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,307
I think we'd need a daring player outside.

442
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,893
- Right, we'd need a joker of sorts.
- Exactly.

443
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,729
I think Gi-hyeon could come up with moves
the leaders might miss.

444
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,064
Play as a piece, Gi-hyeon.

445
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,441
We could use a calm person
like Gi-hyeon out there.

446
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,403
- Do you want to be my partner?
- As the leader?

447
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,197
I need someone else
to read the board with me.

448
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,574
I personally think

449
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:51,204
that I have an edge in figuring out
the optimal move in a short time.

450
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,707
But the problem is
I also make errors often.

451
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,126
That's why I thought
I shouldn't play as a piece.

452
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,753
I thought I could contribute more
by finding out great moves

453
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:01,172
and having a partner
who can cover for my mistakes.

454
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,967
So, I asked Hyeong-seok
if he would be a leader with me.

455
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,595
I felt confident
about playing either role.

456
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,975
Seung-chan suggested that I join him
after volunteering to be a leader,

457
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,227
so I accepted his proposal.

458
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:15,770
TEAM WHITE'S LEADERS

459
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,690
YONSEI'S LEE SEUNG-CHAN
KAIST'S OH HYEONG-SEOK

460
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,608
Who wants to play the leader?

461
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,193
Me.

462
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,949
My strengths are
quick judgments and high adaptability,

463
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:31,578
which could be more useful
if I took the leader's role.

464
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,873
I believe I'm good at
quickly analyzing moves.

465
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:38,668
That's why I felt confident
about working on the strategy.

466
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,003
TEAM BLACK'S LEADERS

467
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,922
SNU'S CHO JUN-HYEONG
POSTECH'S JEON JI-SEONG

468
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:46,051
The time for the strategy meeting is up.

469
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:51,639
All teams. Please gather
in the Main Hall for the main match.

470
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:02,359
- Let's go, KAIST and Yonsei!
- Let's go!

471
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,028
- Let's go, SNU and POSTECH!
- Let's go, SNU and POSTECH!

472
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,906
Remember to keep silent once you go out.

473
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,115
Don't even say a word.

474
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,453
- Guys, please make reasonable decisions.
- Okay.

475
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,334
We'll now begin the main match,
Exit Strategy 2.

476
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,676
It seemed like a piece of cake.

477
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,555
I felt confident about our chances
because we had the benefit.

478
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:37,227
The two leaders of each team,
please return to your base camps.

479
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,020
- Let's do this.
- Let's have a good game.

480
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,946
Pieces of both teams,
please take your positions.

481
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,074
WHITE 1, KAIST'S YU-CHAN

482
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,326
BLACK 1, SNU'S GYU-MIN

483
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,120
WHITE 2, YONSEI'S JEONG-HUN
BLACK 2, SNU'S SU-HAN

484
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:58,331
WHITE 3, YONSEI'S SE-HWAN
BLACK 3, SNU'S JUN-HYEONG

485
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,792
WHITE 4, KAIST'S GI-HYEON
BLACK 4, POSTECH'S MIN-SU

486
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,420
WHITE 5, YONSEI'S HYEON-SEUNG
BLACK 5, POSTECH'S JU-YEONG

487
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:05,880
BLACK 6, POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON

488
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,508
WHITE 6, KAIST'S JI-SEONG

489
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,010
ALL PIECES ARE SET FOR ROUND 1

490
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,096
TEAM WHITE, TEAM BLACK

491
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,890
They must be aiming
to take this cell, too.

492
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:19,060
I think their strategy is similar
to our first one.

493
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,522
They must be planning
to move this piece to here.

494
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:27,777
But what's with this placement?
White 3 seems so out of place here.

495
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,864
We're going to win
if we can take the center.

496
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:36,703
We'll now begin Round 1
of the main match, Exit Strategy 2.

497
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:43,668
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

498
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:46,880
Let's wait until the 10-second warning.

499
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,923
Let's say White 4 moved here

500
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,051
and they moved Black 5 to this spot.

501
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,345
TEAM WHITE'S SPECULATIONS

502
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,637
Black 1 might get called, too.

503
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,223
Come to think of it, they'll think
our placement is great for them,

504
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,267
seeing White 2 and White 6
facing each other.

505
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:02,437
Let's say White 4 and Black 5 moved.
Should White 6 move away?

506
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,647
You have 30 seconds left.

507
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,901
- He'd better step back.
- But it'd be bad if Black 4 moves left.

508
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,278
TEAM WHITE THINKS AHEAD
How about this?

509
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,906
TO PREDICT TEAM BLACK'S MOVES
This guy will come here.

510
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,700
We're down to 10 seconds.
I'll press number 4.

511
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:19,120
Number 4 at 10 seconds,
and we're almost certain about Black 5.

512
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,581
White 4, please make your move.

513
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:22,791
KAIST'S GI-HYEON

514
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,088
He'll come home on his next turn.
What do we do?

515
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:32,384
I think it'd be best
if we countered with Black 4.

516
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,552
They'd probably stall too, right?

517
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,805
Let's not give Team White
much time to consider.

518
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:37,972
- I'll press 4 now.
- Okay.

519
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,018
UNLIKE TEAM WHITE,
TEAM BLACK MOVES QUICKLY

520
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,105
Black 4, please make your move.

521
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,114
- Wait, did he just move back?
- Yeah, right here.

522
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,741
- Here? Leaving this spot open for us?
- I know.

523
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,411
What are they thinking about?

524
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:03,039
Keeping Black 4 here is as good
as giving us this cell next to the exit.

525
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,292
I like our chances.
I don't think they came prepared.

526
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,796
White 4, please make your move.

527
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:16,636
Let's place Black 3 here.

528
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,681
- Shall I call Black 3 right away?
- Go ahead.

529
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,143
Black 3, please make your move.

530
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:25,729
He'll get it.

531
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,022
I'm sure Jun-hyeong gets it.

532
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,982
He will see
that we're making a window shape.

533
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:38,658
TEAM BLACK'S WINDOW SHAPE

534
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:42,245
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

535
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,582
Have they lost it? I mean, wait.

536
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:46,875
- Look at White 2.
- Hold on.

537
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,626
I'm sure they don't have a clever plan.

538
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,754
- We'll have White 2 move here.
- And that's it.

539
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,964
Yeah, they made things easier for us.

540
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:58,386
The window shape strategy
has a fatal flaw.

541
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,139
The flaw is that the opponent
can use your piece

542
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:04,476
and exit the board ahead of your pieces.

543
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,603
Here's what we should consider now.

544
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,147
Wait, White 2 can go here.

545
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:13,568
Damn it.

546
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:17,739
We'll have White 2 go here.
How would they counter that?

547
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,866
They wouldn't think
we'd bring White 4 home.

548
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,576
They'd be fools, then.

549
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:24,746
If they move White 2 to bring him home,

550
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,040
- ...30 seconds left.
- we'll do the same with Black 1.

551
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,583
But this cell is empty.

552
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:33,630
TEAM BLACK CAN'T TAKE
ANY DEFENSIVE OR OFFENSIVE MOVES

553
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:36,716
White 2, please make your move.

554
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,009
YONSEI'S JEONG-HUN

555
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:41,304
It's basically over.
We can just call White 2 again.

556
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:47,686
I was nervous because I saw
that a tiny mistake could end the game.

557
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,271
We didn't fully comprehend
the placement of the pieces.

558
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:51,773
In turn, we missed the fact

559
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:55,068
that Team White could exit sooner
while we were making the window shape.

560
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:59,447
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

561
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,449
Hold on. What do we want to do next?

562
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,869
- Move Black 1, right?
- I think this would be a better move.

563
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:07,831
Will that be okay?

564
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,960
They haven't stalled so far,
so that's not part of their plan.

565
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:15,505
Seeing how it's taking so long,
they must be panicking.

566
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,091
Okay, let's go with Black 1.

567
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:21,553
- Won't this route be better, though?
- But we don't get to decide that.

568
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:23,430
We can only choose
which pieces are able to move.

569
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:27,058
Black 1, please make your move.

570
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:32,522
BLACK 1, SNU'S GYU-MIN, IS CALLED TO MOVE

571
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:36,401
Black 1 is having trouble
deciding which way to go.

572
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:48,038
- This one can come home.
- Let's think about what comes next.

573
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,498
- We'd need another piece back here.
- Right.

574
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:53,335
Black 3 is blocking the way.

575
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:57,005
We don't have that many promising routes.

576
00:29:57,088 --> 00:30:00,633
But if Black 3 holds his position here...

577
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,427
- You have ten seconds left.
- This is it.

578
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,678
- Press it.
- Let's do this.

579
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:06,556
White 2, please make your move.

580
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,726
TEAM WHITE: 1, TEAM BLACK: 0

581
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:13,229
Team White's first piece
has exited the board.

582
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,277
We had the perk of going first,

583
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,863
but I didn't think
we could execute an exit so quickly.

584
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:27,911
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

585
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:30,747
- What if they...
- I can't tell what they'll do next.

586
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:36,002
How's this? They might have Black 6
move into our camp.

587
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:37,587
But we could block him with White 3.

588
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,130
- But--
- They'd bring Black 1 home, then.

589
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:41,591
Let's have Black 6 right next to White 4.

590
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:44,177
- That could work.
- It's our only option.

591
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,681
BLACK 6, POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON,
IS CALLED TO MOVE

592
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:54,145
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

593
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,814
Shall we block Black 3's side?

594
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,982
- No, then he'd exit the board.
- We can't do that.

595
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,736
- Shall we have White 1 come up?
- Or have him go to Black 2.

596
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,447
- No, that'd open up a path for Black 4.
- I see.

597
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,908
- But this cell is unoccupied.
- Oh, right.

598
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,160
But having Black 4 here in itself
isn't good for us.

599
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:12,247
No, so let's have White 1 line up here.

600
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,957
Would Yu-chan do what we want?

601
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,836
White 1, please make your move.

602
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,380
We'll be fine
as long as he doesn't move forward.

603
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:23,591
That could make things
slightly precarious for us.

604
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,802
When I was called to move,

605
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,430
I had to make a decision
while considering the next moves.

606
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:32,100
I could only hope what I had in mind
was what the leaders wanted me to do.

607
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:36,521
He's moving forward.

608
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:37,981
TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION FAILS

609
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,024
It's all right.

610
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:42,110
Here's the thing.
We were hoping Black 6 would move.

611
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:44,487
- But now, Black 4 might move.
- That's true.

612
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,657
Don't you think Black 4 will move
to take this cell?

613
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:51,327
BLACK 4 CAN TAKE THE CELL BELOW THE EXIT

614
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,374
Shall we position Black 1 here?

615
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,127
Black 1, it is.

616
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,548
He won't approach White 6

617
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:06,760
- if he has any sense.
- Black 1, please make your move.

618
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:13,725
One of Team White's pieces
was blocking my path then.

619
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:16,936
None of the other routes
seemed very meaningful.

620
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,148
In fact, all of them seemed
to open up possibilities for Team White.

621
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:25,445
That was when I first thought
that something was off.

622
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,157
TEAM BLACK'S GAME BOARD

623
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,161
TEAM BLACK'S LEADERS
MISTOOK BLACK 1'S POSITION

624
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:41,795
BLACK 1 COMPLETES HIS MOVE

625
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:45,423
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

626
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,177
Why is Black 1 not positioned
on the same row as Black 3?

627
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:51,096
Black 1 is over here.

628
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,890
Oh, so that's where he was.

629
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,478
We weren't in the Main Hall
to observe the game in person,

630
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:01,356
and that led to the mistake
of misplacing our game piece.

631
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:05,068
TEAM BLACK BELATEDLY REALIZES THE MISTAKE

632
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:08,863
Hold on. I just don't understand them.

633
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,865
Let's say Black 4 comes here.

634
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,035
Even then, that works for us.

635
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,286
- Let's move White 3.
- Okay.

636
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,956
And is this where White 3 is now?

637
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:21,501
White 3, please make your move.

638
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:26,047
WHITE 3, YONSEI'S SE-HWAN,
IS CALLED TO MOVE

639
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:31,886
TEAM WHITE POSITIONED BY THE EXIT

640
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,348
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

641
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,395
We've messed up.

642
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:43,189
We came up with a strategy,

643
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:46,943
but we couldn't find ways to revise it
after we realized our mistake.

644
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,868
I don't see any moves
that could be helpful to them.

645
00:33:57,537 --> 00:34:01,750
We could try outnumbering them.
Should we have Black 5 go around?

646
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,209
Okay.

647
00:34:04,753 --> 00:34:06,671
Let me check Black 5's position.

648
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:07,922
He's all alone.

649
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:11,676
Black 5, please make your move.

650
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,677
POSTECH'S JU-YEONG

651
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,262
And where could he go?

652
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:25,190
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

653
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:27,484
Let's call White 6.

654
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:29,319
How about we call a timeout before that?

655
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:31,279
Yes. I think that would be better.

656
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,700
Team White requested a timeout.

657
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,828
You'll be given five minutes.

658
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:43,375
The game's almost over.

659
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,336
It's over, right?

660
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,171
This is just for precaution.

661
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,631
I'll break it down for you.

662
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:52,175
- We wanted to play it safe.
- You'll be given five minutes.

663
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:57,305
Once White 6 makes his move,
White 1 can come home in 2 turns.

664
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,433
Moving White 6
is the right call and our best choice.

665
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,644
We only requested the timeout
to wrap things up.

666
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,646
Just to avoid any mistakes.

667
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:07,982
All others, stay put. Once White 6 moves
and White 1 leaves, it's over.

668
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,823
Have we arranged the pieces correctly?

669
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:17,784
LEADERS EXPLAIN THEIR MISTAKE
We thought Black 1 was here.

670
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,994
I shouldn't have been called
at the second time.

671
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:22,288
- So, you mistook my position.
- So that's what happened.

672
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:23,873
- Damn it.
- I was confused...

673
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:26,459
This route for White 1
can be done very fast.

674
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,170
In that case,
we should have Black 3 cut him off.

675
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,881
But even if we did that,
they could move White 5.

676
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:33,633
That's it for us.

677
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:35,343
IT IS TOO LATE TO MAKE A COMEBACK

678
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:38,138
I can guarantee that Team White
will have White 1 go here.

679
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:42,434
Once he gets here, it's over.
We should move Black 3 on our next turn.

680
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:43,727
You want Black 3 there?

681
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,687
Then, we'll draw Black 2 to his side.

682
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:48,189
Here's what we need to focus on.

683
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,108
We have to stop White 6.

684
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:54,612
But we have to assume
that they'll move White 1.

685
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,865
JI-SEONG IS CONVINCED
THAT WHITE 1 WILL MOVE

686
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:59,492
- Your time is up.
- Then we can't move Black 5.

687
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:01,953
Your time is up.

688
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,455
The game will be resumed.

689
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:04,372
TIMEOUT ENDS

690
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,043
Please return to your previous positions.

691
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:11,504
Block White 6 with Black 3. Got it.

692
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:12,881
White 6?

693
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,216
Is this it? Shouldn't you go out?

694
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,176
Do we have it right?

695
00:36:16,259 --> 00:36:18,219
- Are we good? Did you get the plan?
- I got it.

696
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:22,057
We'll be unstoppable
after claiming the two key cells.

697
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:23,850
Good luck out there!

698
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,102
Let's go!

699
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,481
- We can't talk out there.
- Check your positions.

700
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:32,901
The game will be resumed.

701
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:35,278
Please return to your previous positions.

702
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:43,119
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

703
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,537
White 1?

704
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,457
We're sure to win

705
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:50,710
unless Ji-seong or Yu-chan speaks,
or we press the wrong button.

706
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,629
White 6, please make your move.

707
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:56,216
White 6, please make your move.

708
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:03,932
CONTRARY TO TEAM BLACK'S PREDICTION,
TEAM WHITE CALLED WHITE 6 TO MOVE

709
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:08,728
What was that about?

710
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,607
He moved here.

711
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:15,402
They're bringing White 1 home right after.

712
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:18,947
Let's counter with Black 2.

713
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,326
But they can still end the game
with White 1.

714
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,994
Should we have Black 3 retreat?

715
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,830
No, we can't do that.

716
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:27,831
But having him here...

717
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:30,458
TEAM BLACK HAS NO MOVES
TO TURN THINGS AROUND

718
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:31,626
No.

719
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,879
- We lost.
- Yeah, we're done.

720
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:39,467
- Press number one.
- Yeah, it's just...

721
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:41,636
Actually, I'm a little scared.

722
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,597
But they can't have a secret ace
up their sleeves now.

723
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,057
Of course not. Press the button.

724
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,059
- Take a leap of faith.
- All right.

725
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:50,979
White 1, please make your move.

726
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:01,573
TEAM BLACK CAN'T MAKE ANY DEFENSIVE MOVES

727
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,241
Moving Black 3 was a huge mistake.

728
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:06,119
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

729
00:38:10,498 --> 00:38:13,585
Black 2, please make your move.

730
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:21,676
White 1, please make your move.

731
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:29,392
Team White's second piece
has exited the board.

732
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,686
It was exhilarating.

733
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,856
But I knew we had to win 2 out of 3 games,

734
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:37,942
so I thought I should be focused
on winning the next match.

735
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:46,242
I was saddened by the defeat.

736
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,703
But it served as a wake-up call

737
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:51,539
reminding me that we could get
eliminated at any moment.

738
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:54,125
We just outclassed them.

739
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,336
We could've taken them
even if we hadn't gone first.

740
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:59,881
That concludes Round 1 of Exit Strategy 2.

741
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:02,384
The first round goes to Team White.

742
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,055
KAIST and Yonsei are a great team.

743
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:09,683
It wouldn't have been easy for us
to take your team down.

744
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:12,143
Let's work on strategies for going second.

745
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,232
Both teams,
please return to your base camps.

746
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:22,028
Our fate was sealed
when Black 3 was called to move.

747
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,030
- Let's forget about the loss.
- Right.

748
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,908
- Do you remember their placement?
- I do.

749
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,411
Let's try to analyze it from that.

750
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,663
These were positioned symmetrically.

751
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:36,001
We were wrong to take
a symmetrical arrangement.

752
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:41,840
We were complacent
with our initial placement.

753
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:45,677
We only realized the importance
of certain cells during the game, too.

754
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:50,098
I think we didn't have enough time
during the strategy meeting.

755
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,979
TEAM BLACK HAS TROUBLE
COMING UP WITH A NEW STRATEGY

756
00:39:57,063 --> 00:40:00,900
Let's try moving pieces around.
You know that's the only way to crack it.

757
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:02,694
They can't move this one.

758
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:04,863
Moving this led to our defeat earlier.

759
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:09,409
We went second in Round 1,
so we prepared our strategy accordingly.

760
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:12,245
Next, we had to quickly come up
with a strategy to go first.

761
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:15,165
We need a strategy for going first.

762
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,668
Let's think of a new strategy.
Don't get too excited.

763
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:21,421
It's not over yet,
so let's stay focused for a little more.

764
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,340
We won that round thanks to our strategy.

765
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:26,301
So let's come up
with another good one for going second.

766
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:28,303
We won the first round so easily,

767
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:30,930
and that led us to think
that we would take the second round

768
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,932
with another excellent strategy.

769
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:36,102
Claiming this cell
might have left an impression on them.

770
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,480
They could try to claim
this row in the center next time.

771
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:40,190
We'll need a contingency plan

772
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:43,485
to prevent their further action
if they claim these cells first.

773
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:44,986
COUNTERMEASURES ARE NEEDED

774
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,031
There are rows and columns
on the board, right?

775
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:51,826
We need obstacles or pieces there
to score points.

776
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,288
The team that went first decided
the direction the game would take.

777
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,749
That was why we obsessed
over the placement of the pieces.

778
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:01,544
Since we're going second,
we should try to claim this column.

779
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,130
If you want to claim the central column,

780
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:09,302
these two shouldn't be side by side.
They need to be on different rows, then.

781
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,429
We should change their placements.

782
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:12,597
- Shall we change it?
- Yes.

783
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:14,766
TEAM WHITE ADAPTS TO GOING 2ND
Let's change it.

784
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:16,434
1ST ROUND PLACEMENT, 2ND ROUND PLACEMENT

785
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:20,939
PLACEMENT ADJUSTED
IN ANTICIPATION OF TEAM BLACK'S 1ST MOVE

786
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:24,693
- Do we agree this is the best setup?
- For going second, yes.

787
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:29,739
You have five minutes left.

788
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,158
During the strategy meeting,

789
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:37,539
you must appoint 2 members as leaders
and decide the placement of your 6 pieces.

790
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:40,000
- Should we or shouldn't we change it?
- How about a change?

791
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,543
Should we change the leaders?

792
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:42,752
What do you think?

793
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,963
I won't mind a change.

794
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,804
- Can I try it?
- Sure.

795
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:53,722
Go for it.

796
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:57,225
Su-han is also a seasoned chess player,

797
00:41:57,308 --> 00:42:00,478
so I did not doubt his skills
in analyzing moves.

798
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:03,356
SNU'S JUN-HYEONNG PASSES
THE LEADER TITLE TO SNU'S SU-HAN

799
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,483
We'll go with Ji-seong and Su-han.

800
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:09,988
- Let's win this round at all costs.
- Of course. We can't afford to lose now.

801
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:12,365
Guys, the game isn't over yet.

802
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:15,618
TEAM WHITE KEEPS THE SAME LEADERS
FOR ROUND 2

803
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,621
You just have to focus on your moves,
so it'll be much easier.

804
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,331
We thought the leaders did a fine job.

805
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:25,045
That's why we wanted them
to take charge again in the second round.

806
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:28,840
Let's do another chant.
When I finish my line, shout, "Let's go!"

807
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:32,761
- Let's go, KAIST and Yonsei!
- Let's go!

808
00:42:32,844 --> 00:42:35,055
- Let's go, SNU and POSTECH!
- Let's go, SNU and POSTECH!

809
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:40,435
We'll now begin Round 2
of Exit Strategy 2.

810
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:47,901
The two leaders of each team,
please return to your base camps.

811
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,159
Su-han is their leader now.

812
00:42:56,242 --> 00:42:58,620
But that won't make a difference.

813
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:01,289
I think we're better
than Team Black's leaders.

814
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:03,917
Let's set our eyes on winning this round.

815
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:08,963
Pieces from both teams will now take
their positions on the board.

816
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:11,007
WHITE 1, KAIST'S YU-CHAN
BLACK 1, SNU'S GYU-MIN

817
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,259
WHITE 2, YONSEI'S JEONG-HUN
BLACK 2, SNU'S JUN-HYEONG

818
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:15,595
WHITE 3, YONSEI'S SE-HWAN
BLACK 3, SNU'S JUN-HYEONG

819
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,764
WHITE 4, KAIST'S GI-HYEON
BLACK 4, POSTECH'S MIN-SU

820
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:19,891
WHITE 5, YONSEI'S HYEON-SEUNG
BLACK 5, POSTECH'S JU-YEONG

821
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:22,435
White 6 and Black 6,
please enter the board.

822
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:25,814
BLACK 6, POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON

823
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:27,190
What?

824
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:35,824
4 PIECES FROM TEAM BLACK
ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN A CORNER

825
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:38,076
They're huddled together, I see.

826
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:41,037
This idea is the GOAT, if I say so myself.

827
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:42,497
It's out of this world.

828
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,501
We can take the game by ourselves
regardless of their gameplay.

829
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:49,546
I can't think of anything
that can defend against this.

830
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:51,631
TEAM BLACK'S STRATEGY MEETING

831
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,134
Hold on. Why don't we try this?

832
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:56,469
Here's a plan to bring two pieces home
using our pieces only.

833
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:57,762
Early on,

834
00:43:57,846 --> 00:44:00,140
let's use this formation
and have these two move around.

835
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:02,559
- It's not bad, right?
- Just a minute.

836
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:03,852
- It's good, right?
- Yeah!

837
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:06,479
I came up with the strategy
for the second round.

838
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:09,774
If we could claim the cell
next to the exit in Team White's camp,

839
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:12,694
these two can use our own pieces

840
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:16,114
and have two pieces
take the exit without fail.

841
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:18,283
The key point of Team Black's strategy

842
00:44:18,366 --> 00:44:21,494
is that they only need their own pieces
to exit the board.

843
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:24,914
By reducing their dependency
on the variability of Team White's pieces,

844
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:29,461
they can safely use their own pieces
to move two of their pieces to the exit.

845
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:32,797
This will increase
their chances of winning the match.

846
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,216
It's such a good plan.

847
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,260
We need to think
of a way to defend against it now.

848
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,514
We'll now begin Round 2
of Exit Strategy 2.

849
00:44:41,848 --> 00:44:45,268
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

850
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,103
We'll move Black 4, right?

851
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:48,605
Right off the bat?

852
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:50,607
- Let's not overthink this.
- Black 4. Okay.

853
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:54,194
Black 4, please make your move.

854
00:44:54,277 --> 00:44:55,111
POSTECH'S MIN-SU

855
00:44:57,238 --> 00:44:59,699
TEAM BLACK MOVES AS PLANNED
TO TAKE THE CENTRAL ROW

856
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:03,203
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

857
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:04,704
How about moving White 5 forward?

858
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:07,707
For Black 4 to come home,
they need our piece here.

859
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,751
Without it, Black 4 can't do anything.

860
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,171
Don't press anything yet.
Suppose White 5 went there.

861
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:14,297
What would they do then?

862
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,590
UNAWARE OF TEAM BLACK'S PLAN

863
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:17,300
Let's say Black 2 moves next.

864
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,344
Let's send White 4 next to that.

865
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:20,679
- White 4?
- Yeah.

866
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:23,473
Black 2 won't trouble us, then.
Press number 5 with 10 seconds left.

867
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:24,891
You have ten seconds left.

868
00:45:26,184 --> 00:45:28,603
White 5, please make your move.

869
00:45:29,854 --> 00:45:33,608
WHITE 5, YONSEI'S HYEON-SEUNG,
IS CALLED TO MOVE

870
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:41,950
Shall we put Black 4 into position?

871
00:45:43,284 --> 00:45:45,203
Or should we move Black 2 first?

872
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:48,748
If we moved Black 4 first,
White 4 could get in our way.

873
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:52,627
- Let's move Black 2, then.
- I think that would be better.

874
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,756
Black 2, please make your move.

875
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,550
BLACK 2, SNU'S JUN-HYEONG,
IS CALLED TO MOVE

876
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:03,680
- ...to make a move.
- Move White 4.

877
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:05,348
- Then--
- That's the right call.

878
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,475
Then, White 5 or White 4
could keep Black 2 in check.

879
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,601
MOVE WHITE 4 NEXT TO BLACK 2

880
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:11,521
White 4, please make your move.

881
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:12,439
KAIST'S GI-HYEON

882
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:17,152
Hold on. Black 2 is...

883
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:20,447
Wait, what?

884
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,490
- Black 2 was here.
- He went there.

885
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:26,578
- Wait, we made a mistake.
- Yeah.

886
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:28,413
We were so sure he would've moved forward.

887
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,208
- He'll move forward. That's for sure.
- Black 2, please make your move.

888
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:34,085
That's for sure.

889
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:36,087
- White 4 is our counter, right?
- Yeah.

890
00:46:36,171 --> 00:46:37,881
HYEONG-SEOK MISPLACED BLACK 2

891
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:44,304
TEAM WHITE PLACED BLACK 2 IN A WRONG SPOT

892
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:47,182
White 4 moves forward.

893
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,725
Hold on. We've messed up.

894
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,813
WHITE 4, GI-HYEON, IS MOVED BY ACCIDENT

895
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:55,607
Here comes White 4.

896
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:57,400
Shall we move Black 4?

897
00:46:57,484 --> 00:46:59,903
What could they do
if we scored a point quickly?

898
00:46:59,986 --> 00:47:02,572
Nothing much. Let's go with Black 4.

899
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:05,575
Black 4, please make your move.

900
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,292
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

901
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:15,627
TEAM BLACK HOLDS THE CENTRAL ROW

902
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:18,672
- What good comes out of that?
- Oh, I see what their goal is.

903
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:20,465
- They'll try this, right?
- Yeah.

904
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:23,968
BLACK 6 CAN EXIT THE BOARD IN 4 TURNS

905
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:28,348
But isn't it our turn first?
They'll move like this.

906
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:31,643
Then they'd need multiple turns,
but White 3 can come home in 3 turns.

907
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:33,144
Let's move White 3 to here.

908
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,398
White 3, please make your move.

909
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:44,364
- Did they call White 3? Why?
- Yeah.

910
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:46,157
Is this what they're going for?

911
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:48,159
They'd score faster than us.

912
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:50,161
Shall we request a timeout?

913
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:52,455
- All right.
- Let's use a timeout.

914
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:57,085
Team Black requested a timeout.

915
00:47:57,794 --> 00:47:59,963
- That will give us a timeout, too.
- Right.

916
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,633
- Let's come clean and apologize.
- Of course.

917
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,719
- We should tell them we missed it.
- Yeah.

918
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:08,346
You'll be given five minutes.

919
00:48:09,514 --> 00:48:10,348
Come on in.

920
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:12,183
- We could lose in four turns.
- What?

921
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:13,476
It's over in four turns.

922
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:16,646
It's over in four turns.

923
00:48:17,188 --> 00:48:19,774
- Walk us through it, Gi-hyeon.
- Judging by where we're at,

924
00:48:20,483 --> 00:48:22,652
they could take the game in four turns.

925
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:25,447
2 OF TEAM BLACK'S PIECES
CAN EXIT THE BOARD IN 4 TURNS

926
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:29,451
They will score 2 points in 4 turns
while we can only score 1.

927
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:32,620
What if they move White 4 to cut us off?

928
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:35,040
White 4 would go here. Then...

929
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:37,375
Our only option is to bring Black 2 home.

930
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:39,377
Then, White 4 could move back.

931
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:42,047
This would be the biggest game changer.
Let's think about this.

932
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:48,720
So, if White 4 goes here,

933
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:51,848
we would bring Black 2 home,
and White 4 could move back.

934
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:55,810
BLACK 1 AND BLACK 6
CAN'T ACCESS THE CENTRAL ROW

935
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:59,481
This is the best Team White could do.
Let's see if we can still win.

936
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:02,692
Your time is up.

937
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:04,778
The game will be resumed.

938
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:08,782
BLACK 2 WILL MOVE AS PLANNED

939
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:13,244
Black 2, please make your move.

940
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:22,629
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

941
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,383
White 4, please make your move.

942
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:28,510
WHITE 4, KAIST'S GI-HYEON,
IS CALLED TO MOVE

943
00:49:35,725 --> 00:49:38,478
GI-HYEON MOVES UP
AGAINST TEAM BLACK'S PREDICTION

944
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:47,070
I have to get out of the way.
Otherwise, we'll lose.

945
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:51,282
They will score 2 points in 4 turns
while we can only score 1.

946
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:53,910
They'll move like this
to exit two pieces in a row.

947
00:49:53,993 --> 00:49:56,079
2 OF TEAM BLACK'S PIECES
CAN EXIT THE BOARD IN 4 TURNS

948
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:57,706
Once Black 2 moves across,

949
00:49:58,331 --> 00:49:59,624
White 4 has to step away.

950
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:02,627
THIS MOVE PREVENTS BLACK 3
FROM STOPPING ON THE CENTRAL ROW

951
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:04,713
Think about the variables
and call the right numbers.

952
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:05,797
There's only one way.

953
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,050
I'm so glad
that we found that White 4 move.

954
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:11,011
But White 4 is gone.

955
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:12,470
WHITE 4 MOVED UP UNEXPECTEDLY

956
00:50:12,554 --> 00:50:14,014
What can we do now?

957
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,850
You have ten seconds left.

958
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:18,226
Let's move Black 1.

959
00:50:19,602 --> 00:50:21,479
We only considered White 4
acting as an obstacle.

960
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:22,856
TEAM BLACK DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING

961
00:50:22,939 --> 00:50:26,192
Black 1, please make your move.

962
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:31,573
Let's bring White 2 home.

963
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:33,783
Should we call it quickly?

964
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:36,202
- Shall I call White 2?
- Yeah, do it.

965
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:39,664
Jeong-hun has back pains.
Let's give him time to rest.

966
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,999
You have a point.

967
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:45,128
White 2, please make your move.

968
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:47,380
Is he going to go around
and exit the board?

969
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:48,798
That came out of nowhere.

970
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:53,470
Here is the scenario for Team Black
to have their two pieces exit the board.

971
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:57,015
Black 6 requires 3 turns,
and Black 1 requires 4 turns.

972
00:50:57,098 --> 00:50:59,100
In total, they need seven turns.

973
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:00,810
Team White, on the other hand,

974
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:04,814
only requires 1 turn for White 2
and 3 turns for White 3.

975
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:07,650
In summary,
they can finish the game in 4 turns.

976
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:10,195
- Who came up with this move? Gi-hyeon?
- Yeah.

977
00:51:10,278 --> 00:51:12,238
- That's insane.
- Things worked out so well

978
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:15,075
because the whole team
kept thinking about the best moves.

979
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:17,911
They might try to use White 3,

980
00:51:17,994 --> 00:51:20,121
- so let's call Black 4.
- Would he know to move up?

981
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:22,290
USES BLACK 4 FOR DEFENSE
He'd notice that route, right?

982
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:23,333
I'm sure he will.

983
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,336
That White 4 move was totally insane.

984
00:51:26,419 --> 00:51:28,046
You need to quickly come up with a plan.

985
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:31,007
Black 4, please make your move.

986
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:32,175
POSTECH'S MIN-SU

987
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:39,683
Should we have White 2 exit the board
or explore other avenues?

988
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:41,685
Give me a second. I'll think about it.

989
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:44,479
If they bring White 2 home,
we can have Black 4 take his place

990
00:51:44,562 --> 00:51:46,356
and keep him there until the end.

991
00:51:46,439 --> 00:51:48,441
Or we could force White 5 to move down.

992
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:51,027
But they can't bring White 2 home anymore.

993
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,614
They'll see that Black 4 will follow
once White 2 exits the board.

994
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:56,324
TEAM WHITE DECIDES TO EXIT WHITE 2
Shall we bring White 2 home?

995
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:57,992
- I think that's the right call.
- Me too.

996
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:01,913
White 2, please make your move.

997
00:52:08,878 --> 00:52:09,713
TEAM WHITE: 1, TEAM BLACK: 0

998
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:13,258
Team White's first piece
has exited the board.

999
00:52:13,341 --> 00:52:15,802
Losing White 4 was a huge blow.

1000
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:21,433
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

1001
00:52:21,516 --> 00:52:22,934
I bet they'll call Black 6.

1002
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:24,978
That's their only option.
But what about Black 4?

1003
00:52:25,061 --> 00:52:27,480
Right. Black 4 moving
could be a possibility.

1004
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:29,232
Black 4, please make your move.

1005
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,359
- To get him here, right?
- It looks that way.

1006
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:33,903
BLACK 4, POSTECH'S MIN-SU,
IS CALLED TO MOVE

1007
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,201
It could have been a landslide
if we hadn't messed up Black 2.

1008
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:41,911
It's such a shame.

1009
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:44,956
We shouldn't have moved Black 1 earlier.

1010
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:48,585
WHITE 4'S MOVE CAUGHT TEAM BLACK OFF GUARD

1011
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:50,045
But White 4 is gone.

1012
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:51,338
Let's move Black 1.

1013
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:55,091
TEAM BLACK MADE
AN UNEXPECTED MOVE WITH BLACK 1

1014
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:59,012
We made a mistake,
thinking we'd get blocked.

1015
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:02,015
TEAM BLACK MADE AN UNNECESSARY MOVE

1016
00:53:02,932 --> 00:53:05,393
White 4, please make your move.

1017
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:09,356
White 4 will probably go here.

1018
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,860
- Let's have Black 2 exit the board.
- Right. But if White 5 moves away,

1019
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,905
the central row ends up in their hands.

1020
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:19,115
Let us revisit Team Black's strategy.

1021
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,661
They seek to have Black 1 and Black 6
exit the board using Black 2.

1022
00:53:24,537 --> 00:53:27,290
However, if White 4
moves down to the central row,

1023
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:29,542
Black 2 must exit the board.

1024
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:33,129
This would then leave
Black 1 and Black 6 at a dead end.

1025
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:37,884
That would render
Team Black's strategy useless.

1026
00:53:38,301 --> 00:53:41,262
TEAM BLACK MUST DEVISE A NEW STRATEGY

1027
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:44,766
White 4, please make your move.

1028
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:51,481
We regained control of this row.

1029
00:53:51,564 --> 00:53:53,692
TEAM WHITE RECLAIMS THE CENTRAL ROW

1030
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:56,027
There goes that row.
Let's bring Black 2 home.

1031
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:58,571
TEAM BLACK LOSES CONTROL
OF THE CENTRAL ROW

1032
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,990
How are they so good?

1033
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,327
Black 2, please make your move.

1034
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:11,626
Team Black's first piece
has exited the board.

1035
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,379
TEAM WHITE: 1, TEAM BLACK: 1

1036
00:54:14,462 --> 00:54:16,840
- They can't do much, can they?
- No, not really.

1037
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:18,633
We have the upper hand, thanks to White 4.

1038
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:20,051
He's going to stay put.

1039
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:23,054
We only need to place
one of the pieces here.

1040
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:24,973
Let's move White 5 up.

1041
00:54:25,056 --> 00:54:27,809
- Otherwise, we might lose this column.
- I agree.

1042
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:30,770
White 5, please make your move.

1043
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:33,815
TEAM BLACK EXPECTS WHITE 5 TO MOVE DOWN

1044
00:54:33,898 --> 00:54:36,818
TEAM WHITE HOPES WHITE 5 WILL GO UP
He needs to go to Black 4.

1045
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,702
WHITE 5, YONSEI'S HYEON-SEUNG, MOVES UP

1046
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:51,332
We should bring Black 6 home.
Let's take the battle to the central row.

1047
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,252
Man, how did it end up like this?

1048
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:58,006
Black 6, please make your move.

1049
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:04,471
What if they're trying
to move Black 6 like this?

1050
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:06,306
That must be their plan.

1051
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,225
- Let's have White 6 block him.
- That will do it.

1052
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:10,393
- Shall we call White 1?
- Yeah.

1053
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:12,395
DECIDES TO ATTACK WITH WHITE 1

1054
00:55:12,812 --> 00:55:15,607
White 1, please make your move.

1055
00:55:18,526 --> 00:55:20,320
Black 3 would go to Yu-chan, right?

1056
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:23,531
Sure. It'll all be over
if they don't call Black 3.

1057
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:25,992
IF TEAM BLACK CHOOSES TO MOVE
A PIECE OTHER THAN BLACK 3

1058
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:29,704
TEAM WHITE SECURES A VICTORY IN 2 TURNS

1059
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:32,624
- Shall we move Black 3?
- Of course, we have to.

1060
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,090
They must have thought
about moving Black 5.

1061
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:42,676
- We should move White 3.
- Yeah.

1062
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:44,302
DEFEND AGAINST BLACK 5
Why don't we move it now?

1063
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:46,054
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

1064
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:51,976
What are they trying to do?

1065
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,271
I honestly can't tell
what they're trying to do.

1066
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,982
Let's wait for their move
and request a timeout.

1067
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:01,653
What if Black 4 goes around?

1068
00:56:01,736 --> 00:56:04,197
It would be better for us
if Black 4 were to move here.

1069
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,532
Let's roll with that.

1070
00:56:05,615 --> 00:56:08,535
Black 4, please make your move.

1071
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,497
TEAM WHITE NOTICED TEAM BLACK'S PLAN
That's all they've got.

1072
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,582
We discussed that earlier, right?

1073
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:15,917
Wait until the 30-second warning.

1074
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:18,795
Suppose we move White 3.
Then, Black 4 comes here.

1075
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:20,505
You have 30 seconds left.

1076
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:21,673
We can't do that.

1077
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:25,677
- Shall we request a timeout?
- Let's do that.

1078
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,012
- Do I press zero?
- Yeah.

1079
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:30,640
Team White requested a timeout.

1080
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,476
They're good at catching routes.

1081
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,479
We didn't expect them
to remove White 4 from the center.

1082
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,231
They managed to find their only way out.

1083
00:56:38,314 --> 00:56:41,026
I've noticed several occasions
where they pulled off good moves.

1084
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:44,946
They can't move diagonally anyway,
and we have a foothold across the board.

1085
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,197
Let's go on the defensive.

1086
00:56:46,614 --> 00:56:49,409
Black 4 would move this way, right?
Why don't we move White 5 down?

1087
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,745
If this moves to the center,
I could take the exit.

1088
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:52,662
That's a good idea.

1089
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:53,788
WHITE 5 TO EXIT USING BLACK 4

1090
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:54,956
But what if they move Black 1?

1091
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,417
Black 1 and 6
need to go that way at least once.

1092
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:00,920
We can block their path
with White 6, then.

1093
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:02,964
USE WHITE 6 TO BLOCK BLACK 1 AND 6

1094
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:05,175
It's not about us winning.
We just can't let them win.

1095
00:57:05,258 --> 00:57:06,551
Right. They can't find a way.

1096
00:57:06,634 --> 00:57:10,305
As long as we can keep it that way,
we can take the game with those three.

1097
00:57:12,557 --> 00:57:14,100
What if this one moves here?

1098
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,812
- Do you think White 5 would do that?
- Black 4 can't go here then.

1099
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:19,606
WHITE 5 CAN TAKE THE EXIT USING BLACK 4

1100
00:57:19,689 --> 00:57:21,232
- He'd go there, then.
- Would he?

1101
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:22,901
They must see that, too.

1102
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:29,157
Think about how they could exit first.
We need to know to avoid defeat.

1103
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:33,453
Then, let's position Black 6 here.

1104
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:35,580
Let's aim for this.

1105
00:57:35,663 --> 00:57:38,375
STRATEGIC MOVE TO CLAIM
THE 2 ADJACENT CELLS TO THE EXIT

1106
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:41,169
- That would be faster.
- This is it.

1107
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,338
Your time is up.

1108
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:44,798
The game will be resumed.

1109
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:54,516
White 1, please make your move.

1110
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:58,353
White 1, please make your move.

1111
00:57:58,436 --> 00:57:59,270
What? Again?

1112
00:57:59,354 --> 00:58:01,564
WHITE 1 MOVES UNEXPECTEDLY

1113
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:03,650
Hang on. Is White 1 moving?

1114
00:58:04,943 --> 00:58:06,986
What is their plan?

1115
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,489
Why would they want White 1 to move?

1116
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:13,785
Hold on. Our teammates
must be getting shaken up.

1117
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:16,371
I just couldn't figure out their plan.

1118
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:25,964
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

1119
00:58:26,047 --> 00:58:27,674
Should we have White 3 retreat?

1120
00:58:27,757 --> 00:58:29,384
HOPES TO USE BLACK 4
TO GET WHITE 3 TO MOVE

1121
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,556
Wait, they must've called White 1
expecting us to move Black 4.

1122
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:39,060
That can only mean they devised a way
to finish the game before us.

1123
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:41,646
What did they see that we missed?

1124
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:44,190
Shall we call Black 4, as you suggested?

1125
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:46,192
No, wait. Let's think it over.

1126
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:49,362
Moving Black 4 might lead to our defeat.

1127
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,990
You have ten seconds left.

1128
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:55,201
Hold on. What's the deal with White 1?

1129
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:59,372
Black 4, please make your move.

1130
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:08,256
Team White,
please select a piece to make a move.

1131
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,717
Let's bring White 5 down here.

1132
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,427
Gi-hyeon will know what to do, right?

1133
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:17,599
White 5, please make your move.

1134
00:59:20,518 --> 00:59:22,103
What did you see?

1135
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:24,022
I'm sure White 5 will come this way.

1136
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:32,155
Team Black,
please select a piece to make a move.

1137
00:59:32,697 --> 00:59:36,743
Didn't we discuss having Black 6
come to the center to threaten them?

1138
00:59:36,826 --> 00:59:39,871
Black 6, please make your move.

1139
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,129
White 1, please make your move.

1140
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:50,882
White 1? What the heck are they thinking?

1141
00:59:56,221 --> 00:59:58,056
Hurry, Su-han. Team KAIST...

1142
00:59:59,724 --> 01:00:01,976
Are we going down like this?

1143
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:46,021
