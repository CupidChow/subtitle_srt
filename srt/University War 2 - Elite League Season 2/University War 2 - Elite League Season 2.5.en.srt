1
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,613
Your final CSAT scores will be announced.

2
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,324
CSAT WITHOUT EXAM PAPERS
SNU: 160, KAIST: 210, YONSEI: 160

3
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,577
Team Oxford...

4
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,911
NEEDS MORE THAN 170 POINTS TO SURVIVE

5
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,998
IF TEAM OXFORD SCORES MORE THAN 170,
TEAM YONSEI FACES DEATHMATCH

6
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,631
You scored 150 points.

7
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,801
Team Oxford is the lowest-scoring team.

8
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,557
TEAM YONSEI SURVIVES BY SCORING 160

9
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,810
TEAM OXFORD SET TO COMPETE
IN THE DEATHMATCH

10
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,940
I was devastated and badly disappointed.

11
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,819
A 10-point difference meant
that we only missed it by a question.

12
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,405
I was so disappointed by the result.

13
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,866
- What a shame.
- We were so close.

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,037
My legs are giving out.

15
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,165
CSAT WITHOUT EXAM PAPERS, FINAL RESULTS

16
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,460
TEAM KAIST: WINS
TEAM OXFORD: FACES THE DEATHMATCH

17
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,088
- We almost came in third.
- I know.

18
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,632
I think that was
the most nerve-wracking match ever.

19
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,010
We should forget about
taking it easy moving forward.

20
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,597
We won the main match!

21
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,562
Team Oxford,
please go to the Deathmatch Hall.

22
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,214
I thought we had the best chance
of winning against Team Oxford

23
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,134
out of the four remaining teams
in a head-to-head situation.

24
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:18,054
I didn't think
that our chances were too bad.

25
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,641
As the name suggests,
our survival hung on this Deathmatch.

26
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,476
I knew I had to stay on my toes.

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,061
We couldn't go home just yet.

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,064
I wanted this Deathmatch to be a chance
to prove our worth again.

29
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,068
I felt sure that Team POSTECH
would be going home today.

30
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,660
The Deathmatch will now begin.

31
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,540
Today's Deathmatch
is Calculation Connect Five.

32
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,545
- Calculations?
- That sounds fun.

33
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,799
In Calculation Connect Five,
you will be given numbered stones.

34
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:59,596
The 1st player to form a row
to make 16 wins the game.

35
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:04,768
A special rule applies to calculations
in Calculation Connect Five.

36
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:10,857
If a row contains both players' stones,
the numbers on your stones must be added

37
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,277
while the numbers on your opponent's
must be subtracted.

38
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,654
Therefore, even within the same row,

39
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,950
both players will have different results.

40
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,872
Apply this rule as you calculate
the sum of the rows you create.

41
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,250
The 1st player to form a row
to make 16 will take the game.

42
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,335
PLAYER WITH BLACK STONE WINS

43
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,131
- That's what they meant by "calculation."
- That's too complicated.

44
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:40,303
Each player will be given 4 sets of stones
with numbers from 1 to 5.

45
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,514
In total, it will be 20 stones.

46
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,809
Each turn must be completed in one minute.

47
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,352
PLAYER WITH BLACK STONE GOES FIRST

48
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,773
The player to make the first move
can only use 1, 2, or 3.

49
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,776
If you fail to complete your turn
within the time limit,

50
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,237
the chance will be
turned over to your opponent.

51
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,198
I'm really good at these.

52
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,035
Each round will be played
on a one-on-one basis.

53
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,539
Different contestants must play
in the first two rounds.

54
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,042
But any player can play
in the third round.

55
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,044
Out of a total of three rounds,

56
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:17,215
the team that secures two wins first
will be declared the winner.

57
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,511
The team to go first
will be decided by Team Oxford

58
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,388
as they joined the Deathmatch later.

59
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,723
From the second round onward,

60
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,642
the losing team of the previous round
will make the first move.

61
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,436
It sounds like fun.

62
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,816
Our team was experienced in playing chess
and other games that were similar to this,

63
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,609
so I felt good about our chances.

64
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,654
I felt certain my team could win.

65
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,574
I play Connect Five often for fun,

66
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,618
so I thought we could make a comeback
if we avoided making a mistake.

67
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,621
Both teams,
please start discussing your strategies.

68
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,250
You have 20 minutes.

69
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,627
I'm pretty sure
they'll choose to play first,

70
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,131
because it's better to go first
in games like this.

71
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,260
- Jin-hyeon says he's a seasoned player.
- So, here's what I think.

72
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,555
It's crucial that you make
a triangle with your stones.

73
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,931
- A triangle?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,099
Here's an example.

75
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,144
JIN-HYEON TAKES CHARGE
I'll assign the numbers like this.

76
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,564
Let's check out the sums.
Diagonally, we get 7.

77
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,942
Horizontally, 9, and vertically, 8.

78
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,444
Theoretically,

79
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,155
we have six possible routes of attack.

80
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,950
EXPANDING OPTIONS WITH A TRIANGLE
If we place a 4 here, we'll get 7.

81
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,911
This row would give us 13.

82
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,246
So, by doing this,
we can create multiple attack routes.

83
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,250
We should focus on expanding our options
by placing stones close to one another.

84
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:41,049
The most advantageous move would be
the one that forms multiple rows, right?

85
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,384
- Right.
- Sure.

86
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,011
Having a 4 here doesn't just add 4.

87
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,639
It creates an additional row,
so we're effectively getting eight.

88
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,308
We need to keep increasing the numbers.

89
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,270
So, we should create intersections
and add more rows, right?

90
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,064
We should keep an eye open for these.

91
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,148
One more thing.

92
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,945
In turn-based games,
the priority is defense, not offense.

93
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,196
Remember the minimax rule.

94
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,782
MINIMIZE DAMAGES IN WORST-CASE SCENARIOS
Stopping the opponent is most important.

95
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,117
It's the minimax rule.

96
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,578
My hobby is playing chess.

97
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:15,250
I'm interested in turn-based games,
and I play them quite often, too.

98
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,796
MUN-HYEOK IS A MEMBER
OF A CHESS CLUB AT OXFORD

99
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,801
When it comes to analyzing moves
and coming up with strategies,

100
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,845
I'd say I'm pretty good at them.

101
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,098
Let's talk about which numbers to use.

102
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:34,310
Using up the fives could be risky
because it'll leave you defenseless.

103
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:38,773
There is a limit
to the number of stones the players have.

104
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,442
REMAINING BLACK STONES
Consider this example.

105
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,195
If you have a five left,
it would be possible to defend an attack.

106
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:49,826
Without it, it would be impossible
to block the opponent's attack.

107
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,079
You shouldn't use up
all the fives early on.

108
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,081
Because even if you use a 4 to block a 5,

109
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,876
they could keep adding fives
to reach the target number.

110
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,921
- You'd be totally defenseless.
- It's all about timing.

111
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,092
- Especially with the fives.
- If your opponent places a three,

112
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,762
the best would be to use something
that is higher or lower by one.

113
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,722
Holding big numbers back
could be even better.

114
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,682
These are the combinations
that can get us 16.

115
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,477
TEAM POSTECH LISTS POSSIBLE CASES
Eleven and five.

116
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,062
Twelve and four.

117
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,731
If we succeed in forming a row
with a sum of 11 or higher,

118
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,859
we can always take it up to 16
by adding 1 more stone.

119
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,319
WINNING COMBINATIONS

120
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,573
In terms of offense,
we saw reaching 11 as the key.

121
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,035
That's why our defense strategy
was to be on the lookout for 11.

122
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,748
We would strive to keep the sum
of our opponent's rows at ten or lower.

123
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,542
Even if they are set apart,
you should see them as a connected line.

124
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,877
It's not a regular Connect Five.

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,005
You can still win if you set up your row
so that its sum reaches 11.

126
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,382
In regular Connect Five,

127
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,886
the only avenue for defense
is the open end on the right side.

128
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:54,391
But in Calculation Connect Five,
both ends can be utilized.

129
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,144
As demonstrated,
taking advantage of the fact

130
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,940
that both ends can be utilized
will be very important.

131
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,192
Don't forget to keep count
of the opponent's stones.

132
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,736
Right. It'll be important to know
how many of each stone they have left.

133
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,239
Also, think about the odd numbers
and the even numbers.

134
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,032
If all your remaining stones
are even-numbered,

135
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,952
it'll be bad
if your rows only add up to odd numbers.

136
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,745
- That's right.
- You can't make 16 then.

137
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,917
Calculation Connect Five can only be won
if the sum of your row is equal to 16.

138
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,796
Let's say the sum of every row
on the board is an odd number,

139
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,465
but the remaining stones
are all even-numbered.

140
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,385
Since the sum of an odd number
and an even number is always an odd,

141
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:34,055
the goal of 16 can't be reached
as it is an even number.

142
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,432
CAN'T MAKE 16

143
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,726
Placing big numbers
diagonally is important.

144
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,603
It's also important to use them
to block diagonal attacks

145
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,730
by placing them at intersections.

146
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,567
The calculation required for this game
is pretty simple anyway,

147
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,654
so players who can spot the intersections
will have a big advantage.

148
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,072
Mun-hyeok is our guy, then.

149
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,575
- You're good at spotting these details.
- He really does.

150
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,326
Shall I go first?

151
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,164
You can go first.
Shall I take the second round?

152
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,249
Show them what you got, Seung-chan.

153
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,128
CHESS LOVERS, SEUNG-CHAN AND MUN-HYEOK,
WILL BE PLAYING FOR TEAM OXFORD

154
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:09,049
Am I being overly confident?
I'm so convinced that we're going to win.

155
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,675
No, I agree. They're both so good.

156
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,470
What should we do?
I don't think I should be so cocky.

157
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,765
So, you'd have won
if you had placed a five here.

158
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,060
Jin-hyeon.

159
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,312
Awesome. Take the first round.

160
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,189
I'll do it.

161
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,234
The time for the strategy meeting is up.

162
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,278
Huddle up, guys.

163
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,114
POSTECH!

164
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,495
- Focus, okay?
- Let's do this!

165
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,753
- Go get them!
- Let's go.

166
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,847
We'll now begin the Deathmatch,
Calculation Connect Five.

167
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,687
They must be so nervous.
Deathmatches are so nerve-wracking.

168
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,605
In the first round,

169
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:10,819
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok will play
against Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

170
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,612
Have fun out there.

171
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:13,863
Please come forward.

172
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,906
CALCULATION CONNECT FIVE

173
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:15,824
Good luck.

174
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,992
Go get him, Mun-hyeok!

175
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,994
You got this, Jin-hyeon!

176
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,466
Please win this for us.

177
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:43,685
Team Oxford, please decide
which team will make the first move.

178
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,023
I'll go first.

179
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,524
TEAM OXFORD TAKES THE 1ST TURN

180
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,527
There you go. He made the right call.

181
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,990
Please note that you can only use a stone
with a value of three or lower.

182
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,286
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok,
please place your stone.

183
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,163
Get ready.

184
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:07,709
The match begins now!

185
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,342
MUN-HYEOK PLACES A 3 ON HIS 1ST TURN

186
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,804
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
will now take his turn.

187
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,858
Did he not come up with a strategy?

188
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,277
But he must've expected going second.

189
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,613
He should take his time.

190
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,165
Jin-hyeon places his stone
right next to the three.

191
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,001
How will Team Oxford's Mun-hyeok respond?

192
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,763
He's making a straight line?

193
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,431
That's how he's going to play it?

194
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,810
We keep kibitzing
now that we're safe from the Deathmatch.

195
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,105
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
will now take his turn.

196
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,657
MUN-HYEOK PLACES A 3

197
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,702
What's he doing?

198
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,830
They'll take an offensive approach
in the early stages of the game,

199
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,623
utilizing the perk of going first.

200
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,959
If your opponent places a three,

201
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,670
the best would be to use something
that is higher or lower by one.

202
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,341
MUN-HYEOK LEADS A DEFENSIVE GAME
DESPITE THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING FIRST

203
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,343
All right.

204
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:45,390
Mun-hyeok didn't play the game
like I expected him to.

205
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,891
So I was rather confused.

206
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,529
JIN-HYEON PLACES A 5,
THE LARGEST NUMBER

207
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,866
I just don't think that was a wise move.

208
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,951
Once a five is used,
both will have to keep using it.

209
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,870
Yeah, using five can be a gamble.

210
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,248
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok
will now take his turn.

211
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,345
MUN-HYEOK FORMED A ROW THAT MAKES 11

212
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,848
Team Oxford's Mun-hyeok
takes over the center section.

213
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,184
MUN-HYEOK CAN MAKE 16 IN THE NEXT TURN
That's 11. He's going to win.

214
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,186
You have to block it.

215
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,239
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok
will now take his turn.

216
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,166
That wasn't a bad move.

217
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,460
Our smart guy's doing well.

218
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:01,216
The game was designed for the first player
to take the lead throughout.

219
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,967
And I think I took the lead very well.

220
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,055
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
will now take his turn.

221
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,431
Please place your stone.

222
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,728
Mun-hyeok had
the advantage of going first,

223
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,064
so I decided to take
a defense-heavy approach.

224
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,202
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
will now take his turn.

225
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,585
Jin-hyeon has no rows
he can use for attacks.

226
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,797
Jin-hyeon's defending very well,
but he has no offensive routes.

227
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,551
JIN-HYEON HAS NO ROWS
THAT MAKES A RESULT OF 5 OR HIGHER

228
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,767
He did well to block that.

229
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,479
They've used the same number
of 3s, 4s, and 5s so far.

230
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,574
MUN-HYEOK PLACES A 5,
THE LARGEST NUMBER

231
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,493
- That was the right move.
- Now he has rows that make 8 and 10.

232
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,953
- He's doing well.
- Eight and ten.

233
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,788
Eight and ten? That's a strong move.

234
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,625
Jin-hyeon now has to think carefully
and choose between offense or defense.

235
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,628
But then again,
he has no viable routes for attack.

236
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:27,052
Jin-hyeon appears to be
being dragged along by Mun-hyeok.

237
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,055
- I think we could easily win.
- You have 30 seconds.

238
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,932
They should've had their best player
in the first round.

239
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,066
JIN-HYEON DEFENDS WITH A 2

240
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,947
MUN-HYEOK IMMEDIATELY COUNTERS
WITH ANOTHER 2

241
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,994
- He cut off Jin-hyeon's offense.
- With the two, right?

242
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,330
He must've thought that could be a threat.

243
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,834
In turn-based games,
the priority is defense, not offense.

244
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,046
MUN-HYEOK FOCUSES
ON PLAYING A DEFENSIVE GAME

245
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,965
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
will now take his turn.

246
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,015
He has picked up a four.

247
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,070
He should've placed a five there.

248
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,572
- That row makes a ten now.
- You're right.

249
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,867
JIN-HYEON PLACES A 4
AND MISSES THE CHANCE TO MAKE AN 11

250
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,578
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok
will now take his turn.

251
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,713
MUN-HYEOK LAUNCHES AN ATTACK WITH A 5

252
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,297
- There you go.
- Good call.

253
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,675
That was perfect. He's doing well.

254
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,011
That was the best option.
The best defense is a good offense.

255
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,804
He just made a 14.

256
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,682
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
will now take his turn.

257
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,017
He has to block it.

258
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,228
Run the numbers correctly
and make sure to cut him off.

259
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:12,073
JIN-HYEON PUTS DOWN THE 4
AND USES A 5 INSTEAD

260
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,120
Why did he block that with a five?

261
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,290
The difference in the remaining fives
could have ended the game.

262
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,750
He should've used a four there.

263
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,586
And that spot doesn't help him
with the offense, either.

264
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,095
MUN-HYEOK PLACES A 4

265
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,558
That vertical line makes nine
and keeps Jin-hyeon in check.

266
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,894
The diagonal 12 could end the game.

267
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,104
Jin-hyeon should block that with a two.

268
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,816
That was a smart move.

269
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,860
This is driving me insane.

270
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,536
JIN-HYEON USES A 2 FOR DEFENSE
That was a good move.

271
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,082
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok
will now take his turn.

272
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,002
Can't you attack that row from both ends?

273
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,506
- What if he placed a five here?
- That would work.

274
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,383
Wouldn't Jin-hyeon have to counter that?

275
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,469
This vertical line would make 14
which would put him under pressure.

276
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,388
APPLYING PRESSURE WITH TWO LINES

277
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,182
But Mun-hyeok only has
a single five remaining.

278
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:23,395
NUMBER OF REMAINING 5S
OXFORD: 1, POSTECH: 2

279
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:24,813
You shouldn't use up
all the fives early on.

280
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,523
Because even if you use a 4 to block a 5,

281
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,441
they could keep adding fives
to reach the target number.

282
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,151
You'd be totally defenseless.

283
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,698
MUN-HYEOK ONLY HAS A SINGLE 5 REMAINING

284
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,786
I could've used it
either offensively or defensively.

285
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:46,167
But if I used it,
Jin-hyeon would get a huge upper hand.

286
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,878
You have 30 seconds.

287
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,301
You have ten seconds.

288
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,980
That's why I decided to keep playing
while holding back the five.

289
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,817
What was that for?

290
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,029
Why did he make that decision?

291
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,031
What's the idea behind the last stone?

292
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,952
Mun-hyeok kept
a 3, a 4, and a 5, just in case.

293
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,373
MUN-HYEOK HAS A 3, A 4, AND A 5 LEFT

294
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:30,795
JIN-HYEON HAS A 3, A 4, AND TWO 5S LEFT

295
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,715
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
will now take his turn.

296
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,008
Please place your stone.

297
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,439
He just blocked Mun-hyeok.

298
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,191
JIN-HYEON USES A 5
AS A PREEMPTIVE DEFENSIVE MOVE

299
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,692
Jin-hyeon now has 6 and 8.

300
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:55,403
But why would he use a 5 to make 6 and 8?

301
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,988
What a waste.

302
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,617
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok
will now take his turn.

303
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,910
Please place your stone.

304
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:14,673
MUN-HYEOK PLACES A 4

305
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:18,426
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
will now take his turn.

306
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,844
Please place your stone.

307
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,565
Jin-hyeon is on a crazy roll.

308
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,609
He just made a double-three.

309
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,784
I think we can apply
the regular Connect Five's rules.

310
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,869
Both games have very similar patterns.

311
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,038
Place a stone here for me.

312
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,915
You're right.

313
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,710
- That's the finisher.
- That's practically a double-three.

314
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,253
That's a double-three.

315
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,922
A double-three
in a regular game of Connect Five

316
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:59,718
refers to a move that forms
2 rows of 3 connected stones at once.

317
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,680
It is a finishing move
that cannot be defended by the opponent.

318
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,474
Team POSTECH's double-three strategy

319
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,353
is to place 1 stone to form 2 lines
that results in a sum higher than 11.

320
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,564
This way,
regardless of their opponent's move,

321
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:16,609
they can form a line
that makes a 16 in their next turn.

322
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,948
These are the possible cases
where we can have a double-three.

323
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,785
Naturally, our core strategy
was forming a double-three.

324
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,079
Later on in the game,

325
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,874
I could see that Mun-hyeok had exhausted
most of his high-numbered stones.

326
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,752
So, I thought of launching an attack
as soon as I got the chance.

327
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,047
JIN-HYEON ACTS ON HIS DOUBLE-3 STRATEGY

328
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,882
Why did he use a five there?

329
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,761
2ND MOVE BASED ON THE DOUBLE-3 STRATEGY

330
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,472
But why would he use a 5 to make 6 and 8?

331
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,057
What a waste.

332
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:53,104
JIN-HYEON FORMS A DOUBLE-3
WITH HIS 3RD MOVE USING A 5

333
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,733
Wait, I think the game's over.

334
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,277
Wasn't that the finishing move?

335
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,196
There you go. It's over.

336
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,239
We won.

337
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,785
We lost.

338
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,582
It was a shame that I didn't notice
that row being formed.

339
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,837
Man, how did they come up with that?

340
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,715
Mun-hyeok didn't notice
the build-up to a double-three.

341
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,259
We didn't get
why he used that five, either.

342
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:25,095
We'd have lost too.

343
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,098
Team Oxford's Chang Mun-hyeok
will now take his turn.

344
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,189
Look, he has a 3
and a 1 in his hands for the checkmate.

345
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,816
He knows he's about to get 15 and 13.

346
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,401
He's already picked up his stones.

347
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:42,320
He already knows
what he will use to finish the game.

348
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,665
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
formed a row that makes 16.

349
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:56,418
The first round goes to Team POSTECH.

350
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,836
TEAM POSTECH'S CHOI JIN-HYEON WINS ROUND 1

351
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,629
Thanks, Jin-hyeon.

352
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,972
Some say even the most competent
can make a mistake,

353
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,266
but I believe a truly skilled person
would never slip up.

354
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:14,185
So, I accepted my loss
and left the center stage.

355
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:16,855
Good work.

356
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:19,482
You were great.

357
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,193
That was brilliant. You killed it.

358
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,611
Let me have some of that energy.

359
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,032
Things get rough
if you lose the first round.

360
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,868
Setting the right tone
is everything in Deathmatches.

361
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,829
Team POSTECH has the upper hand
now that they've won a round.

362
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:36,416
We'll now begin the second round
of Calculation Connect Five.

363
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,044
In the second round,

364
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,379
Team Oxford's Lee Seung-chan will play

365
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,716
against Team POSTECH's Jeon Ji-seong.

366
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,385
The two contestants, please come forward.

367
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,306
- Good luck.
- Go get him!

368
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,891
- Good luck!
- You can do this!

369
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:55,560
Go, Ji-seong, go!

370
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,690
I wasn't all that nervous.

371
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,361
"Let's win no matter what
and get another shot to prove ourselves."

372
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,696
That was the only thought in my head.

373
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:12,160
It was rather scary,
but I somehow felt good about my chances.

374
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,329
Both thoughts were running in my mind.

375
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,582
We prayed for you
with our fingers laced like this, too.

376
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:25,382
Lee Seung-chan will make the first move
as Team Oxford lost the first round.

377
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:29,344
Please note that you can only use a stone
with a value of three or lower.

378
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:33,556
Team Oxford's Lee Seung-chan,
please place your stone.

379
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,816
SEUNG-CHAN PLACES A 3 ON HIS 1ST TURN

380
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,792
Team POSTECH's Jeon Ji-seong
will now take his turn.

381
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,008
It all seems pretty tame so far.

382
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,011
You could say
they're playing by the book this time.

383
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,303
OXFORD: WHITE, POSTECH: BLACK

384
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:35,827
JI-SEONG PLACES A 5

385
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:39,122
He forms two different routes right away.

386
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,124
Eight and nine. That's heavy-handed.

387
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,835
You can counter and attack
at the same time.

388
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,837
A five here can pose a threat,

389
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,215
so I expect Seung-chan
to place a five there.

390
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:55,055
SEUNG-CHAN COUNTERS WITH A 5

391
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,514
That's it.

392
00:25:57,432 --> 00:26:01,394
I thought I could take
an offensive approach.

393
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,940
Team POSTECH's Jeon Ji-seong
will now take his turn.

394
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:23,166
SEUNG-CHAN MAKES AN 11 AGAIN

395
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,751
Great call.

396
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,963
- He should place another stone there.
- Seung-chan is so smart.

397
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,509
I wonder how Ji-seong
will counter that 11.

398
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:40,433
JI-SEONG DEFENDS WITH A 3

399
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:43,269
Team Oxford's Lee Seung-chan
will now take his turn.

400
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,358
SEUNG-CHAN PICKS UP A 4

401
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:59,536
I thought making unexpected moves
by using high numbers might faze Ji-seong.

402
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,079
Was that a wise move?

403
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,457
I'm not sure about that move.

404
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:14,426
JI-SEONG PLACES A 4

405
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,177
Aren't we in trouble?

406
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,554
We're in trouble.

407
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,809
Team Oxford's Lee Seung-chan
will now take his turn.

408
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:37,991
I tried to put myself in Ji-seong's shoes
as I analyzed my next move.

409
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,168
I like it.

410
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,503
- Smooth sailing so far.
- What?

411
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,130
I think he's doing fine.

412
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:56,092
I thought that Ji-seong wasn't making
any unexpected moves.

413
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,970
Team POSTECH's Jeon Ji-seong
will now take his turn.

414
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,779
Why did he make that move?

415
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,868
JI-SEONG PLACES A 5
WITHOUT CONNECTING IT WITH OTHERS

416
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,954
Team Oxford's Lee Seung-chan
will now take his turn.

417
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,292
What's the secret behind this move?

418
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:32,671
Maybe he's trying to block
the diagonal line with the white fives.

419
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:35,256
- I think I get why he did it.
- What?

420
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,427
I said I got why he did that.
But I just think that it was...

421
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,513
- It's a little risky.
- Yeah.

422
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:45,558
That can only be a move
that rides on an opponent's mistake.

423
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:50,605
But other than the top horizontal row,
he can't connect it to anything else.

424
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:57,362
The reason why I placed the five
away from the other stones

425
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,781
is because if I had placed it
next to the others,

426
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:05,453
he would've seen that its sum was 11
and taken a defensive measure.

427
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:09,332
But if it's disconnected by one cell,
the nerves could easily make him miss it.

428
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:13,712
I used a trick so he wouldn't notice
I had just formed a line that makes 11.

429
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,841
You have 30 seconds.

430
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,351
He needs to defend against that well.

431
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:31,229
- He might miss that.
- That's a possibility.

432
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:43,074
SEUNG-CHAN DIDN'T NOTICE THE 11

433
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:47,620
Team POSTECH's...

434
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,712
You have ten seconds.

435
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,048
- Team POSTECH's Jeon Ji-seong
- What's going on?

436
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,050
will now take his turn.
Please place your stone.

437
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:07,557
Team POSTECH's Jeon Ji-seong
will now take his turn.

438
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:21,780
JI-SEONG MAKES 16

439
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:25,450
Team POSTECH's Jeon Ji-seong
formed a row that makes 16.

440
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,703
The second round goes to Team POSTECH.

441
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,413
TEAM POSTECH'S JEON JI-SEONG WINS ROUND 2

442
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,585
I felt terrible for my teammates.

443
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,841
I couldn't think of any ways
to make it up to them.

444
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,595
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

445
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:51,976
That concludes the Deathmatch,
Calculation Connect Five.

446
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,437
The result will now be announced.

447
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:58,066
The winning team is Team POSTECH.

448
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,860
I expected to feel overjoyed.

449
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:04,364
But I noticed how down Team Oxford looked.

450
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,242
I couldn't simply enjoy the win.

451
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:11,287
My heart did grow heavy,
but I was still glad.

452
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,622
I mean, we managed to win.

453
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:16,167
The third team to be eliminated
from Elite League, Season 2,

454
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:18,253
is Team Oxford.

455
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:22,007
I felt so bad about my careless mistake.

456
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,176
You did great.

457
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:30,265
Team Oxford, please exit the grounds.

458
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,352
- Let's go.
- All right.

459
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:35,979
Thanks for everything.

460
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:38,606
Goodbye.

461
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,535
To be honest, I didn't want to leave.

462
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:53,413
The others had benefit matches
and main matches ahead of them.

463
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:57,042
I felt so jealous
because I knew how much fun it would be.

464
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,794
It's such a shame that we lost,

465
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:02,047
but I was blessed to have
such dependable teammates.

466
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,383
If the show gets another season,

467
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:08,053
I want to compete again
and win that scholarship.

468
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,597
All of my teammates are older than me.

469
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:15,352
I was the cheeky youngest member,
and I got to fool around a bit.

470
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:19,105
I was so grateful
they embraced my antics and trusted me.

471
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,444
We did well and had a lot of fun, too.

472
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:28,448
Where would I find
such lovable and dear friends like them?

473
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,576
I think our teamwork was perfect.

474
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:37,123
I'm grateful for this opportunity
to build such a close bond with them.

475
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:38,083
Let's go.

476
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,293
All right. Good job.

477
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,272
Team POSTECH,
as the winner of the Deathmatch,

478
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:05,402
please return to the Main Hall
for the next match.

479
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,158
Team POSTECH returns from the dead.

480
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,537
Look at how proud of themselves they are.

481
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:24,462
Why are they going around the room?

482
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:25,797
It's their victory lap.

483
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,511
Team POSTECH is back!

484
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,847
We won't go down that easily.

485
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:38,059
- Not dying is the same as winning.
- Right.

486
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:42,605
We've been on the passive side so far
and focused on not going home.

487
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:46,276
But we won't settle for surviving.
We'll show you that we're in it to win it.

488
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:54,868
We'll now begin today's benefit match.

489
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,331
Why are we so far apart from the others?

490
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,583
I feel left out.

491
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:05,045
Maybe because we'll be parting soon?

492
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,509
Today's benefit match...

493
00:34:13,386 --> 00:34:15,513
is Blind Sudoku.

494
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,974
Are we seriously going to play this?

495
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,643
HWANG GI-HYEON
PRE-TEST SUDOKU 1ST PLACE

496
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,228
- Hold on.
- This is great.

497
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:24,647
GI-HYEON PLACED FIRST
IN THE SUDOKU PRE-TEST

498
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,441
BY COMPLETING IT IN 37 SECONDS

499
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:28,818
- "Blind Sudoku"?
- Would we need to memorize the board?

500
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,820
In Blind Sudoku,

501
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:33,990
you will have to memorize
the Sudoku board within the time limit.

502
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:38,244
Your task is to complete the puzzle
with an empty board as your reference.

503
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:39,996
Goodness.

504
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,790
That's just insane.

505
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:46,670
The game uses a 6-by-6 Sudoku board.

506
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:51,966
Standard Sudoku rules apply
when completing the Blind Sudoku board.

507
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:56,388
The columns and rows must be filled
with numbers from 1 to 6.

508
00:34:56,471 --> 00:35:00,767
Each 2-by-3 block
must also contain those numbers.

509
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,186
The entire board must be filled
according to these rules.

510
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,605
Once the game starts,

511
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,858
a Sudoku board
filled with 16 numbers will be shown.

512
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:12,821
The contestants will see the board
for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

513
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:17,325
Once the time for memorization is over,
all the numbers will disappear.

514
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:20,412
That's insane.

515
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:24,499
The first player has 30 seconds

516
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:28,003
to name a cell's location
and the number that should go there.

517
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,087
FIRST PLAYER: F6, 1

518
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,132
If it is correct,
the player will be given one point.

519
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:36,511
But the answers
will not be displayed to the players.

520
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,889
We'd have to memorize
the opponent's answers, too.

521
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:43,393
We'd have to memorize
and solve everything by sight.

522
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:47,856
If you give a wrong answer
or fail to answer within the time limit,

523
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:50,275
your opponent will take their turn.

524
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,153
Two players will take turns
to give their answers.

525
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:57,282
The 1st player to score 11 points
will be declared the winner.

526
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:00,160
Each team must name a representative

527
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:03,413
who will then compete
in a tournament-styled game.

528
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:07,667
The winning team will be given
a substantial benefit

529
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:10,503
that can be used in the next main match.

530
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:16,134
Please go to your base camps
and start discussing your strategies.

531
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:20,430
I missed this place.

532
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,474
I MISSED IT TOO

533
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:26,895
Look at this board.

534
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:29,064
If we choose to memorize everything on it,

535
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:33,651
we'd have to memorize at least 20 cells
as well as the opponent's answers.

536
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:35,612
But we can come up with our own system.

537
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:38,740
For example, we can move counterclockwise
in calling out our answers.

538
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:42,827
That would lessen the hassle
of keeping track of our own answers.

539
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:45,747
We would have memorized
where the empty cells are,

540
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,916
and we would be following
our own rule to call out answers.

541
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:51,961
Team POSTECH's strategy is to memorize
the layout of the empty cells

542
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:55,882
and follow a pre-determined rule
to call out the coordinates in order.

543
00:36:55,965 --> 00:37:00,720
This would allow them to avoid
calling out the same cell twice.

544
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:03,890
The key challenge is reducing
the amount of information to memorize.

545
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:06,893
Once we decide
on how to move through the cells,

546
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,562
it won't matter if our opponent
names a cell in the middle.

547
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,856
We'll just move on to the next cell.

548
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:16,111
I suggest that we tackle
one small block at a time.

549
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:18,488
If we wanted to memorize
where all the ones are,

550
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,657
we'd have to recall
the entire 6-by-6 board.

551
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,494
But we could break that down
and focus on small 2-by-3 blocks.

552
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:26,287
That sounds like a good idea.

553
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,916
- Have you memorized it, Jeong-hun?
- Sure.

554
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,501
Really? Draw it for us, then.

555
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:33,294
JEONG-HUN RECREATES THE SAMPLE QUESTION

556
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,088
- Why don't you try it as well, Se-hwan?
- Both of us?

557
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:39,968
PERFECT RECREATION OF THE SAMPLE QUESTION

558
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:43,263
Jeong-hun has memorized it,
so all we have to do is solve it.

559
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:49,936
Honestly, I only needed 30 seconds
to memorize the whole board.

560
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:53,982
- I think we should play the long game.
- You think that's better?

561
00:37:54,065 --> 00:37:57,777
I suggest memorizing the whole board
and seven or eight answers I could use.

562
00:37:58,194 --> 00:38:01,823
I'll fill up the cells
and memorize them as I go along.

563
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:05,160
I'd memorize the answers only like this.
5, 6, 4, 1, 6, 5, 4...

564
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:06,745
SE-HWAN AIMS TO MEMORIZE THE ANSWERS

565
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,329
Can you memorize their locations, too?

566
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,331
I can memorize it
if I look at it over and over again.

567
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:13,501
Jeong-hun's memorization skills
will be useful later on in the game.

568
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:16,254
But Se-hwan will have the edge
if he memorizes everything perfectly.

569
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:20,592
TEAM YONSEI THINKS IT WILL BE A SHORT GAME
I doubt the game will last for that long.

570
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:22,218
I think Se-hwan should go for it.

571
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:24,220
TEAM YONSEI'S REP: PARK SE-HWAN

572
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,141
You're great at Sudoku
and memorization, Gi-hyeon.

573
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,810
I think your calmness
will shine in a game like this.

574
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:34,147
Let's say everyone solves the puzzle
and memorizes the answers in order.

575
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,691
I know that I can complete
the whole thing.

576
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:38,151
Once I'm done...

577
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:41,404
So, if my opponent starts off
with the easier ones,

578
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:44,824
- then I could...
- Hold off calling out the difficult ones.

579
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,201
KAIST'S STRATEGY

580
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:48,953
Save the difficult ones for later.
I'll keep that in mind.

581
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,497
1. SOLVE THE SUDOKU IN THE GIVEN TIME
2. CALL OUT THE DIFFICULT ANSWERS LATER

582
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,040
I think it's a good idea.

583
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:54,751
I'm glad we have
the best Sudoku player on our team.

584
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,587
At the end of the day,
only one person can play.

585
00:38:58,296 --> 00:38:59,964
Who thinks he has a shot at winning?

586
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,093
I think you'd do well, Jun-hyeong.

587
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:04,678
Do you think I could do it?

588
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,515
Jun-hyeong was hesitant about competing.

589
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:11,142
I knew Sudoku was a game
he felt confident in.

590
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,771
I'd be more confident
if they asked us to solve one quickly.

591
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:15,772
Same here.

592
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:20,318
It seemed like he was hesitating
because his losing streak weighed on him.

593
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:21,695
So, I said...

594
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:24,447
Go get the win.
I doubt anyone would complete it, anyway.

595
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,825
I'll give it a shot, then.

596
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:30,912
The time for the strategy meeting is up.

597
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:35,834
All contestants,
please gather in the Main Hall.

598
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:47,846
Representatives, please step forward
and pick out a ball from the box.

599
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:49,264
Go for it, Team SNU!

600
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:51,391
- Let's go, Team KAIST!
- Good luck, Team Yonsei!

601
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:55,979
Contestants who picked out the same color
will be competing against each other.

602
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:59,691
The player who picks out the marked ball
will take the first turn.

603
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:02,819
GROUP A: TEAM KAIST'S HWANG GI-HYEON
VS. TEAM SNU'S CHO JUN-HYEONG

604
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:05,655
GROUP B: TEAM POSTECH'S CHOI JIN-HYEON
VS. TEAM YONSEI'S PARK SE-HWAN

605
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:10,201
We'll now begin
today's benefit match, Blind Sudoku.

606
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:13,621
We will start with Group A.

607
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:18,835
If you're not participating in the game,
please return to your base camps.

608
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,130
- You'll be here by yourself.
- Get going.

609
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:23,340
I'll get going, then.

610
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:24,674
- Good luck!
- You got this!

611
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,094
Shall we do our chant?

612
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,097
- One, two, three.
- Let's go, Team KAIST!

613
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:34,351
You got this, Gi-hyeon.

614
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:40,357
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon

615
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,026
and Team SNU's Cho Jun-hyeong,
please step forward.

616
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:51,284
I had a small grudge against Gi-hyeon
for losing to him.

617
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:53,995
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.
That is correct.

618
00:40:55,872 --> 00:41:00,585
DURING THE PYRAMID GAME
JUN-HYEONG LOST TWICE TO GI-HYEON

619
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:02,837
I really want to win this time.

620
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:09,010
Here's your board for Blind Sudoku.

621
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:14,057
You have 2 minutes and 30 seconds
to memorize the board.

622
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:20,772
I was confident
that I could solve it quickly,

623
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:24,317
so I used the first minute
to solve ten cells quickly.

624
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:29,239
I spent the remaining minute and a half
on perfectly memorizing those cells.

625
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:34,494
I planned to use 2 minutes and 30 seconds
to memorize the board perfectly.

626
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:37,789
Gi-hyeon and I would get
30 seconds each to answer,

627
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:40,458
so I planned to use that time to solve
two more answers, and keep scoring.

628
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:44,337
JUN-HYEONG PRIORITIZES MEMORIZATION
GI-HYEON PRIORITIZES SOLVING THE PUZZLES

629
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,464
It's hard enough
just trying to solve it by sight.

630
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,591
Three... Hold on.

631
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,343
- It's difficult, isn't it?
- Yeah.

632
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,178
That will give Gi-hyeon the upper hand.

633
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:53,263
Four, three...

634
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,644
The time for memorization is over.

635
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,358
THE BOARD WILL REMAIN EMPTY
UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME

636
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:08,111
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon
will take his turn first.

637
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:12,115
I'll go with 6 in F2.

638
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:14,701
F2, 6.

639
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:15,869
That is correct.

640
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:17,287
SNU'S JUN-HYEONG: 0
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 1

641
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:20,623
I'll go with 1 in F1.

642
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,210
F1, 1. That is correct.

643
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:28,131
I'll go with 2 in E2.

644
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:30,800
E2, 2. That is correct.

645
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:34,596
I'll go with 5 in E4.

646
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:36,931
E4, 5. That is correct.

647
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:39,225
SNU'S JUN-HYEONG: 2
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 2

648
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,685
He's good.

649
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:43,396
I'll go with 2 in F3.

650
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:46,066
I'll go with 4 in D1.

651
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:47,859
That is correct.

652
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:52,489
I'll go with 4 in E5.

653
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:56,076
I'll go with 2 in A6.

654
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:58,286
That is correct.

655
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,705
That's our Gi-hyeon!

656
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:01,998
SNU'S JUN-HYEONG: 4
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 4

657
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:03,416
Don't get too excited.

658
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,335
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

659
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,463
I'll go with 1 in B5.

660
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,964
B5, 1.

661
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:12,759
That is correct.

662
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,845
Team SNU's Cho Jun-hyeong.

663
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:19,140
SNU'S JUN-HYEONG: 4
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 5

664
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:23,269
I'll go with 4 in A5.

665
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:29,734
That cell is already occupied.

666
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:33,571
Remembering what the opponent said
is just too much.

667
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:35,949
I think that's Jun-hyeong's limit.

668
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:37,659
I doubt he can remember anything else.

669
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:40,495
When my opponent called out an answer,

670
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:42,789
I would call out an answer to a cell
that was close to his

671
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:46,209
and kept following him around
when he moved to a different area.

672
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,128
That way, I could fill up all the cells

673
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:50,797
in the areas
that the opponent had memorized.

674
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,509
I'll go with 6 in E6.

675
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:56,094
That is correct.

676
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:58,680
Team SNU's Cho Jun-hyeong.

677
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:02,809
SNU'S JUN-HYEONG: 4
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 6

678
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:07,856
I'll go with 5 in C3.

679
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:11,401
That is incorrect.

680
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:16,865
I'll go with 3 in B2.

681
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:18,992
That is correct.

682
00:44:20,493 --> 00:44:21,745
How is he so good?

683
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,038
I can't believe this.

684
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:26,332
SNU'S JUN-HYEONG: 4
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 7

685
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:28,043
Team SNU's Cho Jun-hyeong.

686
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:37,886
I'll go with 3 in C4.

687
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:39,721
C4, 3.

688
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:40,972
That is incorrect.

689
00:44:42,932 --> 00:44:45,393
I'll go with 4 in A2.

690
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:46,561
That is correct.

691
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:50,231
Gi-hyeon is seriously killing it today.

692
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:52,567
1ST TO SCORE 11 POINTS WINS
Just 3 more points, and it's over.

693
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:55,570
I was confident that I could win.

694
00:44:55,653 --> 00:44:58,740
I saw this as a game
catered to my strength.

695
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:01,242
I'll go with 4 in F4.

696
00:45:01,826 --> 00:45:04,162
I'll go with 6 in D3.

697
00:45:04,245 --> 00:45:05,497
That is correct.

698
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:07,749
This will be a landslide win.

699
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:10,585
- He only needs one more point to win.
- That's great.

700
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:12,003
SNU'S JUN-HYEONG: 4
KAIST'S GI-HYEON: 10

701
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,089
I haven't solved that one yet.

702
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:15,965
We would have lost even if I was playing.

703
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:17,967
Gi-hyeon is so good at this.

704
00:45:18,718 --> 00:45:20,220
Team SNU's Cho Jun-hyeong.

705
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,015
I'll go with 2 in E5.

706
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,142
That cell is already occupied.

707
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:31,106
I'll go with 3 in D4.

708
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:35,944
D4, 3.

709
00:45:37,445 --> 00:45:38,405
That is correct.

710
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:42,200
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon won 11 points.

711
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:44,077
He has solved the majority of the cells.

712
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:46,830
The game goes
to Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

713
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:48,039
KAIST PROCEEDS TO THE FINALS

714
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:53,503
We beat Team SNU.

715
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:55,672
Gi-hyeon is great
in both Sudoku and memorization.

716
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:57,215
No one will beat him at this game.

717
00:45:57,298 --> 00:45:58,383
What's his secret?

718
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:00,635
That'll completely grind you down.

719
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:05,890
- You're so good. Thanks for the game.
- Thank you.

720
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:11,938
Gi-hyeon the Great.

721
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:16,067
We survived the Deathmatch
and won the last main match as well.

722
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:18,862
I didn't want to break the streak
with this benefit match.

723
00:46:18,945 --> 00:46:22,615
That bolstered my determination
to win and secure the benefit.

724
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,454
There was a cell I had my eye on,
but Gi-hyeon just filled it up.

725
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:29,330
I've now lost three times to Gi-hyeon.

726
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,959
The runner-up in Ace Selection
is a worthy opponent, right?

727
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:35,795
I don't think Jun-hyeong lost
because he wasn't good enough.

728
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:38,131
I just think Gi-hyeon
was overwhelmingly good.

729
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:40,383
He was like a human hurricane.

730
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:46,097
I'm sorry. I'm just so focused
on finding ways to beat Gi-hyeon.

731
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,683
I can't think of anything else.

732
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:54,814
We'll now begin Group B's game
of the benefit match, Blind Sudoku.

733
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:57,108
TEAM YONSEI, PARK SE-HWAN

734
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:58,610
You got this.

735
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:02,781
Let me get the door for you.

736
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:04,532
Just relax, Jin-hyeon.

737
00:47:05,116 --> 00:47:05,950
Team POSTECH!

738
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,578
TEAM POSTECH, CHOI JIN-HYEON

739
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:15,377
How many cells did you memorize?

740
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:17,587
I got one or two.

741
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:19,214
I didn't get any.

742
00:47:22,717 --> 00:47:24,552
I was the best on my team at this game.

743
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:28,014
When I saw that I was against Jin-hyeon,
I felt confident that I could win.

744
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:30,475
My specialty being memorization,

745
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:33,853
I was confident I could easily win it
as long as I played my strengths well.

746
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:35,647
We've got good vibes going today.

747
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,524
We're like Team KAIST
after their Deathmatch.

748
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:40,944
Jin-hyeon's super confident today,
so he won't get nervous.

749
00:47:41,027 --> 00:47:43,530
- Agreed.
- This is his time to shine.

750
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,407
Come on, Se-hwan.

751
00:47:47,617 --> 00:47:49,160
You can do this.

752
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:52,747
Here is your board.

753
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:01,589
That's crazy.
The upper right section's empty.

754
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:04,259
That's insane.
That whole section is empty.

755
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:08,263
That's rough. It gets tougher
if an entire block is empty.

756
00:48:09,764 --> 00:48:12,183
The one-to-one match
makes it so easy to watch.

757
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:13,893
TEAM YONSEI IS RELAXED
It really does, doesn't it?

758
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:17,605
- This is the best solution for this game.
- It's all thanks to my epiphany.

759
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:21,192
Look. I had a eureka moment
while coming up with sample questions.

760
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:22,944
There's a way to solve these quickly.

761
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:25,238
Remember that this is
different from regular Sudoku. Look.

762
00:48:25,947 --> 00:48:30,618
These two areas
should match up one-to-one.

763
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:31,745
Because of that...

764
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:33,747
ONE-TO-ONE MATCH

765
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:39,669
Blind Sudoku uses a 6-by-6 board,
which grants it a distinct property.

766
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:43,631
The upper and lower rows of blocks
that are positioned side-by-side

767
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:47,177
consist of numbers
that are equal to each other.

768
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:51,723
Let us draw a line between the rows
of the neighboring blocks.

769
00:48:51,806 --> 00:48:57,562
No numbers can be repeated
in the upper row of these two blocks.

770
00:48:57,645 --> 00:48:59,230
So naturally,

771
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:04,027
the numbers in the upper row
must match the bottom row numbers.

772
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:06,613
With this knowledge in mind,

773
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:11,618
the blank cells can be filled in quickly
just by comparing three cells at a time.

774
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:14,579
Because they match,
we can fill these up with 5, 2, and 3.

775
00:49:14,662 --> 00:49:16,164
So, they match one-to-one.

776
00:49:16,247 --> 00:49:19,959
The remaining rows should match, too,
so we can place a one up here.

777
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:21,961
I never thought
about looking for matching pairs.

778
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:23,838
It works because each block has six cells.

779
00:49:23,922 --> 00:49:25,840
- This is the quickest solution.
- You're right.

780
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:29,928
Please name a location and a number.

781
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:31,554
I'll go with 2 in E3.

782
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:33,890
That is correct.

783
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:40,814
ONE-TO-ONE MATCH

784
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:42,482
I'll go with 6 in B4.

785
00:49:43,274 --> 00:49:44,275
That is correct.

786
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:46,945
Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan won one point.

787
00:49:47,028 --> 00:49:50,031
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 2
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 1

788
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,783
I'll go with 3 in A3.

789
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:53,993
I'll go with 6 in C2.

790
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,829
I'll go with 6 in D1.

791
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:57,706
That is correct.

792
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:01,251
GAINS 8 CONSECUTIVE POINTS
Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan won 1 point.

793
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:02,794
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 8
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 6

794
00:50:02,877 --> 00:50:04,671
Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan...

795
00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:07,507
He hasn't made a single mistake.

796
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,384
I'm glad we chose him to be our rep.

797
00:50:10,176 --> 00:50:11,553
Damn it.

798
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:13,430
He solved all those cells?

799
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:16,016
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

800
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:19,144
I'll go with 3 in E2.

801
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,730
E2, 3. That is incorrect.

802
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,233
Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan.

803
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:27,110
I'll go with 1 in D4.

804
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,822
D4, 1. That is correct.

805
00:50:30,905 --> 00:50:32,490
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 9
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 6

806
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:34,242
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

807
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:38,163
I'll go...

808
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:42,375
with 1 in E1.

809
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:46,713
That is correct.

810
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:48,757
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 9
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 7

811
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,384
- Great.
- He got it.

812
00:50:51,968 --> 00:50:53,928
- And that didn't work out.
- Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan.

813
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:55,722
The next answer would be 5 in E2.

814
00:50:57,932 --> 00:50:59,851
I'll go with 2 in E2.

815
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:00,977
That is incorrect.

816
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:04,356
He hasn't got a clue.

817
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:05,940
Man, we're in trouble.

818
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:07,567
Hold on, this is bad.

819
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,569
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

820
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,530
Please go with 5 in E2.

821
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:14,324
I'll go with 5 in E2.

822
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:15,950
That is correct.

823
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:19,996
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
won one point.

824
00:51:20,497 --> 00:51:22,248
There are three cells remaining.

825
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:27,087
I'll go with 3 in D2.

826
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,546
D2, 3.

827
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,007
That is correct.

828
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:33,885
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 10
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 8

829
00:51:33,968 --> 00:51:35,595
Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan.

830
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:38,556
He needs 11 points to win.
We're at match point now.

831
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:40,642
We need a draw.

832
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:44,104
If Jin-hyeon doesn't get it
but Se-hwan does, we're done.

833
00:51:44,187 --> 00:51:46,272
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

834
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:47,899
I'll go with 4 in F2.

835
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:51,319
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 10
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 8

836
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:52,862
F2, 4.

837
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:55,657
That is correct.

838
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,493
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
won one point.

839
00:51:59,285 --> 00:52:01,162
We're still in it. This is so dramatic.

840
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:02,372
This is too much.

841
00:52:02,455 --> 00:52:04,207
Damn it.

842
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,750
It's 10 points to 9.

843
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,711
They're so evenly matched.

844
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:10,213
- Why are they so good?
- Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan.

845
00:52:10,296 --> 00:52:11,923
Please name a location and a number.

846
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:13,967
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 10
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 9

847
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,807
I'll go with 1 in E4.

848
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:28,231
That cell is already occupied.

849
00:52:28,314 --> 00:52:29,774
This is nuts.

850
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:31,526
- Please.
- Come on.

851
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:34,070
Please.

852
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,407
I'm sending you good vibes
from the whole universe.

853
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:40,744
JIN-HYEON COULD END THE GAME IN A DRAW

854
00:52:41,786 --> 00:52:44,622
I'll go with 5 in F4.

855
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:49,878
F4, 5.

856
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:51,087
That is correct.

857
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:55,592
The final score is 10 to 10. It's a draw.

858
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:05,518
Settle down, Team Yonsei!

859
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:08,021
Jin-hyeon is on fire today!

860
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:09,898
Damn it.

861
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:12,692
How did he manage to catch up in the end?

862
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:18,573
The game has ended in a 10-to-10 draw.

863
00:53:18,656 --> 00:53:20,784
We'll have a re-match.

864
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:25,663
You've got some skills.

865
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:27,832
I forgot everything by the end of it.

866
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,959
- Right?
- But you got them right.

867
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:35,340
After hearing the re-match announcement,
I thought beating him might not be easy.

868
00:53:36,007 --> 00:53:37,550
Once the game finished as a draw,

869
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:41,763
I told myself I should be on my toes
and do my absolute best from now on.

870
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:48,228
We'll now begin the re-match
between Team POSTECH and Team Yonsei.

871
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:52,190
Here's your board for Blind Sudoku.

872
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:00,740
This one looks tricky to memorize.

873
00:54:02,992 --> 00:54:04,953
That one really looks difficult.

874
00:54:05,036 --> 00:54:06,454
Isn't that way too difficult?

875
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:09,332
They left out number two. That's why.

876
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,542
I knew something was off.

877
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,877
The key lies in memorizing
where the empty cells are.

878
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:15,463
Here's how I'll do it.
I'm going to make dance moves.

879
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,009
Like this.

880
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:20,260
LIKE THIS?

881
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:22,846
- It kind of goes like this.
- Show me all the moves.

882
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:30,687
Doesn't this help you remember?

883
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:39,362
Guys, remember this hack.
Memorize with dance moves.

884
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:41,865
Lee Ju-yeong's memory hack.

885
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:45,827
What do you think?
You got them memorized, didn't you?

886
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,078
I know it helped you.

887
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:03,011
The time for memorization is over.

888
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:06,264
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon
will take his turn first.

889
00:55:06,848 --> 00:55:08,683
I'll go with 2 in C2.

890
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:10,852
C2, 2. That is correct.

891
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:13,438
Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan.

892
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:16,107
I'll go with 2 in A3.

893
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:18,276
A3, 2. That is correct.

894
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:21,321
I'll go with 1 in D1.

895
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:23,782
D1, 1. That is correct.

896
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,410
Jin-hyeon will take the match.

897
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:29,412
He's like a memorization maniac.

898
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,539
I'll go with 5 in C3.

899
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:32,665
That is correct.

900
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,251
Great. Show them what you got, Se-hwan.

901
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:38,088
I'll go with 6 in B4.

902
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:40,006
I'll go with 6 in E3.

903
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:42,175
That is correct.

904
00:55:42,717 --> 00:55:43,927
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 3
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 3

905
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:49,182
Let's do this. We're going to win.

906
00:55:55,438 --> 00:55:57,273
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

907
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:58,858
I'll go with 2 in D4.

908
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:00,610
I'll go with 4 in F6.

909
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:02,278
I'll go with 5 in E4.

910
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:03,697
I'll go with 6 in A5.

911
00:56:04,572 --> 00:56:05,532
That is correct.

912
00:56:08,326 --> 00:56:09,577
We might have another draw.

913
00:56:10,286 --> 00:56:12,163
Those two are way too good.

914
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:14,791
They're so good at memorizing.
How are they doing it?

915
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,585
I was beginning to wonder,
"Does Se-hwan never mess up?"

916
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:18,962
He was really good.

917
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:20,964
It really made me realize

918
00:56:21,047 --> 00:56:23,842
how much the Deathmatch
improves the survivors' skills.

919
00:56:24,926 --> 00:56:26,761
I'll go with 2 in E6.

920
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:28,054
E6, 2.

921
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:30,015
That is correct.

922
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:32,642
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 5
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 6

923
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:36,062
I'll go with 6 in E3.
Sorry, I meant 6 in D3.

924
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,066
That cell is already occupied.

925
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:44,237
Yes, Se-hwan chose an occupied cell.

926
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,405
That's not good.

927
00:56:45,488 --> 00:56:47,949
A mistake like that
would shake you up badly.

928
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:50,368
If you make that mistake,
you need to memorize it all over again.

929
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:54,456
I messed up once,
and I started to have a meltdown.

930
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:56,207
I'll go with 6 in C2.

931
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:57,876
That cell is already occupied.

932
00:56:57,959 --> 00:57:00,545
I'll go with 6 in C1.

933
00:57:00,628 --> 00:57:03,465
- "That cell is already occupied."
- That cell is already occupied.

934
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:08,762
- Se-hwan's completely lost it now.
- You're right.

935
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:13,641
- This can't be.
- Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

936
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:17,270
I'll go with 5 in F5.

937
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:20,523
I'll go with 2 in B5.

938
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:21,608
That is correct.

939
00:57:22,233 --> 00:57:24,861
Jin-hyeon has the upper hand now.

940
00:57:25,278 --> 00:57:27,530
TEAM POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON
HAS A 3-POINT LEAD

941
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:31,201
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 5
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 8

942
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:32,786
I could sense Se-hwan's nerves.

943
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:35,955
That's when I felt certain
I had it in the bag.

944
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:38,833
I'll go with 1 in B6.

945
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:40,418
B6, 1.

946
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:41,586
That is correct.

947
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,047
I'll go with 6 in F2.

948
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,256
That is correct.

949
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:47,759
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 5
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 10

950
00:57:52,055 --> 00:57:53,598
- We won.
- We did.

951
00:57:56,434 --> 00:57:57,435
We lost this one.

952
00:58:01,606 --> 00:58:03,024
Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan.

953
00:58:03,983 --> 00:58:06,444
I'll go with 2 in F1.

954
00:58:06,528 --> 00:58:07,987
F1, 2.

955
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:09,072
That is correct.

956
00:58:09,739 --> 00:58:11,616
What? How did he figure that out?

957
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,077
- It's all right.
- We can still win this.

958
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:16,204
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

959
00:58:16,287 --> 00:58:18,123
I'll go with 5 in E2.

960
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:23,044
E2, 5.

961
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:27,173
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 6
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 10

962
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:29,092
Please.

963
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:33,346
That is incorrect.

964
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:37,809
He didn't know it.

965
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:39,853
Come on, dude!

966
00:58:39,936 --> 00:58:41,187
We just need one more.

967
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:44,399
I told myself I should stay on my toes
and not miss that chance.

968
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:47,861
I'll go with 3 in E2.

969
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:49,863
E2, 3.

970
00:58:49,946 --> 00:58:51,156
That is correct.

971
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:52,240
That is correct.

972
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:55,160
That is correct.

973
00:58:55,243 --> 00:58:57,829
He's keeping our hopes up again.

974
00:58:58,204 --> 00:59:00,123
Hold on.

975
00:59:01,082 --> 00:59:02,584
There are three cells remaining.

976
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,341
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

977
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:12,260
I'll go with 3 in B1.

978
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:14,054
B1, 3.

979
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:19,100
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 7
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 10

980
00:59:20,268 --> 00:59:21,478
That is incorrect.

981
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,606
That is incorrect.

982
00:59:24,689 --> 00:59:27,359
- What's gotten into him?
- We're in trouble.

983
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:28,902
I'll go with 3 in A1.

984
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,154
A1, 3.

985
00:59:33,156 --> 00:59:34,157
That is correct.

986
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:36,868
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 8
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 10

987
00:59:36,951 --> 00:59:38,286
He's good.

988
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,247
They're keeping us on the edge
until the very end.

989
00:59:41,581 --> 00:59:43,541
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

990
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:44,793
I'll go...

991
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:50,340
with 4 in B1.

992
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:52,759
B1, 4.

993
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:54,552
That is incorrect.

994
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:56,304
That is incorrect.

995
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:58,765
The only missing number is five.
They should call it.

996
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:01,601
If Se-hwan gets this right,
I'm going to get my hopes up.

997
01:00:02,143 --> 01:00:03,603
I'll go with 5 in B1.

998
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:05,021
That is correct.

999
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:06,815
That is correct.

1000
01:00:06,898 --> 01:00:08,775
Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan.

1001
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:09,984
This is insane.

1002
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:11,653
What's up with him, really?

1003
01:00:12,278 --> 01:00:14,197
This is the reverse of the first game.

1004
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,950
We're closing the gap on Team POSTECH.

1005
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:19,994
They might end up setting a record
of the most draws on this show.

1006
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:23,415
There is one cell remaining.

1007
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:25,625
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 9
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 10

1008
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:29,129
SE-HWAN COULD WIN THE POINT
TO INITIATE ANOTHER RE-MATCH

1009
01:00:29,212 --> 01:00:31,673
How can the game still be going
with only one cell left?

1010
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,510
Their heads are going to spin
if they have another re-match.

1011
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:38,596
I hope they get exhausted after this
and give up the final round.

1012
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:41,016
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

1013
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:47,313
YONSEI'S SE-HWAN: 9
POSTECH'S JIN-HYEON: 10

1014
01:01:29,397 --> 01:01:31,399
