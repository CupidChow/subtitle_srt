00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,093
<i>The first person who got it right</i>
<i>is from Team SNU.</i>

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,511
ELITE LEAGUE SEASON 1: WINNER
<i>It's Jung Hyun-bin.</i>

3
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,512
Can I guess the hidden number?

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,014
He's incredible.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,515
I'll go with I11, G8, and J9...

6
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,101
<i>Team SNU's Jung Hyun-bin</i>
<i>has connected five stones.</i>

7
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,019
Game over.

8
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:20,979
YUK JUN-HYEONG, TEAM SNU

9
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:24,065
I managed to get answers faster
than the contestants on the show.

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,110
KIM GYU-MIN, TEAM SNU
I remember finding the answers

11
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,237
faster than the contestants did.

12
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,156
<i>That was beyond human.</i>

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,991
<i>They're totally killing it.</i>

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,493
<i>They seem confident about everything.</i>

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,746
<i>They have four Hyun-bins.</i>

16
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,331
You're toast if you meet us
at the Deathmatch.

17
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,292
<i>Losing is not in my vocabulary.</i>

18
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,752
Am I intimidated?

19
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,672
No, I'm not.

20
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,798
We'll win, anyway.

21
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,093
Honestly, I don't think
their team's that great.

22
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,346
<i>He's insane.</i>
<i>He memorizes everything on sight.</i>

23
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,972
<i>We're up against a monster.</i>

24
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,432
<i>They've maxed out their stats.</i>

25
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,975
<i>They seriously can't be human.</i>

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,311
SNU - KU - YONSEI - KAIST - POSTECH
THE RANKS ARE ABOUT TO CHANGE AGAIN

27
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,606
<i>This is Elite League.</i>
<i>A pure brainpower survival challenge.</i>

<i>The battle of geniuses</i>

31
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,619
<i>The new season comes with a few changes.</i>

32
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,415
<i>Those who face elimination</i>

<i>will be granted a game-changing perk</i>
<i>that will affect the main match.</i>

39
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,271
That's amazing.

40
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,316
- Let's go, Team KAIST!
- Let's go, Team KAIST!

41
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,028
<i>The advanced difficulty of the games</i>

42
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,573
<i>will push the contestants</i>
<i>to use their abilities to their fullest.</i>

43
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,743
<i>The first season was nothing.</i>

44
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,203
<i>These games are insane.</i>

45
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,080
<i>I never imagined it'd be like this.</i>

46
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,498
<i>That's insane.</i>

47
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,208
<i>All I can say is, "Holy shit."</i>

48
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,343
<i>The winning team will be awarded</i>
<i>a scholarship of 80 million won in total.</i>

49
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,223
<i>A battle of wits</i>
<i>between the top 1% of Korea.</i>

50
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:24,102
<i>The competition will begin once again.</i>

51
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,209
We're the first ones.

52
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,669
It's that way.

53
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,048
Is that our base camp?

54
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,090
Yes, it must be.

55
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,217
- It looks much cooler.
- It sure does.

56
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,219
It almost looks like a temple.

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,806
Are the teams arranged
according to the last season's results?

58
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,016
Yeah, I think so.

59
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,518
- They're all mixed up.
- The winner, the runner-up, and so on.

60
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,729
SNU, KU, YONSEI, KAIST, POSTECH

61
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,899
We must be first on set
since Team SNU won last time.

62
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,150
KIM GYU-MIN, TEAM SNU

63
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,070
- I can't wait to meet other contestants.
- Same here.

64
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,199
Hello. I'm known
as the genius from Geoje Island.

65
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,576
I attended Daegu Science High
and entered SNU.

66
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,120
My name is Woo Su-han
and I started studying

67
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,040
electrical and computer engineering
at SNU in 2024.

68
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,918
I came in second in the pre-test.

69
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,672
I would have solved it
even if I tried in ninth grade.

70
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,216
I'm a natural-born mathematician.

71
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,302
I'm Cho Jun-hyeong, and I got
into SNU School of Dentistry in 2024.

72
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,806
I mastered calculus
when I was in eighth grade,

73
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,809
completing it in just one month
over my summer break.

74
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,602
CHO JUN-HYEONG, DENTISTRY

75
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,062

Hello.

79
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,944
Hi.

80
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:57,946
I knew it. It's Team KU.

81
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,531
- Hello.
- Welcome.

82
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,992
- Hi.
- Hello.

83
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:05,995
Wait.

84
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,997
He does resemble Son Suk-ku.

85
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,710
He really does. I can totally see it.

86
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,837
<i>Hello. I'm known as the Son Suk-ku</i>
<i>of Korea University.</i>

87
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,588
I graduated third in my class
at Sejong Science High.

88
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,758
I'm Lee Hyeon-seung,
and I entered KU Medical School in 2020.

89
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,510
I have a GPA of 4.36 out of 4.5.

90
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,096
I'm Choi Seong-hyeon,
an integrative energy engineering major.

91
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,765
I entered KU in 2022,
and I'm currently 21 years old.

92
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,809
I'm very competitive,
and I love strategy games.

93
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,728
I got into KU
without any private tutoring.

94
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,813
I started studying
industrial management engineering in 2022.

95
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,064
My name is Seo Ha-eun.

96

They all look so smart.

101

KANG RA-EL, TEAM KU
But don't you think

102
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,827
- they look pretty young?
- Yeah, they do.

103
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,454
- Who are they?
- It must be the next group.

104
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,413
It's Team Yonsei.

105
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,751
How come we're in the middle?

106
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,045
The main characters
always take the center.

107
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,671
- That's true.
- It feels just right.

108
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,548
It means we're handsome.

109
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,675
Good looking enough to take center stage.

110
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,012
I was an honors student
at Daejeon Science High.

111
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,098
I'm Yang Hyeon-seung, and I entered
Yonsei Medical School in 2022.

112
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:11,061
I was the top student of my class
for about half of my high school career.

113
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,022
I won the Talent Award of Korea
and represented Korea

114
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,815
in the International Science
and Engineering Fair.

115
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,193
I'm Lee Seung-chan, a system semiconductor
and engineering major.

116
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,736

They're all so tall.

122
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,790
That must be him.

123
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,166
- Is he the KAIST hottie?
- The guy at the front.

124
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,335
- Our own Son Suk-ku's hotter.
- The one leading them?

125
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,420
- Hands down.
- Oh, that must be him.

126
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,673
They must've introduced some new changes.

127
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,132
- There must be.
- That's what I think.

128
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:45,178
The first season's contestants,
were all blindsided by the producers, too.

129
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,682
I received many acceptance letters,
and chose KAIST over med schools.

130
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,476
I'm Oh Hyeong-seok,
a student at KAIST School of Computing.

131
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,688
I didn't do badly in the CSAT,
but my grades did slip just a bit.

132
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,481
I had five wrong answers in total.

133
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,734
A lot of people advised me
to enroll in a med school,

134
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,196
but choosing my major
was my first choice as an adult.

135
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,740
So I felt that if I blindly followed
other people's opinions,

136
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,119
it wouldn't be easy for me
to make my own decisions later in life.

137
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,080
I suppose you could say
I followed my heart.

138
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,709
I received awards in every competition
held by Incheon Science High,

139
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,419
and also got a scholarship
from my department.

140
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,921

I can win against anyone
in those kinds of games.

154
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,705
I pulled my grade up from the top 150
to the top 10 in high school.

I'm Ha Min-su,

00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,269
It seems we're the youngest on the whole.

167

Yes.

168

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,690
I recognize the second guy in the row.

170
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,026
He's the one
who started Seoul Science High early.

171
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,737
He even has the look
of a professor already.

172
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,530
I bet he's super smart.

173
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,115
Hello.

174
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,827
I graduated middle school early
and started Seoul Science High early.

175
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,954
I won a gold medal
in the Korean Mathematical Olympiad

176
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,915
and placed first in the pre-test.

177
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,418
I'm Kim Gyu-min, and I started studying
mathematical science at SNU in 2024.

178
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,504
<i>You wrote down "intellect" as your charm.</i>

179
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,174
Well, I couldn't come up
with anything else.

180
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,552
- The one-on-one room intrigues me.
- Right.

181
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,137
Look, guys.

182
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,722
They have two one-on-one rooms.

183
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,266
Why are there two of them?

184
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,061
Seeing how they have two of them...

185
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,688
There might be simultaneous matches.

186
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,356
Are you confident about one-on-ones?

187
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,941
I wouldn't be Team SNU if I wasn't.

188
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,693
Of course. That's a given.

189
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,069
Fake it even if you aren't.

190
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,696
My nerves are getting to me.

191
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,531
Really? Just relax.

192
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,202
This will be fun.

193
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:18,498
<i>Contestants of Elite League,</i>
<i>the brainpower survival challenge.</i>

194
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,749
<i>Welcome.</i>

195
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,920
<i>The first game to open the new season</i>

196
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,714
<i>is a benefit match.</i>

197
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:26,715
BENEFIT MATCH

198
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,802
<i>We'll now begin</i>
<i>today's benefit match, the Ace Selection.</i>

199
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,512
What the heck?

200
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,305
Is it starting already?

201
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,599
<i>In the Ace Selection,</i>

202
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,185
<i>all contestants will participate</i>
<i>in the same game</i>

203
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,522
<i>until a single contestant emerges</i>
<i>as the Ace of all players.</i>

204
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:47,736
<i>In other words, this will determine</i>
<i>the strongest among the 20 contestants.</i>

205
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,029
- What?
- What?

206
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,989
They'll be the top player, then.

207
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,365
That was unexpected.

208
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,536
<i>This will determine</i>
<i>who the strongest player is.</i>

209
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,998
<i>One cycle consists</i>
<i>of four different types of games.</i>

210
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,791
<i>And as the game progresses,</i>

211
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,627
<i>the allotted time will diminish</i>
<i>by ten seconds each cycle.</i>

212
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,712
10-SECOND REDUCTION PER CYCLE

213
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,214
<i>If you fail to answer</i>
<i>within the time limit</i>

214
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,717
<i>or type in a wrong answer,</i>
<i>you'll be eliminated.</i>

215
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,761
<i>The eliminated contestants</i>
<i>will have to return to the base camp,</i>

216
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:16,431
<i>while the remaining contestants</i>
<i>continue on with the game.</i>

217
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,975
A wrong answer will get you eliminated,

218
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,853
so we'd better take the time
to get the answer right.

219
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,938
Let's take it slow
and use all the time we have.

220
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,235
<i>The Ace Selection winner's team</i>

221
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,196
<i>will be given a substantial benefit</i>

222
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,324
<i>that can affect the results</i>
<i>of today's main match.</i>

223
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,661
<i>Here are the four types of games</i>
<i>you'll face in the Ace Selection.</i>

224
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,289
ACE SELECTION
GAMES

225
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,084
BINARY CHOICE, RANK THE AREA,
PIXEL NUMBER 2, ZERO-SUM GAME

226
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,043
"Zero-sum Game"?

227
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,920
I wonder what that could be.

228
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,463
"Rank the Area"?

229
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,257
- I wonder what Binary Choice is about.
- Same here.

230
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,843
<i>The first game is Binary Choice.</i>

231
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,014
<i>Two calculation problems</i>
<i>will be displayed on the screen.</i>

232
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,140
EXAMPLE QUESTION

233
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,600
<i>Compare the two results,</i>

234
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:05,021
<i>and type in the bigger number</i>
<i>within the time limit.</i>

235
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,526
- Ignoring the hundreds could help.
- They might be the same.

236
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,361
Do a side-by-side comparison.

237
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,487
With 420 and 425,

238
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,281
just think about the 5
and ignore the shared 420.

239
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,492
That's what I was thinking, too.

240
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,620
Considering the time limit that's given,

241
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,248
I thought there'd be no chance
for me to get it wrong.

242
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:27,085
I calculate numbers pretty quickly,
so I wasn't really worried about the game.

243
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,088
What is 87 multiplied by 92?

244
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,174
That's 8004.

245
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,970
There's no secret.
I just do it in my head quickly.

246
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,973
I graduated early
from Busan Science High School

247
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,183
and was accepted by KAIST and SNU.

248
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:46,146
I'm Park Ji-seong, and I'm majoring
in electrical engineering at KAIST.

249
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,190
<i>The second game is Rank the Area.</i>

250
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,027
<i>There will be four different areas.</i>

251
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,280
<i>You must rank these areas by size</i>
<i>in descending order.</i>

252
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,489
81 CELLS IN TOTAL

253
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,033
1: 24 CELLS, 2: 15 CELLS,
3: 16 CELLS, 4: 26 CELLS

254
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,786
I don't see any tricks for this one.
You just need to be intuitive.

255
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,789
- You'd have to integrate it in your head.
- This one's so hard.

256
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,126
<i>The third game is Pixel Number Two.</i>

257
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,172
<i>You'll be presented</i>
<i>with 2 sets of 6 pixel cards.</i>

258
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,717
<i>First, layer up the red pixel Cards</i>
<i>and the blue pixel Cards.</i>

259
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,970
<i>Then, disregard the areas</i>
<i>where the two sets overlap,</i>

260
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,640
<i>which will leave you with a number</i>
<i>to be typed in as the answer.</i>

261
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,812
This is totally insane.

262
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,650
I think that's easier
than the one from last season.

263
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,568
I agree.

264
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,030
<i>The fourth game is the Zero-sum Game.</i>

265
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,908
<i>You must memorize 18 numbers first.</i>

266
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,077
<i>And when two numbers are given,</i>

267
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,998
<i>you must remember which numbers</i>
<i>will turn them into a zero</i>

268
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,875
<i>and type in their location as your answer.</i>

269
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,210
WHICH NUMBERS WILL TURN -3 AND 8 INTO 0?

270
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:54,714
<i>The Ace Selection games will now begin.</i>

271
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:04,057
OH HYEONG-SEOK, TEAM KAIST
<i>I'll probably make it to the top two.</i>

272
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,894
LEE HYEON-SEUNG, TEAM KU
<i>It'll be a chance to show them who I am.</i>

273
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,897
KIM GYU-MIN, TEAM SNU
<i>I liked my chances,</i>

274
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,732
<i>since I came first in the pre-test.</i>

275
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,111
The benefit match
for the Ace Selection will now begin.

276
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,196
This is the first cycle.

277
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,074
Let's begin Binary Choice.

278
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,369
You'll be given two minutes
for each question.

279
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,870
ACE SELECTION
CYCLE 1 TIME LIMIT: 2 MINUTES

280
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,247
Here is your question.

281
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,142
You have 30 seconds remaining
to type in your answer.

282
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,525
Ten seconds remaining.

283
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,029
That concludes the game.

284
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,698
<i>The answer</i>

285
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,325
<i>is 3082.</i>

286
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,248
The eliminated contestants are...

287
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,544
Team KAIST, Choi Yu-chan...

288
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,796
CHOI YU-CHAN IS ELIMINATED

289
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,840

Cho Jun-hyeong.

293
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,225
CHO JUN-HYEONG IS ELIMINATED

294
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,978
Please go to your base camp
if you were eliminated.

295
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,110
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

296
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,533
I should've typed in the bigger number,
but I went with the smaller one.

297
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,954
<i>Being eliminated after the first question</i>

298
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,082
<i>definitely affected my confidence.</i>

299
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,293
Moving on, we'll now begin Rank the Area.

300
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,587
Here's your question.

301
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:05,387
JEON JI-SEONG, TEAM POSTECH
<i>This is the game I felt most easy about.</i>

302
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,890
<i>The correct order came to my mind</i>
<i>as soon as I saw it.</i>

303
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,184
KANG RA-EL, TEAM KU
<i>To be honest,</i>

304
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,894
<i>the area game was pretty easy.</i>

305
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:17,357
<i>You can divide it into rectangles</i>
<i>and simply count the leftover areas.</i>

306
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,526
You have ten seconds.

307
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,573
That concludes the game.

308
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,033
<i>The answer</i>

309
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,786
<i>is 3, 2, 1, 4.</i>

1: 18 CELLS, 2: 20 CELLS,
3: 26 CELLS, 4: 17 CELLS

311
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,747
The eliminated contestant is...

312
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,334
Team KU, Lee Hyeon-seung.

313
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,419
LEE HYEON-SEUNG IS ELIMINATED

314
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,882
TEAM KU'S BASE CAMP
We will go on to the next question.

315
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,011
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>Didn't I submit the right answer?</i>

316
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,432
<i>I was so embarrassed.</i>

317
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,226
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

318
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,439
Everyone on Team Yonsei survived.

319
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,359
TEAM YONSEI IS THE ONLY TEAM
WITHOUT ANY ELIMINATIONS

320
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,111
That's intimidating.

321
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,782
<i>Seeing as we had no eliminations</i>
<i>until the very end,</i>

322
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,160
<i>it felt like we made a great start.</i>

323
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,079
I was the top student
at Gyeonggibuk Science High

324
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,456
and came third in the pre-test.

325
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:18,835
I'm Park Se-hwan, and I entered
Yonsei's School of Dentistry in 2024.

326
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,713
I always placed first in math
while I was in high school,

327
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:22,964
so, yes, I'm good.

328
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,759
Hello, everyone.
I'm a geek in love with numbers.

329
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,136
I'm known as the math genius
of Gwangju Science High.

330
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,181
I'm Im Jeong-hun, and I'm studying
urban planning and engineering.

331
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,352
I'm dubbed the memorization beast
for recalling 2 to the 36th power

332
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,728
and 500 digits of Pi by heart.

333
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,898
I placed fourth in the pre-test.

334
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,192
Could you recite Pi for us?

335
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,235
Will I get a signal or something?

336
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,912
HE'S REACHED THE 100TH DIGIT

337
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,878
2X PLAY SPEED

338
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,801
That's about it.

339
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,221
MANAGED TO RECITE 504 DIGITS FROM MEMORY

340
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,348
I got excited about the shoot,

341
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,394
so I memorized an extra 60 digits
this morning to reach 500 digits.

342
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,314
Let's move on to the next question.

343
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,608
It's Pixel Number Two.

344
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,819
KANG RA-EL, TEAM KU

345
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:29,280
<i>As a viewer, I couldn't understand</i>
<i>why the contestants had such a hard time.</i>

346
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,909
<i>But I realized how stressful it was</i>
<i>trying to solve it myself.</i>

347
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,327
CHOI JIN-HYEON, POSTECH

348
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,579
<i>No matter how hard I tried,</i>
<i>I couldn't see the target number.</i>

349
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,707
<i>So, I was getting antsy,</i>
<i>unsure of what to do.</i>

350
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,083
You have 30 seconds.

351
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,712
<i>The announcements for</i>
<i>the remaining time made it even worse.</i>

352
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,255
You have ten seconds.

353
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,137
That concludes the game.

354
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,638
The answer...

355
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,392
<i>is 41.</i>

356
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,893

TEAM POSTECH'S BASE CAMP

364
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,505
These are the negatives.

365
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,799
- What?
- That's where they are.

366
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,718
<i>You have 20 seconds.</i>

367
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,512
You have ten seconds.

368
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,478
<i>Please type in your answers.</i>

369
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,734
The answers

370
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,820
<i>are 3 and 13.</i>

371
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,864
The eliminated contestants are...

372
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,618
Team KU's Seo Ha-eun...

373
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,952
SEO HA-EUN IS ELIMINATED

374
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,621

00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,464
...and Team POSTECH's Ha Min-su.

379
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,632
HA MIN-SU IS ELIMINATED

380
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,510
Please go to your base camp
if you were eliminated.

381
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,220
A TOTAL OF 4 CONTESTANTS ELIMINATED

382
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,262
I'm so upset.

383
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,807
I had all 15 numbers memorized perfectly,

384
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,060
but I ended up typing in
the location for 3 instead of -3.

385
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,395
Isn't it nerve-wracking?

386
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,106
I've never felt my heart
beat that fast before.

387
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,985
- It's all right.
- I got 3 and -3 mixed up.

388
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,779
So, I used a thumbs-up image

389
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,491
to remember the negative numbers,
but I mistook where the image should go.

390
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,953
<i>There are now</i>
<i>ten contestants left in the game.</i>

391
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:44,958
TEAM KU AND TEAM POSTECH
ONLY HAVE 1 CONTESTANT REMAINING

392
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,252
<i>It was a lot of pressure to deal with</i>

393
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,337
<i>to have the fate of my team</i>
<i>on my shoulders.</i>

394
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,133
I placed first in Korea
for the International Robot Olympiad

395
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,720
and chose to enter POSTECH
over SNU and KAIST.

396
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,763
I'm the youngest contestant this season.

397
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,808
My name is Jeon Ji-seong.
I'm a semiconductor engineering major.

398
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,769
- We put too much pressure on Ji-seong.
- Right.

399
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,062
I feel terrible already.

400
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,191
- Oh, please, Ra-el.
- Let's put our faith in her.

401
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,234
Let's pray for her.

402
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,613
<i>I knew I couldn't get eliminated now.</i>

403
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,075
I placed sixth in my class
at Korea Science Academy

404
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,869
and chose KU over KAIST.

405
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:24,080
My name is Kang Ra-el.
I got into KU Medical School in 2023.

406
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,332
As for my CSAT results,

407
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,127
I got the top grade
while only getting six questions wrong.

408
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,177
We will now begin the second cycle.

409
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,263
You will have
1 minute and 50 seconds for each question.

410
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,265
Here's your question.

411
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,189
The answer is 4361.

412
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:50,982
Here are the eliminations.

413
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,943
There are no eliminations.

414
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,197
We'll now begin Rank the Area.

415
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,788
<i>The answer is 4, 3, 2, 1.</i>

416

Here are the eliminations.

423

TEAM YONSEI'S BASE CAMP
Just by one pixel...

430
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,405
We all got eliminated
over Pixel Number Two.

431
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,656
It's so difficult.

432
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:44,703
<i>It was the same for Rank the Area,</i>
<i>Zero-sum Game, and Binary Choice.</i>

433
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,830
<i>I solved them in less than 30 seconds.</i>

434
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,749
<i>But I had to use</i>
<i>all two minutes for Pixel Number Two.</i>

435
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,419
<i>The aim of Ace Selection</i>

436
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,296
<i>is to find a true Ace with no weaknesses.</i>

437
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,424
<i>Calculation, reasoning,</i>

438
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,384
<i>spatial awareness, and memorization.</i>

439
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,636
<i>You have to excel in all four fields</i>

440
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,055
<i>to be the last person standing.</i>

441
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,683
<i>Let's begin the Zero-sum Game.</i>

442
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:11,229
THE ZERO-SUM GAME TOOK THE HIGHEST NUMBER
OF CONTESTANTS IN A SINGLE ROUND

443
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,940
<i>I am not worried about anything.</i>

444
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,943
<i>I think I'd do fine,</i>
<i>even with just 50 seconds.</i>

445
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,487
Here's your question.

NO ELIMINATIONS FOR 3 QUESTIONS IN A ROW

457
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,986
Those guys are the real deal.

458
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,321
They really are.

459
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,655
- Come on, Ra-el.
- They're all great.

460
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,741
Remember who they are.

461
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:06,576
<i>This won't be easy.</i>

462
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,827
<i>This is rough.</i>

463
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,580
Let's continue.

464
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,249
<i>We'll begin Pixel Number Two.</i>

465
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,007
<i>I merged the blue pixel Cards first.</i>

466
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,927
Then the shape of the areas
not covered by the blue pixels

467
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,721
narrowed down the options for the answer.

468
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:27,931
THE ONLY POSSIBLE ANSWER IS 1

469
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,600

TEAM KU IS COMPLETELY ELIMINATED

474
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,655
That was Ra-el's weak spot.

475
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,115
Team KU's Kang Ra-el.

476
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,075
Goodbye, Team KU.

- Good job.

482
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,341
- Well done.
- Good job hanging in there.

483
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,510
It must've been tough.

484
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:07,804
I'm exhausted.

485
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,431
- We're sorry.
- I mean,

486
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,182
I just couldn't do Pixel Number Two.

487
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,934
- It's too difficult.
- You still did great.

488
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:13,935
Don't worry about it.

489
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,563
- I don't know what to say. Sorry.
- Don't say that.

490
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,066

<i>I was my team's only remaining member.</i>

496
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,328
<i>So it was definitely getting to me.</i>

497
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,206
You can do this, Se-hwan.

498
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,586
Let's begin the third cycle
with Zero-sum Game

499
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,838
Here's your question.

500
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:54,684
The thing about memorization games
is that you get confused with each round.

501
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,687
I wonder if there's a trick
to memorizing it in time.

502
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,025
<i>I had no trouble memorizing.</i>

503
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:05,487
<i>I noticed numbers</i>
<i>that are particularly easy to memorize.</i>

504
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,325
<i>For instance, there was 128 and 256,</i>
<i>which are two consecutive powers of two.</i>

505
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,244
In the case of such recognizable numbers,

506
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:16,414
I didn't put much time
into memorizing them.

507
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,041
<i>As for the minus signs,</i>

508
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,378
<i>I memorized them separately</i>
<i>by applying color to them in my mind.</i>

509
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,798
<i>I'd then keep that mental image with me.</i>

510
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,049
<i>That was my strategy.</i>

511
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,010
<i>Please type in your answers.</i>

512
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:36,726
The answers

513
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,270
<i>are 9 and 5.</i>

514
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,486
- Please...
<i>- Here are the eliminations.</i>

515
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,279
Please, Se-hwan.

516
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,448
Here are the eliminations.

517
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,702
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong.

518
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:54,911
PARK JI-SEONG IS ELIMINATED

519
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,080
<i>Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong.</i>

520
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:00,709
Oh, no...

521
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:02,877
- Don't worry about it.
- You did well.

522
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,879
- It's such a bummer.
- You still did well.

523
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,506
- I placed fifth...
- And that's great.

524
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,967
- Don't worry about it.
- Let's root for Gi-hyeon.

525
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,385
- But--
- Oh, I'm so upset.

526
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,053
- I mixed up the signs.
- Right? Me, too.

527
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,680
I kept saying that to Yu-chan, too.

528
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,350
<i>Gi-hyeon was there with me the whole time,</i>

529
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,894
<i>so I hoped we could be</i>
<i>the top two contestants.</i>

530
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,813
<i>It's a shame that we couldn't.</i>

531
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,857
There are four contestants
left in the game.

532
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,316
<i>SNU, KAIST, and Yonsei?</i>

533
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,027
We have the most survivors.

534
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,236
I feel so reassured.

535
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,156
- He can make it.
- You can do it, Se-hwan.

536
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,116
We'll move on to the fourth cycle.

537
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,826
ACE SELECTION
TIME LIMIT: 1 MINUTE 30 SECONDS

538
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,870
Let's begin Binary Choice.

539
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:38,621
Here's your question.

540
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,215
I doubt anyone would get eliminated here.

541
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,177
We'll have to wait
until the time limit is down to a minute.

542
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,222
The answer is 2833.

543
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,767
Here are the eliminations.

544
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,560
- No eliminations.
- No eliminations.

545
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,146
There are no eliminations.

546
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,357
EVERYONE SURVIVES

547
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,941
Here's your question.

548
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:17,160
- This was the most challenging for me.
- Finding the area?

549
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,995
It's so easy to make a mistake.

550
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:22,624
This was so hard for me.
Gi-hyeon must be good at this.

551
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,002
<i>After counting the cells of each segment,</i>

552
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,172
I added the numbers
to see if they reached 81.

553
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,133
That was my approach
to be sure of the answer.

554
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,762
<i>As there are a total</i>
<i>of 81 cells on the board,</i>

555
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,764
<i>the sum of the count of cells</i>

556
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,183
<i>must reach 81 at all times.</i>

557
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,269
<i>Team KAIST's</i>
<i>Hwang Gi-hyeon utilized this fact</i>

558
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,022
<i>to do a quick review of his answer.</i>

559
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:47,857
The answer

560
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,193
<i>is 1, 4, 3, 2.</i>

561
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,113
<i>...is 1, 4, 3, 2.</i>

562
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,911
- I bet they all got it right.
<i>- Here are the eliminations.</i>

563
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,496
Here are the eliminations.

564
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,084
Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan.

565
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,878
<i>Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan.</i>

566
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,464
<i>Eliminated contestants,</i>
<i>please go to your base camps.</i>

567
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:12,924
He came in fourth.

568
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,302
It's between us and Team SNU.

569
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,846
Thank you, Gi-hyeon.

570
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:19,055
I'm so relieved.

571
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,352
We only need to beat one more.

572
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,896
Team KAIST and SNU
have noticeably strong players.

573
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,065
Three contestants are left in the game.

574
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:30,525
Well done.

575
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:32,360
Good job. You held out there long enough.

576
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:33,570
You did great.

577
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,365
4TH PLACE: YONSEI, PARK SE-HWAN
I almost had it.

578
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:38,616
Don't let it get you down.

579
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,244
We're going to win the main match anyway.

580
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:42,787
Right. That's what matters.

581
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,957
Three contestants are left in the game.

582
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,003
TEAM SNU: KIM GYU-MIN, YUK JUN-HYEONG

583
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,629
TEAM KAIST: HWANG GI-HYEON

584
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,299
Let's be the last two left.

585
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:56,301
We really should.

586
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:59,596
<i>I was never pressed</i>
<i>for time up to this point.</i>

587
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,140
<i>So, I kept thinking,</i>
<i>"This is more than doable."</i>

588
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,894
I got into SNU without any tutoring
and only got two wrong on my CSAT.

589
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:09,564
I'm Yuk Jun-hyeong.
I've been studying medicine since 2023.

590
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,274
While finishing off middle school,

591
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:14,402
I didn't take any online
or offline courses outside of school.

592
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:16,696
I studied by myself without any help.

593
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,491
I got one wrong in English
and another in Earth Science.

594
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:24,454
So, I had two wrong answers in total,
with the overall percentile rank at 100.

595
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:29,876
<i>I'm confident I can top Ace Selection</i>
<i>just as I topped the pre-test.</i>

596
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:30,919
KIM GYU-MIN, TEAM SNU

597
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,088
The last two on Team SNU are formidable.

598
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:34,798
You have to give it to Team SNU.

599
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,384
Do you think they'll take the win again?

600
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,387
That won't do. We have to win this year.

601
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,765
Gi-hyeon will do his best
to get us that benefit.

602
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:45,975
Come on, Gi-hyeon!

603
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:49,270
<i>I really wanted to beat Team SNU</i>

604
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:52,649
<i>and be helpful to our team</i>
<i>by taking the benefit.</i>

605
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,610
I was accepted by both KAIST and POSTECH.

606
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,029
I'm a chemistry nerd
and a romantic scientist.

607
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:02,075
I'm Hwang Gi-hyeon, a chemistry major
who started university in 2022.

608
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:05,161
I know Gi-hyeon well
because we've been roommates.

609
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:06,621
He's such a calm person.

610
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:08,289
- Right.
- He hardly gets nervous.

611
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,166
- So, he's levelheaded?
- Yes, exactly.

612
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:11,876
<i>I'm counting on you, Gi-hyeon.</i>

613
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:16,006
Here's your question.

614
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,638
The answer

615
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,598
<i>is 44.</i>

616
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:28,393
There are...

617
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,857
no eliminations.

618
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,108
<i>...no eliminations.</i>

619
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:38,111
ALL 3 CONTESTANTS SURVIVED
Let's begin the Zero-sum Game.

620
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:39,738
Here's your question.

621
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,831
- It's 3.14.
- Right, we have 3.14.

622
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,416
Then, there's 9, 8, 7, 2, 4, and 6.

623
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:54,169
There are 2 and 1,
with 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the middle.

624
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,546
So, you broke it down to 2-1 and 5-6-7-8?

625
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,507
<i>Please type in your answers.</i>

626
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,426
The answers

627
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:04,721
<i>are 17 and 5.</i>

628
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,806
Here are the eliminations.

629
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,350
There are no eliminations.

630
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,435
Again? That's amazing.

631
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,021
Watching all this makes me appreciate

632
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,608
how insanely good Hyun-bin was to memorize
19 four-digit numbers under 5 minutes.

633
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:17,984
Nineteen four-digit numbers?

634
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:20,570
Gyu-min memorized all 30 numbers.

635
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,031
PRELIMINARY MEETING

636
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,949
Speaking of the pre-test,

637
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:27,077
I completed the memorization question.

638
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,704
How is that even possible?

639
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:31,539
PRE-TEST'S MEMORIZATION QUESTION

640
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:34,626
THEY HAD TO MEMORIZE
30 THREE-DIGIT NUMBERS IN 4 MINUTES

641
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:36,544
Does time go slower for you?

642
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,840
That's better.

643
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,885
<i>- He can memorize 30 three-digit numbers?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

644
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,304
TIME LIMIT: 1 MINUTE 20 SECONDS
We'll move on to the fifth cycle.

645
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,473
Here's your question.

646
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:53,603
Three...

647
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,314
Twenty-one, thirty-one...

648
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,402
You have 30 seconds.

649
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,196
<i>- You have 30 seconds.</i>
- There's hardly any time.

650
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,662
<i>The answer is 3029.</i>

651
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:13,331
Here are the eliminations.

652
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:15,041
There are no eliminations.

653
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,836
- That's amazing.
- They're really impressive.

654
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,671
- They're so smart.
- I know, right?

655
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:21,464
We might not have the main match today.

656
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,050
Let's continue.

657
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,136
<i>Let's begin Rank the Area,</i>
<i>Pixel Number Two,</i>

658
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:28,346
<i>and Zero-sum Game.</i>

Here are the eliminations.

660
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:31,975
There are no eliminations.

661
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,518
ALL 4 QUESTIONS CORRECT IN CYCLE 5

662
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,769
That's incredible.

663
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,479
Those two are on another level.

664
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,024
Burn the midnight oil, you three.

665
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:45,071
<i>I liked my chances of winning the match.</i>

666
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,699
<i>Team KAIST's last member kept it up.</i>

667
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:49,492
<i>I didn't expect him to do so well.</i>

668
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,037
<i>I realized it wouldn't be a pushover.</i>

669
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,789
TIME LIMIT: 1 MINUTE 10 SECONDS
We'll move on to the sixth cycle.

670
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,417
Let's begin Binary Choice.

671
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,423
- That could get to you.
- Right.

672
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,050
It's getting difficult now.

673
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:08,845
The answer is 3132.

674
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,765
I think Team KAIST will get eliminated.

675
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:13,683
Actually, I know that he will.

676
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:15,727
Here are the eliminations.

677
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,025
Team SNU's...

678
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:27,614
Yuk Jun-hyeong.

679
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:30,700
YUK JUN-HYEONG IS ELIMINATED

680
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:31,910
There we go!

681
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,953
It's a match between the two professors.

682
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:35,413
It's you or him, Gi-hyeon.

683
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:42,671
I can't believe it.

684
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:45,840
How could it not be 3122?

685
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:47,926
Where did I go wrong?

686
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,179
ACE SELECTION
3RD PLACE: TEAM SNU, YUK JUN-HYEONG

687
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:52,305
<i>I wanted to come in second</i>

688
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,725
<i>and leave an impression</i>
<i>of Team SNU being the final two.</i>

689
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,269
<i>Well, it is what it is.</i>

690
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:01,064
Two contestants are left in the game.

691
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,235
<i>Gi-hyeon was a formidable opponent.</i>

692
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:08,947
<i>Even so,</i>
<i>I wanted to make it clear to everyone</i>

693
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,199
<i>that SNU is the best university around.</i>

694
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,454
<i>I didn't particularly feel nervous.</i>

695
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,540
<i>I told myself I could take the win</i>

696
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:21,543
<i>if I stayed on my toes and kept my cool.</i>

697
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:26,297
THE FINAL SHOWDOWN
BETWEEN TEAM SNU AND TEAM KAIST

698
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,091
Here's your question.

699
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,844
That's downright nasty.

700
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:37,392
<i>I felt confident about Rank the Area</i>
<i>because I trusted my intuitive senses.</i>

701
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,813
<i>I think I can manage</i>
<i>even with only 40 seconds.</i>

702
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:47,235
You can do this, Gyu-min.

703
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,322
I really hope Gi-hyeon can win.

704
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:55,118
That concludes the game.

705
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:56,619
The answer

706
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,580
<i>is 1, 4, 2, 3.</i>

707
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,331
1: 24 CELLS, 2: 18 CELLS,
3: 17 CELLS, 4: 22 CELLS

708
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,541
Here are the eliminations.

709
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:10,592
Here are the eliminations.

710
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,054
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

711
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,180
HWANG GI-HYEON IS ELIMINATED

712
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:16,848
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

713
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:17,932
1ST PLACE: TEAM SNU, KIM GYU-MIN

714
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,477
Eliminated contestants,
please go to your base camps.

715
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:27,317
Yes, Gyu-min!

716
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:34,449
- Gyu-min the Great.
- Gyu-min the Great.

717
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,368
I wonder how far he can go.

718
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,204
<i>I was relieved and thought to myself,</i>

719
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,206
"I did it."

720
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,668
<i>Eliminated contestants, please go</i>

721
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,252
- Let's give him a hug.
<i>- to your base camps.</i>

722
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:51,341
- You were amazing.
- Great job. We came in second.

723
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:53,468
I could stay relaxed because we had you.

724
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:56,304
<i>I basically had the benefit</i>
<i>right in front of my nose.</i>

725
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:58,473
<i>I'm deeply disappointed.</i>

726
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,476
I thought to myself,
thinking I'd tell them,

727
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:06,231
"It was much harder to stay standing
than solving the questions."

728
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:08,525
You even had your sound bite ready.

729
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,362
One contestant is left in the game.

730
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:13,613

ACE SELECTION RULES
<i>The final contestant</i>

732
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:18,368
<i>will continue to be tested</i>
<i>until they give a wrong answer.</i>

733
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:20,412
<i>I welcomed the challenge.</i>

734
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,206
<i>It felt like it could be fun.</i>

735
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,670
"Let them raise their heads
toward Gyu-min."

736
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,464
I'll ask him about his childhood

737
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:34,384
so I can raise my son the same way.

738
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,803
Let's begin Pixel Number Two.

739
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:38,847
There are no eliminations.

740
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,182
Let's begin the Zero-sum Game.

741
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,351
There are no eliminations.

742
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,063
He's really good.

743
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:49,441
I bet Team SNU is puffing up with pride.

744
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:53,153
Oh, Gyu-min the Great!

745
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,531
What do we do?

746
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:59,868
- Isn't he coming on too strong?
- I know. Everyone will be devastated.

747
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,119
He's on another level.

748
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:04,080
How can he stay focused for so long?

749
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,583
CYCLE 7, QUESTION 25
We'll move on to the 7th cycle.

750
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,419
You'll be given one minute
to solve the question.

751
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,379
It'll be tough with only a minute.

752
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:14,132
Yes, he'll start to feel the pressure now.

753
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,300
He's only getting started.

754
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:18,428
- Was he just revving up until now?
- Yes.

755
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:20,430
Let's begin Binary Choice.

756
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,974
There are no eliminations.

757
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,518
Let's begin Rank the Area.

758
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,146
There are no eliminations.

759
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:31,900
Oh, Gyu-min the Great has done it again.

760
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,695
He shouldn't overdo it, though.
He needs to save some for later.

761
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:37,113
Seriously, what's his deal?

762
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,615
Class is over, Professor.

763
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:39,991
How far is he going to go?

764
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:42,285
Just how many questions has he solved now?

765
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,788
We're in the 7th cycle,
so that's 26 questions.

766
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,417
TEAM SNU'S KIM GYU-MIN GETS
26 CORRECT ANSWERS IN A ROW

767
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:52,671
CYCLE 7, PIXEL NUMBER 2
Let's begin Pixel Number Two.

768
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:05,975
The answer

769
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:07,686
<i>is 91.</i>

770
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:10,063
Here are the eliminations.

771
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,148
<i>Isn't it about time now?</i>

772
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,192
Maybe he got it wrong.

773
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,653
There's no way Gyu-min would get it wrong.

774
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:18,571
There are no eliminations.

775
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:21,408
I knew it.

776
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,619
One contestant is left in the game.

777
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,497
Let's begin the Zero-sum Game.

778
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:32,669
You little devil.

779
00:37:32,752 --> 00:37:34,212
I'm sick of this table.

780
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,548
Gyu-min might memorize it in columns.

781
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:37,966
You never know.

782
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:40,301
He might say, "I just memorized it as is."

783
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:43,430
"Can't you memorize all 18 numbers?"

784
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,099
Please type in your answers.

785
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,769
That concludes the game.

786
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,480
The answer is 16 and 11.

787
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:55,358
Here are the eliminations.

788
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,447
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min.

789
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,992
He still hung on for so long.

790
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,703
He's good.

791
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,455
I'll give you that.

792
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:11,332
<i>The final results will now be revealed.</i>

793
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,418
<i>Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min</i>

795
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,884
<i>as the last remaining contestant.</i>

796
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,469
<i>He's like a brick wall.</i>

797
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,184
<i>The bar must've been set higher</i>
<i>for contestants</i>

798
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:30,810
<i>since we're in the second season.</i>

799
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:34,397
It's thrilling to think I placed first
twice among them.

800
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,900
If I keep doing my part,

801
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:40,028
I believe I can keep getting
the same great results.

802
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,822
<i>All contestants.</i>

803
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:46,618
<i>Please come out</i>
<i>and stand before your base camps.</i>

804
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:51,831
- You're such a reliable crutch.
- That was amazing.

805
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,291
How are you so good?

806
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:57,879
I almost had it.

807
00:38:57,962 --> 00:39:01,049
We still did better
than last season's Team KAIST.

808
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:04,219
It's all right.
We're off to a great start.

809
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:07,972
Team SNU's not joking around.

810
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,892
It's seriously impressive
making it to the seventh cycle.

811
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,603
JUNE HUH: WINNER OF FIELDS MEDAL
He looks like June Huh.

812
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:14,896
You're the GOAT, Gyu-min.

813
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:16,648
- Unbelievable.
- That's true.

814
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:18,650
His skills have been proven twice.

815
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,443
- Gyu-min the Great.
- Gyu-min the Great.

816
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:23,446

2ND: TEAM KAIST, HWANG GI-HYEON

821

3RD: TEAM SNU, YUK JUN-HYEONG

822
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,958
17TH: TEAM KU, LEE HYEON-SEUNG
I can't believe it.

823
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:37,502
15TH: TEAM YONSEI, YANG HYEON-SEUNG
I really need to do better.

824
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:38,920
I'm proud of you, Ji-seong.

825
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:41,214
<i>Gyu-min and I are of the same age.</i>

826
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:44,134
<i>I'd love the chance</i>
<i>to go head-to-head against him.</i>

827
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:46,553
The left column is filled with blue.

828
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:51,266
Look how blue the left column is.

829
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,977
Let's send KU and POSTECH home first.

830
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,441
Let's turn this around. We can do it.

831
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,318
5TH: TEAM KAIST, PARK JI-SEONG
I can't seem to let it go.

832
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:04,446
I could've come in fourth.

833
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:07,782
We could've beaten Team Yonsei
by average rank, then.

834
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,075
ACE SELECTION
SNU: AVERAGE RANK OF 8

835
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,286
TEAM YONSEI: AVERAGE RANK OF 8.75
TEAM KAIST: AVERAGE RANK OF 9

836
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:14,164
I think we came in second by average.

837
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:15,999
Yes, you're right.

838
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:18,460
It's unthinkable to place lower than 16th.

839
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:21,421
Exceeding the four-bit range
is out of the question.

840
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,382
SCIENCE NERD JOKE: 4-BIT DATA
CAN ONLY EXPRESS UP TO 16

841
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:27,093
- Team Yonsei seems well-balanced.
- Right.

842
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:29,679
I think their team
is well-talented on average.

847
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:42,776
The first to the right

By placing in the top five percent,

883

I was qualified to compete in the AIME,
the advanced level of the AMC.

I lived in Japan for 15 years

I was accepted to study
computer engineering at SNU,

892
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:47,484

Oxford was ranked first
by the <i>Times Higher Education</i>.

909
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:37,992
I'd say it's a prestigious institution
that everyone knows about.

910

We're sure to take the win this year.

911

- Right. There were.

Sure. Why not?

00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:51,371
Here are the eliminations.

1012
00:47:51,454 --> 00:47:52,622
OXFORD'S HAH EUN VS. 3 MEMBERS OF TEAM MIT

1013
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:54,708
Here are the eliminations.
Team MIT's Heo Seo-yun,

1014
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:57,377
TEAM MIT ELIMINATED IN THE 3RD CYCLE
Park Min-seok, and Jeon Hyeon-u.

1015
00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:02,257
TEAM OXFORD'S HAH EUN PLACES 1ST
IN THE OVERSEAS ACE SELECTION

1016
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:06,177
TEAM OXFORD'S HAH EUN
5TH PLACE OVERALL

1017
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:09,514
5TH: TEAM OXFORD, HAH EUN

1018
00:48:09,931 --> 00:48:11,349
<i>I'm not satisfied.</i>

1019
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:14,853
I should aim for the top.
I'm here to win, after all.

1020
00:48:14,936 --> 00:48:18,440
Team Oxford's Eun ranked the same as me.

1021
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:20,525
<i>There was only one person</i>

1022
00:48:20,608 --> 00:48:22,986
<i>who outranked me</i>
<i>among the overseas contestants.</i>

1023
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:27,157
<i>I was curious about what he was made of.</i>

1024
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:30,326
- Look at joint ninth.
- Team MIT did really well.

1025
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:33,913
Would you look at that?
It'll be tough facing Team MIT.

1026
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:36,332
Three of our team made it

1027
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,418
- pretty high on the ranks.
- Yes, we did.

1028
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:41,129
9TH: MIT'S PARK MIN-SEOK,
HEO SEO-YUN, JEON HYEON-U

1029
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:43,798
Fortunately,
no one did better than Gyu-min.

1030
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,761
<i>I thought this could get interesting.</i>

1031
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:50,889
<i>For what it's worth,</i>
<i>I ranked higher than all of them.</i>

1032
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:52,807
1ST: TEAM SNU, KIM GYU-MIN

1033
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:56,644
No single team stands out so far.

1034
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:57,812
2ND: TEAM KAIST, HWANG GI-HYEON

1035
00:48:57,896 --> 00:49:00,357
<i>Other than against Team SNU,</i>

1036
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,194
<i>I thought it'd be all right</i>
<i>to let our guards down a little.</i>

1037
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,488
- We don't need to cower.
- Right.

1038
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:07,864
We're the best.

1039
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:09,240
It's all about confidence.

1040
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,409
These Korean kids are good.

1041
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,954
But we're also Korean kids, too.

1042
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:18,792
Did you notice how the overseas teams
all have their hands in their pockets?

1043
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:20,835
Look at the two of them.

1044
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:22,545
- Put your hands in.
- Do it.

1045
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:23,755
- Do it now.
- Hurry up.

1046
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:25,674
Look how cool they look standing there.

1047
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:26,841
This won't be easy.

1048
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:32,389
It's a clash between three countries.

1049
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,726
It'd be fun.

1050
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:39,771
<i>Brainpower survival challenge,</i>
<i>Elite League, Season Two.</i>

1051
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:42,816
<i>Please get ready for the main match.</i>

1052
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:47,737
<i>I hope they won't spring 300 on us.</i>

1053
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:49,447
That won't be so bad.

1054
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:51,908
- Imagine what it'd be like to play 400.
- "400."

1055
00:49:51,991 --> 00:49:54,744
We might finally see some team play.

1056
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:56,204
That's bound to happen, right?

1057
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:58,164
I can't wait to see what it could be.

1058
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:00,375
Would Team Oxford be good at calculation?

1059
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:02,919
You can be our human calculator.

1060
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:04,629
MIT? Don't you mean KAIST of the US?

1061
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:05,672
JUST AN AMERICAN KAIST

1062
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:09,384
- We have to be on our toes.
- For sure.

1063
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:13,805
<i>All teams. Please gather</i>
<i>in the Main Hall for the main match.</i>

1064
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:29,904
<i>Today's main match</i>

1065
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:32,741
<i>is Formula Puzzle.</i>

1066
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:34,117
So, it's formulas.

1067
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,702
"Formula Puzzle"?

1068
00:50:35,785 --> 00:50:38,663
<i>For this game, you'll be presented</i>
<i>with a diamond-shaped board.</i>

1069
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:41,666
<i>And your task is to place</i>
<i>puzzle pieces on the board</i>

1070
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,377
<i>and create formulas</i>
<i>to create the target numbers.</i>

1071
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:47,005
The numbers are pretty substantial.

1072
00:50:47,088 --> 00:50:49,215
<i>The first and last rows on each side</i>

1073
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,676
<i>will be left empty on</i>
<i>the diamond-shaped board.</i>

1074
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:55,305
<i>There are a total of 26 target numbers,</i>
<i>discounting those exceptions.</i>

1075
00:50:56,264 --> 00:50:59,392
<i>The puzzle pieces consist of numbers</i>
<i>ranging from 1 to 6</i>

1076
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:03,688
<i>and the symbols</i>
<i>for addition and multiplication.</i>

1077
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:08,276
<i>Numbers 0, 7, 8, and 9,</i>

1078
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,863
<i>and the division and subtraction symbols</i>

1079
00:51:11,946 --> 00:51:13,656
<i>can't be used in your formulas.</i>

1080
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,783
That's insane.

1081
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:19,120
<i>Monochrome colors can be seen</i>
<i>on the board and the puzzle pieces.</i>

1082
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,872
<i>The color of the puzzle blocks</i>

1083
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:24,751
<i>must match that of the board's block.</i>

1084
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:26,461
NOT ALLOWED
ALLOWED

1085
00:51:26,878 --> 00:51:30,757
<i>You will find one puzzle piece</i>
<i>without any markings.</i>

1086
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,635
BLACK PUZZLE EXAMPLE
<i>That is the Black Puzzle Piece.</i>

1087
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:35,845
"Black Puzzle Piece"?

1088
00:51:37,305 --> 00:51:40,225
<i>The teams must use</i>
<i>all of the puzzle pieces</i>

1089
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:43,103
<i>to create formulas</i>
<i>that result in target numbers</i>

1090
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:45,814
<i>and cover the board</i>
<i>without leaving any blanks.</i>

1091
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:48,400
<i>When submitting your answer,</i>

1092
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:51,820
<i>make sure to include</i>
<i>the Black Puzzle's location and its makeup</i>

1093
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:53,905
<i>of the numbers and symbols it carries.</i>

1094
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:57,409
<i>At any point during the match,</i>

1095
00:51:57,492 --> 00:51:59,452
<i>the teams are given up to two attempts</i>

1096
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:02,038
<i>to check how many blocks</i>
<i>have been correctly placed.</i>

1097
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:05,542
<i>However, you will not be told</i>
<i>which blocks were placed correctly.</i>

1098
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:07,877
<i>You will only be given</i>
<i>the number of correct placements</i>

1099
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:10,714
<i>out of all 113 blocks on the board.</i>

1100
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:12,424
<i>The rank of the submitted answer</i>

1101
00:52:12,507 --> 00:52:15,719
<i>will be decided by your team's score</i>
<i>after the final submission.</i>

1102
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:17,178
<i>If a tie occurs,</i>

1103
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:20,765
<i>the team that submitted their answer first</i>
<i>will get the higher rank.</i>

1104
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:22,308
So, we need to be quick.

1105
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:27,272
<i>The first four teams</i>
<i>to complete the puzzle will survive.</i>

1106
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:28,690
<i>The bottom three teams</i>

1107
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:31,568
<i>will immediately be faced</i>
<i>with the Deathmatch.</i>

1108
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,947
<i>...will immediately be faced</i>
<i>with the Deathmatch.</i>

1109
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:37,907
Three teams?

1110
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,409
Is this how it's going to be?

1111
00:52:40,618 --> 00:52:41,661
That's interesting.

1112
00:52:42,912 --> 00:52:44,581
<i>Three teams will end up in a Deathmatch.</i>

1113
00:52:44,664 --> 00:52:48,251
<i>We could easily face that fate</i>
<i>if we don't give it our best.</i>

1114
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:50,545
We have to place first, no matter what.

1115
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:54,883
<i>I like math and feel confident</i>
<i>about my calculation skills.</i>

1116
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:57,594
<i>We were sure to win</i>
<i>if it was about formulas.</i>

1117
00:52:58,053 --> 00:53:00,138
<i>You need confidence to secure a win.</i>

1118
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,265
Watching the Deathmatch will be fun.

1119
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,517
We'll never get to the Deathmatch.

1120
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:07,270
<i>I thought it was a game</i>
<i>that catered to our strengths.</i>

1121
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:11,983
<i>All teams.</i>
<i>Please start discussing your strategies.</i>

1122
00:53:16,279 --> 00:53:18,531
<i>Smaller numbers can be tricky.</i>

1123
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:21,785
Formulas for smaller numbers
need to have an addition symbol.

1124
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:23,995
If we tried to factorize
to get the big numbers,

1125
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,499
it just wouldn't work
if an addition symbol comes in.

1126
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:29,918
We have to be careful
with the addition symbol.

1127
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:34,089
If we have a two-digit number
times a one-digit one,

1128
00:53:34,172 --> 00:53:36,549
plus a two-digit number,
We'd never get an answer.

1129
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:38,927
Possibilities are limited
for multiplied numbers.

1130
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,137
But things are different with addition.

1131
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:42,889
For example, the number seven

1132
00:53:42,972 --> 00:53:47,727
<i>can be broken down to 1 plus 6,</i>
<i>2 plus 5, and so on and so forth.</i>

1133
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,771
<i>Two-digit or three-digit numbers</i>
<i>have too many options.</i>

1134
00:53:49,854 --> 00:53:52,941
<i>So, blindly solving the formulas</i>
<i>wouldn't be the right method.</i>

1135
00:53:53,024 --> 00:53:57,237
The core strategy of the game
relies on reducing the number of cases.

1136
00:53:57,987 --> 00:53:59,364
<i>In the Formula Puzzle game,</i>

1137
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:02,409
<i>reducing the possible number of cases</i>
<i>will be essential.</i>

1138
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:06,204
<i>The key factors to take into account</i>

1139
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:08,415
<i>are the target number and puzzle pieces.</i>

1140
00:54:08,873 --> 00:54:11,418
<i>You can narrow down the possibilities</i>

1141
00:54:11,501 --> 00:54:15,380
<i>by creating a formula</i>
<i>that fits the number of blocks</i>

1142
00:54:15,463 --> 00:54:17,966
<i>with numbers ranging from 1 to 6.</i>

1143
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:22,470
<i>Furthermore, you must never forget</i>
<i>that you are trying to complete a puzzle.</i>

1144
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:25,098
<i>The shapes of puzzle pieces</i>
<i>and the colors of the blocks</i>

1145
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:27,350
<i>will help you to create</i>
<i>the correct formula.</i>

1146
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,352
<i>Utilizing this information strategically</i>

1147
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:31,855
<i>will enable you</i>
<i>to complete the Formula Puzzle.</i>

1148
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:34,691
Here's my idea.
The first set of rows to tackle

1149
00:54:34,774 --> 00:54:36,818
- are these.
- Yes, rows with 3, 5, and 7 blocks.

1150
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:38,987
- Exactly.
- We should check the possibilities

1151
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,739
for those combinations of numbers.

1152
00:54:40,822 --> 00:54:42,449
Look. Here's what I think.

1153
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:44,743
We should all dive into it together first

1154
00:54:44,826 --> 00:54:47,037
<i>and check each possible case.</i>

1155
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:49,414
<i>- First off...</i>
<i>- I'm suggesting we work separately.</i>

1156
00:54:49,497 --> 00:54:50,832
YONSEI'S STRATEGY: DIVIDE AND CALCULATE

1157
00:54:50,915 --> 00:54:53,376
If you get the feeling
that the approach won't work,

1158
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,627
then we need to let it go.

1159
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:55,962
- Do you agree?
- Sure.

1160
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:59,632
If you see 20 different possibilities,
then just forget about it.

1161
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:02,469
I think our focus should be
on getting the numbers right

1162
00:55:02,552 --> 00:55:04,137
- rather than doing the puzzle.
- Right.

1163
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,722
TEAM YONSEI FOCUSES ON FORMULAE
It'll be meaningless.

1164
00:55:05,805 --> 00:55:07,432
The numbers are more important.

1165
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:12,270
<i>Piecing the puzzles together</i>
<i>will help there.</i>

1166
00:55:12,854 --> 00:55:16,232
Like I said earlier,
the ones that can be placed near the edge

1167
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:17,942
are just these three.

1168
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:19,736
- The others won't fit.
- Agreed.

1169
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:22,072
One of these will be on the edges.

1170
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:26,117
TEAM SNU'S STRATEGY
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CASES

1171
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:30,663
BY UTILIZING PUZZLE PIECES
THAT WILL FIT AROUND THE EDGES

1172
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:32,374
I mean, it's called "a puzzle."

1173
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:34,834
You have to start from the edges.

1174
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:36,461
Here's our first plan.

1175
00:55:36,544 --> 00:55:37,962
<i>We'll place one of these pieces first.</i>

1176
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,882
<i>If that helps with the third row,</i>
<i>we can complete the formula there.</i>

1177
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:43,468
<i>Yes, so we'll prioritize these four rows.</i>

1178
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:45,804
- We could cover 20 blocks that way.
- Right.

1179
00:55:45,887 --> 00:55:48,306
It won't be difficult
to fill the middle after.

1180
00:55:48,723 --> 00:55:51,184
Establishing boundaries will be helpful.

1181
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:54,979
So, 111 times 111...

1182
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:58,233
Let's write down 666 times 666, too.

1183
00:55:59,567 --> 00:56:02,904
We used 1 and 6 as our guidelines

1184
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:05,532
<i>to establish the bottom</i>
<i>and the upper limit.</i>

1185
00:56:05,615 --> 00:56:08,410
<i>Our strategy was</i>
<i>to quickly figure those numbers out</i>

1186
00:56:08,493 --> 00:56:11,788
<i>so we could break down</i>
<i>bigger numbers we encounter quickly.</i>

1187
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:15,083
Won't we need a multiplication table
with five-digit numbers?

1188
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:16,543
Yes. Let's do that.

1189
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:21,339
Think of 6666 squared, for example.

1190
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:29,889
With simple calculations like additions,
subtractions, or multiplications,

1191
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:32,809
I can process about 70 in under 2 minutes.

1192
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:38,189
<i>I was confident enough to tackle</i>
<i>any mathematical calculations.</i>

1193
00:56:39,607 --> 00:56:42,652
<i>I think manipulating numbers well</i>
<i>will decide the outcome.</i>

1194
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:44,863
Isn't 23 squared 529?

1195
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,949
And 28 squared is 784.

1196
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:51,327
Oh, and 32 squared and above
will end up with 4 or more digits.

1197
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:54,581
I'm sure you all know that,
but let's keep the digits in mind.

1198
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:57,917
Take a look, guys.

1199
00:56:58,501 --> 00:56:59,794
- Oh, great.
- I made a list.

1200
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,671
If the value of the one is zero,
we get these.

1201
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:03,173
And there's only one option here.

1202
00:57:03,256 --> 00:57:04,507
- This is written down, too.
- Exactly.

1203
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:07,135
<i>According to Team KAIST's strategy,</i>

1204
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:09,637
<i>if the target number's last digit</i>
<i>has a value of nine,</i>

1205
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:13,058
<i>the numbers in the formula</i>
<i>must have threes in their last digits.</i>

1206
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:16,186
<i>If the target number's last digit</i>
<i>has a value of three,</i>

1207
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:20,315
<i>the numbers in the formula</i>
<i>must have 1 and 3 as their last digits.</i>

1208
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:24,152
- A seven can't go there, right?
- Right. It can't.

1209
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:26,613
That would mean there's a plus.

1210
00:57:26,696 --> 00:57:29,532
<i>To get a number</i>
<i>with seven in its last digit,</i>

1211
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:33,244
<i>1 times 7</i>
<i>or 3 times 9 would be a possibility.</i>

1212
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:37,707
<i>But since the pieces</i>
<i>can only have numbers from 1 to 6,</i>

1213
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,627
<i>there are no multiplications</i>
<i>that will have a seven for the last digit.</i>

1214
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:41,753
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A 7

1215
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:45,215
The puzzle element is there for a reason,
so we'd have to make use of that, too.

1216
00:57:45,298 --> 00:57:46,591
We need to stay balanced.

1217
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:48,635
We can't go all in
on completing the puzzle.

1218
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:50,345
Our focus needs to stay balanced.

1219
00:57:51,096 --> 00:57:54,724
The game requires us to consider
both the puzzle and the formulas.

1220
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:56,768
If there's only one set solution...

1221
00:57:56,851 --> 00:57:58,853
- There's only one solution.
- In that case,

1222
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:01,272
why don't we focus on the puzzle aspect?

1223
00:58:01,356 --> 00:58:05,318
If we can get a single row right,
that can work as a huge set of leads.

1224
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:08,488
- We'd just have to complete one line.
- Here's what I think.

1225
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:12,450
The middle ones will be crucial
because the numbers will be hard to get.

1226
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:14,619
You're right. They will be critical.

1227
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:16,579
They may have used a key number there.

1228
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:19,666
There should only be
a single formula per target number.

1229
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:23,211
There may not be that many cases
to make up the biggest number.

1230
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:24,879
Let's decide on one and stick to it.

1231
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:28,174
I don't think it'd be wise to have
the four of us focused on only that.

1232
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:31,469
Let's discuss role assignments
and how we will use our time.

1233
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:32,554
That'll be important.

1234
00:58:32,637 --> 00:58:33,888
- I think so, too.
- I have this idea.

1235
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:36,516
There can only be
so many shapes of puzzle pieces

1236
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:38,685
that can be placed on the edges.

1237
00:58:38,768 --> 00:58:41,855
What if I come up with possible cases
for those smaller numbers?

1238
00:58:41,938 --> 00:58:43,648
Okay. So this is how we'll play it.

1239
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:46,401
Some of us can work on the smaller numbers

1240
00:58:46,484 --> 00:58:48,695
while the others work on the larger ones.

1241
00:58:49,195 --> 00:58:51,990
<i>Hyeon-seung and I are confident</i>
<i>with our calculation skills,</i>

1242
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:54,576
<i>so we were in charge of</i>
<i>tackling the bigger target numbers.</i>

1243
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:56,786
<i>And Ha-eun and Seong-hyeon</i>

1244
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:00,582
<i>went over possible cases</i>
<i>with the smaller target numbers</i>

1245
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:04,127
and tried to place pieces
around the edges first.

1246
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,755
TEAM OXFORD'S BASE CAMP

1247
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:09,090
<i>- I feel good about this.</i>
<i>- My voice is about to give out.</i>

1248
00:59:09,174 --> 00:59:11,885
But guys, think about this.

1249
00:59:11,968 --> 00:59:15,055
Would any other team be enjoying
a lively conversation like ours?

1250
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:16,181
Absolutely not.

1251
00:59:16,556 --> 00:59:19,059
Would any of them have
well-assigned roles as us?

1252
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:22,687
TEAM OXFORD TOOK TURNS
There won't be room for plus signs.

1253
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:24,856
TO PRESENT A STRATEGY
We should start from the edges.

1254
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:27,692
Let's leave the Black Puzzle
until the very end.

1255
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:30,862
We need to stay on track
by having our answers checked early.

1256
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,655
That's a great idea.

1257
00:59:33,865 --> 00:59:35,325
Look how well-organized it is.

1258
00:59:35,408 --> 00:59:36,409
- It really is neat.
- I know.

1259
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:39,037
I doubt any other team
is better prepared than us.

1260
00:59:39,704 --> 00:59:42,374
I'm good with calculation, you know.

1261
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:44,167
Okay, then. Let's assign jobs.

1262
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,251
Let's do that.

1263
00:59:45,335 --> 00:59:48,046
Phase one. We start working
around the edges first

1264
00:59:48,129 --> 00:59:50,215
while Eun decomposes the numbers.

1265
00:59:50,298 --> 00:59:51,466
- As for us--
- As for Seung-chan...

1266
00:59:51,549 --> 00:59:53,385
- He's good, too.
- He's got a lot of it memorized,

1267
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:54,469
so he's a great asset.

1268
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:57,180
- The two of us will organize the pieces.
- Let's do that.

1269
00:59:57,263 --> 01:00:00,141
- I'll leave the puzzle pieces to you two.
- No worries.

1270
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:03,478
One thing is for certain.

1271
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:04,646
You know what?

1272
01:00:04,729 --> 01:00:06,731
This will be much more fun than 300.

1273
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:07,941
- Sure.
- That's true.

1274
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:11,903
- It's such a fun game.
- I know.

1275
01:00:11,986 --> 01:00:13,071
Let's do a good job, too.

1276
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:15,740
I'm all about having a lot of fun.

1277
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:16,825
What worries me

1278
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:19,035
- is that we can only check twice.
- Right.

1279
01:00:19,494 --> 01:00:22,914
We need to make good use of it.
That'll be vital to our success.

1280
01:00:22,997 --> 01:00:26,334
We could do a quick check
after filling in the edges.

1281
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:28,878
Once the edges are done,
going inward would be easy.

1282
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:31,131
1. FILL OUT THE EDGES FIRST

1283
01:00:31,214 --> 01:00:32,841
2. CHECK THE ANSWERS HALFWAY THROUGH

1284
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:34,551
3. USE THE ANSWERS TO FILL IN THE REST

1285
01:00:34,634 --> 01:00:36,386
How should we divide up our roles?

1286
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:39,764
Why don't you work
the bigger numbers, Jin-hyeon?

1287
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:42,726
- Me?
- You're the best at calculation among us.

1288
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:45,353
I'll handle the smaller numbers.

1289
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:46,938
Shall I try placing pieces?

1290
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:49,315
WITH JI-SEONG AS THE LEADER,
TEAM POSTECH DIVIDES UP TASKS IN NO TIME

1291
01:00:49,649 --> 01:00:51,860
Let's write everything down
on a sheet of paper.

1292
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:54,654
JI-SEONG LEADS THE STRATEGY MEETING
The format is key for sharing information.

1293
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:56,573
I think this is really important.

1294
01:00:56,656 --> 01:00:59,117
Let's tackle big targets
with fewer blocks first.

1295
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,619
<i>Ji-seong made some shrewd observations,</i>

1296
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:03,371
<i>which was really helpful.</i>

1297
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:04,789
We're lucky to have you.

1298
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:10,420
<i>He was clearly our strongest contestant.</i>

1299
01:01:11,212 --> 01:01:14,424
Here's one another thing
we could do for you.

1300
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:16,968
Numbers like 611 or 116

1301
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:19,429
can be called "iconic," right?

1302
01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:20,388
Right.

1303
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:21,765
- Numbers that won't change.
- Right.

1304
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:23,266
Min-su and I will make a list

1305
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,769
of those iconic numbers
laid out horizontally and vertically.

1306
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:29,189
PIECES WITHOUT ANY SYMBOLS
<i>We decided to use the term iconic</i>

1307
01:01:29,272 --> 01:01:32,275
<i>to refer to pieces</i>
<i>with peculiar arrangements.</i>

1308
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:33,777
<i>Using the three-digit number</i>

1309
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,363
MATCHING ICONIC PIECES TO BE PLACED
<i>can help us get confirmation</i>

1310
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:37,405
<i>on the other numbers.</i>

1311
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:38,656
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OBTAINED

1312
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,492
<i>That's how we came up with the strategy.</i>

1313
01:01:40,575 --> 01:01:41,910
INFORMATION THROUGH NUMBERED PIECES

1314
01:01:41,993 --> 01:01:44,245
We must keep this in mind
as we play the game.

1315
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:47,040
This isn't just about winning or losing.

1316
01:01:47,123 --> 01:01:49,209
- I agree.
- It's about the record we set.

1317
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:50,960
Team SNU even has the benefit.

1318
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:54,422
We'll just leave them
and go after the 2nd, 3rd and 4th.

1319
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:57,801
<i>Let's find the prime factor of 3233.</i>

1320
01:01:57,884 --> 01:01:59,886
That has to be a two-digit multiplication.

1321
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:01,054
It could be two prime numbers.

1322
01:02:01,137 --> 01:02:02,806
- What could it be?
- How about 43?

1323
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:05,767
- I think 53 might work.
- Really?

1324
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,227
Can you do that in your head?

1325
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:09,896
- If we take away 53 from 3233,
- Yes?

1326
01:02:09,979 --> 01:02:11,648
- we get 3180, right?
- I see.

1327
01:02:11,731 --> 01:02:14,067
- So, 53 times 6 is 318.
- Right.

1328
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:16,945
<i>Gyu-min's fast and precise</i>
<i>with calculations.</i>

1329
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:20,073
He's the quickest person I know.

1330
01:02:20,156 --> 01:02:22,575
- When I look for prime factors--
- If we multiply 53...

1331
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:24,202
I always remove the last digit.

1332
01:02:24,285 --> 01:02:28,123
<i>Let's say we have to check</i>
<i>if 13 is a prime factor of 299.</i>

1333
01:02:28,748 --> 01:02:31,167
<i>The last digit is a nine, right?</i>

1334
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:35,046
<i>I then look for a multiple of 13</i>
<i>that has 9 as the last digit.</i>

1335
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,048
<i>We have 39, for instance.</i>

1336
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:38,883
<i>Then if I subtract 39 from 299,</i>

1337
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,176
<i>I'm left with 260.</i>

1338
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,637
<i>Then we now know that</i>
<i>26 is a multiple of 13.</i>

1339
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:44,180
<i>So, 13 is a factor of 299.</i>

1340
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:49,936
We deciphered this much
even without seeing the puzzle pieces.

1341
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,689
We'll win easily
if nothing drastic happens.

1342
01:02:52,772 --> 01:02:53,940
Listen, guys.

1343
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:56,693
Are there cases where a log can help?

1344
01:02:56,776 --> 01:02:59,779
LOG: A TOOL TO MANIPULATE NUMBERS
Could we use the common log table

1345
01:02:59,863 --> 01:03:01,865
to make it a little simpler?

1346
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:06,870
TO UTILIZE LOG,
YOU NEED THE COMMON LOG TABLE

1347
01:03:06,953 --> 01:03:08,288
Tell me the log base 10 of 3.

1348
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:09,205
It's 0.4771.

1349
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:11,249
The log base 10 of 7 is 0.8451.

1350
01:03:11,332 --> 01:03:13,793
He just remembers it
while the others are calculating.

1351
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:16,212
- I'll give you the values for 11, too.
- Okay.

1352
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:19,382
That's 1.0413.

1353
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:22,510
<i>I like numbers, so I just spend time</i>
<i>looking at them,</i>

1354
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:24,304
and I happened to memorize them.

1355
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:28,183
<i>You have five minutes left</i>
<i>to discuss your strategy.</i>

1356
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:31,394
- It's all about speed from now on.
- Right.

1357
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:34,064
- Let's try not to get upset.
- Good point.

1358
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:35,357
Let's just cheer each other on.

1359
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,442
Just shower each other with compliments.

1360
01:03:37,525 --> 01:03:39,861
I feel confident
about our calculation skills.

1361
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:41,613
But if others have strategies--

1362
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:44,157
We could still outmatch them
with our skills.

1363
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,160
If you make a positive match,
make sure to share it quickly.

1364
01:03:47,243 --> 01:03:49,579
That's the only way
we can narrow down cases.

1365
01:03:49,662 --> 01:03:50,997
But you have to be 100% certain.

1366
01:03:53,249 --> 01:03:54,834
If you think something is certain,

1367
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:57,003
you should have someone else check first.

1368
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:59,756
<i>You have one minute left</i>
<i>to discuss your strategy.</i>

1369
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:00,840
Crack it open.

1370
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:03,718
- Korea University!
- For the nation!

1371
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:06,054
<i>- For the nation!</i>
- Let's do our thing.

1372
01:04:06,137 --> 01:04:07,180
That won't do.

1373
01:04:07,263 --> 01:04:08,306
One, two, three.

1374
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:10,684
- Yonsei University!
- For reunification!

1375
01:04:10,767 --> 01:04:12,060
- Let's go, Team KAIST!
- Let's go, Team KAIST!

1376
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:13,520
POSTECH!

1377
01:04:14,854 --> 01:04:16,064
Make your pick. Up or down?

1378
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:17,691
- Up!
- All right!

1379
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:19,651
- SNU will take the win again!
- SNU will take the win again!

1380
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:20,902
Let's go!

1381
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:30,245
<i>The time for the strategy meeting is up.</i>

1382
01:04:30,328 --> 01:04:34,624
<i>All teams. Please gather</i>
<i>in the Main Hall for the game.</i>

1383
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:36,835
Let's go. We can do this.

1384
01:04:36,918 --> 01:04:38,420
Let's speak softly now.

1385
01:04:38,753 --> 01:04:40,005
We won't be going home today.

1386
01:04:40,088 --> 01:04:41,923
- I want to do well.
- I know I can do well.

1387
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:44,384
Let's aim for the win.
I think we can take it.

1388
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:48,430
It's so big.

1389
01:04:50,306 --> 01:04:51,516
It's pretty intimidating.

1390
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:57,105
Will we find the pieces once we open it?

1391
01:04:57,188 --> 01:05:00,150
I think we should stand
with our backs toward them.

1392
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:03,278
Remember. We're the fastest
at simple calculations.

1393
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:05,530
- It's over when we close it.
- Right.

1394
01:05:06,322 --> 01:05:07,949
It'll be over once we close the lid.

1395
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:09,117
CLOSE THE LID TO SUBMIT ANSWERS

1396
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,994
- We need that to...
- I will now announce

1397
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:12,954
the benefit of the game.

1398
01:05:14,497 --> 01:05:15,582
The benefit...

1399
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,796
will allow its holder to find out

1400
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,257
the numbers and symbols
on the Black Puzzle.

1401
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:27,302
That'll be so useful.

1402
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:33,516
TEAM SNU CAN LEARN
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE BLACK PUZZLE

1403
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,063
- Gyu-min the Great.
- Gyu-min the Great.

1404
01:05:38,146 --> 01:05:42,108
<i>Given our advantage,</i>
<i>we'll be able to avoid the Deathmatch.</i>

1405
01:05:43,818 --> 01:05:46,571
<i>I thought the benefit</i>
<i>was a little too much.</i>

1406
01:05:46,654 --> 01:05:49,991
It only made me feel
more upset about the loss.

1407
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:52,494
- It's too much.
- The benefit could've been mine.

1408
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:55,663
- Team SNU...
- Go ahead, Gyu-min.

1409
01:05:55,747 --> 01:05:57,248
- Gyu-min the Great.
- Do the honors.

1410
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:58,583
You're seriously amazing.

1411
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:01,169
- Great.
- It's huge.

1412
01:06:01,252 --> 01:06:03,338
We don't have to worry about the variable.

1413
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:04,798
What's a Black Puzzle?

1414
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:07,634
I'm so jealous.

1415
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:09,719
- Well, I'm not.
- Can we share?

1416
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:11,179
- Don't be.
- Well, I am.

1417
01:06:11,262 --> 01:06:13,390
- It's okay.
- I'm not jealous at all.

1418
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:15,934
That's not it.

1419
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:19,270
So, no variables for us.

1420
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:22,440
That's the benefit? Isn't it too much?

1421
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:25,819
- It's more than I thought.
- We don't need the pieces anyway.

1422
01:06:25,902 --> 01:06:28,613
<i>Not having the benefit</i>
<i>doesn't mean an automatic loss.</i>

1423
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:30,573
I believe that if we do our best,

1424
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:32,992
the outcome will be much more meaningful.

1425
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:35,412
It's not that big of a deal anyway.

1426
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:41,668
We'll now begin the main match,
Formula Puzzle.

1427
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:43,545
All contestants.

1428
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:50,260
Please check your boards.

1429
01:06:51,469 --> 01:06:52,679
Put it in the back.

1430
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:57,142
- Do we start?
- How do you open it?

1431
01:06:57,225 --> 01:06:59,060
- My gosh.
- Look at how big it is.

1432
01:06:59,144 --> 01:07:00,645
There's more than I thought.

1433
01:07:03,773 --> 01:07:05,650
The numbers get big from row seven.

1434
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:07,569
This won't be easy.

1435
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:12,407
<i>There are 26 target numbers on the board.</i>

1436
01:07:13,074 --> 01:07:15,910
<i>The puzzle pieces are marked</i>
<i>with numbers from 1 to 6,</i>

1437
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:19,414
<i>addition and multiplication symbols,</i>
<i>and have black or white colors.</i>

1438
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:23,251
<i>The teams have to place the pieces</i>
<i>to their corresponding colors</i>

1439
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:25,962
<i>to create a formula</i>
<i>to match the target numbers.</i>

1440
01:07:26,629 --> 01:07:28,006
The Black Puzzle is cross-shaped.

1441
01:07:31,801 --> 01:07:33,762
Stick to the plan
and get your target numbers.

1442
01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:35,096
- Hurry up.
- I'll take this side.

1443
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,306
TAKES ON THE CORNER NUMBERS FIRST

1444
01:07:37,557 --> 01:07:39,893
Show me the corners you're working on now.

1445
01:07:39,976 --> 01:07:40,935
What's your target?

1446
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:43,271
Where are you working on?
Put your hand on the number.

1447
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:46,858
<i>When we first started,</i>

1448
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:50,320
<i>we tried to create formulas</i>
<i>for the numbers on the edges.</i>

1449
01:07:50,403 --> 01:07:52,113
Work on your rows, and check later.

1450
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:53,239
TEAM YONSEI TAKES AN INDIVIDUAL APPROACH

1451
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:56,826
- Find the "n plus one" numbers first.
- Okay.

1452
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,536
Tell me when you spot one.

1453
01:07:58,620 --> 01:07:59,454
I got it.

1454
01:07:59,537 --> 01:08:00,622
Three, five...

1455
01:08:00,705 --> 01:08:02,582
That's it. 388 and 129.

1456
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:04,167
<i>I'll do the calculations.</i>

1457
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:07,337
WHAT IS TEAM KAIST'S "N PLUS 1" STRATEGY?

1458
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,589
<i>We've kept this strategy up</i>
<i>from the onset.</i>

1459
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,134
Let's keep it secret.
Don't mention "n plus one."

1460
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:15,136
Ji-seong's idea about "n plus one"...

1461
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,137
"N plus one"...

1462
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:17,555
- Only with "n plus one"...
- "N plus one"...

1463
01:08:17,639 --> 01:08:18,807
- "N plus one"...
- "N plus one"...

1464
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:20,767
This is an example of "n plus one," right?

1465
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,602
There will only be one multiplication.

1466
01:08:22,686 --> 01:08:25,021
THE "N PLUS 1" STRATEGY:
FIND TARGET NUMBERS

1467
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:27,315
COMPOSED OF ONLY ONE MULTIPLICATION SYMBOL

1468
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:31,194
IF THE TARGET NUMBER IS ONE DIGIT HIGHER
THAN THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS

1469
01:08:31,277 --> 01:08:34,823
THE FORMULA MUST TAKE
THE FORM OF A TIMES B

1470
01:08:35,156 --> 01:08:36,574
Let's say we have an n-digit number

1471
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:38,952
with n-plus-one blocks on this side.

1472
01:08:39,035 --> 01:08:40,745
Then the formula has to be A times B.

1473
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:41,996
There can't be a plus.

1474
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,708
This means that the target
can be prime-factorized.

1475
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:50,005
If the target is an n-digit number
with n-plus-one blocks on the left,

1476
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:51,297
additions can't be used.

1477
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:53,341
That'll create a two-digit difference.

1478
01:08:53,425 --> 01:08:55,385
MAXIMUM VALUE WHEN USING AN ADDITION: 672

1479
01:08:55,468 --> 01:08:57,971
A 4-DIGIT NUMBER CAN NOT BE MADE
WITH JUST AN ADDITION

1480
01:08:58,054 --> 01:09:02,100
<i>It can only have one multiplication</i>
<i>between the two numbers.</i>

1481
01:09:02,183 --> 01:09:04,394
FORMULA ALWAYS TAKES THE FORM OF A TIMES B

1482
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:06,938
<i>The plan was to compare</i>
<i>the target's number of digits</i>

1483
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,648
<i>with the number of blocks.</i>

1484
01:09:08,732 --> 01:09:10,442
<i>That was what we looked for first.</i>

1485
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:13,069
<i>We'll then factorize those numbers</i>

1486
01:09:13,153 --> 01:09:15,405
<i>to create a formula</i>
<i>by using multiplications.</i>

1487
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:20,326
THE FIRST TARGET NUMBER
FOUND USING "N PLUS 1" STRATEGY

1488
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:26,249
TEAM MIT AND KAIST ARE WORKING
ON THE SAME NUMBER

1489
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:36,051
Multiplication and additions...

1490
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:39,471
Hey.

1491
01:09:39,554 --> 01:09:42,390
Can you help?
I'm losing my mind over this.

1492
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:44,392
Once we get this, the rest will be easy.

1493
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:48,980
That's 49 times 7921, right?

1494
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:50,065
But I can't get it.

1495
01:09:50,148 --> 01:09:52,901
SEUNG-CHAN HAVING DIFFICULTY
PRIME-FACTORIZING 7921

1496
01:09:53,568 --> 01:09:55,236
I'm prime-factorizing.

1497
01:09:56,154 --> 01:10:00,742
<i>While prime-factorizing,</i>
<i>I got 7921 at first.</i>

1498
01:10:01,326 --> 01:10:02,744
This won't work.

1499
01:10:02,827 --> 01:10:04,621
This won't either.

1500
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:08,416
<i>I tried prime numbers between 20 and 30,</i>
<i>but had no luck.</i>

1501
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,626
<i>So I wondered...</i>

1502
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,711
This only has one case.

1503
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:12,962
- Which one?
- 388,129?

1504
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:14,089
- This one.
- This one?

1505
01:10:14,172 --> 01:10:15,256
It's 623 squared.

1506
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:18,426
- So 623 times 623?
- Lower your voice.

1507
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:23,056
I thought it might be a square number
of a large prime number.

1508
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:25,308
So I tried 89
thinking that might fit the bill,

1509
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:26,935
<i>and it turned out my hunch was right.</i>

1510
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:29,020
<i>That's how I found the formula.</i>

1511
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:36,569
There's only one possibility.
I checked all its submultiples.

1512
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,321
And that's 623 times 623?

1513
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:39,823
Yes. It's for certain.

1514
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:42,409
Does nothing work?

1515
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:43,952
Have you tried 89?

1516
01:10:44,035 --> 01:10:45,286
No, I haven't.

1517
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:47,872
It's 89 squared.

1518
01:10:48,456 --> 01:10:49,666
Oh, you're right.

1519
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:51,584
It can't be...

1520
01:10:51,668 --> 01:10:53,420
It's 89 squared.

1521
01:10:55,964 --> 01:10:56,923
I got it.

1522
01:10:57,007 --> 01:10:59,551
The formula's got to be this, right?

1523
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:03,304
THE FORMULA FOR 388,129 IS DETERMINED

1524
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:04,931
Eun!

1525
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:07,017
Great job.

1526
01:11:08,893 --> 01:11:10,020
Well done, you two.

1527
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:11,855
- Good job.
- I'm so proud of you.

1528
01:11:11,938 --> 01:11:13,565
You're the best, guys.

1529
01:11:15,525 --> 01:11:16,526
With 8,100...

1530
01:11:18,528 --> 01:11:19,404
And 90, 9...

1531
01:11:37,505 --> 01:11:38,423
I got it.

1532
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:40,467
882.

1533
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:41,551
I got all the blocks.

1534
01:11:41,926 --> 01:11:43,928
This row should form this number, right?

1535
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:47,015
<i>Getting the 623 squared early on</i>

1536
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:48,975
<i>helped boost my confidence.</i>

1537
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:50,518
- Can you try that one?
- Which one?

1538
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:51,603
Next up is this.

1539
01:11:52,687 --> 01:11:54,689
<i>It's another n-plus-one case.</i>

1540
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:57,901
TEAM KAIST FOUND THEIR NEXT TARGET
<i>With eight digits...</i>

1541
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,781
- I got this one, too.
- Really?

1542
01:12:02,864 --> 01:12:04,074
- That's crazy.
- What did you do?

1543
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:06,701
I tried ten four-digit multiplications.

1544
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:08,370
- Look at this.
- You're mad.

1545
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:09,996
20476881...

1546
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,290
You have to multiply 3,121 by 6,561.

1547
01:12:12,749 --> 01:12:14,084
Damn. That's insane.

1548
01:12:14,668 --> 01:12:16,461
Is this a five-digit multiplication?

1549
01:12:16,544 --> 01:12:17,796
- Yes.
- That's right.

1550
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:21,299
<i>I noticed the four-billion-something</i>
<i>right in the middle.</i>

1551
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:22,967
THE LAST N+1 TARGET
<i>It was very doable.</i>

1552
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,094
That's insane.

1553
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:26,304
Let's try it together.

1554
01:12:27,597 --> 01:12:28,765
Stop talking and focus.

1555
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:32,644
Hey. I'm sure about this one.

1556
01:12:33,186 --> 01:12:36,856
This number here is for this one.

1557
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:38,942
<i>What stood out to me was</i>

1558
01:12:39,025 --> 01:12:41,903
<i>that the huge number</i>
<i>was a multiple of three.</i>

1559
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:44,656
<i>Figuring out if a number</i>
<i>is three's multiple is easy.</i>

1560
01:12:44,739 --> 01:12:47,826
<i>The target will be a multiple of 3</i>
<i>if its digits add up to a multiple of 3.</i>

1561
01:12:47,909 --> 01:12:50,745
<i>After quickly extracting</i>
<i>the factor eight times,</i>

1562
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:53,623
<i>I tried to create a formula</i>
<i>using numbers 1 through 6 only.</i>

1563
01:12:53,707 --> 01:12:55,542
<i>This was the only one that worked.</i>

1564
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:56,835
Just a second, guys.

1565
01:12:56,918 --> 01:12:58,503
This is definitely a one.

1566
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:00,880
It has to be.

1567
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:02,382
BOTH LAST DIGITS ARE 1

1568
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:04,092
Both of their last digits are ones.

1569
01:13:05,343 --> 01:13:08,304
<i>Right. Shall we approach it</i>
<i>from that angle?</i>

1570
01:13:09,305 --> 01:13:11,141
There. I got something.

1571
01:13:11,224 --> 01:13:12,267
<i>There are a few cases for 260.</i>

1572
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:14,310
<i>- In that case--</i>
<i>- There are three pluses.</i>

1573
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:15,353
NUMBER 260 HAS 4 POSSIBILITIES

1574
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:17,313
Our role assignments are perfect.

1575
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:19,774
How was my insight
on stressing its importance?

1576
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:21,359
- I told you it'd be key.
- You were brilliant.

1577
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:23,153
What about checking
three blocks at a time?

1578
01:13:23,528 --> 01:13:24,946
You were great, too.

1579
01:13:28,908 --> 01:13:31,953
Here's a list of iconic pieces
with three numbers.

1580
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:34,372
TEAM POSTECH'S ICONIC STRATEGY

1581
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:37,292
USE ICONIC PIECES
THAT HAS 3 NUMBERS IN A ROW

1582
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:40,712
AMONG THE 27 PIECES, 5 ARE ICONIC PIECES

1583
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:42,672
The possible cases are limited.

1584
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:43,882
9 POSSIBILITIES WERE FOUND

1585
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:46,092
- I'm looking at that one, too.
- Yes, 429.

1586
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:48,011
- I got it!
- Which one?

1587
01:13:48,094 --> 01:13:50,722
Look. I narrowed it down.
53 times 43 times 653.

1588
01:13:50,805 --> 01:13:51,931
Lower your voice.

1589
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:53,641
Wait, 653 is an iconic piece.

1590
01:13:53,725 --> 01:13:56,019
- Let's have a look.
- I knew it.

1591
01:13:56,102 --> 01:13:57,062
<i>This is insane.</i>

1592
01:13:57,145 --> 01:13:59,230
<i>We need to get the order right, though.</i>

1593
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:02,067
THE ORDER IS UNDETERMINED

1594
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:07,030
- You're our strongest player.
- This feels so awesome.

1595
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:15,997
TEAM POSTECH FINDS THE FORMULA FOR 388,129

1596
01:14:16,081 --> 01:14:17,332
Why is this one iconic?

1597
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:25,048
TWO POSSIBILITIES

1598
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:27,926
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION GAINED
THROUGH THE ICONIC 623-PIECE

1599
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:29,469
That's truly iconic.

1600
01:14:31,388 --> 01:14:33,890
Only 1 plus 5 times 6 can go there.

1601
01:14:34,432 --> 01:14:35,934
What about 15 plus 16?

1602
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,144
There's no plus here.

1603
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:40,772
- There's no white plus symbol.
- What about 31...

1604
01:14:40,855 --> 01:14:42,607
- We don't have a white one?
- No.

1605
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:44,609
<i>Out of all the pieces,</i>

1606
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:48,488
<i>only nine pieces have a plus symbol.</i>

1607
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:52,450
<i>None of the symbols</i>
<i>have a white background.</i>

1608
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:54,703
30 MINUTES AGO

1609
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:56,204
If you ask me,

1610
01:14:56,287 --> 01:14:58,039
the first thing we should do

1611
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:01,376
is tally up the total number
of the arithmetic symbols.

1612
01:15:01,459 --> 01:15:03,461
Since there are multiple puzzle pieces,

1613
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:05,797
<i>I thought it'd be helpful to count up</i>

1614
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,551
<i>the arithmetic symbols</i>
<i>and the numbers etched on them</i>

1615
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:12,595
<i>to gain an overview</i>
<i>of the combination of numbers</i>

1616
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:14,889
<i>and how they were organized.</i>

1617
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:18,476
<i>And this is the major insight</i>
<i>that was found.</i>

1618
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,895
PUZZLE PIECES STATS
WHITE, GRAY, TOTAL

1619
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:24,024
The good news is
that we only have nine plus symbols.

1620
01:15:24,107 --> 01:15:25,775
There are no white plus symbols.

1621
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:27,360
The times symbols are mostly gray.

1622
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:32,574
<i>Other teams seemed to be counting</i>
<i>the colored blocks as well.</i>

1623
01:15:33,366 --> 01:15:35,410
Don't forget the Black Puzzle.

1624
01:15:38,371 --> 01:15:39,372
The Black Puzzle...

1625
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:41,666
<i>Luckily, we knew what it looked like.</i>

1626
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:44,169
There are no white plus symbols.

1627
01:15:44,252 --> 01:15:45,462
No white pluses?

1628
01:15:46,212 --> 01:15:49,257
Wait, we can't be sure yet
because of this one.

1629
01:15:49,341 --> 01:15:53,094
The other teams didn't have information
on five of the blocks.

1630
01:15:53,178 --> 01:15:57,098
So, I doubt they could get a clear picture
even after counting the blocks.

1631
01:15:57,182 --> 01:15:59,267
This one has to be a times symbol, then.

1632
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:01,227
At any rate, two goes there.

1633
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:03,021
Let me work on that.

1634
01:16:03,104 --> 01:16:05,106
How do some of them use mental math?

1635
01:16:09,235 --> 01:16:11,780
- What's up?
- Divide it by 2, and it's 123,454,321.

1636
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:13,698
What, 123,454,321?

1637
01:16:15,075 --> 01:16:18,078
- That's 11111 squared.
- So, that's 5 ones.

1638
01:16:18,703 --> 01:16:22,457
<i>Dividing the target number by 2</i>
<i>left us with 123,454,321.</i>

1639
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,834
<i>Things went smoothly after that.</i>

1640
01:16:31,716 --> 01:16:34,469
<i>Let's place the pieces</i>
<i>that can work with 623.</i>

1641
01:16:34,552 --> 01:16:35,720
We should get it checked.

1642
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:37,639
- We can't just keep calculating.
- I only have a few.

1643
01:16:38,223 --> 01:16:39,557
We need to use 623, right?

1644
01:16:40,183 --> 01:16:43,019
Wait. I think we should use
256 plus 4 here.

1645
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:44,270
Really? 256 plus 4?

1646
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:47,107
- Then we'd need 256 first.
- Right.

1647
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:50,318
But determining a piece
is too difficult now.

1648
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:52,445
This may not fit here.

1649
01:16:53,488 --> 01:16:55,156
TEAM SNU IS STRUGGLING
We need a plus next to the six.

1650
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,408
TO PIECE THE PUZZLE TOGETHER

1651
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:58,284
This might not go here.

1652
01:16:58,993 --> 01:17:01,329
Let's find a piece that could fit there.

1653
01:17:03,498 --> 01:17:05,792
- We need 56.
- We need 56?

1654
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:08,712
<i>I grew uneasy, to be honest.</i>

1655
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:13,299
Things didn't progress as quickly
as I hoped at the beginning.

1656
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:18,013
<i>We kept having trouble while dividing</i>
<i>or prime-factorizing numbers as well.</i>

1657
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:20,890
That made me think,
"Maybe this wasn't so easy."

1658
01:17:21,391 --> 01:17:22,225
But...

1659
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:32,485
Wait. Where does this leave us, then?

1660
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:34,863
BY PLACING 2 PUZZLE PIECES

1661
01:17:34,946 --> 01:17:38,033
TEAM SNU GAINED LEADS ON 2 TARGET FORMULAS

1662
01:17:38,116 --> 01:17:40,869
- Has anyone prime-factorized it?
- No. You can go ahead.

1663
01:17:40,952 --> 01:17:42,537
- Shall I do it?
- Yes.

1664
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:48,293
- Nothing fits.
- This and that won't work.

1665
01:17:48,376 --> 01:17:50,587
- All these are out, too.
- That's the only one.

1666
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,048
That's so damn beautiful.

1667
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:55,675
We've examined all other possibilities,

1668
01:17:55,759 --> 01:17:58,428
and this piece is the only one
that can go here,

1669
01:17:58,511 --> 01:17:59,846
and the shape fits, too.

1670
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:02,807
I think 11 might work.

1671
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,977
- But multiplying by 11--
- What do we have now?

1672
01:18:09,647 --> 01:18:11,900
- It's 11 divided by...
- We got it.

1673
01:18:12,567 --> 01:18:13,401
We got it.

1674
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:14,819
- Good job.
- Let's fill these blocks.

1675
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:16,404
That's the only piece that will work.

1676
01:18:16,488 --> 01:18:18,490
- We're set this far.
- Are we 100% certain?

1677
01:18:18,573 --> 01:18:20,909
<i>Yes. There can be no other possibilities.</i>

1678
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:25,955
Why don't we get the answer checked now?

1679
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:27,165
Shall we try it now?

1680
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:30,210
I don't think that'll be a bad idea.

1681
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:33,338
<i>I wanted to use a chance</i>
<i>to check our answers</i>

1682
01:18:33,421 --> 01:18:35,298
earlier than the other teams.

1683
01:18:37,842 --> 01:18:40,470
<i>If we get the first few rows wrong,</i>

1684
01:18:40,553 --> 01:18:43,515
that can lead to devastating results
once we're done.

1685
01:18:43,598 --> 01:18:45,392
TEAM SNU PREPARES FOR A CHECK-UP
<i>So, I suggested</i>

1686
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:48,019
<i>that we get our answers checked early on.</i>

1687
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:50,230
I should leave out confusing parts, right?

1688
01:18:50,313 --> 01:18:51,314
Yes, that's right.

1689
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:53,692
TEAM SNU
FORMULA PUZZLE PRELIMINARY CHECK

1690
01:18:53,775 --> 01:18:54,984
Let's hand it in.

1691
01:18:58,863 --> 01:19:00,407
They're checking their answer.

1692
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:02,909
- Is he from SNU?
- Yes.

1693
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:06,037
<i>I was impressed by their speed.</i>

1694
01:19:06,746 --> 01:19:08,665
I submitted our answer sheet.

1695
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:10,083
Is that three?

1696
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:14,045
Team SNU submitted their answer
for the first review.

1697
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:16,214
- Ignore it.
- Of course.

1698
01:19:16,297 --> 01:19:17,424
Let's do our thing.

1699
01:19:18,341 --> 01:19:20,760
- They have the benefit.
- Don't mind them and hurry.

1700
01:19:21,636 --> 01:19:23,888
Team SNU's preliminary score...

01:19:39,821 --> 01:19:41,156
- Twenty-nine?
- What?

1707
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:43,616
- Are we lagging behind?
- We're fine.

1708
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,743
Don't let it get to you.

1709
01:19:44,826 --> 01:19:46,786
That wasn't so impressive.

1710
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:49,164
That's a nice start.

1711
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,665
They have the benefit.

1712
01:19:50,749 --> 01:19:52,751
- All right!
- Sweet.

1713
01:19:53,543 --> 01:19:54,961
We're going to win at this rate.

Don't worry about them.

01:20:18,651 --> 01:20:20,278
<i>Aren't we the de facto winner?</i>

1720
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:22,655
<i>That really ticked me off.</i>
