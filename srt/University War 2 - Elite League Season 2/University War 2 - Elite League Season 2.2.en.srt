FORMULA PUZZLE
Team SNU's preliminary score

2
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,404
is 29.

3
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,115
TEAM SNU HAD 30 BLOCKS CHECKED

4
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,410
29 CORRECT PLACEMENTS
1 INCORRECT PLACEMENT

5
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,995
- The five was wrong, as we hoped.
- It's not five.

6
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,122
- So, this was wrong.
- We can remove this.

7
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,832
This should go here instead.

8
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,961
This is the only one that works.

9
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,213
<i>- There's a times symbol here.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

10
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>That leaves us with either of these pieces</i>
<i>with fours that work.</i>

11
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,303
POSSIBLE PIECE OPTIONS

12
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,096
So, it's either one of these.

13
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,683
TEAM SNU'S STRATEGY
Why don't we write five here?

14
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,685
SUBMIT ONE POSSIBLE PIECE TO DEDUCE ANSWER

15
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,230
Other than the block we wrote in to check,
everything was correct.

16
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,360
<i>The fact that the five was wrong</i>
<i>actually worked out to be better for us.</i>

17
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,320
PIECE PLACEMENT CONFIRMED

18
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,280
- That's it.
- This should go here instead.

19
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,327
- Are we lagging behind?
- We're fine. Don't let it get to you.

20
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,703
That's a nice start.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,705
They have the benefit.

22
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,217
I'm sure about these.

25

<i>and make no mistakes in doing so,</i>

26
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,895
we had no reason
to fall in the bottom three.

27
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,075
<i>It's so reassuring to have</i>
<i>such a smart teammate.</i>

28
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:00,412
Why do I like mathematics?

29
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,330
Because I'm good at it.

- That's it.
- That's so hot.

35
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,220
- Can we use a times symbol here?
- That's super hot.

36
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,805
I'm pretty good at puzzles,

37
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,141
so I was responsible
for checking the layout

38
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,018
<i>and the combinations of the pieces.</i>

39
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,436
- Won't this work?
- How about...

40
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,397
Please check if we can proceed with that.

41
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,233
I kept my team informed
about the possible combinations

42
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,610
and which pieces would or wouldn't work.

43
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,696
<i>We kept an open line of communication.</i>

44
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,948
- This was a plus symbol.
- Right.

45
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,241
That one was a plus.

46
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,534
Don't worry about the puzzle.

47
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,785
TEAM OXFORD IS WELL ORGANIZED
Okay.

48
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,912
How's 1413 times 33 look?

49
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,497
- We wrote it as that.
- What, 1413?

50
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,832
- For the blocks here.
- With 33.

51
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,542
I think it's 33.

52
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,960
- Thirty-three?
- Yes.

53
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,712
Thirty-three?

54
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,506
- Are you sure about 54?
- Look, 454.

55
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,883
That works with the first row.

56
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:55,884
Look, we have one here.

57
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,510
- That's perfect.
- Great.

58
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,096
<i>We were making steady progress,</i>

59
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,307

Our initial strategy

63
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,696
was to come up with formulas
in the corners first.

64
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,948
<i>But when we actually tried doing it,</i>

65

DIFFICULTIES IN THE INITIAL STRATEGY
<i>it didn't work as well as we had hoped.</i>

66
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,620
This is difficult.

67
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,747
We made changes to our strategy

68
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,377
<i>to complete the puzzle by starting</i>
<i>from just one corner first.</i>

69
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,670

Something's not right.

75
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,266
Should we just give up on the big numbers?

76
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,644
- It's pretty hard, right?
- I can't seem to get it.

77
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,771
- It's not a bad idea to ditch them.
- Right.

78
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,856
Starting from here won't be so bad.

79
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,234
- Two hundred sixty-five...
- We've already cracked one formula here.

80
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,568
Keep that in mind while working.

81
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,446
We should try piecing
the puzzles together.

82
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,364
You're right.

83
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,241
- I've tried--
- Having two people crack big numbers

84
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,367
is a waste of time.

85
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,910
This must be it, right?

TEAM YONSEI'S FIRST PRELIMINARY CHECK

Damn it. Team Yonsei's checking?

91
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,518
Team Yonsei's preliminary score...

92
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,774
is 72.

93
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,026
- There we go.
- That's it.

94
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,569
We're on a roll. This is it.

95
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,114
They got 72?

96
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,491
- What was that?
- Seventy-two.

97
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,659
They're almost done.

98
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:45,952
Dang.

99
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,537
What? 72 points?

100
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,622
Come on, that's not much.

101
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,876
<i>To hear Team Yonsei of all the teams</i>
<i>to make so much progress so quickly</i>

102
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,129
<i>made me feel more and more anxious,</i>
<i>and I was in a panic.</i>

103
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,298
Stay calm and collected.

104
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,341
Sure, that's paltry.

105
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>To be perfectly honest,</i>

106
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,552
I was deeply shaken.

107
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,097
At that point,
our block count was nowhere near 70.

108
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,559
<i>Team Yonsei's score meant</i>
<i>they were halfway done.</i>

109
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,979
<i>Hearing that made me wonder</i>
<i>if they had the upper hand.</i>

110
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,816
How are they working so fast?

111
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,443
This is it, isn't it?

112
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,652
- Yes.
- How about this?

113
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,987
This goes in this row.

114
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,865
<i>We had a good cycle going on.</i>

115
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,576
Because we have teammates
who are great at calculation...

116
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,577
Guys.

117
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,871
That's 623 squared.

118
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,457
I got it. It's 151 times 353.

119
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,792
That leaves us with nine.

120
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,377
You're amazing.

121
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,254
<i>Jeong-hun is sure about his answers,</i>
<i>and he's always right.</i>

122
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,673
<i>And he's so quick.</i>

123
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,550
- Can you prime-factorize 313?
- What, 313?

124
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,804
- It's a prime number.
- Really? Okay.

125
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,515
<i>He says you'll find numbers in your head</i>
<i>once you do enough calculations.</i>

126
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,434
There's this number I'm confident about.

127
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,853
But this is obviously a multiple of nine.

128
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,357
Wait. I think I recognize this number.

129
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,279
<i>I think I've seen it before.</i>

130
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,284
I knew I saw this from somewhere.

131
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,537
- It's because of this.
- Okay.

132
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,582
<i>I knew 279936 was 6 to the power of 7.</i>

133
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,169
- This just came to me.
- So, we should add one.

134
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,838
Judging by the number of blocks,

135
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,881
it had to be 6 to the power of 7 plus 1.

136
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,508
- We'd need six, then.
- Right.

137
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,596
<i>While the others worked on the math,</i>
<i>I pieced puzzles together from the top.</i>

138
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,807
- What about this?
<i>- There are fewer possibilities</i>

139
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,058
<i>when it's treated as a puzzle.</i>

140
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,810
Hey, that works.

141
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,562
- Okay. That's done.
- We got that one.

142
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,105
You're so good at this.

143
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,106
That's hot.

144
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,774
I'm playing a game of Tetris here.

145
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,069
Well, if you did,
you'd probably be the best in Korea.

146
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,321
We're doing so well.

149
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,622
Some haven't even placed any.

150
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,249
Some haven't even placed any.

151
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,545
TEAM KAIST HASN'T PLACED
A SINGLE PIECE YET

152
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,299
<i>When Team SNU got theirs reviewed,</i>

153
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,177
<i>I could console myself,</i>
<i>thinking it was thanks to the benefit.</i>

154
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,221
But when I heard
that Team Yonsei got around 70 right,

155
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,098
I realized we were doing something wrong.

156
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,768
We should start working on
the puzzle pieces.

157
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,021
- I don't think we can relax right now.
- We need to do it.

158
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,774
Our initial plan was
to leave the puzzle pieces

159
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,984
until we were sure about their placements.

160
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,154
30 MINUTES AGO

161
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,155
I got all the blocks.

162
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,240
This row should form this number, right?

163
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,201
- Sure.
- It's a square number.

164
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,660
TEAM KAIST SOLVED 2 TARGETS QUICKLY

165
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,537
- Did you get it?
- I got this one, too.

166
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,039
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I got it.

167
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,375
<i>That got me overly excited, I think.</i>

168
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,671
<i>I thought we had a shot at breaking down</i>
<i>the center row with a ten-digit number.</i>

169
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,923
Let's try it together.

170
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,510
<i>So, we ended up</i>
<i>doing endless calculations.</i>

171
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,641
<i>It was a mistake to have</i>
<i>three work on the same row.</i>

172
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,561
<i>We got lost in endless calculations.</i>

173
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,939
<i>It was as if we got entranced.</i>

174
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,440
<i>We couldn't give up easily</i>

175
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,068
<i>because it felt like</i>
<i>we were at the edge of discovery.</i>

176
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,653
<i>So, we couldn't just stop.</i>

177
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,071
Sixty-six doesn't work.

178
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,408
Where did I go wrong?

179
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,660
<i>We used up about 30 minutes on it.</i>

180
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,454
<i>It felt so regretful</i>
<i>to waste that much time.</i>

181
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,961
It's all right. We've got this.

182
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,879
Of course, we do.

183
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,548
We'll get it done.

00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,137
SNU: 2ND PLACE, YONSEI: 1ST PLACE

187
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,222
- A four-digit number?
- Don't you think...

188
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,890
Wait. I came up with something.

189
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,060
This can get us a formula
of a 5-digit number plus a 3-digit one

190
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,812
which yields the target here.

191
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,022
You're right.

192
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:44,941
This is great.

193
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,234

Guys. Huddle up for a second.

196
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,283
Let's suppose
we got everything right so far.

197
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,368
- Okay.
- Then, this space needs to have this,

198
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,120
- Yes?
- or it has to be this.

199
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,288
I'll tell you why.

200
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,248
A BLACK PUZZLE
This white times symbol

201
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,916
NO VISIBLE INFORMATION
is only on these pieces.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,376
- Okay.
- But this won't make a six.

203
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,462
- Then, it must be the Black Puzzle.
- Let me check.

204
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,130
- We can decide after that.
- Try this row.

205
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,923
We can't forget this either.

206
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:09,841
Look.

207
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,259
A white times symbol.

208
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,303
TEAM SNU HAS A VISIBLE BLACK PUZZLE.

209
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,348
YONSEI'S BLOCK COUNT: 80
LOOKS FOR A SPOT FOR THE BLACK PUZZLE

210
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,224
Eight, nine, ten, and sixteen.

211
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,060
SNU'S BLOCK COUNT: 56
This is right.

212
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,187
SNU'S BLOCK COUNT: 60
This is the only option.

213
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,689
- How's this?
- That works.

214
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,317
SNU CLOSES IN ON YONSEI
With this, we can use five, too.

215
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,695
- I know where the Black Puzzle goes.
- Where?

216
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,155
- Here?
- Yes.

217
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,365
- Right.
- It goes here?

218
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,991
Are you sure about that?

219
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,329
Se-hwan must be right.
It sits perfectly with the other rows.

220
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,247
Team Yonsei didn't pass the 100 mark.

221
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,291
Once we gain momentum, we can beat them.

222
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,005
How's 6561?

223
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,549
Wait, isn't that a power of three?

224
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,843
- Right. Then this should go here.
- There.

225
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,428
- There we go.
- We need to make 463.

226
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,472
- We need three.
- The piece from earlier should work.

227
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,682
And 1421...

228
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,643
Tell me what to do next.

229
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,020
- Let's see what piece we might need here.
- Okay.

230
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,523
Try making up a combo using these numbers.

231
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,732
YONSEI HAS 6 REMAINING

232
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,528
- But the Black piece...
- I know.

233
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,655
- We should consider where it goes.
- How does this look?

234
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,160
<i>When we got to finding the spot</i>
<i>for the Black Puzzle...</i>

235
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,204
We have six where we wanted, right?

236
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,997
Isn't this our only option?

237
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,001
- Does anything work?
- Yes. This definitely works.

238
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,336
At this rate, we'll be done in no time.

239
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,629
- How about--
- This is it.

240
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,965
- Right, the times symbol.
- This is the only one with it.

241
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,926
<i>When we were down to the last four pieces,</i>

242
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,428
<i>we thought we had it in the bag.</i>

243
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,554
I think we will win.

244
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,559
They are getting to me.

245
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,978
- As for others...
- We're almost done.

246
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:45,937
How does this look?

247
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,647
- Look.
- How about this corner?

248
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,399
We can use these two

249
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,859
- and fill up here.
- I can check.

250
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,777
Have we confirmed these blocks?

251
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,196
Not yet. Hold on.

252
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,115
- We have an error here.
- Right.

253
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,742
It's 353 times 151, right?

254
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,368
I know what we can use here.

255
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,619
- So--
- That's 453.

256
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,704
Really, 453?

257
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,080
Look. This is 453.

258
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,125
It's 4 times 4.

259
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,003
We need to fill the last digit of 650.

260
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:10,920
2 PIECES REMAIN

261
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,382
- Put it there.
- Behold the power of Tetris.

262
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,634
I could see it working.

263
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,595
All done except for the Black Puzzle.

264
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,721
Try this. I'll solve that.

265
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,556
- Wait. It won't take long, right?
- Right. Okay!

266
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,641
This is a race against time.

TEAM SNU COMPLETES THE PUZZLE

268
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,357

- Let's check this one last time.

269
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,399
- Are we sure?
- Yes.

270
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,859
- Is this it?
- Yes, go submit it.

271
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,402
As quickly as you can.

272
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,032
We might get a tie.

I'm hoping we can show everyone our team

as we keep growing older
and more experienced.

291
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,712
Gyu-min did all the heavy lifting.

292
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,296
No, I didn't.

293
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,051
<i>Gyu-min was the MVP in effect,</i>
<i>figuring out 623 squared</i>

and securing the Black Puzzle's info

We're up next.

296
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,267
The benefit is a huge bonus.

297
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,437

- Yeah, we do.

I'll be so impressed if they get 113.

301
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,322
Your score is 113.

302
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,365
- Yes!
- Well done.

303
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,825

00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,203

Good job.

306
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,916
- It's done. Huddle up.
- We did well.

307
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,170
<i>If we can maintain</i>
<i>this high level of teamwork,</i>

308
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,840
I dare say we can have a landslide win
in the next match.

309
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,967
It sure feels great to be in the top two

310
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,886
to lead by a huge margin.

311
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,637
We're the top dogs here.

312
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,310
- Team Yonsei's really good.
- They are, right?

313
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,936
They didn't have the benefit.

314
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,564
The Black Puzzle
would've been a huge hurdle.

315
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,068
Even without the benefit,
we still came very close to Team SNU.

316
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,362

00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,128
- Yes?
- That could work, right?

342
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,295
THEY CHANGE THEIR STRATEGY

343
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,630
I think I could work with that.

344
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,132
With the times symbol here...

345
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:46,094
<i>We decided to change our strategy</i>
<i>and piece the puzzles together one by one.</i>

346
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,388
- That works, right?
- Yes!

347
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,098
- It does.
- Wait.

348
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,475
Only this piece can go here.

349
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,935
We should find a piece to go here.

350
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,270
- Look for that shape.
- Okay.

351
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,563
That's it, right? Yes.

352
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,065
Keep it there.

353
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,569
The new strategy helped us
fill up the board quickly and correctly,

354
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,947
which meant we never had to know
all the answers to begin with.

355
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,324
Why don't we work on it a bit more

356
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,326
- and have our answer reviewed?
- Let's do that.

357
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,454
Wait. We have to decide
how much to get reviewed.

358
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,457
Why can't I crack this?
We should get it reviewed, too.

359
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,417
Let me try calculating this.

360
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,506
<i>I did get deeply concerned at that point.</i>

361
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,884
We couldn't factorize the target number<i>.</i>

362
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,136
It was 53,303.

363
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,806
<i>Considering the target's last digit,</i>

364
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,351
<i>its factors should end with either 3 or 1.</i>

365
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,020
I considered practically all possibilities

366
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,271
but still had no luck.

367
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,898
BOTH FACTORS ARE PRIME NUMBERS

368
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,484
TO FACTORIZE 53,303,
IT NEEDS TO BE DIVIDED UP TO 151

369
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:49,199
Are we taking the right approach?
This seems inefficient.

370
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,577
Finding the right piece can be a key.
We've placed so many already.

371
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,289
OXFORD'S BLOCK COUNT: 32

372
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,376
I think I got it. Just a second.

373
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,502
- What is it for?
- Tell us.

374
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,129
It's 353 times 151.

375
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,965
<i>So, it's 353 times 151?</i>

376
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,135
Jin-hyeon made the correct calculations

377
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,554
<i>just when we needed them the most.</i>

378
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,223
- I'll get back to you in two minutes.
- Okay.

379
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,766
Here. I'm done.

380
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,645
<i>We were able</i>
<i>to work through the board quickly</i>

381
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,147
<i>by inputting the numbers he came up with.</i>

382
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,826
That's 1 plus 454.

383
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,744
Yes.

384
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,204
Look at this row.

385
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,208
<i>So, this is definitely a one.</i>

386
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,793
<i>- And 3, too.</i>
<i>- Right, 3 and 1.</i>

387
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,547
TEAM MIT FILLED UP 56 BLOCKS
THROUGH CALCULATION ALONE

388
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,883
We're falling too far behind
on placing the pieces, though.

389
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,804
BUT HAVEN'T PLACED AS MANY PUZZLES YET

390
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,515
- I'll submit this.
- Okay.

391
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:01,312
Team KU submitted their answer
for the first review.

392
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,238
Team KU's preliminary score is 49.

393
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,906
- ...is 49.
- We're good!

394
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,991
ALL 49 PLACEMENTS ARE CORRECT
We're good.

395
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,242
- Let's keep at it.
- Let's go.

396
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,243
It's over.

397
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,245
<i>We got all the blocks right so far.</i>

398
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,705
TEAM KU, 49 CORRECT PLACEMENTS

399
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,958
I've got some great news coming soon.

400
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,752
We're counting on you.

401
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:24,961
...is 49.

402
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,839
- We can turn things around.
- I'd say they haven't got the hang of it.

403
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,592
There they are, giving us more courage.

404
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,635
- I've figured this one out.
- He's got something.

405
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,304
We need a times symbol here

406
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,181
- followed by 6561.
- So 5 and 6...

407
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,641
- That sounds about right.
- Yeah, it does.

408
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,101
Let's check our progress, then.

409
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:43,855
TEAM POSTECH'S 1ST PRELIMINARY CHECK

410
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:51,446
Team POSTECH submitted their answer
for the first review.

411
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,032
Team POSTECH's preliminary score

412
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,493
is 75.

413
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,204
Don't get excited yet.

414
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,581
- We got most of it right, right?
- Right.

415
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,459
- It looks like their plan's working.
- Right.

416
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,378
We should've started on the puzzle sooner.

417
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:09,297
Right. Everyone else started
with the puzzle.

418
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,633
<i>Knowing others were clearly ahead of us</i>

419
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,177
<i>made us feel even more pressed for time.</i>

420
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,012
I'm losing my mind here.

421
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,597
Calm down. We're good.

422
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,228
- Do you want to use this long one here?
- Exactly.

423
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,813
I'm looking for a times symbol and three.

424
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:25,980
That looks promising.

425
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:28,650
We can divide this.

426
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,360
- This should work.
- Thanks.

427
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,695
I got it, Eun.

428
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,238
You did?

429
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:35,740
It's 300 and...

430
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,075
- Yes, finally.
- It works.

431
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,618
There we go.

432
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,667
Why can't I get this?

433
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,502
- Do you mean this?
- Won't this work?

434
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:48,878
TEAM KU TRIES TO PLACE THE BLACK PUZZLE

435
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:49,963
Just a second.

436
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,341
- What if we divide this by three?
- Hold on.

437
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,010
- I don't think--
- Can I try that?

438
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,428
- I got it.
- You did.

439
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,304
That's 363 times...
How do we make that work?

440
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,806
We're almost done.

441
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,643
- My bad.
- Let's try narrowing things down.

442
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:04,561
This is it.

443
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,402
TEAM POSTECH COMPLETES THE FORMULA PUZZLE

444
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,486
Go!

445
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,367
- We could come in third, right?
- The lid!

446
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,786
Let's get ready to cover it.

447
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,582
Team POSTECH submitted their answer
for the second review.

448
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,250
They must be done now.

449
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,419
There's no need to cower.

450
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,590
Team POSTECH's preliminary score...

451
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,427
is 113.

452
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,262

00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,689
Let's keep it down. They're still working.

456
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,442
Can I give you a kiss on the cheek?

457
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,321
<i>My team is very close-knit,</i>

458
00:19:56,404 --> 00:20:01,242
and I'm confident that our teamwork
is as good as it can get.

00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,380
I need a times symbol.

466
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,091
We really need to pick up the pace now.

467
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,051

- Really?
- Yes.

471
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,556
- I'll go hand it in.
- Should we hand it in?

472

- Go right ahead.
- Yes.

476
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,488
- Great!
- What did you say we should place here?

477
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,948
- We need 241 here.
- Oh, right.

478
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,035
Do we already have the formula?

479
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,161
Yes.

480
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,163
The Black Puzzle can't go here, right?

481
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,331
Try 65321...

482
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,916
I'll tackle the case with four on top.

483
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,626
Okay, that sounds good.

484
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,169
- That...
- That piece definitely goes there.

485
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,462
- Do this for me.
- It goes here.

486
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:55,922
FOUND THE RIGHT SPOT FOR THE BLACK PUZZLE

487
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,049
- Okay. Can you check this, Mun-hyeok?
- I'll do it.

488
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,050
One with 15589.

489
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,012
It's all done.
We can just go by its shapes now.

490
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,388
- Only this will fit.
- Right.

491
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,598
- Let's get to calculations.
- Only this can go here.

492
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,183
That checks out.

493
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,268
- Really?
- It's the only option.

494
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,645
- But that doesn't work with the formulas.
- It doesn't work.

495
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,480
This should go here. Can you confirm it?

496
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,815
COMPLETES THE PUZZLE
Well...

497
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,483
- Write this up.
- We need this figured out.

498
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:16,985
That confirms this row.

499
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,778
- The 36 goes here.
- Wait.

500
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,322
- Let's get it checked first.
- It's right.

501
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,074
- Okay.
- That's for certain.

502
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,372
- Let's submit the answers.
- Give me that.

503
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:31,458
Submit it.

It's wrong? I thought it was right.

507
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,813
I made a calculation mistake.

508
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,066
I made a calculation mistake.

509
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,779
Six, and then zero, six...

510
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:07,160

00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,876
I feel really good.

513
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,253
I love our team.

514
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,672
Same here.

515
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,256
We're so well-balanced.

516
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,591
I don't care about anything else.

517
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,302
My heart is bubbling
with love for you guys.

518
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,055
- We did so well today.
- Yeah.

519
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,182
We could've walked all over them.

520
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,267
We would have if we had the benefit.

521
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,645
- There's no doubt about it.
- Seriously.

522
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,647
Ji-seong was our MVP of the day.

523
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,941
- His "iconic" strategy worked well, too.
- You did well.

524
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,025
It really did.

525
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:42,362
<i>I felt grateful to my team</i>
<i>for respecting my takes on things.</i>

526
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,406
<i>It felt really good.</i>

527
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,033
I'm totally spent.

528
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:49,953
Oh, man...

529
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,217
<i>The final results will now be revealed.</i>

530
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:05,719
<i>First place,</i>

531
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,387
<i>Team SNU.</i>

FORMULA PUZZLE, 1ST: TEAM SNU

533
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:12,183
<i>We proved ourselves,</i>
<i>and I was proud to be an SNU student.</i>

534
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,352
<i>Second place, Team Yonsei.</i>

535
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,521

536
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,899
<i>I believe our success today</i>

537
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,735
<i>We'll do our best again tomorrow.</i>

538
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,988
<i>We saw a strong potential for winning.</i>

00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,949
<i>Third place, Team POSTECH.</i>

541
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,286
<i>I feel a twinge of regret.</i>

542
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:35,040
<i>But I'm sure you'll witness</i>
<i>our strength in no time.</i>

543
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,750
WHICH TEAM WILL JOIN THEM?
<i>Fourth place...</i>

544
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:46,801
<i>Fourth place,</i>

545
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,428
<i>Team Oxford.</i>

FORMULA PUZZLE, 4TH: TEAM OXFORD

547
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,146
I made a calculation mistake.

548
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,441
EUN MISTOOK THE CALCULATION RESULTS
Oh, no. I didn't.

549
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:02,776
So, is it four?

550
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,778
Yes, we do need four there.

551
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,988
Cover the board right away
when you hear 113.

552
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,074
Team Oxford's preliminary score

553
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,368
is 113.

554
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,827
Close it!

555
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,500
- Huddle up.
- Let's go.

556
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,044
All right. Good job.

557
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:24,839
<i>We made it through the first day.</i>

558
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,509
<i>I'm so happy we escaped the Deathmatch.</i>

559

560
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,181
KU, KAIST, MIT: UP FOR ELIMINATION

561
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:36,434
We focused too much on calculations
and forgot about the puzzle.

562
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,311
It's a shame.

563
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,606
I won't sleep tonight
if we get sent home like this.

564
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,525
There's no way we're going home.

565
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:47,195
<i>I told myself to secure a win</i>
<i>in the Deathmatch, no matter what.</i>

566
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:51,199
This was a game that we had
a fair chance of doing well.

567
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,785
That's why I feel even more frustrated.

568
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,161
Where did it go wrong?

569
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:00,291
We should've played
while piecing the puzzle together,

570
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,460
but we totally forgot about that.

571
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,755
<i>I felt deeply disappointed.</i>

572
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:08,591
We just have to win.

573
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:12,012
<i>I haven't even considered the possibility</i>
<i>of having to play the Deathmatch.</i>

574
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,722
<i>I was really shocked.</i>

575
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,557
Let's stop regretting

576
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,476
and turn our focus to the Deathmatch.

577
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,311
- We just have to win.
- Absolutely.

578
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,897
<i>Those who failed</i>
<i>to complete Formula Puzzle,</i>

579

<i>Please go to the Deathmatch Hall</i>

583
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,073
<i>and prepare for the Deathmatch.</i>

584
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,951
They even changed the lighting.

585
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:36,453
That's brutal.

586
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:38,204
It's scary, for sure.

587
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,915
That's so savage. Let's not end up there.

588
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,417
I don't want to go in there.

589
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,769
What are these?

590
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,521
The pillars are all toppled.

591
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,696
<i>I thought, "We shouldn't have</i>
<i>lost the main match.</i>

592
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,989
<i>Look where we ended up."</i>

593
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:14,657
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

594
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:18,828
<i>I didn't want the team</i>
<i>to end up ruined like this place.</i>

595
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:23,792
<i>I thought my teammates</i>
<i>were all more than capable.</i>

596
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,585
<i>I think we have a good chance.</i>

597
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,921
I'm seriously upset.

598
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,799
<i>　We kept telling each other,</i>
<i>"Let's not end up in a Deathmatch"</i>

599
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:36,179
<i>I'll put everything behind me</i>
<i>and do my best to survive the Deathmatch.</i>

600
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,684
<i>The Deathmatch will now begin.</i>

601
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,901
<i>The three teams</i>
<i>competing for survival today</i>

602
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,612
<i>will play two Deathmatches in total.</i>

603
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:54,781
<i>Only one team will be left surviving.</i>

604
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,659
<i>The team that ranked lowest</i>
<i>in the first game</i>

605
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,494
<i>will be eliminated immediately.</i>

606
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:04,249
<i>The remaining top two teams</i>
<i>will participate in the second Deathmatch.</i>

607
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:07,377
<i>The result of the second Deathmatch</i>

608
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,295

609
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,924
<i>and which will face immediate elimination.</i>

610
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,134
Damn it.

611
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,972
- How heartless!
- Two games in a row?

612
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,807
Guys, two teams are going home.

613
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,518
Don't be so delighted.

614
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,520
We're all in the same boat here.

615
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:27,022
Get off your high horse.

616
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,607
I know how happy you must be right now.

617
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:31,776
How nice.

618
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,696
I'd hate to win the first one
then lose the next.

619
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:35,780
This is savage.

620
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,241
Why wouldn't they eliminate
two teams at once?

621
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,784
We got this, okay?

622
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:41,119
Stay sharp.

623
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,621
We just need to win both games to stay.

624
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,082
We can do it. We just have to win.

625
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,919
- Keep it cool, my heart.
<i>- Today's Deathmatch</i>

626

627
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,636
Wasn't it about finding a person?

628
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,764
- It's that detective game.
- Right.

629
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,307
"Signal Investigation 2"?

630
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,517
- That's the Deathmatch now?
- How could it be?

631
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:05,685
Isn't this reasoning?

632
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,270
I want to play, too.

633
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,271
It's a team game.

634
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,481
It's a reasoning test.

635
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,567
<i>In Signal Investigation 2,</i>

636
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,653
<i>you'll have to decipher sentences</i>

00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,197
<i>to identify the culprit.</i>

638
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,656
- "A mystery language"?
- "A mystery language"?

639
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,285
<i>There will be two rounds per game.</i>

640
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,286
30 MINUTES PER ROUND

641
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,662
<i>In the first round,</i>

642
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:28,500
<i>you'll be given 48 sentences,</i>
<i>laid out in a random order.</i>

643
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,211
<i>Out of the 48 sentences,</i>

644
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:34,673
<i>half will be in the mystery language,</i>

645
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:38,760
<i>and the other half</i>
<i>will be the Korean translations</i>

646
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,720
<i>of the ones in the mystery language.</i>

647
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,014
<i>While they all have a matching pair,</i>

648
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,892
<i>the sentences are not laid out</i>
<i>in a matching order.</i>

649
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,645
30 MINUTES TO DECIPHER THE LANGUAGE
<i>In the first round,</i>

650
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:52,107
<i>the contestants have to find out</i>
<i>how to interpret the mystery language.</i>

651
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:59,572
<i>When the second round starts,</i>
<i>you'll be given photos of the ten suspects</i>

652
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:02,534
<i>along with three sentences</i>
<i>written in the mystery language</i>

653
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:05,412
<i>that describes the culprit's appearance.</i>

654
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:09,374
<i>Based on the information gathered</i>
<i>in the first round,</i>

655
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:13,503
<i>you must decode the three sentences</i>
<i>to pinpoint the culprit.</i>

656
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,296
<i>You will have 30 minutes</i>

657
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,591
<i>to place and submit the culprit's photo</i>
<i>in the investigation envelope.</i>

658
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:19,634
SIGNAL INVESTIGATION 2

659
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:21,761
It's completely different from last time.

660
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,972
That sounds really difficult.

661
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,099
<i>Teams that apprehend the culprit win,</i>

662
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,560
<i>and those who don't will lose.</i>

663
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,937
<i>If all teams succeed</i>
<i>in apprehending the culprit,</i>

664
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:34,858
<i>the rank will be decided</i>
<i>based on the order of answer submission.</i>

665
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,903
<i>The top two teams will participate</i>
<i>in the second Deathmatch.</i>

666
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,614
<i>The team that does not succeed</i>

667
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,700
<i>will be eliminated from Elite League.</i>

668
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,286
Winning this game
doesn't guarantee your survival.

669
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,580
- There's still another game.
- You could still get eliminated.

670
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,123
That's insane.

671
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,043
The last game
was all about creating evidence photos.

672
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:55,378
This could be better.
The photos were confusing.

673
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,756
<i>Having a good intuition</i>
<i>seemed to be important,</i>

674
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,260
<i>and I'm quite intuitive by nature,</i>
<i>so I thought I could help my team to win.</i>

675
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:05,555
<i>I liked my team's chances</i>
<i>for winning the game.</i>

676
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:06,931
We need a good strategy.

677
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,558
I didn't see this coming.

678
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,518
<i>Even without working hard for it,</i>

679
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,812
<i>I always had good results</i>
<i>in linguistic ability tests.</i>

680
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:14,647
<i>I felt very confident.</i>

681
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,525
<i>This was one of the games</i>
<i>I was expecting to see.</i>

682
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:21,321
<i>So, I thought the odds were in our favor.</i>

683
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:22,989
I think you'll be good at this.

684
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:26,284
<i>Deduction and reasoning</i>
<i>are areas that I'm fond of,</i>

685
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,787
<i>so I felt this was something</i>
<i>I could do well in.</i>

686
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:32,832
<i>Please start discussing your strategies.</i>

687
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:39,714
- First off, this is what came to my mind.
- Okay.

688
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:42,342
We have to break down
the Korean sentences and count them.

689
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:46,304
Right. For example, how many times
"man" or "woman" appear.

690
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:49,557
We need to spend at least three minutes
to tally things up first

691
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,685
because we have no information to work on.

692
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:58,316
Or if "glasses" comes up five times.

693
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,695
We should count the words first
and then start matching them.

694
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:05,407
A complete understanding
of the new language isn't a requirement.

695
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,160
The task can be carried out
with good matching and reasoning skills.

696
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:12,997
Our strategy was to match words
that appeared the same number of times.

697
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,374
Here's an example.

698
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,668
If "tu" and "man" both appear eight times

699
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:19,379
and "su" and "woman"
both appear seven times,

700
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:21,464
<i>We could say we found</i>
<i>two corresponding cases.</i>

701
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:22,549
MATCH MADE BASED ON COUNT

702
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:23,466
Here's my take.

703
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,177
If we can match two full sentences,

704
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,430
- we could gain tons of information.
- You're right.

705
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:30,473
It's not about grammar.
It's a matching game.

706
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:34,227
This is just another puzzle,
so we need to treat it like one.

707
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,938
How should we mark the words
that match in meaning?

708
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:38,982
We could come up with a table

709
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,900
that could give us a clear overview.

710
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,570
That might be more helpful
than blindly writing things down.

711
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,405
Why don't we make a table first

712
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:48,116
with rows and columns like "Korean,"
"Mystery Language," and "Count"?

713
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,369
<i>We thought information access</i>
<i>was the key to success here.</i>

714
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,706
<i>So, we decided to share everything</i>
<i>by writing it up on the board.</i>

715
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,584
If we lose, we're out. We have to win.

716
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,211
- We need to answer as soon as it starts.
- That should be our goal.

717
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:04,716
<i>I think I could actually have fun</i>
<i>with a reasoning game like this.</i>

718
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,553
Would it be better
to group all 24 sentences together?

719
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:14,517
Sure. That's why I'm suggesting
that we write the sentences--

720
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,436
Wait, it's not about the sentences.
It's about--

721
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,732
Yeah, but I don't know if there's going to
be a lot of sentences with the same words.

722
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:21,858
But there has to be.

723
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:25,111
I've tried similar problems before,
and it's just how it has to be.

724
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:29,532
<i>Min-seok took a linguistics course at MIT,</i>

725
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,202
<i>and he used his knowledge</i>
<i>to set up our framework.</i>

726
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:38,208
Even if we get many of the words,

727
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,418
we'll be in trouble
without the word for negation.

728
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:44,464
<i>A mistake in identifying the negation</i>

729
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:47,926
<i>could lead to interpreting</i>
<i>sentences in the complete opposite.</i>

730
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:53,014
<i>As such, identifying the negation plays</i>
<i>a key role in Signal Investigation 2.</i>

731
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:11,074
Okay, let's listen to the guy
who took a linguistics course.

732
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,914
Try to jog your memory of the course.

733
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,877
<i>To be perfectly honest,</i>

734
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,839
if we find the words for gender,
color, hairstyle, accessories,

735
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:29,009
confirmation, and negation,
we can find our culprit easily.

736
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:31,511
The hints we need
will be in the Korean sentences.

737
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,763
Correctly counting
the repetition of words is crucial.

738
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:36,558
But we shouldn't focus too much
on just counting.

739
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:39,060
What if many sets appear
the same number of times?

740
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,771
We should treat them like simple hints.

741
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:44,941
RA-EL SUGGESTS FOCUSING ON SENTENCES
These aren't independent sentences.

742
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,484
They're all connected to each other.

743
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:49,446
- I think we should utilize that point.
- How are they connected, though?

744
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,406
Think about it. "She is wearing a hat."

745
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:52,866
"She is wearing glasses."

746
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,826
They are constructed the same way.

747
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:57,370
We're bound to find sentences
that are somehow connected.

748
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,039
I guess we could call them key sentences.

749
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:00,999
- Pairs of key sentences.
- Okay, I get it.

750
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,835
And there could be
different sentence structures, too.

751
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,628
It could be, "She has long hair."

752
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,297
- It could also be, "Her hair is long."
- Right.

753
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,799
The same sentence
could be paraphrased like this.

754
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,218
I see. The difference
is noticeable even in English.

755
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:15,388
That's why I'm suggesting
we should classify the sentences.

756
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:19,434
But think about it.
Sentence structures can be scrambled.

757
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:22,437
I think it'd be best
to count the repetitions

758
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,940
and find matching pairs
based on the result.

759
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:28,234
- Let's find a balance between them.
- All right.

760
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,528
Both ideas sound great to me.

761
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,155
- Right.
- They are only slightly different.

762
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:34,991
I think we could cover both approaches
by assigning roles.

763
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,953
No one can submit an answer
during the first 30 minutes, anyway.

764
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:42,499
So, let's use that time
to gather as much information as we can.

765
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:45,835
And if one team submits their answer,
then we should take a gamble.

766
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,505
Right, I think we should take some risks.

767
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:52,258
- Since we saw the sentence...
- Here's what's been bugging me.

768
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:53,718
Our strategy feels weak.

769
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:57,472
<i>We had already come up</i>
<i>with everything that I could think of.</i>

770
00:34:57,555 --> 00:34:59,599
<i>I was worried</i>
<i>that we might fall behind at this rate.</i>

771
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:03,395
<i>So, I kept pushing my team</i>
<i>to keep coming up with new ideas.</i>

772
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:06,523
We need more ways
to help us match words together.

773
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:08,942
<i>You have one minute left</i>
<i>to discuss your strategy.</i>

774
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:10,652
- Let's do our chant.
- I just...

775
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,238
Let's all do it to lift our spirits.

776
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,155
One, two, three.

777
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,949
- Let's go, Team KAIST!
- Let's go, Team KAIST!

778
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:20,495
- Let's go, KU!
- Let's go, KU!

779
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:25,875
<i>The time for the strategy meeting is up.</i>

780
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,339
EVIDENCE BOX

781
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,049
We'll now begin the first round.

782
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:35,969
Please have your team's representative
come to the Main Hall

783
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:38,263
and collect the evidence box.

784
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,057
Your 30 minutes start now.

785
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:43,143
Open it.

786
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:45,854
Take everything out.

787
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,690
<i>Going into the first main match,</i>

788
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:52,068
<i>we mistakenly thought</i>
<i>others might not finish under 150 minutes</i>

789
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,320
<i>and worked at a too leisurely pace.</i>

790
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:57,198
<i>This time, we're assuming all others</i>
<i>can submit their answers on the dot</i>

791
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,159
<i>and we'll stay focused on joining them.</i>

792
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,326
This is insane.

793
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,540
Why is this so long?

794
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:07,292
KOREAN

795
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,336
MYSTERY LANGUAGE

796
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:12,756
KINYARWANDA: NATIONAL LANGUAGE OF RWANDA
<i>The mystery language</i>

797
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,424
<i>for the game is Kinyarwanda.</i>

798
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:18,511
<i>Its grammar is very different</i>
<i>from that of Korean.</i>

799
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:23,266
<i>During the first round,</i>
<i>the three teams will study 48 sentences</i>

800
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:27,103
<i>to come up with ways</i>
<i>to interpret the Kinyarwanda sentences.</i>

801
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,190
That's insane.
It looks like such a difficult language.

802
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,777
One, two, three, four,

803
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:37,405
- five, six, seven, eight...
- Right hand.

804
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:42,160
TEAM KAIST STARTS COUNTING
THE NUMBER OF TIMES EACH WORD WAS USED

805
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,538
We have to tally the words right.

806
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:48,208
I'll count "shirt."

807
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:49,751
Do it.

808
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,586
I'll check for "glasses."

809
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,297
I'll check for "glasses."

810
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,716
I'll count that.

811
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,719
- Let me see the whole set.
- I'll check the Korean texts.

812
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:00,637
Twenty...

813
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,972
I'll read the words
that are repeated a lot.

814
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,308
<i>"Umugabo," "umwe," "ntago,"</i> and <i>"afite."</i>

815
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:07,435
- They keep getting repeated.
- Right.

816
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:11,856
ALL 3 TEAMS START BY COUNTING THE WORDS

817
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,401
This may be easier than expected.

818
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:17,237
I'll count <i>"uwo."</i>

819
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,531
Two, three, four,

820
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:21,783
five, six, seven, eight.

821
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:23,368
Eight times.

822
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:24,869
<i>"Uwo"</i> was used eight times.

823
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:29,833
"THAT" WAS ALSO USED 8 TIMES

824
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,210
I think <i>"uwo"</i> means "that."

825
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,962
- They were both used 8 times.
- Yeah, 8 times.

826
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,757
8 USES OF "THAT", 8 USES OF <i>"UWO"</i>

827
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:39,718
Wait, this means "that."

828
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:40,844
<i>"Uwo"</i> is "that"?

829
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:43,888
Because "that" was used eight times here

830
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:45,724
and "uwo" was used eight times too.

831
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,767
Write it down in the "possible" section.

832
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:49,019
Are we sure about this?

833
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:52,856
You should write it down.

834
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,901
- How about "one"?
- "One"?

835
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,491
8 USES OF "ONE"

836
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:05,577
It might be "one" too.

837
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:10,165
<i>Tallying the number of times a word</i>
<i>was used in each text</i>

838
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:13,877
<i>and finding matching pairs</i>
<i>is the most basic solution for this game.</i>

839
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,004
<i>However, just like the case of "uwo,"</i>

840
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:19,549
<i>there can be multiple Korean words</i>
<i>that were used the same number of times.</i>

841
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:22,344
<i>As such, the teams will need</i>
<i>a way to identify</i>

842
00:38:22,427 --> 00:38:24,512
<i>words with more than one possible match.</i>

843
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:25,889
What's the match for "that"?

844
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:27,640
Did you say it meant "one"?

845
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:29,017
It's either "that" or "one."

846
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,352
Just do another one.

847
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,855
We don't have to be sure about it now.

848
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:36,608
- "That" and <i>"uwo"</i> appear eight times.
- But there's another one.

849
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:38,318
- "One" shows up eight times.
- Gabo...

850
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,195
- "One" shows up eight times?
- Really?

851
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:41,488
Six, eight, ten.

852
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:43,239
Two, four... Twenty-four in total.

853
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,700
- Do we have any uncertainties here?
- One, two, three, four, five...

854
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:47,619
Let's just assume that it is.

855
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,497
We need to make lots of assumptions.

856
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,956
The way I see it,

857
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,542
we got fixated on finding an exact answer.

858
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:58,797
The others tried piecing things together
and lucked out with answers.

859
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:01,591
I'll assume that it's right,
but I won't write it down.

860
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:06,096
We don't have much time left,
so we should go with that assumption.

861
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:09,432
It'd be much easier to compare
8 sentences between the 2 sets

862
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:10,809
instead of going through 24.

863
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:14,979
<i>That allowed us to focus on 8 pairs</i>
<i>and not the entire 24 pairs.</i>

864
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:18,608
<i>By assuming that "uwo" means "that"</i>

865
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:23,571
<i>and looking for possible matches</i>
<i>in just 8 sets of sentences instead of 24,</i>

866
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:27,534
<i>identifying the corresponding pairs</i>
<i>could happen much faster.</i>

867
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:33,707
<i>Moreover, this process will allow them</i>
<i>to confirm if "uwo" does mean "that."</i>

868
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:38,253
<i>- "Umugore."</i>
- Twelve, thirteen, sixteen, seventeen...

869
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:39,546
It's used three times.

870
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:41,214
What was used three times
in those sentences?

871
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,465
Can I use this for a second?

872
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:44,217
- "Person" was used three times.
- Three times.

873
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,011
So, "person" is one candidate.

874
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:47,470
- "Woman" is another one.
<i>- uwo...</i>

875
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,723
In that case, <i>"umugore"</i> means "person"

876
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:50,974
- Right.
- or "woman."

877
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:52,475
Look. There's "<i>umugabo</i>."

878
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,936
TWO WORDS WITH DIFFERENT SUFFIXES

879
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,063
It probably means "woman,"
with <i>"umugabo"</i> meaning "man."

880
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:58,314
<i>UMUGORE:</i> WOMAN, <i>UMUGABO:</i> MAN

881
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:02,444
<i>Ji-seong's suggestion</i>
<i>of interpreting "uwo" as "that"</i>

882
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:04,863
<i>turned out to be</i>
<i>a great starting point for us.</i>

883
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:08,742
<i>That assumption allowed us to determine</i>
<i>which words meant "man" and "woman."</i>

884
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:11,661
We need to distinguish differences
between <i>"umu" </i>and <i>"aba."</i>

885
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:12,746
Find this.

886
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:15,832
TWO WORDS WITH DIFFERENT AFFIXES

887
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:19,461
I guess <i>"umu"</i> could be singular,
and <i>"aba"</i> could be plural.

888
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:21,087
We could find a rule for these.

889
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:24,924
If <i>"umugore"</i> means woman,
then <i>"amagore"</i> could mean two women.

890
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,385
- Do we know the word for "person"?
- Person?

891
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,346
I think <i>"muntu" </i>might be it.

892
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,222
<i>　MUNTU</i>: ASSUMED TO MEAN PERSON
<i>"Muntu"?</i>

893
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,767
That must be it
since there are only three of them.

894
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,061
- How about <i>"ntago"?</i>
- That could mean "not."

895
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:38,772
I'm certain about that, too.

896
00:40:38,855 --> 00:40:40,315
Great job, Ji-seong.

897
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:41,316
Thanks.

898
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:43,109
<i>Ntago</i>.

899
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:49,532
<i>ABAGORE:</i> TWO WOMEN,
<i>MUNTU:</i> PERSON, <i>NTAGO:</i> NOT

900
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:54,287
I feel good about this.
I think we could get a win.

901
00:40:57,248 --> 00:41:01,586
TEAM MIT CONTINUES
TO TALLY THE NUMBER OF WORDS

902
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,678
You know what?

903
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:11,846
I'm concerned we might be wasting time

904
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,390
- with unnecessary words.
- Me too.

905
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:14,391
Here's what I think.

906
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:23,692
When so many words
are used the same number of times,

907
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,819
tallying won't tell us anything.

908
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:28,780
Shouldn't we start pairing them up now?

909
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:30,198
Okay. Let's do that.

910
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:37,956
Oh, <i>"babiri"</i> must mean "two."

911
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,333
<i>BABIRI:</i> 5, TWO: 5

912
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,460
It appears at the beginning
of many sentences.

913
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:45,964
THE TWO WORDS APPEAR IN SIMILAR LOCATIONS
THE SAME NUMBER OF TIMES

914
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:48,133
That would make things much easier.

915
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:49,843
Remember the sentences with "two"?

916
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,345
KOREAN, KINYARWANDA

917
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,515
THEY ONLY NEED TO COMPARE 5 SENTENCES
THAT HAVE THE TWO WORDS

918
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:57,684
"<i>Abagore babiri</i>" is mentioned often.

919
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:59,894
I think it means woman or man.

920
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:01,312
<i>Wait. One, two...</i>

921
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:03,231
<i>"Abagore" is mentioned twice.</i>

922
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:04,566
<i>- Woman, then?</i>
<i>- So that means woman.</i>

923
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:06,067
<i>"Abagado" would be "man."</i>

924
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:07,402
<i>Those are for certain.</i>

925
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:08,528
<i>"ABAGORE":</i> WOMAN, <i>"ABAGADO":</i> MAN

926
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,286
<i>"Icyatsi."</i> Right?

927
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:17,829
- Right?
- Hold on.

928
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:19,831
Look, "hat" is mentioned again.
"Green hat."

929
00:42:19,914 --> 00:42:21,458
- Both sentences have "hat."
- Right.

930
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,792
WHITE HAT, GREEN HAT

931
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:24,044
"Glasses" is used twice, too.

932
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,755
The same goes for "hat" and "white."

933
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:30,425
<i>"ICYATSI"</i> HAS 4 POSSIBLE MATCHES

934
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:33,428
GLASSES, HAT, WHITE, GREEN
Wearing a white hat and green shoes...

935
00:42:34,554 --> 00:42:36,306
Oh, I think this means a hat.

936
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:38,767
You think this means a hat?

937
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:42,729
- That seems like a verb.
- Yeah, that's a verb.

938
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:44,647
And that's "hat",
and then different colors.

939
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:51,821
TWO WOMEN, WEAR, HAT, COLOR A, COLOR B

940
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:52,781
That sounds right.

941
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:57,160
You have ten minutes left.

942
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,412
<i>You have ten minutes left.</i>

943
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:00,830
What did he say?

944
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:02,248
- Damn it.
- What did he say?

945
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,834
We haven't found many matching pairs yet.

946
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:05,877
Three...

947
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,504
We should've stuck with counting.

948
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:09,506
That's what we should've done.

949
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:13,968
TEAM KU FOCUSED ON SENTENCE STRUCTURES
Simpler sentences may be easy to crack.

950
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:16,596
Can you check their lengths?
There are eight "thats."

951
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,640
I'll check by syllables.

952
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:21,643
I think I found a structure.

953
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:24,270
Let's focus on the modifiers.

954
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:25,897
That's a great point.

955
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,399
What are you working on now?

956
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:29,150
We're just...

957
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:32,487
- We should match the modifiers instead.
- We need to do this now.

958
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,281
- What do you want us to find, then?
- Try to come up with...

959
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:36,700
Damn it. We should've...

960
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,535
- What was this?
- It's going to be okay.

961
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:40,370
Let's stay calm.

962
00:43:42,163 --> 00:43:45,208
<i>That's when we really got down</i>
<i>to find matching pairs.</i>

963
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,085
Let me tally up <i>"babiri."</i>

964
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:48,962
- How many times was <i>"umuntu"</i> used?
- Thrice.

965
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:50,338
Same goes for <i>"abogabo."</i>

966
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:51,715
"One man" was used four times.

967
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,217
"That man" was used twice.

968
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,804
We have the <i>umogabo-umugore</i> pair
and the <i>abagabo-abagore</i> pair.

969
00:43:58,304 --> 00:43:59,472
I'll count <i>"bambaye."</i>

970
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,266
Okay. I'll count <i>"yambaye."</i>

971
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:04,144
Guys, <i>"uwo"</i> means "that."

972
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:06,813
<i>- "Uwo"</i> means "that" for sure.
- Ipantaro, ngufi...

973
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:08,773
- <i>"Umugore"</i> means "woman."
- Then is this wrong as well?

974
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:11,818
Maybe an "n" followed by an apostrophe
could mean "and."

975
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:12,777
I agree.

976
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,863
- It's a perfect match.
- It has to be "and."

977
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:16,823
- The "n" followed by an apostrophe.
- It's the same here.

978
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:18,658
TEAM KU'S MAKES A DEDUCTION

979
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:20,201
We have many matching pairs.

980
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:21,703
"That man," "not"...

981
00:44:21,786 --> 00:44:22,912
<i>"Ngufi."</i>

982
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:24,247
- Yes!
- <i>"Afite"</i> must mean "head."

983
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,373
I got it.

984
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:28,335
<i>"Ngufi"</i> means short.

985
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:29,794
<i>UWO UMUGORE</i>: THAT WOMAN, <i>NGUFI</i>: SHORT

986
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:31,671
<i>"Ipantaro"</i> means pants.

987
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,090
- What?
<i>- "Yambaye"</i> means to wear.

988
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:35,842
- Go write in on the board.
- Please.

989
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:37,677
- Write <i>"yambaye."</i>
- I don't know it, so can you do it?

990
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,138
What can <i>"icyatsi" </i>mean?

991
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:41,681
- "Woman" is used twice.
- I got it.

992
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:43,058
What about "person"?

993
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:43,975
Look.

994
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:47,145
I think <i>"amadarubindi" </i>means glasses.

995
00:44:47,228 --> 00:44:49,731
- I was thinking the same thing.
<i>- "Amadarubindi."</i>

996
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:51,816
I think I found the word for green.

997
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,029
I think <i>"icyatsi" </i>is "green,"
and <i>"umweru" </i>is "white."

998
00:44:56,112 --> 00:44:58,281
<i>"ICYATSI":</i> GREEN, <i>"UMWERU":</i> WHITE

999
00:44:58,365 --> 00:44:59,574
Guys, I got it.

1000
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,160
I figured out <i>"umweru."</i>

1001
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:04,913
- I think it means green.
- Green?

1002
00:45:04,996 --> 00:45:06,539
And <i>"Icyatsi" </i>is "white."

1003
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,416
<i>"ICYATSI":</i> WHITE, <i>"UMWERU":</i> GREEN

1004
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,129
<i>Team KAIST and Team MIT interpreted</i>
<i>the same two words in reverse.</i>

1005
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:17,425
<i>A single word could change their fates.</i>

1006
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:21,471
And I think <i>"ingofero"</i> means "hat."

1007
00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:23,723
We know that "<i>umweru" </i>means "green," so...

1008
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,141
"Does not wear."

1009
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:28,478
- I think this is the negation.
- Right.

1010
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:31,189
<i>"Ntago" </i>would mean "right hand."

1011
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:33,858
Guys, this means glasses
and that means blue.

1012
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:34,776
TWO MEN, RIGHT HAND

1013
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:36,152
GLASSES, BLUE, NEGATION
The blue...

1014
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:37,654
Oh, my gosh.

1015
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,619
I'm a total genius.

1016
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,664
<i>That concludes the first round.</i>

1017
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,668
We'll now begin the second round.

1018
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:53,461
All teams, please send one member

1019
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:57,465
to collect your investigation envelope
from the table in the Deathmatch Hall.

1020
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:00,552
Your 30 minutes start now.

1021
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,733
<i>In the second round, you'll be given</i>

1022
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:17,944
<i>photos of the suspects</i>
<i>with sentences that describe the culprit.</i>

1023
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,240
PHOTOS OF 10 SUSPECTS

1024
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:26,911
3 SENTENCES DESCRIBING THE CULPRIT

1025
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:29,080
Let's start from here.

1026
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:31,499
What words mean "man" and "woman"?

1027
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:34,836
<i>"Umugabo."</i> So, the culprit is a guy.

1028
00:46:34,919 --> 00:46:36,421
It says, "That man."

1029
00:46:36,504 --> 00:46:37,881
- I'll put the women aside.
- Okay.

1030
00:46:37,964 --> 00:46:39,507
Go ahead. We're looking for man.

1031
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:43,053
TEAM MIT NARROWS DOWN THE SUSPECTS TO MEN

1032
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:49,976
<i>"Umweru."</i>

1033
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,103
That means green.

1034
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:53,813
Then, this would be the only option.

1035
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:57,650
SUSPECT 6

1036
00:46:59,402 --> 00:47:00,278
Right.

1037
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:03,198
We'll go with this one
if one team submits their answer.

1038
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:05,992
But I feel confident about our answer.

1039
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:08,661
- I'll lay them all on the floor.
- Okay. Go for it.

1040
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:11,247
<i>"Muntu"</i> means a person.

1041
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:12,749
<i>"Ntago."</i>

1042
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:14,626
- That was a negation.
- What was <i>"afite" </i>again?

1043
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:15,960
<i>"Yambaye"</i> was "wear," right?

1044
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:17,337
PERSON, NEGATION, WEAR
Short...

1045
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,254
To wear?

1046
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:19,798
What was <i>"amadarubindi"?</i>

1047
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:22,008
<i>- </i>That was glasses.
- Glasses.

1048
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:24,636
Make sure to check
if there is no negation.

1049
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:26,638
- Of course.
- Okay.

1050
00:47:27,013 --> 00:47:29,140
- Tell me when you're done.
- <i>"Ingofero"</i> was "hat."

1051
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:30,350
What was <i>"umutuku"?</i>

1052
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:32,102
What does that say?

1053
00:47:32,185 --> 00:47:33,478
I can't read it.

1054
00:47:33,561 --> 00:47:35,021
- The one below "green."
- That's "red."

1055
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:36,856
<i>"UMUTUKU"</i>: RED

1056
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,401
So, <i>"ntago"</i> is at the beginning.

1057
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:41,277
So, the person doesn't...

1058
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:44,989
If the negation precedes two elements,
does it affect them both?

1059
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:48,118
- That's what it was in all the examples.
- Then...

1060
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:51,996
Then, let's take out the suspects
with glasses or a red hat.

1061
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:53,373
GLASSES, REMOVED

1062
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:54,374
RED HAT, REMOVED

1063
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:57,669
SUSPECT 1, SUSPECT 9

1064
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:59,254
What does your card say?

1065
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:00,213
It says, "that man..."

1066
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:02,882
HYEONG-SEOK HAS BEEN DECIPHERING
CULPRIT DESCRIPTION 3

1067
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:04,718
- That's pants or a skirt.
- It says, "That man

1068
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:05,927
is not wearing shorts."

1069
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:07,637
- "That man"?
- Yeah.

1070
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:08,763
Look, it says <i>"umugabo."</i>

1071
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:12,058
<i>UWO</i>: THAT, <i>UMUGABO</i>: ONE MAN

1072
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,269
But I thought it said...

1073
00:48:14,352 --> 00:48:15,437
- Wait.
- We have an error.

1074
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,563
THEIR SUSPECTS ARE 2 WOMEN

1075
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:18,815
The culprit can't be a woman.
Let's remove them.

1076
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:26,322
TEAM KAIST'S NEW POOL OF SUSPECTS ARE MEN

1077
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:27,407
Okay, then.

1078
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,659
Among these men...

1079
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:32,037
- Look for a white shirt.
- Focus on keywords.

1080
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,455
- He's wearing a white shirt.
- Okay.

1081
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:36,291
- And he has a book in his right hand.
- Okay.

1082
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:37,876
These three are wearing a white shirt.

1083
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:42,589
SUSPECTS THAT ARE WEARING A WHITE SHIRT
AND HOLDING A BOOK IN HIS RIGHT HAND

1084
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:44,299
What about the red hat?

1085
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:45,925
According to this, he's not wearing it.

1086
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:46,843
NEGATION, HAT, RED

1087
00:48:46,926 --> 00:48:48,303
- Then, it's him.
- He's not wearing shorts.

1088
00:48:48,386 --> 00:48:49,804
- He's not wearing shorts?
- Glasses...

1089
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:51,222
<i>"Ntago</i>," "<i>yambaye</i>..."

1090
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,224
RED HAT, REMOVED

1091
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:54,225
SHORTS, REMOVED

1092
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:56,644
ALL SUSPECTS ARE DISCARDED

1093
00:48:57,645 --> 00:49:01,191
TEAM KAIST'S INTERPRETATION OF 2 SENTENCES
MADE THEM RULE OUT ALL SUSPECTS

1094
00:49:01,274 --> 00:49:02,942
Negation, book, right hand.

1095
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:04,569
- Wait.
- Disregard the negation.

1096
00:49:04,652 --> 00:49:07,238
Apply it to what follows it directly.
So, this person isn't a woman.

1097
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:09,115
- Then, this might not mean "to hold."
- Then...

1098
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:10,075
"That man..."

1099
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:13,453
What would this mean
if the negation only applies to one word?

1100
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:15,872
ADJUSTS NEGATION'S REACH
TO THE NEXT IMMEDIATE ELEMENT

1101
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:18,249
NOT WEARING GLASSES

1102
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,959
- That man...
- That man isn't wearing glasses.

1103
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:22,587
- But he's wearing a red hat?
- Just not glasses.

1104
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:24,673
NO GLASSES, WEARING A RED HAT

1105
00:49:24,756 --> 00:49:28,134
SUSPECT 4

1106
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:29,386
No shorts, right?

1107
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:31,012
- Then, it's him.
- Are you sure?

1108
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:32,055
Of course.

1109
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:33,139
Let's hurry.

1110
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:35,308
Let's hurry.

1111
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:36,976
- Let's submit this.
- Go.

1112
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,228
Go ahead!

1113
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:43,525
No one handed it in?

1114
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:54,160
Team KAIST and Team MIT
submitted their investigation envelopes.

1115
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:58,665
TEAM KAIST'S ANSWER: SUSPECT 4
TEAM MIT'S ANSWER: SUSPECT 6

1116
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:00,500
Shouldn't we rule these people out?

1117
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:02,127
- Wait.
- We need something blue.

1118
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,797
<i>Team KAIST and Team MIT</i>
<i>submitted their investigation envelopes.</i>

1119
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,132
The color of their clothes...

1120
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:08,466
This is killing me.

1121
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:10,677
We still have 30 minutes left.

1122
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,137
- Take it slow.
- Hat colors, left or right hand.

1123
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,638
We just need to get it right.

1124
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:15,515
Ruling out women
was the right call, right?

1125
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:18,143
As long as we're sure
the suspect is a man,

1126
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:21,354
it has to be about a man
regardless of what follows.

1127
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:22,814
NEGATION DOESN'T AFFECT SUBJECT

1128
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:24,274
Okay. Let's remove all women.

1129
00:50:24,357 --> 00:50:25,692
We should hurry now.

1130
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:29,654
ALL FEMALE SUSPECTS ARE RULED OUT

1131
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:31,865
"That man" is followed by a negation.

1132
00:50:31,948 --> 00:50:32,782
<i>Team MIT.</i>

1133
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:34,826
<i>You can't change your answer.</i>

1134
00:50:35,785 --> 00:50:36,703
Great.

1135
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:37,954
Of course, they can't.

1136
00:50:38,621 --> 00:50:41,666
TEAM MIT'S BASE CAMP
RIGHT AFTER SUBMITTING THEIR ANSWER

1137
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:45,920
Do you remember
the color of the culprit's shoes?

1138
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:48,590
Can we make another submission
or change our answer?

1139
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:50,300
- What?
- No, we can't.

1140
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:52,635
I don't think <i>"ntago" </i>means right hand.

1141
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:59,017
Can we change our answer after submission?

1142
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,268
Team MIT.

1143
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:02,270
- You can't change your answer.
- Okay.

1144
00:51:02,354 --> 00:51:03,855
<i>- You can't change your answer.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

1145
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:06,149
It's fine. I'm sure we got it right.

1146
00:51:06,232 --> 00:51:07,609
We submitted the right one.

1147
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:14,532
Once Team KAIST submitted their answer,
we had to submit ours before Team KU.

1148
00:51:17,827 --> 00:51:19,621
But what if we got it wrong?

1149
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,876
They must've gotten it wrong.

1150
00:51:24,959 --> 00:51:27,879
They blew it, so we just need
to take our time and get it right.

1151
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:29,172
Let's take it slow.

1152
00:51:29,255 --> 00:51:32,175
<i>Team MIT must've been certain</i>
<i>about making a mistake</i>

1153
00:51:32,258 --> 00:51:34,094
<i>to ask for a re-submission.</i>

1154
00:51:34,177 --> 00:51:35,762
<i>We immediately took it as a sign</i>

1155
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:38,390
<i>that Team MIT got it wrong.</i>

1156
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:41,309
<i>That helped us resume our analysis calmly.</i>

1157
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:43,645
Seong-hyeon,
are we sure <i>"ngato" </i>is a negation?

1158
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:45,271
Look. <i>"Ngato yambaye."</i>

1159
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:48,274
So, they're not wearing something.

1160
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:50,819
- It talks about shorts here.
- In that case...

1161
00:51:50,902 --> 00:51:52,946
- So, <i>"ipantaro--"</i>
- The phrase "<i>ipantaro ngufi"</i>

1162
00:51:53,029 --> 00:51:54,781
must mean shorts.

1163
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:57,409
Maybe they're not wearing shorts.
So, "no" and "shorts."

1164
00:51:57,492 --> 00:51:58,576
- No shorts? Got it.
- Yes.

1165
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,037
So, like I said,
that leaves us with three suspects.

1166
00:52:01,454 --> 00:52:02,288
SHORTS, REMOVED

1167
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:05,667
SUSPECT 4, SUSPECT 8, SUSPECT 10

1168
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,877
We need to look at the colors, too.

1169
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:09,337
Maybe <i>"kandi" </i>describes a color.

1170
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:10,588
How many times was it used?

1171
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:13,049
- I see three <i>"Kandi" </i>and "yellow" here.
- Then, yellow it is.

1172
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,427
- This must mean "a yellow shirt."
- Correct.

1173
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:16,386
But there's a negation.

1174
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:18,513
- Yellow...
- Then, we can rule that one out, too.

1175
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:20,890
YELLOW SHIRT, REMOVED

1176
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:23,184
SUSPECT 4, SUSPECT 8

1177
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:25,854
<i>The only difference</i>
<i>between them is glasses.</i>

1178
00:52:25,937 --> 00:52:27,605
SUSPECT 4: NO GLASSES, SUSPECT 8: GLASSES

1179
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:29,232
The key term is "glasses."

1180
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,151
- We should get the envelope ready.
- Here.

1181
00:52:31,234 --> 00:52:33,153
We have to submit it in time.

1182
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:36,823
TEAM KAIST REVIEWS THEIR ANSWER
He was wearing a red hat.

1183
00:52:36,906 --> 00:52:37,907
Where's the word?

1184
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,576
A red hat, "<i>yambaye</i>." We were right.

1185
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:42,203
That leaves us with these two,
and glasses were the key.

1186
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:43,496
- And glasses...
- Here.

1187
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,290
- "Not wearing glasses."
- Right, the negation.

1188
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:46,666
I'm sure we got it right.

1189
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,084
We were definitely right.

1190
00:52:48,918 --> 00:52:50,795
All the others are wearing blue pants.

1191
00:52:55,258 --> 00:52:57,552
But are we sure about green?
That's the thing.

1192
00:52:58,636 --> 00:52:59,888
Let's hand it in.

1193
00:52:59,971 --> 00:53:01,639
- It's that one.
- Are you sure?

1194
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:03,016
- So, this one?
- Is he the one?

1195
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:04,642
Let's go.

1196
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:05,977
I'll take that.

1197
00:53:09,814 --> 00:53:10,857
SIGNAL INVESTIGATION 2

1198
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,902
Team KU submitted
their investigation envelope.

1199
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:20,784
<i>That concludes Signal Investigation 2,</i>
<i>the first Deathmatch.</i>

1200
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:22,660
Team KU used up all their time,

1201
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:25,246
- so they might've taken a gamble.
- It's possible.

1202
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,166
We might not have made it back
if we ended up there.

1203
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:30,210
This season is much more difficult.

1204
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:31,628
<i>All teams.</i>

1205
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:34,214
<i>Please gather in the Deathmatch Hall.</i>

1206
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:37,384
Why am I feeling nervous?

1207
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:52,148
SIGNAL INVESTIGATION 2

1208
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:57,445
They all look so down.

1209
00:53:58,071 --> 00:53:59,864
- Who do you mean?
- Team KU.

1210
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:05,662
Team MIT looks so glum.

1211
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,460
I'll now announce
the results of the first round.

1212
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:14,796
Team KAIST.

1213
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:16,423
Oh, please...

1214
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:26,433
You apprehended the culprit.

1215
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,811
TEAM KAIST SUCCEEDS
You apprehended the culprit.

1216
00:54:41,156 --> 00:54:43,283
- You apprehended the culprit.
- They did it.

1217
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:47,662
- Good job.
- We killed it.

1218
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:49,873
Don't mention anything about the game.

1219
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:52,876
Let's clear our heads for the next round.

1220
00:54:52,959 --> 00:54:54,753
- Let's rest.
- Oh, Lord.

1221
00:54:54,836 --> 00:54:58,548
- Rest and prepare for the next round.
- We earned the time for a break.

1222
00:54:59,966 --> 00:55:01,176
Team MIT.

1223
00:55:01,926 --> 00:55:03,678
You failed to apprehend the culprit.

1224
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:07,515
TEAM MIT FAILS

1225
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:10,185
<i>- You failed to apprehend the culprit.</i>
- No way!

1226
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:16,441
- I guess that's for the better.
- Team MIT's out?

1227
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:20,653
Come on. We can make it.

1228
00:55:21,237 --> 00:55:22,113
Come on...

1229
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:23,365
Team KU.

1230
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:32,248
- You failed to apprehend the culprit.
- Damn it.

1231
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:35,335
TEAM KU FAILS

1232
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:36,836
We got it wrong?

1233
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:40,173
The only difference
between them is glasses.

1234
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:41,591
10 MINUTES AGO
You're right.

1235
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:44,052
If we interpret <i>"kuboko" </i>as glasses,
he's wearing them.

1236
00:55:45,011 --> 00:55:46,971
- I think it does mean glasses.
- Right.

1237
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:48,056
Is he the one?

1238
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:49,683
CULPRIT: SUSPECT 4
We're using this one?

1239
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:51,768
THEY CHOSE SUSPECT 8 INSTEAD
Let's go.

1240
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:53,603
<i>With the exception of Team KAIST,</i>

1241
00:55:53,687 --> 00:55:56,606
<i>both Team KU and Team MIT failed</i>
<i>to get the right answer.</i>

1242
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:59,275
The two teams will participate
in an extra round

1243
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,236
to determine who will be eliminated.

1244
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:03,196
Let's do this.

1245
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:12,080
<i>It's like we were given a chance</i>
<i>to have another shot at life.</i>

1246
00:56:12,163 --> 00:56:14,749
We'll secure a win
and make it to the next round.

1247
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:19,295
<i>We weren't completely certain</i>
<i>about the answer we submitted.</i>

1248
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:21,923
<i>Naturally, I was prepared</i>
<i>for this eventuality.</i>

1249
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:23,758
<i>We can use this chance to try again.</i>

1250
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:25,719
<i>I feel good about our chances.</i>

1251
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,057
The two teams will be given
one more description of the culprit

1252
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:33,518
written in the mystery language.

1253
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:34,644
ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION TO BE GIVEN

1254
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:38,565
Both teams, please choose a suspect
within the allotted time.

1255
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:42,152
Team MIT, Team KU.

1256
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:45,071
Please collect
your investigation envelopes.

1257
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:50,493
<i>Team MIT would've wanted</i>
<i>to change their answer</i>

1258
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:53,163
<i>because they identified</i>
<i>the mistake they made.</i>

1259
00:56:53,246 --> 00:56:55,081
So, with the additional description,

1260
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:57,584
I was hit with the thought

1261
00:56:57,667 --> 00:57:00,587
that they might already know the answer

1262
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,006
<i>and could submit the answer first.</i>

1263
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:07,927
Both teams, return to your base camps.

1264
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:14,517
The extra round
of Signal Investigation 2 starts now.

1265
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:23,651
<i>Please open the envelope.</i>

1266
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:27,697
ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CULPRIT

1267
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:30,325
Do we know what <i>"umukara"</i> means?

1268
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:32,535
<i>"Inkweto"</i> means shoes.

1269
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,372
<i>"INKWETO":</i> SHOES

1270
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,377
<i>"UMUKARA"</i> HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED

1271
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:45,215
Well, <i>"Inkweto" </i>means shoes.

1272
00:57:45,298 --> 00:57:47,258
This person is wearing shoes.

1273
00:57:48,968 --> 00:57:50,637
<i>"INKWETO":</i> SHOES

1274
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,222
What does <i>"ubururu" </i>mean?

1275
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:54,265
Blue shoes.

1276
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:56,851
- Blue shoes, and...
- Where is that phrase mentioned?

1277
00:57:56,935 --> 00:57:57,769
Sentence 15.

1278
00:57:57,852 --> 00:58:00,313
So, he's wearing blue shoes
and black glasses?

1279
00:58:00,397 --> 00:58:01,731
- Black glasses?
- Then, it's this.

1280
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:03,608
<i>It's talking about a man, too.</i>

1281
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:05,527
BOTH SENTENCES MENTION
BLUE SHOES AND BLACK GLASSES

1282
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,822
<i>We found another clue, "black shoes,"</i>

1283
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:11,700
<i>based on the comparison</i>
<i>of a different set of sentences.</i>

1284
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:14,452
SUSPECT 6 WAS PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED

1285
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:15,453
BLACK SHOES, REMOVED

1286
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:17,122
SUSPECT 4, SUSPECT 8

1287
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:19,916
CULPRIT: SUSPECT 4

1288
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:25,046
Do we know what this is?

1289
00:58:26,464 --> 00:58:29,009
I have a feeling that we've messed up.

1290
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:30,468
- We can do it.
- It's okay.

1291
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:31,553
Look here.

1292
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:34,139
Let's start over
and rule them out, one by one.

1293
00:58:34,222 --> 00:58:36,099
- Sure. Lay them out.
- Bring out all the photos.

1294
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:37,183
Put the women aside

1295
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,310
and just have the men laid out.

1296
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:41,646
SUSPECT 2, SUSPECT 4,
SUSPECT 6, SUSPECT 10

1297
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:43,106
We said <i>"ipantero" </i>was "hat."

1298
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:45,817
- That's not what it means.
- But didn't we say--

1299
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,527
- <i>"Ingofero"</i> was "hat."
- Oh, right.

1300
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:48,820
So, he's wearing a hat.

1301
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:50,947
SUSPECT WITHOUT A HAT IS RULED OUT

1302
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:55,160
CULPRIT: SUSPECT 4

1303
00:58:55,243 --> 00:58:57,829
I think it's him.
He's the only one with glasses.

1304
00:58:57,912 --> 00:58:59,289
But he's using the wrong hand.

1305
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:00,790
SUSPECT 6 HOLDS A BOOK IN HIS LEFT HAND

1306
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:02,334
THE OTHERS ARE USING THEIR RIGHT HANDS

1307
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,877
Should we start over?

1308
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,047
- No, we don't have the time.
- We only have five minutes or so.

1309
00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:10,633
Are we getting it wrong again?

1310
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:13,553
Team MIT might succeed.

1311
00:59:13,636 --> 00:59:15,930
Judging by how Team KU failed
after using all 30 minutes,

1312
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,932
- they have no idea.
- They must be clueless.

1313
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:18,975
- I think you're right.
- Right.

1314
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:21,895
Team MIT might have rushed
and had things left unchecked.

1315
00:59:21,978 --> 00:59:24,522
I think they took a gamble
after we handed ours in.

1316
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,107
- They might've done that.
- Right.

1317
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:27,525
Here's one thing I realized.

1318
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:29,194
Your efficiency gets tripled

1319
00:59:29,277 --> 00:59:30,570
- if you really focus.
- Right.

1320
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:32,739
- I usually couldn't have done this.
- You know,

1321
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:34,908
we got so lazy during the Formula Puzzle.

1322
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:36,284
- We were so full of ourselves.
- Right.

1323
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:37,619
We ended up playing the Deathmatch.

1324
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:40,663
- We should always remember this.
- I agree.

1325
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:41,956
The games are so tricky.

1326
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,917
Right. Let's do our best
in the next round.

1327
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:46,336
Yes, I think this one's fine.

1328
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:47,295
We can submit this.

1329
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:49,130
<i>You have five minutes left.</i>

1330
00:59:50,882 --> 00:59:52,217
I want to hand it in.

1331
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:53,343
- How about you?
- Calm down.

1332
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:54,969
- You want to hand it in?
- Yes.

1333
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:56,179
But...

1334
00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:02,143
<i>I thought I needed to be assertive here</i>

1335
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:04,729
<i>for the good of my team.</i>

1336
01:00:05,313 --> 01:00:06,398
- Then, it's this one.
- I agree.

1337
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:08,191
- Let's go with him.
- He's the guy.

1338
01:00:08,274 --> 01:00:09,401
- Shall we submit it now?
- Yes.

1339
01:00:09,484 --> 01:00:10,985
- Let's hand it in.
- Hand it in?

1340
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:13,988
- Go. Run for it.
- I say we got it right.

1341
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:19,202
- Team MIT hasn't submitted it yet.
- Wait.

1342
01:00:19,285 --> 01:00:21,705
- Hand it in!
- Hand it in!

1343
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:23,039
I beat you to it.
