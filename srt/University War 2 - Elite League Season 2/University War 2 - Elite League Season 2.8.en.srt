1
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,904
<i>Brainpower survival challenge,</i>
<i>Elite League, Season 2.</i>

2
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,991
<i>We will now begin the semifinal.</i>

3
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,702
How are you all feeling?
We should do well, right?

4
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,371
<i>Since we've come this far, we must win.</i>

5
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,292
- My sole focus is on winning.
- Yeah, we'll be the winners.

6
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,712
<i>The semifinal game</i>
<i>consists of a single round.</i>

7
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,089
<i>The team that places third</i>

8
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,134
<i>will be eliminated immediately</i>
<i>without the Deathmatch.</i>

9
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,679
<i>The top two teams</i>
<i>will then compete in the finals.</i>

10
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,183
That's so ruthless. It's scary.

11
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,268
Now, that sounds rough.

12
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,103
Dang.

13
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,565
<i>The game for the semifinal</i>

14
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,942
<i>is Code Decryption.</i>

15
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,277
Damn it.

16
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,820
It's a reasoning game.

17
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,197
What?

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,574
- It sounds fun.
- I didn't see this coming.

19
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,661
<i>In Code Decryption,</i>
<i>you will be given opportunities</i>

20
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>to identify and pinpoint</i>
<i>the location of encryptors and obstacles.</i>

21
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,043
Come again?

22
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,128
<i>When the game starts,</i>

23
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:32,342
<i>you will be presented</i>
<i>with a 7-by-7 game board</i>

24
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,011
<i>surrounded by 28 input channels.</i>

25
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,138
<i>The board contains</i>

26
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:42,352
<i>five encryptors that convert the input</i>
<i>according to their set rules</i>

27
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:47,148
<i>and five obstacles that warp</i>
<i>the transmission of the code.</i>

28
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:52,487
<i>The obstacles on the game board</i>
<i>consist of two plain mirrors,</i>

29
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,156
<i>two one-way mirrors, and a black hole.</i>

30
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:58,326
<i>Let's first look</i>
<i>at the plain mirror obstacle.</i>

31
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,995
<i>While the input signal</i>
<i>travels in a straight line,</i>

32
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,665
<i>the plain mirror redirects it</i>
<i>at a 90-degree angle.</i>

33
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,751
<i>The second obstacle type</i>
<i>is the one-way mirror.</i>

34
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,421
<i>These also redirect the signal</i>
<i>at a 90-degree angle</i>

35
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:14,050
<i>while also letting it go straight through,</i>
<i>resulting in two signal outputs.</i>

36
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,511
<i>The third variety is the black hole.</i>

37
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:20,807
<i>It annihilates input signals</i>
<i>and makes it impossible for it to be read,</i>

38
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,393
<i>and the output signal</i>
<i>is represented as an error.</i>

39
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,228
So, there's a black hole.

40
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,400
<i>Each team will be given two minutes</i>

41
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,319
CHANNEL: 2
<i>to select an input channel.</i>

42
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,073
<i>They must then submit</i>
<i>a four-letter code of their choice.</i>

43
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,908
INPUT CODE: AAAA

44
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,036
<i>The output code must be reviewed.</i>

45
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,704
CHANNEL: 28, OUTPUT CODE: CCCC

46
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,497
<i>The differences must be identified.</i>

47
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,707
CHANNEL: 2, INPUT CODE: AAAA

48
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,417
CHANNEL: 28, OUTPUT CODE: CCCC

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,960
<i>The discrepancies will tell you</i>

50
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,088
<i>the rules of the encryptors</i>
<i>and the location of the obstacles.</i>

51
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:57,093
<i>For example,</i>
<i>if a code is entered into Channel 2</i>

52
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,347
<i>and takes a turn to make an exit</i>
<i>through Channel 28,</i>

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,018
<i>we can deduce</i>
<i>that a plain mirror stands in its path.</i>

54
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,023
<i>Additionally, the converted code tells us</i>

55
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,777
<i>that there is an encryptor</i>
<i>standing on that path as well.</i>

56
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,825
<i>As the code AAAA was turned into CCCC,</i>

57
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,703
<i>we can deduce</i>
<i>that the rule of the encryptor</i>

58
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:28,792
<i>shifts each letter of the code</i>
<i>two places forward in the alphabet.</i>

59
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,339
<i>Code Decryption will last</i>
<i>for three rounds in total.</i>

60
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,885
<i>In Rounds 1 and 2, all teams will perform</i>
<i>1 public and 2 private decryptions.</i>

61
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,305
<i>In total, each team will have</i>
<i>three opportunities for decryption.</i>

62
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,643
<i>However, in Round 3, the teams will have</i>
<i>only one private decryption each.</i>

63
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,730
<i>For public decryptions,</i>
<i>the teams will take turns in a set order,</i>

64
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:55,276
<i>and every input and output code</i>
<i>will be publicly disclosed.</i>

65
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,031
<i>The private decryptions will be performed</i>
<i>by all the teams simultaneously,</i>

66
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:04,494
<i>and the input and output code</i>
<i>can only be seen by your own team.</i>

67
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,914
<i>However, in Code Decryption,</i>

68
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:11,126
<i>the four members of the team</i>
<i>will not play together at first.</i>

69
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:18,258
<i>Three members of each team</i>
<i>will decrypt the code in the Main Hall,</i>

70
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,595
<i>and the remaining one will be given</i>
<i>another code to decrypt at the base camp.</i>

71
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,807
<i>Once the decryption is complete,</i>

72
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,561
<i>you may submit your answer sheet</i>
<i>at any point during Round 3.</i>

73
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,896
<i>The submitted answers must contain</i>

74
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,483
<i>the location of the encryptors</i>
<i>and the obstacles and their directions.</i>

75
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,654
<i>A list of rules for all the encryptors</i>
<i>must also be submitted with the answer.</i>

76
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,240
<i>The two teams</i>
<i>that complete the decryption first</i>

77
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,867
<i>will proceed to the finals,</i>

78
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:48,246
<i>while the losing team</i>
<i>will face immediate elimination.</i>

79
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,373
So, finishing sooner is better.

80
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,585
<i>All teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

81
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,879
<i>You have 20 minutes.</i>

82
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,841
So, here's what I think.

83
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,344
Let's imagine that we're the producers

84
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,763
and come up with all sorts
of encryption methods.

85
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:10,268
We had no idea what sort of rules
the encryptors would emulate,

86
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:14,314
<i>so we tried to think</i>
<i>of every possible encryption rule.</i>

87
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,150
So, here's a possible question.

88
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,862
I'll put QW in here.
Let's say there's a question like this.

89
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,781
These usually follow three patterns.

90
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,200
First, a Caesar cipher
with a set number of blanks.

91
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,118
<i>The Caesar cipher</i>

92
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,538
<i>is an encryption technique</i>
<i>that replaces all letters in a code</i>

93
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,583
<i>with letters shifted down the alphabet</i>
<i>by a set number of places.</i>

94
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,835
<i>If the given code is ABCD</i>

95
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,547
<i>and the encryption rule requires</i>
<i>the letters to be shifted by three places,</i>

96
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:44,969
<i>the output given will be DEFG.</i>

97
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,556
Next is a modified Caesar cipher.

98
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,266
<i>Shift one place for the first letter,</i>

99
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,851
<i>then two places,</i>

100
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,854
<i>then three places, and then four places.</i>

101
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,358
INPUT: ABCD
OUTPUT: BDFH

102
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,695
Or the places of the letters might change.
I'll show you an example.

103
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,739
<i>If the letters ABCD</i>
<i>are assigned numbers 1234,</i>

104
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,367
<i>the rule may switch</i>
<i>the 1st and 4th letters around,</i>

105
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,327
<i>and the letters</i>
<i>will be rearranged to DBCA.</i>

106
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,205
These three types of codes
will definitely come up.

107
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,209
What should we discuss first?

108
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,921
Should we talk about identifying
the locations of obstacles and encryptors,

109
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,007
or talk about the rules
of the encryptors first?

110
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,135
We need to focus on the mirrors
until the individual task is done.

111
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,972
Working under the assumption
that we'd learn where the encryptors are

112
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,391
- would be a waste of time.
- Okay, in that case,

113
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,103
let's list the cases of possible outputs.

114
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:39,357
First, the case of a straight line.
In that case, we'll leave the line empty.

115
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,234
- That's for certain.
- All right.

116
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,277
Second,

117
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,488
let's say the signal is redirected once.

118
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,533
It turns in one direction
and gives us a four-letter code.

119
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,661
We can then assume
there wouldn't be any black holes.

120
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,289
- That's the best-case scenario.
- Yeah, in that case,

121
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,334
we can identify the mirror's location
and the direction it's facing.

122
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,294
Third, let's say we get an error message.

123
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,756
<i>We won't be able to tell</i>
<i>where the black hole is.</i>

124
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,675
<i>The signal may have hit a black hole</i>
<i>after hitting a mirror first.</i>

125
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,720
A single error message
would be very difficult to deal with.

126
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,221
That would be the worst.

127
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,226
Wouldn't a double error message only occur
if a signal meets a one-way mirror

128
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,520
and then one of the split signals
meets two plain mirrors?

129
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:21,691
<i>The signal must hit a one-way mirror</i>
<i>for it to be divided,</i>

130
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,693
<i>but the two signals</i>
<i>can't meet at the black hole</i>

131
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,278
<i>unless a split signal</i>
<i>hits two plain mirrors.</i>

132
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,571
ONLY WAY FOR THE SPLIT SIGNALS TO MEET

133
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,824
SCENARIO OF THERE BEING 2 ERROR MESSAGES

134
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,576
Check this out, too.

135
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,120
If the input channel is here,

136
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,208
and this leads to 2 outputs,
these would be the 3 possible cases.

137
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:43,213
<i>In Code Decryption, there may be cases</i>
<i>where two outputs are given.</i>

138
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,800
<i>The simplest scenario for such a case</i>

139
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,680
<i>would be when the input signal is divided</i>
<i>after hitting a one-way mirror.</i>

140
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,557
<i>However, the contestants must remember</i>

141
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,812
<i>that there are 2 other scenarios</i>
<i>where 2 outputs could be given.</i>

142
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,356
- We have to be careful about this.
- I like that.

143
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,941
There's more than one possibility.

144
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,901
Gi-hyeon is great at these things.

145
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,322
If we can find out all the key cases,
we can avoid wasting our turns.

146
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,284
We're good at finding hidden traps,
but let's not get big-headed and focus.

147
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,620
One wrong answer could be the end of it.

148
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,331
- I'm not going home today.
- Me neither.

149
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,794
All right, then.
Who's tackling the individual task?

150
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,797
- Why don't you two decide?
- We'll leave it up to you.

151
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,092
<i>The member remaining in the base camp</i>

152
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,803
<i>will be given another code</i>
<i>that will allow them to determine</i>

153
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,847
<i>the location of the five encryptors.</i>

154
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,890
<i>Once they finish deciphering the code,</i>

155
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,060
<i>they can come to the Main Hall</i>
<i>and join their teammates.</i>

156
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,064
<i>However, they will not be told</i>
<i>whether their decryption is correct.</i>

157
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,819
<i>Additionally, they may give up their task</i>
<i>at any point during the game</i>

158
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,531
<i>and join their teammates in the Main Hall.</i>

159
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,451
- But we don't know what it'll be like.
- I doubt it'd be memorization.

160
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,161
So, do you want to try it?

161
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,539
I'm not sure because we don't know
what we'll be asked to do.

162
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,169
I honestly believe I lost both rounds
in Blind Sudoku only by an inch.

163
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,589
That's why I wanted to take this chance
to make up for my mistakes.

164
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,467
Can I try it?

165
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,428
- Are you sure you can handle it?
- Well, yeah.

166
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,681
I'm sure I can handle
reasoning or calculation problems.

167
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,101
If you're sure, then you should do it.

168
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,686
Okay, I'll do it.

169
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,775
I think the question
will be insanely tough.

170
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,735
When should I join you in the Main Hall?

171
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:33,490
Let's set up a time when I should give up
and join the rest of the team.

172
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,950
Hey, guys.

173
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,870
Could I try the base camp assignment?

174
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,705
Actually, we need you to do it, Gi-hyeon.

175
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,628
Since the Hidden Algorithm game,
I thought my strength was in reasoning.

176
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,173
So, I felt sure that I could finish
the individual task quickly.

177
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,592
That's why I volunteered to take it on.

178
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,554
If you determined the locations
of 3 to 4 encryptors

179
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,599
but got confused
and couldn't pin down the remaining ones,

180
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,810
we could all talk about it
and find them together.

181
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,813
So, you should join us
in the middle of Round 2 at the latest.

182
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,607
GI-HYEON WILL JOIN THE TEAM
WITHIN 2 ROUNDS

183
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,651
EVEN IF HE CAN'T FINISH
THE INDIVIDUAL TASK

184
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,988
Focus on the location of the mirrors
until I join you in the Main Hall,

185
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,782
then we can decipher the codes together.

186
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,242
<i>I asked my teammates</i>

187
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,661
if anyone felt up to the task.

188
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,414
Does anyone want
to tackle the individual task?

189
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,582
If there's no one, I'd like to try it.

190
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,543
Then, you should go for it.

191
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,255
I'm good at solving problems
that involve thinking up new rules.

192
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,049
So, when no one volunteered,
I said I would do it.

193
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,175
And looking back,

194
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,345
it didn't particularly seem like

195
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,432
I had a standout moment
on the show so far.

196
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,768
Whenever I accomplished something,
Gyu-min would always outdo me.

197
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,690
That made me crave
being the center of attention for once.

198
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,899
So, I volunteered.

199
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,360
This game will ask us to think on our feet

200
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,822
to come up with possibilities
and rule out ones that don't match.

201
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,742
We're pretty good at that, aren't we?

202
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,411
Guys, keep your chin up.
You're all really smart.

203
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,288
You're Team SNU, remember?

204
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,207
There's one more thing we should consider.

205
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,462
We'll have to enter four letters, right?
How are we going to arrange the letters?

206
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,173
Do we use the same four letters
or a mix of different letters?

207
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,717
I think using one letter twice
could be helpful

208
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,136
because we would know
if a modified Caesar cipher was used.

209
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,097
That one will shift each letter
down the alphabet by a different amount.

210
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,726
Let's say that our input is ACAG.

211
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,896
If the cipher shifted 1 place,
2 places, 3 places, and then 4 places,

212
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,274
we would have BEDK, right?

213
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,444
So, because the As were replaced
by different letters,

214
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,155
- it's likely that it's a modified Caesar.
- You do have a point.

215
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:41,034
- That's what I think.
- I think we should use different letters

216
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,162
because the rule may swap
the letters of certain places.

217
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,040
- And if we have the same letters...
- Seung-chan's right.

218
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,375
- It can get confusing.
- Totally.

219
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:52,003
Let's say our input was ACAG,
but the rule was to swap Letters 1 and 3.

220
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,421
The output would be the same.

221
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,798
- Okay, I get it.
- Right?

222
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,759
We'll use ABCD as our input code, okay?

223
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,928
Let's use something else
for public decryptions.

224
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,597
- In that case...
- We should use something outlandish.

225
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,974
If we stick to a set code,
it'll also help the others.

226
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,936
TEAM SNU PLANS TO USE CODES
THAT ARE HARD TO GET HINTS FROM

227
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,771
We should mix up random ones to--

228
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,106
Let's go with YJKW.

229
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,234
- What?
- Those are the initials of our surnames.

230
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,735
That's great.

231
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,447
<i>The time for the strategy meeting is up.</i>

232
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,574
- Yonsei University!
- For reunification!

233
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,744
- We, SNU, will win!
- We, SNU, will win!

234
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,288
Let's go.

235
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,373
Good luck.

236
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,588
- Let's go, Team KAIST!
- Let's go, Team KAIST!

237
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,468
Listen up, guys.

238
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,138
Don't ever raise your voices
even if you get worked up.

239
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,681
The others might hear us.

240
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,934
We need to keep things to ourselves
and work with what we have.

241
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,603
We can't let the others
gain any information from us, okay?

242
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,315
Get used to the keyboard
while we still have some time.

243
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,237
I'll type in the codes.

244
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,822
INPUT CODES ARE ENTERED VIA TABLET PCS

245
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:03,700
All set.

246
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,994
I like the feel of that.

247
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,583
We will begin the semifinal,
Code Decryption.

248
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,087
You've got this.

249
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,089
We'll take care of things out here.

250
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,009
You should concentrate
on solving the problem inside.

251
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:25,263
If the question you get is so hard
that it seems humanly impossible,

252
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,474
- feel free to give up and join us.
- Okay.

253
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,892
Don't pressure yourself.

254
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:34,272
If you are solving the individual task,
please return to your base camps.

255
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,069
I'll come out during Round 2.

256
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,243
ONE MEMBER OF EACH TEAM
WILL DECIPHER A SEPARATE CODE

257
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,331
WHICH WILL ALLOW THEM TO IDENTIFY
THE LOCATION OF THE ENCRYPTORS

258
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,168
We will decide on the overall order
by a throw of a die.

259
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,048
Team Yonsei will go first,
followed by Team KAIST, then Team SNU.

260
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,591
PUBLIC DECRYPTION ORDER
YONSEI, KAIST, SNU

261
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,968
Since we're going last,

262
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,471
we should follow our strategy
during the private decryption

263
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,767
and use the public decryptions
to get any additional information we can.

264
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,563
We will now begin
the public decryption of Round 1.

265
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,164
<i>The deciphering of the individual codes</i>
<i>will also begin.</i>

266
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,165
INDIVIDUAL TASKS BEGIN

267
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,927
What am I looking at?

268
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,936
They're all 7-by-7 boards.

269
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,730
Are there any overlaps?

270
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,107
There are 2 boards with 1142.

271
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,278
Boards 1 and 2
had the same 2 cells marked,

272
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,905
and the numbers also had
four overlapping figures.

273
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:09,200
This seemed to suggest that the cells
corresponded with the numbers,

274
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,746
so I took a closer look at those numbers
and realized that they were coordinates.

275
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,216
I've got 1,1 and 2,2...

276
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,512
<i>I took the numbers to be coordinates</i>
<i>and made good progress.</i>

277
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,891
<i>But I found something</i>
<i>that didn't follow the same rule.</i>

278
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,063
What does 7,1 and 3 mean?

279
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,148
<i>There was an odd one out.</i>

280
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,734
<i>We were given 7-by-7 boards,</i>

281
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,279
<i>so they shouldn't be higher than seven</i>
<i>if these really were coordinates.</i>

282
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:53,661
Thirteen? But that doesn't make any sense.

283
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:55,789
Seven...

284
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,249
What could this be?

285
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:03,546
WHICH TEAM WILL DECIPHER
THE INDIVIDUAL CODE FIRST?

286
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,133
Let us begin the public decryption
starting from Team Yonsei.

287
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,678
Since we're starting things off,

288
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,180
- let's start from here.
- Channel 24? All right, then.

289
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,391
- Shall I type that in?
- Sure.

290
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,238
Let's use numbers
instead of letters from now.

291
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,073
This should make things easier for us.

292
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,284
Team Yonsei's output is

293
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,455
Channel 12, ADHM.

294
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,251
...ADHM.

295
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,755
- That means this row is empty.
- Yeah.

296
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,382
Did we give away too much?

297
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,842
Don't worry about it.

298
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,927
So, there can't be
any mirrors there, right?

299
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,971
A STRAIGHT LINE MEANS
THERE CAN'T BE ANY MIRRORS IN THAT LINE

300
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:53,888
<i>Right. That's confirmed.</i>

301
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,432
They gave us a huge clue.

302
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,020
Team KAIST,
please proceed with the public decryption.

303
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:09,571
<i>Team KAIST's output is Channel 14, ABCD.</i>

304
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,949
- Another empty row, right?
- Yeah.

305
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,285
That sure is incredible.

306
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:19,456
There can't be an encryptor that turns it
back again to the original input, right?

307
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,332
Or shifting letters back and forth.

308
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,252
Team SNU,
please proceed with the public decryption.

309
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,464
Isn't it likely we'd find a mirror
if we chose one of the rows?

310
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,174
Let's go for one of the columns.

311
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,468
- How about Channel 7?
- Channel 7?

312
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:39,392
<i>Team SNU's output is Channel 15, YJKW.</i>

313
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,938
I didn't expect
this round to be like this.

314
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,274
That's such a unique code.

315
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,070
Y FOR YUK JUN-HYEONG, C FOR CHO JUN-HYEONG
K FOR KIM GYU-MIN, W FOR WOO SU-HAN

316
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,156
That concludes
the public decryption of Round 1.

317
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,951
We will now begin
the private decryption of Round 1.

318
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,953
RESULTS WILL ONLY BE SHARED
WITH INDIVIDUAL TEAMS

319
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,246
What should we do next?

320
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,457
Channel 22 has already been called,
so we need something else.

321
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,292
- Channel 26.
- This one?

322
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,669
Channel 26? All right.

323
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,927
We'll likely find a mirror
if we go for a row.

324
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,679
I want to go for this row.

325
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,472
JUN-HYEONG WANTS TO CHECK CHANNEL 23

326
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,057
That does seem to be our best bet.

327
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,934
Channel 23 as the entry point?

328
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,936
That's not a bad idea.

329
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,146
There's such a high chance
of hitting a mirror there.

330
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,982
TEAM SNU TRIES OUT CHANNEL 23

331
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,693
Shall we go with Channel 23?

332
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,570
Let's go with ABCD on Channel 23.

333
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,281
Even if it's empty,
it'll still be useful information.

334
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,491
Let's try this.

335
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,451
Type in Channel 23 and ABCD.

336
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:42,205
You have completed your individual task...

337
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,043
Hold on.

338
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,295
You have completed
your individual task, Team SNU.

339
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,132
Please join your teammates outside.

340
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:57,178
THE CORRECTNESS OF THE RESULT
WILL NOT BE ANNOUNCED

341
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,596
How is he done already?

342
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,391
All right. We can't let that get to us.

343
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,936
- I definitely got it right.
- What was the question?

344
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,312
Here's what it was.

345
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:12,027
It's 7,13...
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

346
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:18,074
If the line is too long,
I can always bend it.

347
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:22,078
So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

348
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,288
That's 7,13.

349
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,249
And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

350
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,878
I had to take a 90-degree turn
for the y-coordinates.

351
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,672
<i>If the x-coordinate was 6,</i>
<i>we had a 6-by-6 board</i>

352
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,799
<i>with the sixth cell</i>
<i>acting as the turning point.</i>

353
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,052
<i>For a 5-by-5 board,</i>
<i>5 was the turning point.</i>

354
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,137
<i>That's the rule I discovered.</i>

355
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,726
There we go. That's just crazy.

356
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,937
That makes this cell 4,6.

357
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,606
That's right, isn't it?

358
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:51,900
Next up is 5,3.

359
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,819
Right?

360
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,238
And finally, 6,6.

361
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,200
TEAM SNU'S JUN-HYEONG WAS FIRST
TO COMPLETE THE INDIVIDUAL TASK

362
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,493
It's in this direction.

363
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,626
TEAM SNU HAS LOCATED ALL THE ENCRYPTORS

364
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,173
Damn it. What's taking him so long?

365
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,052
Team SNU already has the answers.

366
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,303
I know.

367
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:25,684
<i>I knew how anxious Se-hwan must've been,</i>
<i>so I kept cheering for him in my mind.</i>

368
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:30,522
TEAM YONSEI AND TEAM KAIST
ARE STILL WORKING ON THE INDIVIDUAL TASK

369
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,941
We've got it.

370
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,860
We were heading into Round 2,
knowing where the encryptors were,

371
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,696
whereas the others had no idea.

372
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,615
So I felt sure we could get ahead
of the other teams.

373
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,076
We still don't have any clues
about the encryption.

374
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,704
Gi-hyeon couldn't do much
even if he were here.

375
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:46,913
You get what I mean, right?

376
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,208
We still weren't sure
about the location of any of the mirrors.

377
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,545
On top of that,
our input was returned to us as it was.

378
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,214
The location of the encryptors
didn't matter at that point.

379
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,342
- His being here won't change much.
- That's true.

380
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:04,264
The fact that SNU's done already
means Se-hwan could crack it, too.

381
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,724
Don't mind it so much.

382
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,767
Having one more member
won't change anything.

383
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,687
Having more clues matters more
than having more time to ponder.

384
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,688
Totally.

385
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:16,317
The results of your private decryptions
have been shared.

386
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,737
Please give us something worthwhile.

387
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,406
Hang on. What does this mean?

388
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,701
<i>This just makes no sense.</i>

389
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,203
TEAM YONSEI'S CODE
AND ITS PATH ARE UNALTERED

390
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:31,541
Should we try a column next,
or should we try another row?

391
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,545
There are five obstacles in total,
including the black hole, right?

392
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,505
Since all 5 obstacles
are spread out in the 4 rows,

393
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,507
we're bound to find one in our next turn.

394
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:40,425
Right.

395
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:46,389
But I personally think that it's high time
that we move on to the columns.

396
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,266
We've only checked the rows so far,

397
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,519
and we'll likely hit two obstacles
if we check another row.

398
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:52,979
Why don't we go for a column?

399
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,356
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

400
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,857
In that case...

401
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,610
I'll go for Channel 20.

402
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:05,575
TEAM SNU AND TEAM KAIST
ENTERED THE SAME INPUT

403
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,035
Hey, look.

404
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,746
- What?
- Look.

405
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,583
TEAM SNU AND TEAM KAIST'S
PRIVATE DECRYPTION RESULTS

406
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,710
TRYING TO LOCATE THE OBSTACLES
How does this look?

407
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:18,046
Can you show me exactly where this is?

408
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:23,093
Our input was Channel 23,
so if there was a one-way mirror here...

409
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,303
That won't work.
The output came out of Channel 11.

410
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,389
Your suggestion would make it Channel 13.

411
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,724
Not if this one is a black hole.

412
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,768
So, we're assuming that's a black hole?

413
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,688
I want us to examine that possibility.

414
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,153
YUK JUN-HYEONG FOUND SOMETHING
I found something new.

415
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,825
I found the flaw in Su-han's case.

416
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,828
<i>If our input went like this,</i>
<i>the code must stay the same.</i>

417
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,204
<i>But the output code is different.</i>

418
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,248
THE OUTPUT CODE WAS ALTERED

419
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,582
Do you know what that means?

420
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,128
<i>These ones aren't the mirrors.</i>
<i>These ones will create this cycle.</i>

421
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:02,298
THE INPUT THEN CAN PASS AN ENCRYPTOR

422
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,677
<i>If my assumption is correct,</i>
<i>we can be sure where the mirrors are.</i>

423
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,512
This seems about right.

424
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,849
Let's submit an input later
to confirm this.

425
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:16,938
TEAM KAIST IS ALSO TRYING TO DEDUCE
THE OBSTACLES' LOCATION

426
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:21,401
I'll put two one-way mirrors here
to face the same direction, for example.

427
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,903
Then, the input would turn like this.

428
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,823
- So, would this mirror be here?
- Hold on.

429
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,243
But it should come out of Channel 11.

430
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,911
THE OUTPUT COMES OUT OF CHANNEL 13

431
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,874
Since we're unsure,
we might as well check somewhere else.

432
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,084
Okay, let's check
a different channel for now.

433
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,046
- Press enter.
- This is our input.

434
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,470
The results of your private decryptions
have been shared.

435
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,474
Wait, what does this mean?

436
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,059
What?

437
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:59,314
TEAM YONSEI'S INPUT
AVOIDED THE MIRRORS YET AGAIN

438
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,025
Where on earth did they
place those mirrors, then?

439
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,527
We have to find the mirrors soon.

440
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,113
You have completed your individual task...

441
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,079
Team KAIST,
please join your teammates outside.

442
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,252
I'm sure of my answers.

443
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,838
I've got all five encryptors for sure.

444
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,841
TEAM KAIST HAS LOCATED ALL 5 ENCRYPTORS

445
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:31,054
I managed to solve the problem
not long after Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong,

446
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,391
<i>so I was determined</i>
<i>not to get beaten by Team SNU.</i>

447
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,228
TEAM YONSEI IS STILL WORKING
ON THE INDIVIDUAL TASK

448
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,106
Se-hwan might be
double-checking things to be sure.

449
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,275
Even if we knew where the encryptors were,
that wouldn't change much now, right?

450
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,694
- Sure.
- We need the mirrors.

451
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:48,029
- The mirrors are our priority.
- Yeah, definitely.

452
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,241
<i>Honestly, I felt uneasy.</i>

453
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,785
<i>Se-hwan is undoubtedly</i>
<i>one of the smartest contestants.</i>

454
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:57,288
<i>If he needed that much time,</i>
<i>it meant the problem was troubling him.</i>

455
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,749
This can't be happening.

456
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:03,795
It's all right.

457
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,047
I'm sure he'll do fine.

458
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,634
TEAM KAIST GOES OVER THE RESULT
OF THE PRIVATE DECRYPTION

459
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:12,637
It baffles me how we only got
one output at Channel 19.

460
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,393
Hold on. Let me think about something.
I think I saw something earlier.

461
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,688
But the two-mirror placement
might not work.

462
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:22,981
GI-HYEON TRIES TO FIND THE MIRRORS

463
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:27,110
TEAM SNU'S PRIVATE DECRYPTION RESULT

464
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,069
How's this?

465
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,363
CONFIRMED OBSTACLES
<i>About 99 percent correct, right?</i>

466
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,157
<i>I'll mark them as confirmed.</i>

467
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,743
THE LAST MIRROR'S LOCATION CONFIRMED

468
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,038
TEAM SNU HAS LOCATED
ALL ENCRYPTORS AND OBSTACLES

469
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,914
Jun-hyeong's speedy work
helped a great deal.

470
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,624
I'll give you that.

471
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,628
That concludes Round 1 of Code Decryption.

472
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,381
CODE DECRYPTION, ROUND 2
<i>Just as in Round 1,</i>

473
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:52,802
<i>all teams will perform 1 public</i>
<i>and 2 private decryptions in Round 2.</i>

474
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,514
Team Yonsei,
please proceed with the public decryption.

475
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,351
Hey.

476
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,394
- Let's try this one on Channel 8.
- What?

477
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:03,271
Let's use the same code on Channel 8.

478
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:04,230
Why?

479
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,608
To rule out one more row.

480
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,195
CHOOSING CHANNEL 8 AS THEIR ENTRY POINT

481
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:20,330
<i>Team Yonsei's output is Channel 28, ADHM.</i>

482
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:25,377
We ruled out a lot of rows,
so our odds are still pretty good.

483
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,382
TEAM YONSEI NARROWED DOWN
THE POSSIBLE LOCATIONS OF THE MIRRORS

484
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:33,093
You have completed
your individual task, Team Yonsei,

485
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,886
please join your teammates outside.

486
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:39,015
TEAM YONSEI IS LAST TO COMPLETE
THE INDIVIDUAL TASK

487
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,144
- I can't say I'm sure.
- About which one?

488
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:45,355
- This encryptor may go here.
- Where's that?

489
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,315
Why won't this work?

490
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:52,779
STILL HASN'T CRACKED THE RULE
Why is 5,4 down there?

491
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,364
It moved down two rows.

492
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:57,909
<i>Because the fifth board's coordinates</i>
<i>didn't follow the rule I established,</i>

493
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:00,245
<i>I thought I would misplace one encryptor.</i>

494
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:01,663
Even considering that possibility,

495
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:05,542
I thought it was more important
to share my findings with the team first.

496
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,753
TEAM YONSEI'S PREDICTION
OF THE ENCRYPTORS' LOCATIONS

497
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,047
I'm not sure about these two.

498
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,967
I'm certain about these three,
but not these two.

499
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,469
Let's mark the ones
we're sure about first.

500
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,474
<i>Encryptors 2 and 3</i>
<i>might cancel each other out.</i>

501
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,351
<i>That's a possibility.</i>

502
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,022
Our input into Channel 26
came out of Channel 10.

503
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,398
ENCRYPTORS 2 AND 3 CANCEL OUT

504
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,316
- We need to check Channel 5.
- What?

505
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,027
Let's check Encryptor 3 using Channel 5.

506
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,488
Team KAIST,
please proceed with the public decryption.

507
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,533
Why don't we check Channel 4?
Is that a bad idea?

508
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,786
- I think Channel 3 would be better.
- Instead of Channel 4?

509
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,539
A ROUTE TO PASS THROUGH 2 ENCRYPTORS
Channel 4 might not have anything.

510
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:46,374
- Channel 3, it is.
- ABCD on Channel 3?

511
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,418
Shall we change the code?

512
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:51,046
TEAM KAIST USES A DIFFERENT CODE

513
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,505
Let's think about this again.

514
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:58,219
<i>Team KAIST's output is Channel 25, WPPW.</i>

515
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,306
Let's think about this again.

516
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,516
- I got them.
- Really? Show us.

517
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,482
A mirror each in Columns 5 and 19, then...

518
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:12,859
GI-HYEON LOCATES ALL THE OBSTACLES

519
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,110
Could you check these?

520
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,154
Okay, I think that would work.

521
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:21,826
DECRYPTION RESULTS ALIGN
WITH GI-HYEON'S PLACEMENT

522
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,412
So, that's where these are.

523
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,206
- You're insane.
- What about this?

524
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,917
Do we only need the encryption rules now?

525
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,671
TEAMS NUMBERED ENCRYPTORS DIFFERENTLY
So, are we using Channel 10 now?

526
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,798
To confirm the rules
of Encryptors 2 and 3, right?

527
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,174
Yeah.

528
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:42,430
<i>Team SNU's output is Channel 26, YJKW.</i>

529
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:46,476
It turned back. It's an inverse function.

530
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,645
- They canceled each other out.
- Like inverse functions.

531
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,230
<i>That's a major find.</i>

532
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:52,107
TWO ENCRYPTORS CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT

533
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:55,777
We will now begin
the private decryption of Round 2.

534
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,195
Let's put ABCD into Channel 11.

535
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,198
That should give us results
from Channels 6, 17, and 23, right?

536
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:04,786
Please.

537
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:08,456
Let's use Channel 6 to see
if that gets us an error

538
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,083
and what Encryptor 5 gets us.

539
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:13,253
- Please enter your input.
- I agree. Let's go with Channel 6.

540
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,547
- Let's go with ACEG.
- All right. ACEG.

541
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,631
Yeah, let's try it.

542
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,634
- I'll go with this.
- Okay.

543
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:22,053
Done.

544
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,639
- It's so nerve-wracking.
- You have ten seconds left.

545
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:28,810
The results of your private decryptions
have been shared.

546
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:30,729
It's not up yet.

547
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,647
- Hang on, what's this?
- Channel 19?

548
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:36,192
We went with Channel 5,
and the output came out of Channel 19.

549
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,737
Then the mirror must be here.
There's no other option.

550
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,366
But I can't comprehend the results.

551
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,244
You will, with Jeong-hun's help.

552
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:49,205
The assigned numbers for the letters
are 2, 4, 8, and 15.

553
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:53,501
- Yeah, we know that.
- How did they become 22, 20, 16, and 9?

554
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:57,505
The sum of the numbers is 24.

555
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,974
TEAM YONSEI
PRIVATE DECRYPTION RESULT FOR ROUND 2

556
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,691
It adds up so neatly,
so I doubt our conjecture is false.

557
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:19,027
TEAM YONSEI, CODE DECRYPTION
ENCRYPTOR'S RULE

558
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,864
ENCRYPTOR 3: SUM OF THE NUMBERS ASSIGNED
TO INPUT AND OUTPUT LETTERS IS 24

559
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,034
We got an error message.

560
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:27,786
- Our code was ACEG, right?
- Yeah.

561
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,996
- In numbers, that's 1357.
- And we got CJGN.

562
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,623
- What about--
- I've got it.

563
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,750
It shifts the letters by 2 and 7 places.

564
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,586
TEAM KAIST, CODE DECRYPTION

565
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:42,133
This one seems pretty easy.

566
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,470
The rule alternates between moving
4 places forward and 1 place back.

567
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:46,930
YU-CHAN FOUND ENCRYPTOR 4'S RULE

568
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,724
TEAM KAIST FOUND
THE RULES FOR 2 ENCRYPTORS

569
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:53,853
There we go.

570
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:56,815
Channels 17, 23, and 6
are the results we wanted, right?

571
00:30:56,898 --> 00:31:00,610
THE OUTPUT VALUES MATCH THEIR EXPECTATIONS

572
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:04,239
My theory is that the rule alternates
between moving 2 spaces and 7 spaces.

573
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,866
I think it shifts
between moving 2 spots and 7 spots.

574
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:11,204
<i>Letters 1 and 3 are moved by 2 places,</i>
<i>and the others are moved by 7.</i>

575
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,123
TEAM SNU, CODE DECRYPTION

576
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:17,210
This one alternates between moving
4 spaces forward and 1 space back.

577
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,753
I'm sure about this one.

578
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,256
Yeah, that checks out.

579
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:23,675
TEAM SNU ALSO FOUND
THE RULES OF 2 ENCRYPTORS

580
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,594
Since we've got Encryptor 5,
we can work out Encryptor 1.

581
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:30,849
We can then figure out Encryptor 2's rule
and then the rule for Encryptor 3.

582
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:32,225
TEAM KAIST CHECKS 2 ENCRYPTORS TOGETHER

583
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,644
- Let's use Channel 9 this time.
- Yeah, let's go with that.

584
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,688
USES CHANNEL 9 TO CHECK ENCRYPTORS 1 AND 5

585
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:39,399
If we use our neutralizer right,

586
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,444
we can have our input modified
by both Encryptors 3 and 5.

587
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,739
<i>Code Decryption has a special item</i>
<i>called the neutralizer.</i>

588
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:48,908
<i>When used in a certain location,</i>

589
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,579
<i>an encryptor or an obstacle</i>
<i>positioned there is rendered ineffective.</i>

590
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:55,874
<i>The item can only be used</i>
<i>during the private decryption rounds.</i>

591
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:02,213
<i>If Team SNU uses it on the plain mirror</i>
<i>in 5,11 to neutralize its effect,</i>

592
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:06,384
<i>the signal entered into Channel 5</i>
<i>will not go via Channel 19</i>

593
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,303
<i>as the plain mirror has lost its effect.</i>

594
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:13,433
<i>Instead, its outputs will go</i>
<i>via Channels 17 and 23.</i>

595
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:17,187
<i>As such, using the neutralizer</i>
<i>would allow Team SNU</i>

596
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:22,150
<i>to verify if their analysis</i>
<i>of Encryptors 3 and 5 is correct.</i>

597
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:23,818
Isn't that a good idea?

598
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,528
INPUT: CHANNEL 5, BEIN
NEUTRALIZER IN 5,11

599
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,156
What next?
Things will get important from now on.

600
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,158
How about this one?

601
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,161
- Shall we try Channel 17?
- Yeah.

602
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:35,038
All right. I'll type that in.

603
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,042
- I'm going for it.
- Okay.

604
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,463
I hope we get two outputs.

605
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:48,051
The results of your private decryptions
have been shared.

606
00:32:49,094 --> 00:32:51,554
The results of your private decryptions
have been shared.

607
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,349
Which channel did we choose again?
Was it Channel 17?

608
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,518
Damn. How does this make any sense?

609
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,233
Two error messages?

610
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:09,280
FINDS THE PLACEMENT THAT GIVES THEM
2 ERRORS AND A RESULT OUT OF CHANNEL 11

611
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,199
That's the only scenario I have, too.

612
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:12,784
A ONE-WAY MIRROR OVERLAPS
AN UNKNOWN ENCRYPTOR

613
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:14,744
Are we sure about this one?

614
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,209
<i>I wasn't sure about the answer</i>
<i>I submitted for the individual task,</i>

615
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,919
<i>and that dragged my team down.</i>

616
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:26,548
Are we sure about the mirror's position?

617
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:29,634
That's probably the only case that works.

618
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:33,722
The results of your private decryptions
have been shared.

619
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,182
Our original code was BEIN.

620
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,143
<i>Hold on.</i>

621
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:39,686
<i>VSOJ?</i>

622
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,022
<i>ZRSI.</i>

623
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:43,690
Just a second.

624
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:46,067
I've got Encryptor 3's rule, Gyu-min.

625
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:48,945
Can you see this? That's for Encryptor 3.

626
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,864
<i>The sum reaches 24. My thoughts exactly.</i>

627
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,073
<i>Do you think that's wrong?</i>

628
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:53,825
<i>No, it's definitely right.</i>

629
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:56,369
Does this mean Encryptors 2 and 3
share the same rule?

630
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:59,664
<i>Team SNU's public decryption results</i>
<i>in Round 2 showed</i>

631
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:03,418
<i>that if a signal passed</i>
<i>Encryptors 3 and 2 together,</i>

632
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:06,171
<i>the output would be the same as the input.</i>

633
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,049
<i>We now know that Encryptor 3's rule</i>

634
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:13,136
<i>produces a sum of 24</i>
<i>by adding the letter's assigned numbers.</i>

635
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,972
<i>If we entered the letter A to check,</i>

636
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:18,391
<i>we would be able to see</i>
<i>that Encryptor 2's rule</i>

637
00:34:18,475 --> 00:34:24,064
<i>also creates a sum of 24</i>
<i>by adding the numbers of the letters.</i>

638
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:30,653
<i>In summary, we can conclude</i>
<i>Encryptors 2 and 3 have the same rule.</i>

639
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,615
I'm 100 percent certain.

640
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:37,285
But how would they convert the letter Z?

641
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,245
That's what I'm wondering about.

642
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,581
Can we use X, Y, and Z to check?

643
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:45,794
<i>The sum should be kept at 24, right?</i>
<i>Then, X would need 0.</i>

644
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:47,128
<i>And how does that work?</i>

645
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:49,339
LETTERS X, Y, AND Z WILL CAUSE ANOMALIES

646
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,508
I think we have to figure that out.

647
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:57,597

<i>Encryptor 1 gives a mirror image</i>

<i>of the first two letters</i>
<i>onto the remaining slots.</i>

652
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,325
<i>I think you're right.</i>

653
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:22,372
ENCRYPTOR 1: REPLACE THE LATTER HALF
WITH THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THE FIRST HALF

654
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:23,456
Listen, Gyu-min.

655
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,251
I think the former half of the code
decides its latter half.

656
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:27,669
I agree.

657
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:29,587
TEAM SNU DEDUCES THE SAME RULE

658
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,757
- But what about Encryptor 2?
- That keeps the sum of the numbers at 24.

659
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,259
- And he's right.
- I agree.

660
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,845
Maybe we should submit
our answer sheet early.

661
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,221
Yeah, if only two options remain.

662
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:41,307
We will begin Round 3 of Code Decryption.

663
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,685
There will be
no public decryption in Round 3.

664
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:47,063
You can perform private decryptions
or submit your answer sheets.

665
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:48,273
ANSWER SUBMISSIONS USE UP A TURN

666
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:51,192
We will now begin the private decryption.

667
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:54,195
We now have to check the 26th letter.

668
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:57,365
We have no idea
what Z will be converted into.

669
00:35:57,949 --> 00:35:59,451
What's the 12th letter?

670
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:00,744
CHECKING Z'S OUTPUT
It's L.

671
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,537
- You have ten seconds left.
- And Y.

672
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:04,539
Okay, that looks good.

673
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:10,128
We have to run Encryptor 3
with the letters X, Y, and Z.

674
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,338
We have to try it.

675
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,465
TEAM SNU INVESTIGATES ANOMALIES
CAUSED BY X, Y, AND Z

676
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,468
Let's do Channel 11.

677
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:18,261
- Let's try something new.
- But...

678
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:20,472
Is it too risky to use the same letters?

679
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:22,307
- Why not?
- Just a pair.

680
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,641
Let's use the same letter.

681
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:27,020
QQ...

682
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:29,814
- Add an A and a T.
- An A and a T?

683
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:34,486
The results of your private decryptions
have been shared.

684
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:36,071
TAKES IN THE RESULT OF THEIR QUERY

685
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:38,156
Hold on. Is it SZYX?

686
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:41,701
It seems like Team KAIST is almost done.

687
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,495
There we go.

688
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:45,372
GOES OVER THEIR OUTPUT
For example...

689
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:53,505
Channel 17, QQAT. Channel 6, SXCA.

690
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:57,884
Why was the code
out of Channel 23 altered?

691
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:58,968
Channel 23?

692
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,931
Encryptor 4 must be here, then.

693
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:09,270
<i>- That must be it.</i>
<i>- It does look like it.</i>

694
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,481
CONFIRMS THE PLACEMENT
OF ALL ENCRYPTORS AND OBSTACLES

695
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:13,108
Can you revise this?

696
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:16,194
I'm so sorry.
I must've marked Encryptor 4 wrong.

697
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:19,322
Don't worry about it. It's fine, Se-hwan.

698
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:22,200
So, what does Encryptor 4 do?

699
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:26,246
It alternates between moving
4 spaces forward and 1 space back.

700
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,414
I'm sure of that.

701
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:31,167
We will begin the private decryption.

702
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:32,460
Hand it in. Hurry!

703
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:34,295
Are they for real?

704
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,090
Hand it in. Hurry!

705
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:45,724
Let's focus on our analysis.

706
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:50,353
<i>Team SNU and Team KAIST submitted</i>
<i>their answer sheets earlier than expected,</i>

707
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,772
<i>and that surprise made us anxious.</i>

708
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:54,941
Team SNU.

709
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,322
Team SNU, that is the correct answer.

710
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:02,866
TEAM SNU PASSES

711
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:04,701
My goodness.

712
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:07,412
Team KAIST.

713
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,837
That is incorrect.

714
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,717
A turn for private decryption
has been taken away.

715
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:25,347
TEAM SNU AND TEAM KAIST
HAVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR ENCRYPTOR 2

716
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:31,436
TEAM KAIST DID NOT EXPLAIN
THE CASE OF X(24)

717
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,732
We have to run Encryptor 3
with the letters X, Y, and Z.

718
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:39,194
Should we try EKYZ?

719
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:41,154
- No, we need an X, too.
- We do?

720
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:43,073
We need the sum to be 24, right?

721
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:45,784
An X would then need zero,
so we have to test it, too.

722
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:48,620
An imperfect description of the rule
will be incorrect.

723
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,831
TEAM SNU VERIFIED X, Y, AND Z
TO GET THE CORRECT ANSWER

724
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:55,335
Team Yonsei, please proceed
with the private decryption.

725
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,254
Should we try submitting our answer?

726
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:02,676
Check the answers and let me know.
I'll go and hand it in then.

727
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:17,816
<i>That concludes the semifinal,</i>
<i>Code Decryption.</i>

728
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,568
<i>The final results will now be revealed.</i>

729
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:22,821
<i>First place, Team SNU.</i>

730
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:26,783
<i>Second place...</i>

731
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:32,539
<i>Second place,</i>

732
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:34,165
<i>Team KAIST.</i>

733
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,795
<i>Third place, Team Yonsei.</i>

734
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:44,259
It would be pointless to submit it now.

735
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:46,428
TEAM YONSEI CHOSE DECRYPTION
OVER SUBMISSION

736
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:49,097
We didn't cover the case of X.

737
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,098
The 24th letter?

738
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:52,267
TEAM KAIST FINDS THE ERROR IN THEIR ANSWER

739
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:57,897
X TURNS INTO Z
TEAM KAIST ADDED THE MISSING INFORMATION

740
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,983
Team KAIST, that is correct.

741
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:07,866
<i>The fifth team to be eliminated</i>
<i>from Elite League, Season 2,</i>

742
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:09,367
<i>is Team Yonsei.</i>

743
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:13,204
<i>It's a bit disappointing</i>
<i>to finish in third place.</i>

744
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:15,457
<i>I was sure my team wouldn't get eliminated</i>

745
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,418
<i>because we'd managed</i>
<i>to avoid Deathmatches so far.</i>

746
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:21,629
<i>I was reminded of the harsh reality</i>
<i>of a survival show.</i>

747
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:26,217
<i>Team Yonsei, please exit the grounds.</i>

748
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:47,614
<i>I suppose I was somewhat arrogant</i>
<i>before the shoot began.</i>

749
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:49,407
<i>And this journey taught me</i>

750
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:53,370
<i>that I would need to work hard</i>
<i>with more humility moving forward.</i>

751
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,331
<i>We played four main matches.</i>

752
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:58,625
<i>I believe we've made it this far</i>

753
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:02,754
<i>thanks to the great teamwork</i>
<i>and the diverse range of our skill sets.</i>

754
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:06,466
<i>I would like to thank</i>
<i>my teammates for everything.</i>

755
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:11,096
<i>In a way, the whole experience</i>
<i>felt like a dream.</i>

756
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:15,100
<i>I was so happy to see ourselves</i>
<i>working so hard together as a team.</i>

757
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:18,812
<i>I think I'm going to miss</i>
<i>those hours dearly.</i>

758
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:20,188
- Well done.
- Good job.

759
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,732
<i>I think we made it this far,</i>
<i>thanks to my team's faith in me.</i>

760
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,402
<i>Thank you, guys. I love you.</i>

761
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:30,281
<i>There were some difficult times,</i>
<i>and I was also weary at times.</i>

762
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:34,869
<i>But whenever new games were introduced,</i>
<i>my heart raced with excitement again.</i>

763
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:38,206
<i>I was so happy</i>
<i>to solve questions to my heart's content.</i>

764
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:40,500
<i>And I want to tell my teammates...</i>

765
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:43,336
It's kind of embarrassing to say this.

766
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:47,549
I guess that I love them.

767
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:13,950
<i>We somehow managed</i>
<i>to make it to the finals.</i>

768
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:15,910
Let me say this again.

769
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:18,872
We always lost when we were too relaxed

770
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:21,166
and always won
when we poured our hearts into it.

771
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:22,917
Team SNU isn't a pushover,

772
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:26,880
so we'll need everyone to do their best,
and we just might be able to beat them.

773
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:28,840
This goes without saying,

774
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:31,593
but we can't let our guard down
even if we take Round 1,

775
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:34,137
and we shouldn't be so down if we lose it.

776
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,306
We also need to make good use
of the strategy meeting.

777
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:40,352
I want us to think of the games ahead
as Deathmatches rather than the finals.

778
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:42,312
- Totally.
- Right. It's the Deathmatch.

779
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:45,607
But personally, I want us to win 2 to 0.

780
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,108
<i>- Me, too.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

781
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:50,528
<i>We have to be serious today.</i>

782
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,697
But that's not a reason to tense up.

783
00:42:53,323 --> 00:42:54,866
The finals arrived so soon.

784
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,285
It's really the last day.

785
00:42:58,036 --> 00:43:02,040
I hear that you need
an ironlike will to win.

Please, ma'am. Give it to us.

796
00:43:40,912 --> 00:43:42,455
I really need that scholarship.

797
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:44,290
Let's try not to mind that too much.

798
00:43:44,374 --> 00:43:47,043

ELECTRONIC BRAIN
TEAM KAIST'S PARK JI-SEONG

818
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,068
...three, six, and seven.

819
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:53,985
That is correct.

820
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:57,405
Other contestants
are equally as good as us.

821
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,657
Anyone could win
if we all had the same plan.

822
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:00,867
That's why strategies matter.

823
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,747
PASSIONATE LEADER
TEAM KAIST'S OH HYEONG-SEOK

824
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,667
That won't matter. I think we're better
than Team Black's leaders.

825
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,793
Do we know the word for "person"?

826
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:13,713
CALM PACEMAKER
TEAM KAIST'S CHOI YU-CHAN

827
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:15,590
We'll claim it the moment he does.

828
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:19,719
FIRST MEETING WITH TEAM KAIST
I believe I'm the smartest.

829
00:45:19,803 --> 00:45:23,431
I feel very confident in my skill
of arranging numbers to reach a target.

830
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:26,434
I was praised often as a smart kid
while growing up.

831
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:29,813
There is this notion that KAIST students
were all once rejected by SNU,

832
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:32,482
and I applied to be on this show
to correct people's misconceptions.

833
00:45:33,441 --> 00:45:35,902
THE TEAM ONCE UP FOR ELIMINATION
<i>The Deathmatches transformed Team KAIST.</i>

834
00:45:35,985 --> 00:45:38,988
IS NOW IN THE FINALS
<i>What's gotten into Team KAIST?</i>

835
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:40,949
<i>You scored 210 points.</i>
<i>It's a perfect score.</i>

836
00:45:41,032 --> 00:45:44,077
THE DRAMATIC RISE OF TEAM KAIST

837
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,537
We have a shot at winning this season.

838
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,706
We have to win it.

839
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:51,251
Once I find a rule, I rarely forget it.

840
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:55,171
UNRIVALED TOP CONTESTANT
TEAM SNU'S KIM GYU-MIN

841
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:57,716
<i>Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min</i>
<i>is the last remaining contestant.</i>

842
00:45:57,799 --> 00:45:58,925
I'll go with 7 in A3.

843
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:00,051
I'll go with 12 in C2.

844
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:01,845
- I'll go with 2 in E3.
- That is correct.

845
00:46:01,928 --> 00:46:03,304
<i>How can all of that</i>
<i>fit in your head in one go?</i>

846
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:04,973
<i>- Gyu-min the Great.</i>
<i>- Gyu-min the Great.</i>

ALL-ROUNDER
TEAM SNU'S YUK JUN-HYEONG

848
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:10,979
I definitely got it right.

849
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:13,273
My answer is 5, 1, 3, 2, 4, 6.

850
00:46:13,356 --> 00:46:14,649
You reached Tier 1.

851
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:16,067
<i>How did he get it so fast?</i>

852
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,487
Divide it by 2, and it's 123,454,321.

SHREWD STRATEGIST
TEAM SNU'S WOO SU-HAN

854
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:28,663
I'm going to be there to defeat him.
I'm going to keep trying until I win.

855
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:30,665
We can always do something
to place a piece here.

UNYIELDING SPIRIT
TEAM SNU'S CHO JUN-HYEONG

857
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,173
I'm 100 percent sure.

858
00:46:39,215 --> 00:46:41,092
FIRST MEETING WITH TEAM SNU
I only had eyes for SNU.

859
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:43,261
I wasn't interested in any other schools.

860
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:46,514
My competitive streak kicks in
when I meet someone better than me.

861
00:46:46,598 --> 00:46:50,810
I believe I'm good at tasks
where I have to apply set rules quickly.

862
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:54,022
I remember finding answers faster
than the contestants on the show did.

863
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:56,316
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>Team SNU will take the win again?</i>

864
00:46:56,399 --> 00:46:58,568
We're not extras.
We're the lead characters.

865
00:46:58,651 --> 00:47:02,238
FORMIDABLE DEFENDING CHAMPIONS, TEAM SNU

866
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,699
You're toast if you meet us
at the Deathmatch.

867
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:06,534
<i>Losing is not in my vocabulary.</i>

868
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:08,953
We'll have to teach them a lesson.

869
00:47:10,997 --> 00:47:16,002
<i>Team SNU and Team KAIST,</i>
<i>please gather at the Main Hall.</i>

870
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:18,672
- What's that?
- What the heck?

871
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:22,634
What's going on?

872
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:25,178
<i>What is this? A three-dimensional maze?</i>

873
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,139
<i>I'm sure this isn't just a simple maze.</i>

874
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,437
Do whatever it takes
to win the first round.

875
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:36,064
Right, I know.

876
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:39,526
Let's not bank on dumb luck
and win on our merit.

877
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:41,027
Of course, we will.

878
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,613
<i>The first match of the finals</i>

879
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:45,448
<i>is Three-layered Maze.</i>

880
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:46,700
Three layers?

881
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:47,909
"Three-layered Maze."

882
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:52,455
<i>Your task for Three-layered Maze</i>
<i>is to memorize the layout of a maze</i>

883
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:55,959
<i>which has red, blue, and green walls.</i>

884
00:47:56,042 --> 00:48:01,256
<i>Then you must navigate your way through it</i>
<i>to reach the marked goals.</i>

885
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:03,925
ARRIVED AT GOAL

886
00:48:04,342 --> 00:48:05,677
Oh, come on.

887
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:07,178
Memorizing an image?

888
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:11,474
EXAMPLE QUESTION
<i>Please note that you will be given</i>

889
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:15,478
<i>three maps to memorize,</i>
<i>each showing the different colored walls.</i>

890
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:19,107
<i>The locations of the five goals</i>
<i>will not be displayed, either.</i>

891
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:22,277
<i>Contestants will have to combine</i>
<i>the three layers of maps in their heads</i>

892
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,946
<i>and find out the location of the goals.</i>

893
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:30,201
<i>All 5 goals have walls</i>
<i>of all 3 colors surrounding it,</i>

894
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:36,750
<i>and each goal has</i>
<i>a single corresponding cell in the maze.</i>

895
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:40,628
<i>When the game starts,</i>
<i>the players will be given</i>

896
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:44,924
<i>two minutes at each turn</i>
<i>to check the map of the maze.</i>

897
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:48,136
<i>You must find a path to a goal</i>
<i>and memorize it in that time.</i>

898
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:50,638
Seriously?

899
00:48:50,722 --> 00:48:52,182
That's not an easy maze.

900
00:48:52,265 --> 00:48:55,352
<i>Once the two minutes are up,</i>
<i>you will enter the unmarked maze</i>

901
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:59,105
<i>and navigate your way</i>
<i>through the actual maze.</i>

902
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:03,276
<i>You have ten seconds</i>
<i>to move to the next cell,</i>

903
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:08,448
<i>and you can't return to the previous cell</i>
<i>once you take a step away from it.</i>

904
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:12,369
<i>When you think you have reached</i>
<i>one of the goals,</i>

905
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:14,871
<i>you must announce</i>
<i>your arrival on the spot.</i>

906
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:17,916
<i>If it is indeed one of the goals,</i>

907
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:21,795
<i>that will conclude your turn,</i>
<i>leaving your opponent to take their turn.</i>

908
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:28,802
<i>Please note that a player can visit</i>
<i>the same goal as their opponent.</i>

909
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:31,346
What? That's amazing.

910
00:49:31,846 --> 00:49:35,100
<i>If you hit a wall</i>

911
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:38,478
<i>or announce your arrival</i>
<i>in a cell that is not a goal,</i>

912
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:42,440
<i>your turn will end,</i>
<i>leaving your opponent to take their turn.</i>

913
00:49:43,274 --> 00:49:44,818
<i>Out of a total of five goals,</i>

914
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:49,155
<i>the player who reaches two first</i>
<i>will be declared the winner of the round.</i>

915
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:52,450
<i>The game consists of three rounds,</i>

916
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:55,870
<i>and different contestants</i>
<i>must play in Rounds 1 and 2.</i>

917
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:59,040
<i>However, any player can participate</i>
<i>in Round 3.</i>

918
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:01,084
<i>Out of a total of three rounds,</i>

919
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:04,963
<i>the team that secures two wins first</i>
<i>will be declared the winner.</i>

920
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:08,800
<i>Both teams,</i>
<i>please start discussing your strategies.</i>

921
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,680
It's time to pitch your ideas.
Kick us off, Hyeong-seok.

922
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:15,265
I'm sure you'll all agree,

923
00:50:15,348 --> 00:50:18,393
but we need to find a simple path
to memorize with ease and not waste turns.

924
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:22,022
That's why I think
we should spend the first 30 to 40 seconds

925
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:24,232
to find 3 or 4 goals to start off with.

926
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:27,360
Then, we'll work on finding
a simple path to one.

927
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,946
If a path seems too difficult,
we'll move on to the next.

928
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:31,489
Here's what I think.

929
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:34,034
<i>There's a red wall to the left side</i>
<i>of the entrance, right?</i>

930
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:35,660
<i>But the right side is open.</i>

931
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:38,455
<i>So, let's set our path to the right</i>
<i>and look around until we meet a wall.</i>

932
00:50:38,538 --> 00:50:41,958
<i>While doing that,</i>
<i>we'll try to find a goal nearby.</i>

933
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:43,668
- I think that'd be easier.
- Basically,

934
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:45,628
you want us to find an easier path first

935
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:49,215
and then find a goal
that's located near it?

936
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,926
That's what I would do, too,
based on my intuition.

937
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,638
I'll take a look
at the three maps at a distance

938
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,932
and set my course
to where there are no obstacles.

939
00:50:58,016 --> 00:50:59,726
- To find nearby goals?
- Right.

940
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:02,103
And the red map here
has five horizontal lines.

941
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:04,856
I'd focus on the vertical lines
because there are only two.

942
00:51:04,939 --> 00:51:08,234
<i>Applying the same rule,</i>
<i>I'd check the blue horizontal lines.</i>

943
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:09,944
<i>There are only two of them, right?</i>

944
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:13,782
<i>So, if we overlap the red vertical</i>
<i>and the blue horizontal lines,</i>

945
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:15,158
<i>there aren't that many of them.</i>

946
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:17,535
<i>We can find the goal</i>
<i>pretty quickly by doing that.</i>

947
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:20,663
<i>Contestants using this strategy</i>
<i>will examine each map</i>

948
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:24,250
<i>to see where less lines were used</i>
<i>horizontally or vertically,</i>

949
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:27,462
<i>and make use of those lines</i>
<i>to quickly find a goal.</i>

950
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:31,758
<i>The red map in this example</i>
<i>has three cells with vertical lines.</i>

951
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:34,928
<i>By placing those cells</i>
<i>over the other maps,</i>

952
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:39,015
<i>locating Goal 4 can be done quite quickly.</i>

953
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:42,102
<i>We shouldn't even consider</i>
<i>memorizing the whole map.</i>

954
00:51:42,185 --> 00:51:46,439
Let's use parallel lines as our guide
since the goals are located between them.

955
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,608
<i>If you overlap the vertical lines together</i>

956
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:51,069
<i>while focusing on lines</i>
<i>parallel to each other,</i>

957
00:51:51,152 --> 00:51:52,737
<i>we'll be able to find them pretty quickly.</i>

958
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:57,659
<i>All goals will always be located</i>
<i>between two parallel lines.</i>

959
00:51:57,992 --> 00:52:02,747
<i>So, looking for parallel lines</i>
<i>after overlapping the three maps</i>

960
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:06,209
<i>will help you find the goals quickly.</i>

961
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:11,006
I'm telling you.
It'll be really easy to find them.

962
00:52:11,423 --> 00:52:12,549
F4 is the first goal.

963
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:14,092
You're right.

964
00:52:14,509 --> 00:52:17,679
- Who's playing in Round 1?
- I will if no one else wants to.

965
00:52:17,762 --> 00:52:19,764
<i>After the rules were explained,</i>

966
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:22,726
I thought this was my chance to shine.

967
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:26,688
I've always felt confident
with visual games like Ladder Assembly.

968
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:30,275
JUN-HYEONG STOOD OUT IN THE GAME
THAT REQUIRED GOOD SPATIAL AWARENESS

969
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:32,777
HE REACHED TIER 1
BY PLAYING LADDER ASSEMBLY

970
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:33,945
That is correct.

971
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:36,656
<i>This game seemed like</i>

972
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,576
something I could finish faster
than any other participant here.

973
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,578
I was so sure of it.

974
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:45,248
I remember thinking,
"There's no way anyone can beat me."

975
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:47,667
Can we put your name down
for Round 2, Gyu-min?

976
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:49,586
Sure, no problem.

977
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:53,256
At the end of the day, the rule required
the players to memorize the path

978
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,091
and not the whole layout of the maze.

979
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:56,885
So I thought it was doable.

980
00:52:57,427 --> 00:52:59,888
- I'll go crush them in Round 1.
- Go ahead.

981
00:52:59,971 --> 00:53:02,515
- I'll find 2 goals in just 2 turns.
- Go right ahead.

982
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:03,600
It will be a cakewalk.

983
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:07,479
I'd love to have a face-off with Gi-hyeon.

984
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:11,691
I think finding a goal
would only take 15 seconds at most.

985
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:15,320
If none of you are confident enough,
I'll play in Round 1.

986
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:18,198
Then, you can get the feel of the game
as I'm going through it.

987
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:21,242
<i>I felt pretty good</i>
<i>about my spatial intuition,</i>

988
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:24,746
and I thought I could do well
if I kept up with my memorization, too.

989
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:27,499
I'll go with 2 in F3.

990
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:32,045
GI-HYEON SECURED THE BENEFIT
IN BLIND SUDOKU WITHOUT A SINGLE MISTAKE

991
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:33,588
That is correct.

992
00:53:34,964 --> 00:53:38,176
I thought I should take Round 1.

993
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,429
- Can I take Round 1?
- Sure.

994
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:44,307
I have a feeling
that Round 1 would be the easiest.

995
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:45,642
So, I'll take Round 1.

996
00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:47,811
Then, you can practice
while watching me play

997
00:53:47,894 --> 00:53:50,689
so you can win Rounds 2 and 3
even if I end up losing Round 1.

998
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:52,941
You'll be allowed
to go again in Round 3, too.

999
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:56,194
<i>The time for the strategy meeting is up.</i>

1000
00:53:56,277 --> 00:54:01,032
<i>Contestants to play in Round 1,</i>
<i>please come to the Main Hall.</i>

1001
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:02,992
- Wish me luck.
- Go get them.

1002
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:05,745
Shall we huddle up
or just put our hands together?

1003
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:06,788
Just the hands.

1004
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:09,124
One, two, three.

1005
00:54:09,207 --> 00:54:10,834
- Let's go, Team KAIST!
- Let's go, Team KAIST!

1006
00:54:11,334 --> 00:54:12,377
Here I go.

1007
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:14,629
Wish me luck, you guys.

1008
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:16,339
- Let's do it.
- Put your hands on mine.

1009
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:17,507
Who are we?

1010
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,134
- Team SNU!
- Team SNU!

1011
00:54:19,217 --> 00:54:21,636
- We, SNU, will win!
- We, SNU, will win!

1012
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,847
- I'll be right back.
- Good luck.

1013
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,433
I'm counting on you. You've got this!

1014
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:38,445
<i>I went into the game,</i>
<i>thinking I had it in the bag.</i>

1015
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,865
His biggest strengths
are in memorization and spatial awareness.

1016
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:42,907
This was made for him.

1017
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:44,617
Tell me about it.

1018
00:54:46,703 --> 00:54:48,121
I've got this.

1019
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:52,208
I can do this.

1020
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,462
I can win.

1021
00:54:56,671 --> 00:55:01,468
Let us begin Three-layered Maze,
the first match of the finals.

1022
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:07,182
As the winner of the semifinal,
Team SNU will take the first turn.

1023
00:55:07,265 --> 00:55:08,224
TEAM SNU GOES FIRST

1024
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:13,146
You can now review the maps
for two minutes.

1025
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:16,524
Please turn around
and review the maps in front of you.

1026
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,126
That's way too difficult.

1027
00:55:35,543 --> 00:55:37,170
This can't be done in just one go.

1028
00:55:37,587 --> 00:55:39,297
This is such a difficult game.

1029
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:42,092
The goals are harder to find
compared to the example.

1030
00:55:42,175 --> 00:55:44,678
EXAMPLE QUESTION
QUESTION FOR ROUND 1

1031
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,180
ROUND 1'S MAZE IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX

1032
00:55:47,722 --> 00:55:51,142
- Do you think you can memorize them?
- No way. I can't do it.

1033
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:56,147
<i>I thought, "I think I've got this."</i>

1034
00:55:56,564 --> 00:56:00,068
<i>I only had to find a goal close by</i>
<i>and memorize a path leading to it.</i>

1035
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:03,113
<i>Two minutes seemed</i>
<i>like a generous time limit.</i>

1036
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:10,078
D6 is Goal 4.

1037
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:16,793
H7 is Goal 2.

1038
00:56:17,627 --> 00:56:20,547
- Yeah, that's right.
- But getting there will be tricky.

1039
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:24,092
I found a path there. Look.

1040
00:56:24,175 --> 00:56:27,429
It looks like they'll have
to move around a lot to get to Goal 5.

1041
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:31,349
You have 30 seconds left.

1042
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:42,819
The time for memorization is over.

1043
00:56:42,902 --> 00:56:45,655
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong,
please head into the maze.

1044
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:58,001
CORRECT MOVE: MAZE LIGHTS UP GREEN
WRONG MOVE: MAZE LIGHTS UP RED

1045
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:03,256
<i>I only had to travel 10 cells or so</i>
<i>to reach Goal 1.</i>

1046
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,801
<i>I actually had some time to spare</i>
<i>on my first turn.</i>

1047
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:11,348
TEAM SNU'S JUN-HYEONG
DOESN'T HESITATE TO CROSS THE MAZE

1048
00:57:12,682 --> 00:57:17,812
JUN-HYEONG'S CURRENT POSITION

1049
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:28,865
I've reached a goal!

1050
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:31,910
That's Goal 1.

1051
00:57:31,993 --> 00:57:35,955
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong
has reached his first goal.

1052
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,918
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I felt great about my chances.</i>

1053
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:41,670
<i>I just had to avoid making mistakes.</i>

1054
00:57:42,754 --> 00:57:45,215
<i>I didn't feel so stressed out</i>

1055
00:57:45,298 --> 00:57:47,717
<i>thanks to Gi-hyeon's analysis</i>
<i>during the strategy meeting.</i>

1056
00:57:48,885 --> 00:57:51,846
I hope I don't have a breakdown
during the time limit.

1057
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,348
We're going second, right?

1058
00:57:53,431 --> 00:57:55,433
- If Team SNU...
- What if they get it in one go?

1059
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:58,520
Then, we can just carry on
and assume that it's an easy maze.

1060
00:57:58,603 --> 00:57:59,646
If they don't,

1061
00:57:59,729 --> 00:58:01,690
- then just admit that it's hard.
- Right. Just relax.

1062
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:03,775
Yeah, I've got this.

1063
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:12,534
It seems like the goals with lower numbers
are easier to reach.

1064
00:58:12,617 --> 00:58:14,327
He got to the easiest one to find.

1065
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:17,956
Ji-seong will probably reach
the one Jun-hyeong just got to.

1066
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:22,335
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong
will now take his turn.

1067
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:39,102
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong,
please check the maps in front of you.

1068
00:58:50,613 --> 00:58:53,533
<i>It was easy to notice</i>
<i>the route to reach Goal 1.</i>

1069
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:57,746
<i>But since a mistake in Round 1</i>
<i>could ruin my team's whole flow,</i>

1070
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:00,373
<i>I concentrated on double-checking it.</i>

1071
00:59:00,915 --> 00:59:03,001
We should focus
on remembering the first one.

1072
00:59:03,084 --> 00:59:05,420
The rest will be easy if we just remember
the shapes of the routes.

1073
00:59:05,503 --> 00:59:07,339
You have 30 seconds left.

1074
00:59:11,092 --> 00:59:13,219
The time for memorization is over.

1075
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:15,847
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong,
please head into the maze.

1076
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:23,521
Please head to your right.

1077
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:26,316
THERE ARE NO GOALS TO THE RIGHT SIDE

1078
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,043
He's found it, too.

1079
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:47,921
I'm sure he'll get it right.

1080
00:59:49,422 --> 00:59:51,424
<i>I was hoping for Ji-seong</i>
<i>to make a mistake,</i>

1081
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:54,844
<i>but I knew he would catch up</i>
<i>because Goal 1 was so easy to find.</i>

1082
00:59:55,553 --> 00:59:56,680
I've reached a goal.

1083
00:59:56,763 --> 01:00:01,059
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong
has reached his first goal.

1084
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:03,895
<i>...has reached his first goal.</i>

1085
01:00:03,978 --> 01:00:05,689
<i>- Please return to your seat.</i>
- Great work.

1086
01:00:05,772 --> 01:00:08,358
TEAM KAIST: 1, TEAM SNU: 1

1087
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:12,362
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong
will now take his turn.

1088
01:00:15,907 --> 01:00:20,036
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong,
please review the maps in front of you.

1089
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:28,378
Once you find a goal,
memorizing its location will be easy.

1090
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:31,673
But finding and memorizing the route
within the time limit may be rough.

1091
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:36,428
<i>But Jun-hyeong can do it. I'm sure of it.</i>

1092
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:38,430
<i>He's a monster, you know.</i>

1093
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:43,309
The time for memorization is over.

1094
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:14,132
You've hit a dead end
and can't proceed further.

1095
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:15,967
<i>I thought, "I'm screwed."</i>

1096
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:19,596
<i>I had the route memorized</i>
<i>and knew where to take a turn.</i>

1097
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,891
<i>I had my eye on the cell</i>
<i>where I was supposed to take a turn,</i>

1098
01:01:22,974 --> 01:01:27,145
<i>but I got so caught up in it</i>
<i>that I missed taking the actual turn.</i>

1099
01:01:27,228 --> 01:01:28,855
<i>...and can't proceed further.</i>

1100
01:01:28,938 --> 01:01:30,148
He ran into a wall.

1101
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:31,858
Look, he made a mistake.

1102
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:34,778
You've hit a dead end
and can't proceed further.

1103
01:01:34,861 --> 01:01:36,363
Please return to your seat.

1104
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:41,159
<i>It was a golden opportunity</i>
<i>because I could win if I reached a goal.</i>

1105
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:45,622
TEAM KAIST'S JI-SEONG CAN WIN
IF HE REACHES A GOAL ON HIS TURN

1106
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,502
I can do this.

1107
01:01:50,585 --> 01:01:53,838
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong
will now take his turn.

1108
01:02:02,597 --> 01:02:04,891
I can do this.
I only need to find one goal.

1109
01:02:04,974 --> 01:02:09,396
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong,
please review the maps in front of you.

1110
01:02:27,163 --> 01:02:28,540
You have 30 seconds left.

1111
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:33,962
Taking on one goal per turn may be better.
Even Jun-hyeong made a mistake.

1112
01:02:34,045 --> 01:02:36,798
You might mess up while trying
to find multiple goals to get ahead.

1113
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:38,758
I mean, finding just one
is difficult enough.

1114
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:44,305
The time for memorization is over.

1115
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:47,809
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong,
please head into the maze.

1116
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:05,827
<i>I was absolutely terrified.</i>

1117
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,204
<i>If he won, I would be out right away.</i>

1118
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:40,445
Oh, heavens.

1119
01:03:42,238 --> 01:03:45,575
No, there's still a path he can take
to get to a goal.

1120
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:48,370
<i>- I think he's heading to D6.</i>
<i>- D6?</i>

1121
01:03:48,995 --> 01:03:51,081
He's only four cells away.

1122
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:54,334
You have five seconds left.

1123
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:06,388
Come on, Ji-seong.

1124
01:04:07,972 --> 01:04:11,267
<i>I was praying for him to fail</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

1125
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,105
You have five seconds left.

1126
01:04:18,983 --> 01:04:21,194
You've hit a dead end
and can't proceed further.

1127
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,199
He made a mistake.

1128
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:27,867
- Did he get the red lights?
- Yeah.

1129
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,787
<i>You've hit a dead end</i>
<i>and can't proceed further.</i>

1130
01:04:31,204 --> 01:04:32,539
He should've gone around.

1131
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:35,250
Instead of going straight,
he should've moved around.

1132
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:41,464
You've hit a dead end
and can't proceed further.

1133
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:43,550
Please return to your seat.

1134
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:48,763
Finding the goal
must be harder than I thought.

1135
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:50,015
- Yeah.
- It's not easy.

1136
01:04:50,598 --> 01:04:54,602
<i>It was such a shame</i>
<i>because I missed it by a single turn.</i>

1137
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:01,651
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong
will now take his turn.

1138
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:06,656
Please review the maps in front of you.

1139
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:19,169
Which one do you think he'll go for?

1140
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:22,047
I think he'll follow
the same route from earlier.

1141
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:24,841
<i>He'll probably check the wall</i>
<i>he ran into first.</i>

1142
01:05:24,924 --> 01:05:27,135
I think Jun-hyeong
will make a mistake again.

1143
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:34,142
<i>I tried to perfectly memorize</i>
<i>the tricky ones to avoid making mistakes.</i>

1144
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,898
The time for memorization is over.

1145
01:05:40,357 --> 01:05:43,109
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong,
please head into the maze.

1146
01:05:50,867 --> 01:05:54,913
<i>Ji-seong made a mistake as well,</i>
<i>so we were on the same number of turns.</i>

1147
01:06:10,178 --> 01:06:12,389
Finding the routes is tougher
than locating the goals.

1148
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:15,809
The problem is
that you have to keep the route memorized.

1149
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:19,229
<i>The main question was</i>
<i>how we would memorize the routes.</i>

1150
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:23,817
Let's try to remember them as shapes,
but it can still be confusing.

1151
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,486
It won't be easy
to memorize every single cell or turn.

1152
01:06:26,569 --> 01:06:29,072
We should remember the coordinates
for confusing turning points.

1153
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:30,865
Right. That would do the trick.

1154
01:06:31,282 --> 01:06:33,326
"Walk down Row I and turn at Column 8."

1155
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:35,286
"All right. I'll go to Row G now."

1156
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:37,789
"Then, I'll turn at Column 5."
Do you get it?

1157
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:40,166
Memorize it as a matrix.

1158
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,793
The first element would be Row I,

1159
01:06:41,876 --> 01:06:43,753
- the second one would be Column 9.
- Exactly.

1160
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,006
In short, I-9-G-8.

1161
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,090
SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE MEMORY AID

1162
01:06:47,507 --> 01:06:49,050
We're using matrices?

1163
01:06:49,551 --> 01:06:51,094
How could you come up with that?

1164
01:06:57,308 --> 01:06:59,519
He needs to take two steps forward.

1165
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,905
- I've reached a goal.
- Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong

1166
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:14,200
has reached his second goal.

1167
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:21,332
TEAM KAIST: 1, TEAM SNU: 2

1168
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:23,668
THE GAME CONTINUES IF BOTH PLAYERS
REACH THEIR SECOND GOAL IN THE SAME TURN

1169
01:07:24,085 --> 01:07:26,671
- It's okay. Ji-seong--
- I think he'll go for a goal above.

1170
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:28,923
I'm sure he'll remember the route there.

1171
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:32,218
- He would've been thinking about it.
- He almost got there earlier, so...

1172
01:07:32,635 --> 01:07:34,929
<i>He would've retraced his steps</i>
<i>during the break</i>

1173
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:37,349
<i>and realized which way he should've gone.</i>

1174
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:45,523
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong,
please review the maps in front of you.

1175
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:54,157
<i>My mind went blank</i>
<i>when Jun-hyeong succeeded in his turn.</i>

1176
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:59,621
<i>I could have ended it there.</i>

1177
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,916
I think he'll go for D6.

1178
01:08:04,834 --> 01:08:08,380
<i>I could finally think straight</i>
<i>after going over the maps carefully.</i>

1179
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:17,806
The time for memorization is over.

1180
01:08:17,889 --> 01:08:20,892
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong,
please head into the maze.

1181
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:28,400
Please get it wrong.

1182
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:30,193
I don't think he will.

1183
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:34,030
<i>It's just not likely,</i>
<i>considering how far he got earlier.</i>

1184
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:55,093
- He's doing well.
- He needs to go down.

1185
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:05,311
Didn't he make a wrong move?

1186
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:07,063
- No, there's a goal nearby.
- Yeah.

1187
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:08,898
<i>But why did he just go there?</i>

1188
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:11,818
<i>That's not the goal he went for earlier.</i>

1189
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:22,954
This is where things can get tricky.

1190
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:25,498
JI-SEONG TAKES AN UNEXPECTED ROUTE

1191
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:27,083
He got it wrong.

1192
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,377
But he's still getting the green light.

1193
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:35,383
RULE OF THREE-LAYERED MAZE
YOU CAN'T RETURN TO YOUR PREVIOUS POSITION

1194
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:37,218
You have five seconds left.

1195
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:45,685
WENT OVER THE 10-SECOND LIMIT
Your time is up.

1196
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:49,064
Your time is up.

1197
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:52,984
<i>Your time is up.</i>

1198
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:59,324
<i>I made a mistake</i>
<i>when I could have taken the win.</i>

1199
01:09:59,407 --> 01:10:01,159
<i>It was so disappointing.</i>

1200
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:06,331
That concludes Round 1
of Three-layered Maze.

1201
01:10:06,414 --> 01:10:08,500
Round 1 goes to Team SNU

1202
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:11,544
as Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong
reached two goals first.

1203
01:10:15,799 --> 01:10:20,637
<i>Both contestants,</i>
<i>please return to your base camps.</i>

1204
01:10:29,187 --> 01:10:31,064
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. You did great.

1205
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:33,775
- I found the second goal.
- It wasn't easy.

1206
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:36,903
I mean, we could tell that you did.

1207
01:10:36,986 --> 01:10:40,699
We could see you got confused by the end.
It was so close.

1208
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:44,077
It's way more difficult
than we thought it would be.

1209
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,329
Isn't it hard to actually do it,
even with the path memorized?

1210
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:48,289
Things do get confusing
when you're inside.

1211
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:51,918
At least we learned
that Yuk Jun-hyeong isn't so perfect.

1212
01:10:52,919 --> 01:10:55,630
Damn it! I'm so annoyed.

1213
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:00,176
I almost lost it when I made that mistake.

1214
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,012
Don't worry about that. You did great.

1215
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:04,889
- I knew you would do it.
- I think Team KAIST

1216
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:06,933
isn't so good
at working with visual clues.

1217
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:10,186
Gyu-min won't have trouble
memorizing the path,

1218
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:13,648
- but finding one might not be so easy.
- Right, that's his weak spot.

1219
01:11:14,107 --> 01:11:17,944
<i>I thought I'd be able to handle it</i>
<i>when I first learned the rules,</i>

1220
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:19,446
<i>but finding routes was tough.</i>

1221
01:11:19,529 --> 01:11:22,699
That's when I first felt uneasy
about my chances.

1222
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:23,992
How did you find the routes?

1223
01:11:24,409 --> 01:11:28,413
I checked all three maps for every step
and only confirmed a move when I was sure.

1224
01:11:28,496 --> 01:11:30,540
Were you able to do all that
in under two minutes?

1225
01:11:30,957 --> 01:11:33,293
For me, yes.
But I don't know how Gyu-min will do.

1226
01:11:36,129 --> 01:11:38,048
You just can't find all five goals.

1227
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:39,841
I think three goals are more than enough.

1228
01:11:40,342 --> 01:11:43,887
<i>It was a lot of pressure for me,</i>
<i>but I felt sure of my chances.</i>

1229
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:47,807
<i>So, I decided to play and win</i>
<i>both Rounds 2 and 3.</i>

1230
01:11:47,891 --> 01:11:50,894
<i>Contestants to play in Round 2,</i>
<i>please come to the Main Hall.</i>

1231
01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:53,146
- I'll see you later.
- Good luck.

1232
01:11:54,147 --> 01:11:56,691
- I feel terrible for you guys.
- What for?

1233
01:11:56,775 --> 01:11:58,109
Get ready. Who are we?

1234
01:11:58,193 --> 01:11:59,986
- Team SNU!
- Team SNU!

1235
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:02,155
- We, SNU, will win!
- We, SNU, will win!

1236
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:04,157
- Good luck.
- You've got this.

1237
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,909
Take it easy, okay?

1238
01:12:11,664 --> 01:12:13,166
Here comes a familiar face.

1239
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:16,002
So, it's Gi-hyeon against Gyu-min?

1240
01:12:16,461 --> 01:12:17,587
<i>This will be a big one.</i>

1241
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:19,339
<i>Round 2 will be intense.</i>

1242
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:21,257
THE LONG-AWAITED SHOWDOWN BETWEEN TWO ACES

1243
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:24,594
<i>I didn't get to compete</i>
<i>against Gyu-min in Blind Sudoku,</i>

1244
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:25,887
<i>the game I felt confident in,</i>

1245
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:28,431
<i>so I'd been waiting</i>
<i>for a chance to play against him.</i>

1246
01:12:28,932 --> 01:12:33,436
<i>I had a feeling that KAIST would put up</i>
<i>their best player, Gi-hyeon, in Round 2.</i>

1247
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,440
<i>As we were the last remaining contestants</i>
<i>in the first benefit match,</i>

1248
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:41,861
<i>he was the contestant I wanted to defeat</i>
<i>in a 1-on-1 match the most</i>

1249
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:44,364
<i>and the one I also feared to play against.</i>

1250
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:47,617
I'm worried that Gyu-min
would just memorize the whole maze.

1251
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:52,622
But spatial awareness
was always his weakness,

1252
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:53,957
so let's hope for the best.

1253
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,669
As the losing team of Round 1,
Team KAIST will take the first turn.

1254
01:12:58,086 --> 01:13:00,338
Please review the maps in front of you.

1255
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:19,232
This is definitely more difficult.

1256
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:23,236
Even Goal 1 seems pretty tough to find.

1257
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:25,321
Memorizing even one route won't be easy.

1258
01:13:26,406 --> 01:13:27,949
<i>Since this was a turn-based game,</i>

1259
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:30,410
<i>one mistake while going first was fatal.</i>

1260
01:13:30,493 --> 01:13:32,704
<i>That was what I had in mind</i>
<i>going into the game.</i>

1261
01:13:32,787 --> 01:13:34,914
<i>And because we were</i>
<i>evenly matched in skills,</i>

1262
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:38,960
<i>I assumed both of us</i>
<i>would reach a goal at every turn.</i>

1263
01:13:39,377 --> 01:13:43,173
<i>So, it seemed imperative that I find</i>
<i>at least one path to a goal in that turn</i>

1264
01:13:43,256 --> 01:13:45,383
<i>in order to win the game.</i>

1265
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,428
<i>Gi-hyeon showed</i>
<i>a stellar performance in Blind Sudoku,</i>

1266
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,680
<i>and since this game</i>
<i>was quite similar to it,</i>

1267
01:13:51,014 --> 01:13:52,891
<i>I thought defeating him</i>
<i>wouldn't be so easy.</i>

1268
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:04,277
Most goals have a wall at the bottom.

1269
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:05,612
I found Goal 1.

1270
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:08,156
But getting there seems pretty rough.

1271
01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:10,450
There's this one long winding path.

1272
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:13,370
You have 30 seconds left.

1273
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:20,627
The time for memorization is over.

1274
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:23,922
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please head into the maze.

1275
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:44,442
This is so difficult, even with the map.
How does anyone do this?

1276
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:02,460
Where is he going?
Did he memorize everything?

1277
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:04,421
He's doing so well.

1278
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,808
KAIST'S GI-HYEON FAILS

1279
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,313
You've hit a dead end
and can't proceed further.

1280
01:15:22,397 --> 01:15:24,024
Please return to your seat.

1281
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:30,488
He's made a mistake.

1282
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:31,781
<i>You've hit a dead end...</i>

1283
01:15:31,865 --> 01:15:33,199
He had to move up an extra cell.

1284
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:41,624
<i>I told myself to focus</i>
<i>since I couldn't afford any more mistakes.</i>

1285
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:45,587
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min
will now take his turn.

1286
01:15:48,423 --> 01:15:50,633
<i>I thought I'd still get one more turn.</i>

1287
01:15:50,717 --> 01:15:54,971
<i>Even if I failed after going second,</i>
<i>the scores would still be tied.</i>

1288
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:59,100
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min,
please review the maps in front of you.

1289
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:15,575
We can win
if Gyu-min can just memorize two paths.

1290
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:17,952
<i>And I bet he knows that, too.</i>

1291
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:27,420
You have one minute left.

1292
01:16:28,922 --> 01:16:30,465
F4 is the easiest to get to, right?

1293
01:16:31,257 --> 01:16:32,092
Yeah.

1294
01:16:32,175 --> 01:16:34,928
The ideal approach
would be to go for F4 first.

1295
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:39,307
The time for memorization is over.

1296
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:42,227
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min,
please head into the maze.

1297
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:02,789
Where is he headed?

1298
01:17:03,206 --> 01:17:04,374
- What?
- Where is he going?

1299
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:05,542
- That's a wrong move.
- Yeah.

1300
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:09,921
GYU-MIN WALKS PAST THE OPENING
THAT LEADS TO THE CLOSEST GOAL

1301
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:12,757
- No, there's still a viable path.
- I bet he knows where he's going.

1302
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:36,656
Let's just avoid making a mistake.

1303
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:50,045
Okay, things are going well.

1304
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:51,921
Just one step further.

1305
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:53,923
Damn. It's over.

1306
01:18:01,973 --> 01:18:03,224
Hang on.

1307
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:04,642
What the heck?

1308
01:18:05,894 --> 01:18:07,562
Why did he move up from D4?

1309
01:18:07,645 --> 01:18:10,565
<i>I think he has his eyes on B5.</i>

1310
01:18:10,982 --> 01:18:12,859
He must be insane.

1311
01:18:19,574 --> 01:18:20,950
<i>He's going for B5.</i>

1312
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:31,127
Okay, take the final step.

1313
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:33,380
Move downward, and he's done.

1314
01:18:35,715 --> 01:18:37,008
I've reached a goal.

1315
01:18:38,885 --> 01:18:40,178
I've reached a goal.

1316
01:18:43,973 --> 01:18:45,892
That was totally nuts!

1317
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:48,144
What did I just witness?

1318
01:18:49,312 --> 01:18:50,855
And that was the longest route.

1319
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:52,649
I'm so glad I got into SNU.

1320
01:18:52,732 --> 01:18:55,318
Otherwise, I would've had
to face him as an opponent.

1321
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,947
He went straight to B5 first.

1322
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:02,951
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min
has reached his first goal.

1323
01:19:03,993 --> 01:19:06,663
<i>As expected,</i>
<i>Gyu-min didn't make a mistake.</i>

1324
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:09,833
<i>While observing Jun-hyeong play,</i>

1325
01:19:09,916 --> 01:19:12,877
<i>I noticed that the route to Goal 1</i>
<i>was the easiest one,</i>

1326
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:16,464
and things got more tricky
for the goals with higher numbers.

1327
01:19:16,548 --> 01:19:18,842
Thinking this trend would hold in Round 2,

1328
01:19:18,925 --> 01:19:20,343
<i>I looked for Goal 1 first.</i>

1329
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:22,846
<i>I felt conflicted at first</i>
<i>about setting my course there</i>

1330
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:24,556
<i>because it was so far away.</i>

1331
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:26,725
<i>But I still thought</i>
<i>that I could find a route</i>

1332
01:19:26,808 --> 01:19:28,893
<i>and that I might not have enough time</i>

1333
01:19:29,352 --> 01:19:32,480
<i>if I were to try finding a different one</i>
<i>at that moment.</i>

1334
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:36,985
So, I took a gamble, hoping I would find
a route to Goal 1 in time.

1335
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:40,238
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon
will now take his turn.

1336
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:43,033
Please review the maps in front of you.

1337
01:19:49,914 --> 01:19:53,877
<i>I told myself to forget about</i>
<i>my last attempt and focus on the present.</i>

1338
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:56,963
You have 30 seconds left.

1339
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:06,806
The time for memorization is over.

1340
01:20:08,058 --> 01:20:10,769
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please head into the maze.

1341
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:21,863
Will he go to F4?

1342
01:20:34,959 --> 01:20:36,544
I've reached a goal.

1343
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:41,007
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon
has reached his first goal.

1344
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:48,056
That was the easiest route.

1345
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:50,141
This could backfire on us

1346
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:55,897
because Gyu-min would now know
there's a goal he can reach quickly.

1347
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,816
We'll win if Gyu-min can get to F4.

1348
01:20:57,899 --> 01:21:01,236
Gyu-min would've noticed
how fast Gi-hyeon reached a goal.

1349
01:21:01,319 --> 01:21:02,821
He'll know that there's one close by.

1350
01:21:03,571 --> 01:21:06,491
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min
will now take his turn.

1351
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:09,077
Please review the maps in front of you.

1352
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,746
THE GAME WILL END
IF GYU-MIN REACHES A GOAL

1353
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:15,291
I need to go on to Round 3.

1354
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:26,428
<i>Up until that point,</i>
<i>I'd never been flustered during a game.</i>

1355
01:21:26,511 --> 01:21:30,807
<i>This was the first time that I did,</i>
<i>and I was in a panic.</i>

1356
01:21:35,645 --> 01:21:38,606
<i>I actually had some trouble</i>
<i>finding the route on my first turn.</i>

1357
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:39,983
<i>I also ran into many dead ends.</i>

1358
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,862
<i>But then I realized</i>
<i>that the goals I had to find</i>

1359
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:46,823
<i>were all dead ends,</i>
<i>surrounded by three walls.</i>

1360
01:21:46,906 --> 01:21:47,824
<i>Then it hit me.</i>

1361
01:21:47,907 --> 01:21:49,909
Rather than seeking
a path leading to a goal,

1362
01:21:49,993 --> 01:21:52,871
I should just follow an open path
and turn to a dead end.

1363
01:21:52,954 --> 01:21:55,707
<i>I decided to use that strategy</i>
<i>on my second turn.</i>

1364
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:58,293
The time for memorization is over.

1365
01:21:58,376 --> 01:22:01,004
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min,
please head into the maze.

1366
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:06,676
Even Gyu-min would mess up at least once.

1367
01:22:22,984 --> 01:22:23,818
It's over.

1368
01:22:23,902 --> 01:22:27,405
GOAL 2 CAN BE REACHED IN JUST 6 MOVES

1369
01:22:36,247 --> 01:22:39,751
I mean, he can still reach a goal
by going that way, but...

1370
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:42,253
- What?
- He went that way.

1371
01:22:51,971 --> 01:22:53,765
<i>Where is he headed?</i>

1372
01:22:58,478 --> 01:22:59,938
Surely, he can't be...

1373
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:02,524
- He wouldn't go there if he wasn't sure.
- No way.

1374
01:23:02,607 --> 01:23:05,193
<i>- Will he reach the goal from earlier--</i>
<i>- He's going to B7.</i>

1375
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,862
<i>He's headed to B7 or D4.</i>

1376
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:21,251
He found the two longest routes.

1377
01:23:21,584 --> 01:23:24,796
<i>- Does he just need to go straight?</i>
<i>- Yeah, one more step, and he's there.</i>

1378
01:23:32,053 --> 01:23:33,555
Please.

1379
01:23:37,517 --> 01:23:39,185
I've reached a goal.

1380
01:23:43,356 --> 01:23:44,983
I've reached a goal.

1381
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:49,487
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min
has reached his second goal.

1382
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:55,785
I can't believe this!

1383
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:00,915
He just brushed off the easiest path.

1384
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:03,793
- I think I'm crushing on him.
- That was sick.

1385
01:24:03,877 --> 01:24:05,879
<i>He really is amazing.</i>

1386
01:24:06,254 --> 01:24:07,881
Gyu-min the Great strikes again.

1387
01:24:07,964 --> 01:24:11,009
<i>All I could think of was</i>
<i>how grateful I was to him.</i>

1388
01:24:11,259 --> 01:24:12,385
Oh, dear.

1389
01:24:13,803 --> 01:24:15,680
He doesn't mess up, does he?

1390
01:24:16,389 --> 01:24:18,266
It's such a shame
we didn't even get a chance.

1391
01:24:24,981 --> 01:24:26,858
Their second-best lost to our second-best,

1392
01:24:26,941 --> 01:24:29,235
- and their best lost to our best.
- That's true.

1393
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:32,238
Meet us in a 1-on-1, and you're toast.

1394
01:24:33,698 --> 01:24:39,329
<i>That concludes Three-layered Maze,</i>
<i>the first match of the finals.</i>

1395
01:24:39,829 --> 01:24:43,458
<i>The game goes to Team SNU.</i>

1396
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,004
<i>I remember thinking</i>
<i>that only one final hurdle was in our way.</i>

1397
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:50,965
<i>We were on the brink of winning.</i>

1398
01:24:51,049 --> 01:24:52,884
<i>I thought that given our history,</i>

1399
01:24:52,967 --> 01:24:55,303
<i>we could still come from behind</i>
<i>to defeat Team SNU 2 to 1.</i>

1400
01:24:55,387 --> 01:24:57,347
<i>And I was determined to see it done.</i>

1401
01:24:57,764 --> 01:25:00,850
- Let's just win the next two games.
- It's really the Deathmatch now.

1402
01:25:01,309 --> 01:25:03,395
Let's win the second one
as if our lives depended on it.

1403
01:25:04,688 --> 01:25:06,022
Gyu-min the Great!

1404
01:25:06,106 --> 01:25:07,482
Good job. How many goals did you find?

1405
01:25:07,565 --> 01:25:08,650
- Two.
- Two? Great job.

1406
01:25:08,733 --> 01:25:10,402
The second goal just came to me

1407
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:12,821
while I was waiting
after I took my first turn.

1408
01:25:12,904 --> 01:25:15,532
- The second goal came to you?
- While you were waiting?

1409
01:25:15,615 --> 01:25:18,618
I realized the routes I discarded
must've had goals in their ends.

1410
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:21,871
After that, I decided
to look for an open path

1411
01:25:21,955 --> 01:25:24,666
instead of trying
to find a path to a specific goal.

1412
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:26,710
His mind works on a whole new plane.

1413
01:25:26,793 --> 01:25:29,879
Great work, Gyu-min.
Let's keep it up for the remaining games.

1414
01:25:30,422 --> 01:25:32,007
- Thanks, Gyu-min.
- Seriously.

1415
01:25:32,966 --> 01:25:34,467
Come on, you did great.

1416
01:25:34,551 --> 01:25:35,427
Good work.

1417
01:25:37,095 --> 01:25:37,929
It's okay.

1418
01:25:38,596 --> 01:25:39,597
I got so flustered.

1419
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:43,935
It's all good. And if you think about it,
now that the 1-on-1 matches are over,

1420
01:25:44,019 --> 01:25:47,272
the remaining matches
will have us work as a team or in pairs.

1421
01:25:47,355 --> 01:25:48,523
We have the upper hand, then.

1422
01:25:48,606 --> 01:25:52,193
The basic requirement hasn't changed.
We still need two wins first to beat them.

1423
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,654
Let's play the next match,
aiming for 2 to 0 wins.

1424
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:57,490
We'll go into the next game
with the same mindset as we did earlier.

1425
01:25:57,824 --> 01:25:58,908
FINALS

1426
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:02,287
TEAM SNU: 1, TEAM KAIST: 0

1427
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:09,544
<i>We aimed to have a clean sweep</i>
<i>of two consecutive wins.</i>

1428
01:26:09,627 --> 01:26:12,630
<i>We wanted people to know</i>
<i>that Team SNU doesn't play Round 3 games.</i>

1429
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:18,219
<i>We were so determined</i>
<i>to put Team KAIST at the top.</i>

1430
01:26:18,303 --> 01:26:21,931
<i>I was determined to take Round 2</i>
<i>and take this on to Round 3.</i>

1431
01:26:22,682 --> 01:26:24,601
<i>The second match of the finals...</i>

1432
01:26:24,684 --> 01:26:26,186
They're telling us that right away?

1433
01:26:28,855 --> 01:26:30,815
<i>...is Formula Territory Control.</i>

1434
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:35,028
It'll be calculation
and spatial awareness.

1435
01:26:36,988 --> 01:26:40,325
<i>It seemed like a game</i>
<i>catered to my team's strength.</i>

1436
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:42,285
<i>In Formula Territory Control,</i>

1437
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:46,915
<i>you will work with numbers from 1 to 6</i>
<i>and the given operation symbols.</i>

1438
01:26:46,998 --> 01:26:50,752
<i>Your task is to create formulas</i>
<i>that result in target numbers</i>

1439
01:26:50,835 --> 01:26:53,880
TARGET NUMBER: 263
<i>that can be found on the 13-by-13 board.</i>

1440
01:26:53,963 --> 01:26:57,967
<i>The team with control over more territory</i>
<i>will be declared the winner.</i>

1441
01:27:01,096 --> 01:27:06,184
<i>The numbers ranging from 1 to 6</i>
<i>can each be used twice at most.</i>

1442
01:27:06,267 --> 01:27:09,604
<i>The operator symbols, on the other hand,</i>
<i>can be used without limit.</i>

1443
01:27:09,688 --> 01:27:11,272
Great, there's no limit.

1444
01:27:11,856 --> 01:27:13,817
<i>Forming a number of two digits or more</i>

1445
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:17,779
<i>by placing the numbers side by side</i>
<i>is prohibited.</i>

1446
01:27:18,905 --> 01:27:22,283
<i>The following are</i>
<i>the requirements for target numbers.</i>

1447
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:24,119
<i>First, a target number must have</i>

1448
01:27:24,202 --> 01:27:27,455
<i>three digits or more</i>
<i>displayed in a straight line.</i>

1449
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:31,251
<i>Additionally, it must be read</i>
<i>from left to right or from top to bottom.</i>

1450
01:27:31,918 --> 01:27:36,006
<i>For example, the target number</i>
<i>in the violet cells is 239.</i>

1451
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:39,009
<i>It cannot be read as 932.</i>

1452
01:27:39,884 --> 01:27:44,431
<i>Second, either the beginning</i>
<i>or the end of any target numbers</i>

1453
01:27:44,514 --> 01:27:46,349
<i>must lie within your own territory.</i>

1454
01:27:46,933 --> 01:27:50,270
<i>Third, you can't form target numbers</i>
<i>that pass through obstacles</i>

1455
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:52,856
<i>or your opponent's territory.</i>

1456
01:27:53,565 --> 01:27:57,027
<i>Each cell you secure counts as one point,</i>

1457
01:27:57,110 --> 01:28:01,156
<i>and the team that wins 50 points or more</i>
<i>will be declared the winner.</i>

1458
01:28:02,782 --> 01:28:04,451
This is a team game.

1459
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:07,746
<i>I thought my team was equally good</i>
<i>as Team KAIST in team games.</i>

1460
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:11,624
<i>Given that this involved calculations,</i>
<i>the odds of our winning were higher.</i>

1461
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:14,336
<i>Formulas and calculations</i>
<i>were something we felt confident in.</i>

1462
01:28:14,753 --> 01:28:17,088
<i>I thought we could win</i>
<i>as long as we could stay composed.</i>

1463
01:28:17,547 --> 01:28:19,257
<i>Both teams,</i>
<i>please return to your base camps</i>

1464
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:21,384
<i>and start discussing your strategies.</i>

1465
01:28:21,593 --> 01:28:23,720
It's basically the same
as last season's Formula Archery.

1466
01:28:23,803 --> 01:28:27,640
Exactly, but they added
a strategic element of territory control.

1467
01:28:27,974 --> 01:28:30,727
I don't have
any strategies prepared yet...

1468
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:32,687
- Let me handle it.
- By all means.

1469
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:34,856
What ideas have you got?

1470
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:37,567
The game will end within 15 turns at most.

1471
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:40,111
If both teams keep going
for a 4-digit or 5-digit number?

1472
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:41,863
Yes. I'm sure it'll end in 15 turns.

1473
01:28:41,946 --> 01:28:43,114
FIRST 50 OR MORE POINTS WINS

1474
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:45,909
It'll all boil down to making formulas
for 15 five-digit target numbers.

1475
01:28:45,992 --> 01:28:47,660
I think three-digit numbers

1476
01:28:47,744 --> 01:28:49,954
- should only be used as a last resort.
- Of course.

1477
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:53,041
And if it came to that,
winging it on the spot would be better.

1478
01:28:53,124 --> 01:28:53,958
You're right.

1479
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:58,213
The game wasn't so different from the game
I played with license plates.

1480
01:28:58,713 --> 01:29:01,299
<i>I've made formulas</i>
<i>resulting in the two-digit number</i>

1481
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:04,427
<i>using the numbers</i>
<i>of the four-digit number enough times.</i>

1482
01:29:04,511 --> 01:29:09,182
So, I felt confident in my ability
to arrange numbers to create formulas.

1483
01:29:09,599 --> 01:29:12,435
Jun-hyeong is a wizard
when it comes to arranging numbers,

1484
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:14,062
so I thought this was his big moment.

1485
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:17,190
Let's say we have to make a formula
that results in 25,614.

1486
01:29:17,482 --> 01:29:20,235
For example, rather than taking
a five-digit number as a whole,

1487
01:29:20,318 --> 01:29:23,613
breaking it down to 2 or 3 digits
makes it easier to deal with.

1488
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:28,493
<i>Crafting a formula that results in 25,614</i>
<i>with one formula won't be easy,</i>

1489
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:31,871
<i>but breaking it down to 256 and 14</i>

1490
01:29:31,955 --> 01:29:35,458
<i>makes it easier to find the final value.</i>

1491
01:29:37,293 --> 01:29:39,587
It will come down to which team
manages to find more numbers.

1492
01:29:39,671 --> 01:29:40,630
Exactly.

1493
01:29:40,714 --> 01:29:43,967
It will be a huge win for us if we can get
a six-digit target number from the get-go.

1494
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:45,427
<i>If we can, that is.</i>

1495
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:47,971
<i>Six digits on our first turn?</i>

1496
01:29:48,054 --> 01:29:49,848
A BIGGER TARGET NUMBER
CAN GAIN CONTROL OVER MORE CELLS

1497
01:29:49,931 --> 01:29:52,809
I seriously think
we could get a six-digit number.

1498
01:29:54,352 --> 01:29:55,729
Here's what I think.

1499
01:29:56,688 --> 01:30:00,025
In a worst-case scenario,
three-digit numbers...

1500
01:30:00,108 --> 01:30:03,653
We can get 3 digits in under 30 seconds.
Don't worry about them.

1501
01:30:03,737 --> 01:30:05,488
Just think about squared numbers.

1502
01:30:05,572 --> 01:30:07,282
Many reach 100 digits

1503
01:30:07,365 --> 01:30:08,950
- or even 200 digits easily.
- That is true,

1504
01:30:09,034 --> 01:30:11,536
but we have to present our formula
both verbally and in print.

1505
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:13,163
What if we run out of time?

1506
01:30:13,663 --> 01:30:14,956
The way I see it,

1507
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:18,418
we might end up losing on the spot
with a four-digit target number or less.

1508
01:30:20,253 --> 01:30:23,006
<i>The finals would end if we lost Round 2.</i>

1509
01:30:23,089 --> 01:30:25,675
<i>That was why we had</i>
<i>such a heated discussion.</i>

1510
01:30:26,426 --> 01:30:28,261
If we find a viable five-digit number,
we'll go for it.

1511
01:30:28,345 --> 01:30:30,805
If we spot a usable four-digit number,
let's say so and work on it.

1512
01:30:30,889 --> 01:30:32,599
So, one person
works on four-digit numbers?

1513
01:30:32,682 --> 01:30:35,393
At least 2 people
should work on 4-digit numbers.

1514
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:38,980
But why should we waste our resources
in getting four-digit numbers?

1515
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:40,982
I doubt they would even use
a four-digit number.

1516
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:44,277
But it's unrealistic to expect them
to use a five-digit number at every turn.

1517
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,196
I think that view is more unrealistic.

1518
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:48,531
I'll be shocked
if they ever use a four-digit number.

1519
01:30:48,615 --> 01:30:52,202
If we're so sure that they would only use
five-digit ones, we should do the same.

1520
01:30:52,285 --> 01:30:56,164
And we will, but we need someone to work
on a four-digit one as a safeguard.

1521
01:30:56,247 --> 01:30:58,541
I think our main goal
should be five-digit ones.

1522
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:00,877
If too many people work
on finding four-digit ones,

1523
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,381
we'll end up using them more than others.
Then, we're sure to lose.

1524
01:31:04,923 --> 01:31:07,258
<i>It was likely that Team SNU would do well,</i>

1525
01:31:07,342 --> 01:31:09,386
so I felt convinced that we would lose

1526
01:31:09,469 --> 01:31:11,680
if we used target numbers
of four digits or less.

1527
01:31:11,763 --> 01:31:14,307
Here's another idea.
I'm not great with big numbers,

1528
01:31:14,391 --> 01:31:17,060
so why don't I make formulas
of four-digit ones quickly and join you?

1529
01:31:17,143 --> 01:31:20,730
- If that gets out of hand, tell us.
- I will.

1530
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:24,234
So, how are we assigning roles again?

1531
01:31:24,317 --> 01:31:26,319
- I'll work on four-digit numbers.
- As a safeguard.

1532
01:31:26,403 --> 01:31:29,239
We will try to find five-digit numbers
we could work with

1533
01:31:29,322 --> 01:31:34,327
or seven-digit ones if any stand out.
Then, we'll try to find a path toward it.

1534
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,329
Do you think you two
could handle five-digit numbers?

1535
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:38,456
If we can claim six cells from the start,

1536
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,501
it'll give us more options
in the next turn, and it'll be easier.

1537
01:31:41,584 --> 01:31:44,087
Okay, it'd be nice to have you
work on six-digit numbers.

1538
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:45,255
ASSIGNING INDIVIDUAL ROLES

1539
01:31:45,338 --> 01:31:48,091
If you need a power of 2, for example,
don't get fixated on 2.

1540
01:31:48,174 --> 01:31:49,759
Remember that 2 to the power of 10

1541
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:51,886
is interchangeable
with 4 to the power of 5.

1542
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:54,222
Here's an idea
for multiplying three numbers.

1543
01:31:54,305 --> 01:31:56,474
For instance,
instead of 6 times 5 times 4,

1544
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:59,310
we can use the factorial of 6 divided
by the factorial of 3 to spare numbers.

1545
01:31:59,394 --> 01:32:00,729
That's a great catch.

1546
01:32:00,812 --> 01:32:03,189
Don't forget that factorials
are superior to exponentiation.

1547
01:32:03,273 --> 01:32:06,693
Factorials only require a single symbol,
but exponentiation needs an extra number.

1548
01:32:06,776 --> 01:32:09,654
BY EMPLOYING FACTORIALS MORE,
TEAM KAIST AIMS TO USE LESS NUMBERS

1549
01:32:09,738 --> 01:32:11,614
The most important rule of this game is...

1550
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:14,034
- We can use two sets of numbers.
- That's right.

1551
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:16,870
We shouldn't mistakenly use
the same number three times.

1552
01:32:16,953 --> 01:32:18,997
- If we need an extra two,
- Okay.

1553
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,540
we can use
the square root of four instead.

1554
01:32:20,623 --> 01:32:22,167
Yeah, they are interchangeable.

1555
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:24,502
We can use the factorial of 3
instead of 6.

1556
01:32:24,919 --> 01:32:30,675
<i>Numbers from 1 to 6 can only be used twice</i>
<i>in Formula Territory Control.</i>

1557
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:34,137
<i>If a formula uses the same number</i>
<i>three times like the one on screen,</i>

1558
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:36,514
<i>the formula will be counted as incorrect.</i>

1559
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:40,185
<i>But if the overused numbers</i>
<i>are replaced using operator symbols,</i>

1560
01:32:40,268 --> 01:32:42,604
<i>the formula will be counted as correct.</i>

1561
01:32:42,687 --> 01:32:44,564
TARGET NUMBER 112
CORRECT

1562
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,317
What else should we prepare?

1563
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,653
- We have the power table ready.
- Has anyone drawn up a factorial table?

1564
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:52,655
I have, up to the factorial of 12.

1565
01:32:53,073 --> 01:32:56,659
We prepared a power table
and a factorial table for the game

1566
01:32:57,077 --> 01:33:00,663
because we would need those
to create large numbers.

1567
01:33:01,122 --> 01:33:02,791
They were the aces up our sleeves.

1568
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:05,627
Fifties squared are easy to memorize.

1569
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:07,545
I think I can memorize up to 60 squared.

1570
01:33:08,338 --> 01:33:11,049
What is he even saying?

1571
01:33:11,132 --> 01:33:12,676
I can't believe my ears.

1572
01:33:12,759 --> 01:33:14,386
Gyu-min really is on another level.

1573
01:33:14,469 --> 01:33:17,347
Look. 50 plus n squared
is surprisingly easy to memorize.

1574
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:20,141
I have almost up to 60 squared memorized.

1575
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:21,643
What is 42 squared?

1576
01:33:21,726 --> 01:33:22,977
That's 1,764.

1577
01:33:23,061 --> 01:33:24,145
- What?
- He's right.

1578
01:33:26,189 --> 01:33:29,025
I already had up to 45 squared memorized.

1579
01:33:29,109 --> 01:33:30,944
I only need to memorize
46 squared and 47 squared

1580
01:33:31,027 --> 01:33:33,822
since I'm already used to the fact
that 48 squared is 2,304

1581
01:33:33,905 --> 01:33:36,449
- and that 49 squared is...
- That's 2,401.

1582
01:33:37,117 --> 01:33:39,327
How did you get used to that fact
in the first place?

1583
01:33:39,411 --> 01:33:42,497
- It sort of is everywhere.
- Yeah, and you get to learn it.

1584
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:44,249
You two are just weird.

1585
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:47,669
<i>You have one minute left</i>
<i>to discuss your strategy.</i>

1586
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:50,213
I'll crunch 10 calculations
within 2 minutes.

1587
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:52,340
- You can just copy my formulas.
- Okay.

1588
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:55,385
I'm so psyched to show my skills at last.

1589
01:33:56,886 --> 01:33:59,806
It turns out the other Jun-hyeong
had been waiting for his moment.

1590
01:33:59,889 --> 01:34:02,058
He kept saying
he would prove himself this time.

1591
01:34:02,767 --> 01:34:05,395
<i>I found his tenacity admirable.</i>

1592
01:34:06,187 --> 01:34:08,189
<i>The time for the strategy meeting is up.</i>

1593
01:34:09,733 --> 01:34:10,984
I really want to win.

1594
01:34:11,234 --> 01:34:13,028
- I so badly want that for us.
- Right?

1595
01:34:13,445 --> 01:34:15,071
We have to end it now.

1596
01:34:15,155 --> 01:34:17,657
We can win. We really can do it.

1597
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:19,492
Let's win Round 2, no matter what.

1598
01:34:35,342 --> 01:34:37,385
<i>Since we were faced</i>
<i>with a formidable team,</i>

1599
01:34:37,469 --> 01:34:39,554
<i>I reminded myself</i>
<i>not to let my guard down.</i>

1600
01:34:39,637 --> 01:34:41,348
<i>We were in the finals, after all.</i>

1601
01:34:41,806 --> 01:34:44,225
<i>As long as we didn't make any mistakes,</i>

1602
01:34:44,309 --> 01:34:47,645
<i>our dreams of winning</i>
<i>could actually come true.</i>

1603
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:52,025
<i>I liked our chances with this game.</i>

1604
01:34:52,817 --> 01:34:55,820
<i>I was determined to win</i>
<i>Formula Territory Control at all costs.</i>

1605
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,992
Let us begin Formula Territory Control,
the second match of the finals.

1606
01:35:01,076 --> 01:35:04,287
As the losing team of Three-layered Maze,

1607
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:06,873
Team KAIST will decide
which team will make the first move.

1608
01:35:06,956 --> 01:35:08,500
<i>If you choose to go first,</i>

1609
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:10,877
<i>your starting point</i>
<i>will be the upper-left corner.</i>

1610
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,253
<i>If you choose to go second,</i>

1611
01:35:12,337 --> 01:35:14,964
<i>your starting point</i>
<i>will be the lower-right corner.</i>

1612
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:19,177
TEAM KAIST CHOOSES TO GO FIRST
We'll go first.

1613
01:35:19,761 --> 01:35:23,348
<i>My team could run numbers quickly</i>
<i>and knew a variety of calculations.</i>

1614
01:35:23,431 --> 01:35:25,892
And with the added bonus of going first,

1615
01:35:25,975 --> 01:35:29,229
I thought we could shape
the course of the game to our advantage.

1616
01:35:30,021 --> 01:35:32,107
Team KAIST will go first,

1617
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:34,442
and Team SNU will go second.

1618
01:35:34,526 --> 01:35:37,821
Team SNU, please turn around.

1619
01:35:37,904 --> 01:35:41,241
THE TEAM TO GO SECOND
CAN'T SEE THE OTHER TEAM'S FIRST MOVE

1620
01:35:45,328 --> 01:35:47,580
Not being able to see the board
is making me nervous.

1621
01:35:50,458 --> 01:35:53,044
We will now begin
Formula Territory Control.

1622
01:35:54,838 --> 01:35:55,755
<i>Here's your board.</i>

1623
01:35:55,839 --> 01:35:59,050
TEAM KAIST'S STARTING POINT

1624
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:02,470
Team KAIST, please find a target number

1625
01:36:02,554 --> 01:36:05,223
and complete its formula
within two minutes.

1626
01:36:06,766 --> 01:36:08,143
We have to move down.

1627
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:10,687
- Find a number in the column.
- Okay.

1628
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:13,690
AIMS TO FIND A TARGET NUMBER
THAT EXPANDS THEIR TERRITORY DOWNWARD

1629
01:36:17,569 --> 01:36:18,737
Guys.

1630
01:36:19,195 --> 01:36:20,739
I have a formula for a five-digit number.

1631
01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:21,698
Look.

1632
01:36:22,198 --> 01:36:25,702
Help me with this. What do I use
other than 2 to the power of 4?

1633
01:36:25,785 --> 01:36:27,162
ONLY NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 6 CAN BE USED

1634
01:36:27,245 --> 01:36:28,580
- You have one minute left.
- Well...

1635
01:36:28,997 --> 01:36:30,707
Do you want to use mine instead?

1636
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:31,916
TARGET NUMBER: 6,524

1637
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,209
You want me to use this?

1638
01:36:34,794 --> 01:36:35,837
I'll write that down, then.

1639
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,213
Can you work on this for now?

1640
01:36:38,131 --> 01:36:39,382
You have 30 seconds left.

1641
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:41,384
TEAM KAIST WRITES DOWN
THE 4-DIGIT TARGET NUMBER FIRST

1642
01:36:41,468 --> 01:36:43,094
That's 6,524.

1643
01:36:44,054 --> 01:36:47,015
- Come on, help me complete this.
- You have ten seconds left.

1644
01:36:47,807 --> 01:36:49,351
- Call our target number.
- Go on!

1645
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:51,895
Our target number is 6,524.
The formula is 3 times 3 squared

1646
01:36:51,978 --> 01:36:54,856
to the power of the square root of 4
minus 6 squared minus 1.

1647
01:36:55,607 --> 01:36:57,609
Team KAIST, that is correct.

1648
01:36:57,692 --> 01:36:59,194
TARGET NUMBER: 6,524

1649
01:36:59,277 --> 01:37:01,696
They kicked things off
with a four-digit number.

1650
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:03,782
- Seventeen...
- We could've called this instead.

1651
01:37:03,865 --> 01:37:06,284
- That's 286...
- Look, this is it.

1652
01:37:06,868 --> 01:37:09,871
It was just the first turn.
Don't be overly anxious from the start.

1653
01:37:09,954 --> 01:37:12,290
TEAM KAIST STARTS OFF
WITH A 4-DIGIT TARGET NUMBER

1654
01:37:12,374 --> 01:37:15,502
Team SNU, please turn around.

1655
01:37:19,381 --> 01:37:22,050
Team SNU, please find a target number

1656
01:37:22,133 --> 01:37:24,552
and complete its formula
within two minutes.

1657
01:37:25,512 --> 01:37:28,306
<i>We had decided not to even consider</i>
<i>anything lower than a five-digit number.</i>

1658
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:31,893
TEAM SNU IS ON THE HUNT
FOR 5-DIGIT TARGET NUMBERS

1659
01:37:34,854 --> 01:37:37,357
- What are we looking at?
- A formula for 64,126. Check it.

1660
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:41,361
TEAM SNU COMPLETED A FORMULA
FOR A 5-DIGIT TARGET NUMBER

1661
01:37:41,945 --> 01:37:44,572
- Run the numbers for us.
- Check how many times a number was used.

1662
01:37:44,656 --> 01:37:46,741
- Two 2s, two 3s, and two 4s.
- Right, we're good.

1663
01:37:47,659 --> 01:37:51,663
Our target number is 64,126.

1664
01:37:51,746 --> 01:37:55,792
Its formula is the cube of 5 times 2 cubed

1665
01:37:55,875 --> 01:38:00,755
plus 4 to the power of 4 over 2
minus 1 minus 1.

1666
01:38:00,839 --> 01:38:03,633
TARGET NUMBER 64,126

1667
01:38:04,592 --> 01:38:06,428
Team SNU, that is correct.

1668
01:38:07,971 --> 01:38:09,139
Damn it.

1669
01:38:09,931 --> 01:38:12,767
Team SNU's accumulated score is 5 points.

1670
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:13,685
SNU: 5, KAIST: 4

1671
01:38:23,778 --> 01:38:26,156
I have a formula for 41,268.

1672
01:38:26,948 --> 01:38:28,241
How did you get it?

1673
01:38:29,325 --> 01:38:30,785
Yours is almost the same as mine.

1674
01:38:30,869 --> 01:38:33,038
Double-check the numbers.
I'll write it down.

1675
01:38:34,831 --> 01:38:36,416
I think it's right.

1676
01:38:36,499 --> 01:38:39,252
Our target number is 41,268.

1677
01:38:39,336 --> 01:38:43,006
Its formula is the factorial of 8
plus 4 to the power of 5

1678
01:38:43,089 --> 01:38:45,508
minus the factorial of 4 times 3
minus 2 times 2.

1679
01:38:46,551 --> 01:38:48,470
Team KAIST, that is incorrect.

1680
01:38:49,012 --> 01:38:50,013
What?

1681
01:38:50,722 --> 01:38:52,766
What? How come?

1682
01:38:53,183 --> 01:38:55,060
You can't use the number eight.

1683
01:38:55,143 --> 01:38:58,396
NUMBERS RANGING FROM 1 TO 6
CAN ONLY BE USED TWICE EACH

1684
01:39:02,108 --> 01:39:04,736
I'm so sorry, guys.

1685
01:39:04,819 --> 01:39:06,821
We should be the ones apologizing
for not catching that.

1686
01:39:07,364 --> 01:39:08,782
Damn it.

1687
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:14,788
<i>I kept making mistakes</i>
<i>starting from Round 1,</i>

1688
01:39:14,871 --> 01:39:17,165
<i>so I felt terrible for my teammates.</i>

1689
01:39:17,248 --> 01:39:19,668
Gi-hyeon was the one
who used eight in that formula,

1690
01:39:19,751 --> 01:39:22,087
but I was also at fault
because I missed that

1691
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:23,672
<i>while writing down his formula.</i>

1692
01:39:24,255 --> 01:39:26,716
<i>Blaming him for that</i>
<i>hadn't even crossed my mind.</i>

1693
01:39:27,217 --> 01:39:29,844
Team SNU, please find a target number

1694
01:39:29,928 --> 01:39:32,138
and complete its formula
within two minutes.

1695
01:39:33,348 --> 01:39:34,933
Can you make a formula for 19,804?

1696
01:39:35,016 --> 01:39:36,267
For 19,804?

1697
01:39:36,351 --> 01:39:37,811
That's pretty close to 19,683.

1698
01:39:37,894 --> 01:39:38,770
TEAM SNU'S POWER TABLE

1699
01:39:38,853 --> 01:39:40,855
What are you working on right now?

1700
01:39:41,815 --> 01:39:44,109
That big one over there, 9,745,821.

1701
01:39:44,192 --> 01:39:45,652
- Did you say 9,745,821?
- Yeah.

1702
01:39:46,152 --> 01:39:50,115
SU-HAN IS TRYING TO MAKE A FORMULA
FOR THE 7-DIGIT TARGET NUMBER, 9,745,821

1703
01:39:50,198 --> 01:39:51,908
With 5 to the power of 10...

1704
01:39:51,991 --> 01:39:54,244
Minus 3 to the power of 9
minus 11 squared.

1705
01:39:54,327 --> 01:39:55,745
We need to tweak it now.

1706
01:39:55,829 --> 01:39:57,497
Five...

1707
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:59,207
To the power of 4 plus 6.

1708
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:02,419
As for this, we'll use 3 plus 6.

1709
01:40:02,502 --> 01:40:05,630
What about 11?
Which squared number can I use?

1710
01:40:05,714 --> 01:40:07,549
- I know we need one here.
- How about four plus...

1711
01:40:08,633 --> 01:40:10,176
<i>I thought hard about making 11.</i>

1712
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:11,469
AVAILABLE NUMBERS: 5, 4, 2, 1, 1

1713
01:40:11,553 --> 01:40:13,471
Use 5 plus 4 plus 1 plus 1.

1714
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:17,017
REMAINING NUMBERS

1715
01:40:19,519 --> 01:40:20,937
Does that work, though?

1716
01:40:21,021 --> 01:40:22,439
Yeah, it does.

1717
01:40:22,897 --> 01:40:26,067
Our target number is 9,745,821.

1718
01:40:26,151 --> 01:40:27,819
SU-HAN CALLS A 7-DIGIT TARGET NUMBER

1719
01:40:29,529 --> 01:40:32,240
Its formula is 5 to the power of 4 plus 6

1720
01:40:32,323 --> 01:40:34,492
minus 3 to the power of 3 plus 6

1721
01:40:34,576 --> 01:40:38,079
minus the square
of 5 plus 4 plus 1 plus 1.

1722
01:40:38,163 --> 01:40:40,498
TARGET NUMBER: 9,745,821

1723
01:40:40,915 --> 01:40:42,167
That is correct.

1724
01:40:45,045 --> 01:40:46,421
<i>The thrill was amazing.</i>

1725
01:40:46,504 --> 01:40:48,548
I thought,
"The clip of this moment will go viral."

1726
01:40:48,965 --> 01:40:50,133
Damn it.

1727
01:40:50,842 --> 01:40:52,510
<i>When Team SNU got a seven-digit number,</i>

1728
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:55,472
<i>I wondered if I should be looking</i>
<i>for a 7 or 8-digit number</i>

1729
01:40:55,555 --> 01:40:56,806
<i>instead of a six-digit one.</i>

1730
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:59,017
<i>I kept wavering back and forth after that.</i>

1731
01:41:00,685 --> 01:41:03,688
Why don't we go back
to making a formula for 41,268?

1732
01:41:03,772 --> 01:41:06,983
Show me what you've got.
Do you have a substitute for eight?

1733
01:41:07,067 --> 01:41:08,735
TARGET NUMBER: 41,268

1734
01:41:08,818 --> 01:41:10,612
<i>We can use 5 plus 3 instead.</i>

1735
01:41:14,866 --> 01:41:16,242
Our target number is 41,268.

1736
01:41:16,326 --> 01:41:18,161
Its formula is the factorial of 5 plus 3

1737
01:41:18,244 --> 01:41:20,246
plus 4 to the power of 5
minus the factorial of 4

1738
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:22,290
times 3 minus 2 times 2.

1739
01:41:22,374 --> 01:41:23,625
TARGET NUMBER: 41,268

1740
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:24,834
That is correct.

1741
01:41:26,127 --> 01:41:28,672
SNU: 11, KAIST: 8
Your accumulated score is 8 points.

1742
01:41:28,755 --> 01:41:30,632
- Hey, double-check this for me.
- Okay.

1743
01:41:31,633 --> 01:41:33,510
- Our target is 72,386?
- Is this the factorial of 6?

1744
01:41:33,593 --> 01:41:34,803
The factorial of 6 plus 4.

1745
01:41:34,886 --> 01:41:38,223
So, 724 times 100 equals 72,400.
Then, subtract 14 from that.

1746
01:41:38,306 --> 01:41:40,225
TARGET NUMBER: 72,386

1747
01:41:41,142 --> 01:41:43,853
That results in 72,386, right?
I'll move on to the next one.

1748
01:41:45,605 --> 01:41:47,857
I'll call 72,386
if we don't have anything else.

1749
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,818
I have another one.

1750
01:41:49,901 --> 01:41:51,528
It's for 56,836.

1751
01:41:52,112 --> 01:41:53,238
With it, we can travel upward.

1752
01:41:53,321 --> 01:41:55,573
- That's the better option for us.
- Then, let's call that.

1753
01:41:55,657 --> 01:41:56,574
Go right ahead.

1754
01:41:58,201 --> 01:42:01,663
Our target number is 56,836.

1755
01:42:02,038 --> 01:42:04,040
Team SNU, that is correct.

1756
01:42:04,124 --> 01:42:07,168
TARGET NUMBER 56,836

1757
01:42:07,252 --> 01:42:09,462
SNU: 15, KAIST: 8
Team KAIST, please find a target number

1758
01:42:09,546 --> 01:42:11,715
and complete its formula
within two minutes.

1759
01:42:13,216 --> 01:42:15,593
I think I just made a formula
for a seven-digit number.

1760
01:42:15,677 --> 01:42:18,513
Can you call that one?

1761
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:21,307
I'll call this
if you don't have anything better.

1762
01:42:21,391 --> 01:42:22,976
We don't. Just do it.

1763
01:42:23,435 --> 01:42:26,563
Our target number is 1,572,634.

1764
01:42:27,105 --> 01:42:30,650
The formula is
3 to the power of 6 plus 6 plus 1,

1765
01:42:30,734 --> 01:42:34,446
minus the cube
of 2 to the power of 5 minus 4,

1766
01:42:34,529 --> 01:42:39,117
plus 5 minus 2 to the power of 1 plus 4.

1767
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,202
TARGET NUMBER 1,572,634

1768
01:42:41,619 --> 01:42:43,371
Team KAIST, that is incorrect.

1769
01:42:44,956 --> 01:42:46,875
Team SNU will now take their turn.

1770
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:48,251
- Where did we go wrong?
- Hold on.

1771
01:42:48,335 --> 01:42:51,296
Our target number is 16,798.

1772
01:42:51,379 --> 01:42:52,464
TEAM SNU DOESN'T HESITATE

1773
01:42:52,547 --> 01:42:54,007
What the heck?

1774
01:42:55,216 --> 01:42:57,135
Don't give them any time to think.

1775
01:42:57,469 --> 01:43:00,180
<i>To be honest, it was our strategy</i>

1776
01:43:00,263 --> 01:43:02,307
not to give Team KAIST any time to think.

1777
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:04,267
If we made formulas
for five-digit numbers quickly

1778
01:43:04,351 --> 01:43:06,186
<i>and called numbers without a delay,</i>

1779
01:43:06,269 --> 01:43:09,230
<i>the pressure that Team KAIST</i>
<i>would feel would be huge.</i>

1780
01:43:09,314 --> 01:43:13,360
The other Jun-hyeong on my team came up
with formulas endlessly like a machine.

1781
01:43:13,443 --> 01:43:14,861
<i>He didn't just come up with one.</i>

1782
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:17,113
<i>He completed 2 formulas every 2 minutes.</i>

1783
01:43:17,197 --> 01:43:20,450
<i>I didn't have to wrack my brains</i>
<i>to find new numbers at all.</i>

1784
01:43:22,118 --> 01:43:23,870
Team SNU, that is correct.

1785
01:43:23,953 --> 01:43:25,038
TARGET NUMBER: 16,798

1786
01:43:25,121 --> 01:43:27,832
TEAM KAIST REVIEWS THEIR WRONG FORMULA

1787
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:30,710
So, 28 cubed is actually 21,952.

1788
01:43:30,794 --> 01:43:32,253
Did we calculate it wrong?

1789
01:43:32,337 --> 01:43:34,089
The number in our power table was wrong.

1790
01:43:34,172 --> 01:43:35,465
<i>Let's give this up.</i>

1791
01:43:35,548 --> 01:43:39,219
TEAM KAIST MADE A CALCULATION MISTAKE
DURING THE STRATEGY MEETING

1792
01:43:40,053 --> 01:43:41,680
Why don't we go for this one?

1793
01:43:41,763 --> 01:43:43,431
I have a formula for that ready.

1794
01:43:43,807 --> 01:43:46,434
Our target number is 28,637.

1795
01:43:46,518 --> 01:43:48,520
Team KAIST, that is correct.

1796
01:43:49,688 --> 01:43:51,481
SNU: 19, KAIST: 12
Team SNU, please find a target number

1797
01:43:51,564 --> 01:43:53,441
and complete its formula
within two minutes.

1798
01:43:53,525 --> 01:43:54,818
Our target number...

1799
01:43:54,901 --> 01:43:58,279
TEAM SNU ONCE AGAIN
PRESENTS THEIR ANSWER PROMPTLY

1800
01:43:58,697 --> 01:44:02,826
Our target number is 82,145.

1801
01:44:02,909 --> 01:44:04,077
That is correct.

1802
01:44:09,874 --> 01:44:11,835
We need to stay calm.

1803
01:44:12,377 --> 01:44:15,922
<i>Listening to Team SNU quickly coming up</i>
<i>with five-digit target numbers and higher,</i>

1804
01:44:16,006 --> 01:44:18,466
<i>I knew I had to concentrate more</i>
<i>and keep working at it.</i>

1805
01:44:19,718 --> 01:44:20,844
Hey, I've got something.

1806
01:44:21,302 --> 01:44:24,848
It's 89,324.
The number going down Column 1.

1807
01:44:24,931 --> 01:44:26,683
Can you double-check it for me?

1808
01:44:27,475 --> 01:44:29,978
It's correct.
Here, we have a formula for 89,324.

1809
01:44:30,061 --> 01:44:31,396
It's a five-digit number.

1810
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:34,774
If this turns out to be incorrect,
the game is as good as done.

1811
01:44:35,817 --> 01:44:38,278
Our target number is 89,324.

1812
01:44:38,361 --> 01:44:40,280
Team KAIST, that is correct.

1813
01:44:41,531 --> 01:44:42,907
<i>The game wasn't over yet.</i>

1814
01:44:42,991 --> 01:44:47,245
<i>I thought we could still turn it around</i>
<i>if we focused and did well.</i>

1815
01:44:47,328 --> 01:44:50,123
Can anyone make a formula for 10,529?

1816
01:44:50,206 --> 01:44:54,169
I divided 94,761 by 9.
It's to seal that upper-right corner.

1817
01:44:54,627 --> 01:44:56,004
Did you say 10,529?

1818
01:44:56,087 --> 01:44:58,506
- I know that 529 is 23 squared.
- Is that right?

1819
01:44:58,882 --> 01:45:00,258
One times five...

1820
01:45:00,342 --> 01:45:02,218
- Do I take it to the power of 4?
- Hold on.

1821
01:45:02,635 --> 01:45:06,514
Our target number is 94,761.

1822
01:45:07,557 --> 01:45:09,225
Team SNU, that is incorrect.

1823
01:45:09,309 --> 01:45:10,518
- Damn it.
- What?

1824
01:45:11,519 --> 01:45:12,771
That's good.

1825
01:45:12,854 --> 01:45:15,690
- What went wrong?
- One number was used three times.

1826
01:45:15,774 --> 01:45:16,900
Which is it, two?

1827
01:45:16,983 --> 01:45:18,401
- Hey, don't worry.
- It's okay.

1828
01:45:18,943 --> 01:45:20,236
I'm so sorry about that.

1829
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,988
- It's okay.
- We're good.

1830
01:45:22,072 --> 01:45:24,657
Don't let that get to you.
Let's do better from now on.

1831
01:45:25,116 --> 01:45:27,369
We're not the only ones making mistakes.

1832
01:45:27,911 --> 01:45:29,579
<i>I told myself Team SNU could also make</i>

1833
01:45:29,662 --> 01:45:32,165
<i>the mistake of using the same number</i>
<i>three or more times.</i>

1834
01:45:32,248 --> 01:45:34,584
<i>I was more determined</i>
<i>to close down the score gap.</i>

1835
01:45:34,668 --> 01:45:36,419
SNU: 23, KAIST: 16
Team KAIST, please find a target number

1836
01:45:36,503 --> 01:45:38,129
and complete its formula
within two minutes.

1837
01:45:38,546 --> 01:45:41,758
- Why don't we cut them off with 7,315?
- I was considering that, too.

1838
01:45:41,841 --> 01:45:44,219
Our target number is 7,315.

1839
01:45:44,844 --> 01:45:46,763
Team KAIST, that is correct.

1840
01:45:46,846 --> 01:45:49,391
SNU: 23, KAIST: 19
Your accumulated score is 19 points.

1841
01:45:49,474 --> 01:45:51,476
The cells with 7,315
is now our territory, right?

1842
01:45:51,559 --> 01:45:55,230
Why don't we get 2,693 to seal off
the lower end and go for the top area?

1843
01:45:55,313 --> 01:45:57,482
- You want us to go for 2,693?
- Yeah, or 26,934.

1844
01:45:57,565 --> 01:46:00,360
Let's block off their access from below
and work on the top rows.

1845
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:02,237
How does that sound?

1846
01:46:02,779 --> 01:46:05,115
BOTH TEAMS WANT TO PREVENT THE OTHER
FROM GAINING MORE TERRITORY

1847
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:06,950
We have to get 94,761 now.

1848
01:46:07,033 --> 01:46:08,159
Let's seal that corner.

1849
01:46:08,702 --> 01:46:12,872
Our target number is 94,761.

1850
01:46:14,499 --> 01:46:16,584
We should've actually claimed
that cell with nine, too.

1851
01:46:16,668 --> 01:46:19,170
- They would mirror our tactics.
- We couldn't help it.

1852
01:46:19,254 --> 01:46:21,923
It was better to place a barrier
than to let them cross over.

1853
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:24,009
Team SNU, that is correct.

1854
01:46:24,092 --> 01:46:25,051
TARGET NUMBER: 94,761

1855
01:46:25,468 --> 01:46:26,678
That corner is sealed.

1856
01:46:29,139 --> 01:46:31,141
Double-check this for me.

1857
01:46:31,224 --> 01:46:32,767
- It's 269--
- You have one minute left.

1858
01:46:32,851 --> 01:46:35,020
We need to get 269,341.

1859
01:46:35,103 --> 01:46:37,022
Just count the numbers. One, two, three...

1860
01:46:37,105 --> 01:46:38,231
You have 30 seconds left.

1861
01:46:38,314 --> 01:46:39,983
The number count was fine.

1862
01:46:40,066 --> 01:46:42,277
Call the number.
There's nothing more we can do.

1863
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:45,905
Our target number is 269,341.

1864
01:46:45,989 --> 01:46:47,699
TARGET NUMBER: 269,341

1865
01:46:47,782 --> 01:46:49,534
Team KAIST, that is incorrect.

1866
01:46:49,617 --> 01:46:51,661
Team SNU will now take their turn.

1867
01:46:52,162 --> 01:46:53,246
Let's close that off!

1868
01:46:53,329 --> 01:46:54,539
- With this?
- Go on.

1869
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:57,709
I know where it went wrong.
It was the multiplication.

1870
01:46:57,792 --> 01:47:00,086
Where, exactly?
Was it a simple calculation mistake?

1871
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:01,880
Yeah, right in the middle.

1872
01:47:01,963 --> 01:47:03,757
It's all right.
Focus on finding something else.

1873
01:47:05,508 --> 01:47:07,635
Block them out so they can't come across.

1874
01:47:08,178 --> 01:47:12,599
<i>We had compiled an impressive list</i>
<i>of formulas we could use.</i>

1875
01:47:14,809 --> 01:47:18,063
I've got formulas for 61,736 and 14,726.

1876
01:47:18,438 --> 01:47:22,692
We can call 92,654 and 43,218
back-to-back. I have 93,419 ready, too.

1877
01:47:23,151 --> 01:47:25,904
Why don't we write up
all the formulas on a single page?

1878
01:47:25,987 --> 01:47:29,657
TEAM SNU PREPARED A LIST
OF FORMULAS THEY COULD USE

1879
01:47:29,741 --> 01:47:33,578
Our target number is 93,419.

1880
01:47:36,247 --> 01:47:37,248
That is correct.

1881
01:47:37,332 --> 01:47:39,793
TARGET NUMBER: 93,419

1882
01:47:39,876 --> 01:47:42,337
Jun-hyeong is doing
all the heavy lifting this time.

1883
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:43,505
I know. He's brilliant.

1884
01:47:43,588 --> 01:47:45,632
I'm working on another. Give me a second.

1885
01:47:45,715 --> 01:47:46,758
Wait, no.

1886
01:47:47,926 --> 01:47:49,678
Team KAIST, please find a target number

1887
01:47:49,761 --> 01:47:51,680
and complete its formula
within two minutes.

1888
01:47:52,263 --> 01:47:54,224
Help me find a formula for 9,185.

1889
01:47:54,307 --> 01:47:56,434
We need to get this one quickly.

1890
01:47:57,602 --> 01:47:59,396
You have 30 seconds left.

1891
01:47:59,813 --> 01:48:02,148
THE TARGET NUMBER IS HARD TO REACH
Why can't I make 50?

1892
01:48:02,565 --> 01:48:05,276
- We should start writing our formula.
- Hey, but...

1893
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:09,447
HYEONG-SEOK MADE A FORMULA FOR 394
TO STOP TEAM SNU'S ADVANCE

1894
01:48:10,824 --> 01:48:12,283
I have 9,185. Is it too late?

1895
01:48:12,367 --> 01:48:13,201
Yeah, it is.

1896
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:15,245
Our target number is 394.

1897
01:48:15,328 --> 01:48:17,956
Its formula is the square of 4 times 5,
then minus 6.

1898
01:48:18,665 --> 01:48:20,542
Team KAIST, that is correct.

1899
01:48:21,918 --> 01:48:23,837
Let's launch a penetration. How's 43,218?

1900
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,588
We double-checked it earlier.

1901
01:48:25,672 --> 01:48:27,090
USING A FORMULA FROM THEIR LIST

1902
01:48:27,173 --> 01:48:30,593
Our target number is 43,218.

1903
01:48:31,052 --> 01:48:32,637
Team SNU, that is correct.

1904
01:48:34,014 --> 01:48:36,474
It's rather sad to think
none of my formulas were used.

1905
01:48:36,558 --> 01:48:38,351
The six-digit one?
Let's keep it for the finale.

1906
01:48:38,435 --> 01:48:39,394
But I prepared three.

1907
01:48:39,477 --> 01:48:40,437
It's heartbreaking.

1908
01:48:42,564 --> 01:48:44,524
Team KAIST, please find a target number

1909
01:48:44,607 --> 01:48:46,776
and complete its formula
within two minutes.

1910
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:48,945
Didn't someone say they found something?

1911
01:48:49,029 --> 01:48:50,363
- I've got 9,185.
- Really?

1912
01:48:50,447 --> 01:48:51,364
Yeah.

1913
01:48:52,323 --> 01:48:54,284
Our target number is 9,185.

1914
01:48:54,367 --> 01:48:56,578
<i>Team KAIST, that is correct.</i>

1915
01:48:56,661 --> 01:48:59,831
KAIST: 24, SNU: 35
<i>Your accumulated score is 24 points.</i>

1916
01:49:00,665 --> 01:49:02,334
Do you have a number
you'd like to call next?

1917
01:49:02,751 --> 01:49:03,585
This one, 612,592.

1918
01:49:03,668 --> 01:49:06,713
They might expand in the lower rows,
and I want us to be prepared.

1919
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:11,593
Our target number is 612,592.

1920
01:49:11,676 --> 01:49:13,261
Team SNU, that is correct.

1921
01:49:13,345 --> 01:49:14,804
TARGET NUMBER: 612,592

1922
01:49:18,892 --> 01:49:20,393
I think I've got something.

1923
01:49:21,603 --> 01:49:24,314
Can you double-check this
while I write it down?

1924
01:49:24,397 --> 01:49:26,524
- Count the numbers, too.
- Two was used four times.

1925
01:49:26,608 --> 01:49:28,443
Four times? I can't believe this.

1926
01:49:28,526 --> 01:49:31,237
Can't we use 1 plus 1 instead?
What about 6...

1927
01:49:31,654 --> 01:49:33,114
Do you have anything else ready?

1928
01:49:33,782 --> 01:49:35,492
Yeah, I've got 6,262. Won't that help?

1929
01:49:35,575 --> 01:49:37,202
- What, 6,262?
- Yeah, it's here.

1930
01:49:37,619 --> 01:49:39,204
Our target number is 6,262.

1931
01:49:39,287 --> 01:49:41,915
The formula is 4 cubed minus 2,

1932
01:49:41,998 --> 01:49:48,004
multiplied by the result of
1 plus the square of 1 plus 1 times 5.

1933
01:49:49,798 --> 01:49:51,758
Team KAIST, that is incorrect.

1934
01:49:51,841 --> 01:49:53,426
TARGET NUMBER 6,262

1935
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:55,845
One number was used three times.

1936
01:49:55,929 --> 01:49:56,930
It was the ones.

1937
01:49:58,181 --> 01:50:00,475
- Damn it.
- Team SNU will now take their turn.

1938
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:03,561
Let's call 92,654 next.

1939
01:50:04,938 --> 01:50:07,273
- Can I do it?
- Sure. I know you wanted to.

1940
01:50:08,566 --> 01:50:11,736
Our target number is 92,654.

1941
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:13,738
Team SNU, that is correct.

1942
01:50:13,822 --> 01:50:15,907
TARGET NUMBER: 92,654

1943
01:50:16,324 --> 01:50:17,867
Do you want to call the next one, Gyu-min?

1944
01:50:18,618 --> 01:50:21,788
- Let me use one of my finds, then.
- Do that on our next turn.

1945
01:50:21,871 --> 01:50:24,791
TEAM SNU HAD THE FORMULAS READY

1946
01:50:24,874 --> 01:50:28,920
BUT TEAM KAIST HAS TO KEEP
MAKING NEW FORMULAS

1947
01:50:30,088 --> 01:50:31,881
Our target number is 1,147.

1948
01:50:31,965 --> 01:50:33,091
That is correct.

1949
01:50:33,925 --> 01:50:37,095
Our target number is 61,736.

1950
01:50:37,595 --> 01:50:38,805
That is correct.

1951
01:50:38,888 --> 01:50:40,098
TARGET NUMBER: 61,736

1952
01:50:40,181 --> 01:50:43,184
TEAM SNU WINS WITH ONE MORE ANSWER
<i>Your accumulated score is 48 points.</i>

1953
01:50:43,268 --> 01:50:44,686
KAIST: 27, SNU: 48

1954
01:50:44,769 --> 01:50:46,271
Can I do the last one?

1955
01:50:46,354 --> 01:50:49,441
You've hogged the spotlight so far.
Can I enjoy one brief moment?

1956
01:50:49,649 --> 01:50:51,776
Give us the finishing blow.

1957
01:51:09,836 --> 01:51:12,714
You know, the formula is so neat.
It just can't be wrong.

1958
01:51:12,797 --> 01:51:14,090
Do you want this one?

1959
01:51:15,175 --> 01:51:17,177
Our target number

1960
01:51:17,844 --> 01:51:19,763
is 72,386.

1961
01:51:22,057 --> 01:51:23,224
Its formula is

1962
01:51:23,308 --> 01:51:25,560
the factorial of 6 plus 4

1963
01:51:25,643 --> 01:51:28,438
times 4 times 5 squared

1964
01:51:28,521 --> 01:51:32,067
minus 6 times 2 minus 3 plus 1.

1965
01:51:39,741 --> 01:51:41,242
Team SNU, that is correct.

1966
01:51:41,326 --> 01:51:43,328
TARGET NUMBER: 72,386

1967
01:51:47,916 --> 01:51:49,334
I'm so happy, guys!

1968
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:01,221
Seriously.

1969
01:52:01,304 --> 01:52:03,807
- I can't believe this.
- I seriously love you guys.

1970
01:52:03,890 --> 01:52:05,892
- I love you, too.
- What do we do?

1971
01:52:07,143 --> 01:52:07,977
KAIST: 27, SNU: 52

1972
01:52:08,061 --> 01:52:10,188
<i>With the accumulated score of 52 points,</i>

1973
01:52:10,939 --> 01:52:12,899
<i>Team SNU wins the game.</i>

1974
01:52:27,414 --> 01:52:28,748
It's okay.

1975
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,672
It's all right, really.

1976
01:52:38,008 --> 01:52:39,968
You did great. I mean that.

1977
01:52:40,552 --> 01:52:42,971
- But I didn't do anything.
- Don't say that.

1978
01:52:43,555 --> 01:52:46,099
We knew you were looking
for the bigger numbers.

1979
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:51,479
That's why we went for the four-digit ones
when things got dangerous for us.

1980
01:52:51,563 --> 01:52:57,152
You were the only one we could count on
to find the big numbers for us.

1981
01:52:59,487 --> 01:53:03,199
We were able to do our jobs
because we knew you were working hard.

1982
01:53:06,745 --> 01:53:07,746
You did great, okay?

1983
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:14,085
<i>After all the trouble we went through</i>
<i>to reach the finals,</i>

1984
01:53:14,169 --> 01:53:17,672
<i>I failed to contribute</i>
<i>to my team's success in this match.</i>

1985
01:53:20,425 --> 01:53:23,011
<i>That was the biggest regret I had.</i>

1986
01:53:36,816 --> 01:53:39,277
<i>I got overwhelmed,</i>
<i>thinking I was the one to blame</i>

1987
01:53:39,361 --> 01:53:42,364
<i>for losing the first match</i>
<i>by making mistakes.</i>

1988
01:53:42,614 --> 01:53:45,450
<i>I ended up crying</i>
<i>because I felt so bad for my teammates.</i>

1989
01:53:52,707 --> 01:53:56,878
<i>The winner of Elite League, Season 2,</i>
<i>the brainpower survival challenge,</i>

1990
01:53:58,380 --> 01:53:59,589
<i>is Team SNU.</i>

1991
01:53:59,673 --> 01:54:00,674
FINAL WINNER: TEAM SNU

1992
01:54:06,471 --> 01:54:07,347
Let's do our chant.

1993
01:54:08,473 --> 01:54:09,557
Let's do this.

1994
01:54:09,974 --> 01:54:10,809
Who are we?

1995
01:54:11,226 --> 01:54:13,019
- Team SNU!
- Team SNU!

1996
01:54:13,103 --> 01:54:15,480
- We, SNU, will win!
- We, SNU, will win!

1997
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:20,026
I love you, Team SNU. I mean it.

1998
01:54:21,778 --> 01:54:22,987
Wait. I'm getting dizzy.

1999
01:54:25,573 --> 01:54:27,325
Good work, guys.

2000
01:54:31,287 --> 01:54:33,456
- Great job, guys.
- Well done.

2001
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:34,749
I'm so jealous.

2002
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:36,918
How are you so good?

2003
01:54:39,045 --> 01:54:41,256
<i>At first, I mostly felt</i>
<i>disappointment and regret.</i>

2004
01:54:41,339 --> 01:54:43,967
<i>But I felt grateful</i>
<i>as I looked back on my journey.</i>

2005
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:47,345
<i>Out of the seven teams,</i>
<i>we made our way up one step at a time.</i>

2006
01:54:47,429 --> 01:54:51,433
<i>We poured our heart into every moment,</i>
<i>and our sincerity led us to the finals.</i>

2007
01:54:51,516 --> 01:54:55,270
<i>I'm grateful that we had a good result</i>
<i>of being the runner-up.</i>

2008
01:54:55,603 --> 01:55:00,734
<i>I tried my best in each and every game,</i>

2009
01:55:00,817 --> 01:55:03,361
<i>and that made each win</i>
<i>feel that much better.</i>

2010
01:55:03,445 --> 01:55:05,572
<i>I loved working on the games</i>
<i>with my teammates</i>

2011
01:55:05,655 --> 01:55:08,825
<i>who helped each other out</i>
<i>and always comforted one another.</i>

2012
01:55:09,659 --> 01:55:12,162
<i>I often felt unsure of my abilities,</i>

2013
01:55:12,245 --> 01:55:15,999
<i>but my teammates were there</i>
<i>to cheer me on at every turn.</i>

2014
01:55:16,082 --> 01:55:18,418
<i>It was all thanks to my teammates</i>

2015
01:55:18,501 --> 01:55:21,588
<i>that we were able</i>
<i>to finish in second place.</i>

2016
01:55:22,005 --> 01:55:25,091
<i>I'm so grateful, you guys.</i>
<i>Let's stay in touch.</i>

2017
01:55:25,550 --> 01:55:28,345
<i>I got to participate</i>
<i>in this amazing journey</i>

2018
01:55:28,428 --> 01:55:30,889
<i>with my amazing teammates</i>
<i>while I'm still young.</i>

2019
01:55:30,972 --> 01:55:31,973
<i>That makes me feel so proud.</i>

2020
01:55:36,478 --> 01:55:37,687
Let's do a chant, too.

2021
01:55:38,229 --> 01:55:39,105
Let's keep it quiet.

2022
01:55:39,189 --> 01:55:40,732
Don't we have to let them hear us?

2023
01:55:40,815 --> 01:55:42,317
No, we're playing it cool.

2024
01:55:42,817 --> 01:55:43,693
One, two, three.

2025
01:55:43,777 --> 01:55:44,819
- Let's go, Team KAIST.
- Let's go, Team KAIST.

2026
01:55:44,903 --> 01:55:46,321
I thought we were going for "Let's go."

2027
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:50,658
<i>Who in their twenties would get</i>
<i>to experience something like this?</i>

2028
01:55:50,742 --> 01:55:53,161
<i>My youth would've been</i>
<i>otherwise dull and ordinary.</i>

2029
01:55:53,244 --> 01:55:55,580
Thank you for giving me
such dazzling memories.

2030
01:55:55,663 --> 01:55:57,207
I personally feel more proud

2031
01:55:57,290 --> 01:55:59,876
of being a participant here
than being accepted to KAIST.

2032
01:55:59,959 --> 01:56:02,879
Surviving the Deathmatches was better
than getting my acceptance letter.

2033
01:56:03,296 --> 01:56:05,423
I want to thank you for everything.

2034
01:56:06,132 --> 01:56:08,176
- Great job, guys.
- Well done.

2035
01:56:08,259 --> 01:56:09,761
- I'm so jealous.
- How are you so good?

2036
01:56:09,844 --> 01:56:12,013
We wondered the same thing about you guys.

2037
01:56:13,264 --> 01:56:16,851
<i>To be honest, I hesitated for a long while</i>
<i>before applying to the show.</i>

2038
01:56:17,268 --> 01:56:19,771
<i>I wasn't sure if I was good enough.</i>

2039
01:56:19,854 --> 01:56:21,773
<i>But in the end,</i>
<i>I got to be a part of the show.</i>

2040
01:56:21,856 --> 01:56:24,401
<i>I think I managed to show</i>
<i>what I was capable of.</i>

2041
01:56:24,484 --> 01:56:26,945
<i>Participating in a show like this</i>
<i>has always been a dream.</i>

2042
01:56:27,362 --> 01:56:31,950
<i>I had my fill of the experience,</i>
<i>and I loved every moment of it.</i>

2043
01:56:33,868 --> 01:56:36,121
<i>All of the contestants were so smart</i>

2044
01:56:36,204 --> 01:56:38,581
<i>and also had so many admirable qualities.</i>

2045
01:56:39,290 --> 01:56:42,335
<i>So, I had to think</i>
<i>about what I could do to contribute</i>

2046
01:56:42,419 --> 01:56:43,753
<i>to this group of talents.</i>

2047
01:56:43,837 --> 01:56:46,297
<i>As a result, I was able</i>
<i>to understand myself better.</i>

2048
01:56:46,798 --> 01:56:50,969
<i>Could I get another chance</i>
<i>to have such an experience in my lifetime?</i>

2049
01:56:51,052 --> 01:56:54,264
<i>I got to make so many good friends</i>
<i>and enjoy the interesting games.</i>

2050
01:56:54,347 --> 01:56:57,976
Overall, I'm so happy
and feel somewhat overwhelmed.

2051
01:56:59,519 --> 01:57:02,480
<i>I did have a hard time</i>
<i>dealing with all my losses so far.</i>

2052
01:57:02,897 --> 01:57:04,024
I don't know if I can do it.

2053
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:06,192
Go get the win.
I doubt anyone would complete it, anyway.

2054
01:57:06,651 --> 01:57:07,986
I'll give it a shot, then.

2055
01:57:08,069 --> 01:57:10,613
<i>But whenever I was down,</i>
<i>my teammates cheered me on</i>

2056
01:57:10,697 --> 01:57:12,824
<i>and told me I could do it.</i>

2057
01:57:12,907 --> 01:57:16,578
<i>It was so nice to have</i>
<i>such supportive, dependable friends.</i>

2058
01:57:16,661 --> 01:57:19,330
I think I love them to pieces.

2059
01:57:19,998 --> 01:57:23,168
<i>I believe we showed the world</i>
<i>that SNU students are still formidable.</i>

2060
01:57:23,835 --> 01:57:26,963
<i>But most importantly,</i>
<i>this experience taught me</i>

2061
01:57:27,047 --> 01:57:29,507
<i>what it was like</i>
<i>to be under the spotlight.</i>

2062
01:57:29,591 --> 01:57:32,427
<i>I think I grew rather thick-skinned</i>

2063
01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:35,472
<i>and learned how to present myself better</i>
<i>even under pressure.</i>

2064
01:57:35,555 --> 01:57:37,932
Also, I've grown so fond of my teammates.

2065
01:57:38,016 --> 01:57:39,851
I want to hug them right now.

2066
01:57:42,187 --> 01:57:43,438
That deserves a big hand.

2067
01:57:45,106 --> 01:57:46,775
I'll clap the slate now.

2068
01:57:46,858 --> 01:57:48,568
One, two, three.

2069
01:57:49,903 --> 01:57:52,530
It looked like
you've been dying to try that.

2070
01:57:53,448 --> 01:57:55,533
- To be honest, I was.
- How adorable.

2071
01:57:57,327 --> 01:58:00,455
We could write something like,
"We love you, Gyu-min."

2072
01:58:00,914 --> 01:58:02,332
- Please, don't.
- But we already did. Look.

2073
01:58:02,415 --> 01:58:03,625
Don't do that.

2074
01:58:03,708 --> 01:58:05,001
Please, don't.

2075
01:58:05,085 --> 01:58:07,128
LET THEM RAISE THEIR HEADS TOWARD GYU-MIN

2076
01:58:07,212 --> 01:58:08,838
SNU WILL TAKE THE WIN AGAIN

2077
01:58:08,922 --> 01:58:11,216
KIM GYU-MIN, WOO SU-HAN,
YUK JUN-HYEONG, CHO JUN-HYEONG
