1
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,237
I would like
Team Oxford's Hah Eun to join me.

2
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:33,366
THE SECOND ONE-ON-ONE GAME
BETWEEN HAH EUN AND KIM GYU-MIN

3
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,704
I wanted to earn a point
against the opponent who once beat me.

4
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:41,124
That's what motivated me
to keep challenging Gyu-min.

5
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,962
If I saw someone dominating a field,
getting questions right in a row,

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,257
I'd also feel the temptation
to challenge them and win.

7
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,719
Here's your question.

8
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,264
OCTOBER 1ST IS A THURSDAY
{(SAT^SUN)÷FRI}×TUE÷MON+WED=43

9
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,525
The person with better focus will win.

10
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,657
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min,
please state your answer.

11
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,787
Three, four, nine,

12
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,246
twenty,

13
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,582
twelve...

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,504
and twenty-eight.

15
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,715
That works!

16
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,551
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min.

17
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,636
That is correct.

18
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,472
SAT: 3, SUN: 4, FRI: 9,
TUE: 20, MON: 12, WED: 28

19
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,473
You're the best.

20
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,060
That's insane.

21
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,895
I'm totally speechless.

22
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,190
Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min reached Tier 1.

23
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,360
TEAM SNU'S KIM GYU-MIN REACHES TIER 1

24
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,238
It looks awesome to be in Tier 1.

25
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,323
PYRAMID GAME, CURRENT STANDINGS

26
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,410
TEAM SNU: 1ST PLACE

27
00:01:59,077 --> 00:01:59,994
I felt conflicted.

28
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,748
"Should I keep on playing
even after reaching Tier 1

29
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,583
or hand over the host position?"

30
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,544
If a contestant reaches Tier 1,

31
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,089
they can cede the host title
to one of their teammates.

32
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:15,468
If they choose to keep playing
after reaching Tier 1,

33
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,931
they will win one additional point
with each victory.

34
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,727
They're switching places.

35
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,480
Look. They're switching.

36
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,109
They want to keep him in Tier 1
and secure 4 points.

37
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:35,488
I'll hand over the host title
to Cho Jun-hyeong.

38
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:40,702
The current host, Team SNU's Kim Gyu-min,
ceded his title to Cho Jun-hyeong.

39
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,121
I love you, Gyu-min.

40
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,337
If we can keep it going,
we'll land a spot at the top again.

41
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:55,300
I would have loved
to try playing other games,

42
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,345
but I thought I should prioritize
my team's success

43
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,306
over my personal enjoyment.

44
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,601
Team SNU's Cho Jun-hyeong.

45
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,020
As the new host,
please select the next game.

46
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,147
I think he'll choose memorization.

47
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,150
I will play
if he chooses Hidden Algorithm.

48
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,110
DAY FORMULA, HIDDEN ALGORITHM,
LADDER ASSEMBLY, LINK THE COLORS

49
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,321
My choice is Hidden Algorithm.

50
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,698
TEAM KAIST, HWANG GI-HYEON

51
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,116
Team KAIST is going for it.

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,035
TEAM POSTECH, JEON JI-SEONG

53
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,621
TEAM YONSEI
YANG HYEON-SEUNG, IM JEONG-HUN

54
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,332
I will play
against Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

55
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,211
Since Gi-hyeon came in second
at the Ace Selection on the first day,

56
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,254
I thought beating him in today's match

57
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,175
could pave the way
for my team's victory moving forward.

58
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,260
That's why I chose to play against him.

59
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,429
Here's your question.

60
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,391
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

61
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,186
The algorithm would create a route
according to the set priorities.

62
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,481
So rather than considering
clusters of similar numbers,

63
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:56,444
I tried to follow a sequence of numbers
that created a path to the destination.

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,407
Instead of reviewing
a random set of numbers,

65
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:05,829
finding a repetition of numbers
that form a viable path

66
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,916
can help to figure out
the hidden algorithm faster.

67
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:15,463
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

68
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:23,054
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please state your answer.

69
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,767
My answer is 1, 2, 3, 4.

70
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:34,983
TEAM KAIST, HWANG GI-HYEON
ANSWER: 1, 2, 3, 4

71
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,402
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.
That is correct.

72
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,613
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

73
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,824
TWO POSSIBLE ANSWERS
1, 2, 3, 4 OR 2, 1, 3, 4

74
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:51,082
You will now be acting as the new host,
and you will also be moved up a tier.

75
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,379
Our plan was to try solving two questions
in the game we were most confident in

76
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:00,508
and challenge the host
once we felt sure we could do well.

77
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,385
FOOTAGE FROM PREVIOUS GAMES
It's 3, 1, 4, 2.

78
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,305
GI-HYEON SOLVES THE QUESTIONS FIRST
It's 3, 1, 2, 4.

79
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,848
It's 2, 1, 3, 4.

80
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,642
Gi-hyeon got the answer already.

81
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,355
Gi-hyeon turned out to be great
at figuring out the algorithm.

82
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,483
We thought he had a shot
at taking the host title.

83
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,985
- Try not to appear too confident.
- Okay.

84
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,614
But they already see me
as a strong contender.

85
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,409
2ND PLACE IN ACE SELECTION
Since I'm the best on my team,

86
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,662
I didn't think anyone
would choose me so willingly.

87
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,207
No one would choose to play against you.

88
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,085
I will play
against Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

89
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,961
I couldn't believe my ears.

90
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,383
I stepped up to the stage,
determined to reach Tier 1.

91
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,968
My choice is Hidden Algorithm.

92
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,429
TEAM OXFORM, CHOI WON-JIN
Please select your challenger.

93
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,890
I will play against Team Oxford.

94
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,142
Here's your question.

95
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,312
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

96
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,773
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

97
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,900
My answer is 2, 3, 1, 4.

98
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,527
That is correct.

99
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,487
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

100
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,241
I was surprised at how quick he was.

101
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,704
My choice is Hidden Algorithm.

102
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:16,459
Frankly, I thought I could take on anyone
in a game of Hidden Algorithm.

103
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,045
CHOOSES CHO JUN-HYEONG
I will play against Team SNU.

104
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,715
I felt sure I would win.

105
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,133
Here's your question.

106
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,386
RED: STARTING POINT, GREEN: DESTINATION

107
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,887
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

108
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,181
My answer is 2, 3, 4, 1.

109
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,978
A CORRECT ANSWER
WILL TAKE HIM UP TO TIER 1

110
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,813
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.

111
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,189
That is incorrect.

112
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,445
If I couldn't find
the answer in five seconds,

113
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,239
I was sure the route would take
a long way around the board.

114
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,701
So, I strategically hit the buzzer
and gave a wrong answer

115
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,911
to make the opponent feel flustered.

116
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,496
Your ten seconds have passed.

117
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,292
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon,
please state your answer.

118
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,419
My answer is 2, 3, 1, 4.

119
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,172
TEAM KAIST, HWANG GI-HYEON
ANSWER: 2, 3, 1, 4

120
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,341
Team KAIST's Hwang Gi-hyeon.
That is correct.

121
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,885
You have reached Tier 1.

122
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,139
Team SNU's Cho Jun-hyeong,
you'll be moved down a tier.

123
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:16,770
Seeing Team KAIST's Gi-hyeon
reaching Tier 1 made me wonder

124
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,315
if I should get back in the game
to win some more points.

125
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,816
I seriously considered it.

126
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,696
I will cede the host title.

127
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,656
If there had been
Hidden Algorithm questions left

128
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,992
even after I reached Tier 1,

129
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,869
I might have kept on playing.

130
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,997
But I chose to play it safe
and secure my team's high rank.

131
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,875
I'll hand over the host title
to Park Ji-seong.

132
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,418
Go for it.

133
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,546
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong.
As the new host...

134
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,508
We might need to play
even after reaching Tier 1.

135
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:52,138
While Team SNU and Team KAIST
fiercely compete to take first place,

136
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:56,726
the remaining three are facing
the threat of the Deathmatch.

137
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,939
As Team Yonsei and Team POSTECH
both stand with no points,

138
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,650
the two teams are especially vulnerable.

139
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,860
We need to be chosen to play now.

140
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,279
Let's raise our hands for anything.

141
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,948
We're currently in last place.

142
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,158
If the host doesn't choose us,

143
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,994
we'll get booted out
for not having any points.

144
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,497
Let's see how it plays out.

145
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,210
We can stay put if Team Yonsei
and Team POSTECH fail to earn a point.

146
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,046
If they do manage it,
we have to get in there.

147
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,424
My choice is Day Formula.

148
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,010
- We should at least beat Team POSTECH.
- Go on, you two.

149
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,261
Damn it.

150
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,139
Just raise your hand, Jin-hyeon.

151
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:36,933
Raise your hand.

152
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:42,480
Four contestants challenged
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong.

153
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,274
LEE SEUNG-CHAN, IM JEONG-HUN,
PARK SE-HWAN, CHOI JIN-HYEON

154
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,110
I will play
against Team Oxford's Lee Seung-chan.

155
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,903
- Go take the win, Ace!
- Good luck!

156
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,822
There's our shy superstar.

157
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,617
Here's your question.

158
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,454
APRIL 1ST IS A THURSDAY
{(MON+THU)÷SAT}^TUE÷FRI×WED=84

159
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,213
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong,
please state your answer.

160
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,593
Five, fifteen, ten,

161
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,428
six,

162
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,805
sixteen, and twenty-one.

163
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,766
MON: 5, THU: 15, SAT: 10,
TUE: 6, FRI: 16, WED: 21

164
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,976
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong.
That is correct.

165
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:26,608
Since Team SNU had Gyu-min in Tier 1,

166
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,443
we knew we had to stay on our toes.

167
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,071
My choice is Day Formula.

168
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,114
Here's your question.

169
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,240
NOVEMBER 1ST IS A FRIDAY
{(FRI÷MON)^TUE+SAT}×SUN+WED+THU=178

170
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,533
We were gunning for the win.

171
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,327
NOVEMBER 1ST IS A FRIDAY
{(FRI÷MON)^TUE+SAT}×SUN+WED+THU=178

172
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,912
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong.

173
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,956
Twenty-two, eleven, five,

174
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,126
twenty-three, three, six, and seven.

175
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,754
I can't bear to watch.

176
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,382
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong.

177
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,467
That is correct.

178
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,887
You'll be moved up a tier.

179
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,932
TEAM KAIST'S PARK JI-SEONG REACHES TIER 2

180
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,062
I don't know what he'll choose.

181
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,772
- Ladder Assembly?
- Or Link the Colors.

182
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,024
I doubt he'd consider that.

183
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,069
LADDER ASSEMBLY: 7, LINK THE COLORS: 7

184
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,696
My choice is Ladder Assembly.

185
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,447
In Ladder Assembly,

186
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,284
you'll be presented with five ladders
placed out of sequence.

187
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,412
They must be rearranged

188
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,249
to find a match for the starting points
to their destination.

189
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,667
EXAMPLE QUESTION'S SOLUTION: 4, 5, 1, 2, 3

190
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,085
Put your hand up, Min-su.

191
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,336
TEAM POSTECH, HA MIN-SU

192
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,213
TEAM YONSEI, LEE SEUNG-CHAN

193
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,925
TEAM OXFORD, HAH EUN
I'll go.

194
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:34,968
I need to do this.

195
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,262
I'm just not as gutsy as you are.

196
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,847
TEAM SNU, YUK JUN-HYEONG
I'll try it.

197
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,391
I thought this was my moment

198
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,395
and decided to choose someone
I knew I could beat.

199
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,940
I will play
against Team Yonsei's Lee Seung-chan.

200
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,569
TEAM YONSEI CURRENTLY HAS NO POINTS

201
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,531
I thought that if I lost the game,
it'd be a huge problem for my team.

202
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,160
TEAM POSTECH CURRENTLY HAS NO POINTS
We need Team KAIST to win.

203
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,996
You can do it, Team KAIST.

204
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,624
Here's your question.

205
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,053
- Are you done?
- I'm still working on 4 and 5.

206
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,850
My answer is 5, 2, 4, 1, 3.

207
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,728
That's different from my answer.

208
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,814
Team Yonsei's Lee Seung-chan.
That is incorrect.

209
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,986
- I'm sure I got it.
- Really?

210
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,155
- I double-checked all five of them.
- What?

211
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,323
It's 5, 3, 4, 1, 2.

212
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,741
- You sure?
- Yeah.

213
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,165
My answer is 5, 3, 4, 1, 2.

214
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,250
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong.

215
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,003
That is correct.

216
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,049
Team KAIST's Park Ji-seong reached Tier 1.

217
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,345
We're the only team
who can have 2 people in Tier 1.

218
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,182
THERE ARE 3 CONTESTANTS IN TIER 1

219
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,767
PYRAMID GAME, CURRENT STANDINGS

220
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,145
TEAM KAIST: 1ST PLACE

221
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,772
Would aiming for first place
be a little too much?

222
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,775
Yeah, unless they throw the game

223
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,944
or we somehow knock it out of the park.

224
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,363
To think they pulled this off
after the Deathmatch.

225
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:19,948
Hey, Ji-seong.

226
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,116
LET'S SWITCH HOSTS

227
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,869
I'll hand over the host title
to Oh Hyeong-seok.

228
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,581
You got top grades in the CSAT.

229
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,293
TEAM KAIST'S OH HYEONG-SEOK
TAKES THE HOST TITLE

230
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,089
My choice is Ladder Assembly.

231
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,925
- At this rate,
- One of us needs to volunteer.

232
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,176
we can stay out of the Deathmatch.

233
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,554
Sure, but to play it safe,

234
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,807
- one of you should make it up to Tier 3.
- I agree.

235
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,517
You're right.

236
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,103
TEAM POSTECH CURRENTLY HAS 0 POINTS
All of you need to volunteer.

237
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,606
Our initial plan was to survive
by avoiding finishing last.

238
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,568
EARLY STAGES OF PYRAMID GAME
Hey, we need to stay low for now.

239
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,321
Let's be the dark horses of the game.

240
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,782
I realized we could end up
in the Deathmatch

241
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,367
by playing it too defensively.

242
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,328
That's when I saw the need
to revise our strategy.

243
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,914
You and I should raise our hands.

244
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,458
TEAM YONSEI CURRENTLY HAS 0 POINTS

245
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,793
TEAM SNU CURRENTLY HAS 4 POINTS

246
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,922
I will play
against Team POSTECH's Ha Min-su.

247
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,759
Team POSTECH's Ha Min-su.

248
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,802
- Go get him.
- Please step forward.

249
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:29,059
Team KAIST came out
much stronger than I anticipated.

250
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,353
They really lit a fire under me.

251
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,647
People seemed to be imagining
a rivalry between KAIST and POSTECH.

252
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,234
I wanted to make it clear
that we are far superior.

253
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,528
It's a rival match
between KAIST and POSTECH.

254
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,113
I pray to the heavens.

255
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,491
Please look over us.

256
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,536
I'm going to kiss Min-su
if he gets it right.

257
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,914
I'm so anxious.

258
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,457
Here's your question.

259
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,222
Please let us win.

260
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,350
Just let us have one, Team KAIST.

261
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,436
You'd still be the winner without a point,
but we desperately need it.

262
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,437
Please.

263
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,067
Team POSTECH's Ha Min-su,

264
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,902
- please state your answer.
- Please.

265
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,697
My answer is 3, 4, 5,

266
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,533
followed by 2 and 1.

267
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,121
Team POSTECH's Ha Min-su.

268
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:33,873
That is incorrect.

269
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,421
Team KAIST's Oh Hyeong-seok,
please state your answer.

270
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,256
My answer is 4, 2, 5, 3, 1.

271
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,597
Team KAIST's Oh Hyeong-seok.

272
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,725
That is correct.

273
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,021
You'll be moved up a tier.

274
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,564
TEAM KAIST'S OH HYEONG-SEOK REACHES TIER 3

275
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,608
CURRENT STANDINGS
TEAM KAIST: 1ST PLACE

276
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,819
BOTTOM 3: YONSEI, POSTECH, OXFORD

277
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,321
We are up against Team Oxford
and Team Yonsei.

278
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,865
How many games are left now?

279
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,325
We'll have seven left after this.

280
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,952
I can't believe this.

281
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,662
Let's just get one point.

282
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,623
Team Yonsei and Team POSTECH
should be worried.

283
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,543
Team KAIST's Oh Hyeong-seok.

284
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,962
As the new host,
please select the next game.

285
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,048
My choice is Ladder Assembly.

286
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,216
- Go for it, Jin-hyeon.
- Should I?

287
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,217
TEAM POSTECH, CHOI JIN-HYEON

288
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,554
TEAM YONSEI
YANG HYEON-SEUNG, IM JEONG-HUN

289
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,015
I will play
against Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.

290
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,516
He's done us a great favor.

291
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,355
We can come back after beating Team Yonsei
and not challenge anyone afterward.

292
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,317
Here's your question.

293
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,613
SLOPING RUNGS ARE INTRODUCED

294
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,531
It's getting more difficult now.

295
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,200
That's insane.

296
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,452
Four...

297
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,586
Get this one, Jin-hyeon.

298
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:06,257
My answer is 1, 3, 2, 5, 4.

299
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,222
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.
That is incorrect.

300
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,516
Damn it.

301
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,647
Your ten seconds have passed.

302
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,275
OPEN FLOOR AFTER 10 SECONDS
Both contestants are allowed to answer.

303
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,865
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon,
please state your answer.

304
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,993
My answer is 1, 3, 2, 5, 4.

305
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,037
Didn't he say that already?

306
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,747
He gave the same answer.

307
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,250
Team POSTECH's Choi Jin-hyeon.
That is incorrect.

308
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,877
What's up with him?

309
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,548
I couldn't understand it.

310
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,807
Team KAIST's Oh Hyeong-seok,
please state your answer.

311
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,934
My answer is 5, 4, 3, 1, 2.

312
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,438
Team KAIST's Oh Hyeong-seok.
That is correct.

313
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:08,278
OH HYEONG-SEOK REACHES TIER 2
You will be moved up a tier.

314
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,488
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

315
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,033
Team KAIST's Oh Hyeong-seok...

316
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,993
You're shaking, Jin-hyeon. Relax.

317
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,330
We can still turn this around.

318
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,291
LADDER ASSEMBLY: 4, LINK THE COLORS: 7

319
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,917
My choice is Ladder Assembly.

320
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,171
TEAM YONSEI, IM JEONG-HUN

321
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,506
Try it, Min-su.
We can't let Yonsei get a point.

322
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,593
TEAM POSTECH, HA MIN-SU

323
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,220
I will play
against Team POSTECH's Ha Min-su.

324
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,973
- This is our last shot.
- One final shot.

325
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,225
TEAM YONSEI KEEPS GETTING SIDELINED

326
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,268
How is this fair?

327
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:43,646
I wondered if KAIST
kept choosing POSTECH to keep winning.

328
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,358
It was so frustrating
because they wouldn't choose us.

329
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,236
I avoided strong contenders
to play it safe.

330
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,197
He picked Team POSTECH three times.

331
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,450
- The rival match is ours if we win again.
- We'll destroy them.

332
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,244
We're just as good as them, if not better.

333
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,372
Team KAIST is giving us so many chances.

334
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,041
Here's your question.

335
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,253
What's with those ladders?

336
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,130
That question is insane.

337
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,759
Look at that.
What's the best way to tackle them?

338
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,012
You can make it work if you keep calm.
That works for me, at least.

339
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,725
My main focus was on the ladders
that had rungs on both sides.

340
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:26,022
I tried to work my way up
when faced with the challenging ladders.

341
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,444
Save us, just this once.

342
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:38,243
Team KAIST's Oh Hyeong-seok,
please state your answer.

343
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,245
My answer is 1, 4, 3, 5, 2.

344
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,250
That is correct.

345
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,168
Did he get to Tier 1?

346
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,088
- Damn it, he's good.
- He's really good.

347
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,466
Team KAIST's Oh Hyeong-seok
reached Tier 1.

348
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:01,599
Team KAIST's on a roll
after winning those two Deathmatches.

349
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,184
They even have 3 members in Tier 1.

350
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,352
They're on the rampage.

351
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:06,187
TEAM KAIST HAS 3 MEMBERS IN TIER 1

352
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,189
Team KAIST, the revenants.

353
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:12,360
The Deathmatches seem to have
put them into full concentration mode.

354
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,279
I'll hand over the host title.

355
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:18,366
Team KAIST's Oh Hyeong-seok
ceded his host title

356
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,368
to his teammate, Choi Yu-chan.

357
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,079
My choice is Link the Colors.

358
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,166
In Link the Colors,
you must memorize a colorized board.

359
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,626
You'll then name one cell
that has the displayed color

360
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,545
with another one
that can be linked to that cell.

361
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:31,880
STARTING COLOR: YELLOW, NAMED CELLS: 1, 3

362
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:36,092
The contestant who earns four points first
wins the game.

363
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,055
Two contestants challenged
Team KAIST's Choi Yu-chan.

364
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,098
I will play against Team Yonsei.

365
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,100
Here's your question.

366
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,897
This is the nastiest game yet.

367
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,775
There's no way.
I don't think I can do this.

368
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,237
If a certain combination of colors
was repeated on the board,

369
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,323
like the red-yellow cells
and the yellow-red cells,

370
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,657
I memorized them as a set.

371
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,826
Then, regardless of the starting color,

372
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,162
I could use the set as my answer.

373
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,291
The time for memorization is over.

374
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,544
Please start the game with the color blue.

375
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,172
TEAM KAIST'S CHOI YU-CHAN GOES FIRST
I will go with 1, 6.

376
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,341
One, six. That is correct.

377
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,885
I will go with 2, 13.

378
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,763
Two, thirteen. That is correct.

379
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,599
I will go with 16, 21.

380
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,185
Sixteen and twenty-one.

381
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,395
That is incorrect.

382
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,023
I will go with 14, 16.

383
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:33,650
That is correct.

384
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,027
Seven, twelve. That is incorrect.

385
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,320
TEAM KAIST WAS INCORRECT

386
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,322
I will go with 3, 5.

387
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,158
Three, five. That is correct.

388
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,036
TEAM YONSEI CAN WIN
WITH JUST 1 MORE POINT

389
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,123
TEAM POSTECH AT RISK OF BECOMING
THE LOWEST-SCORING TEAM

390
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,916
I will go with 7, 4.

391
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,461
Seven, four. That is correct.

392
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,758
I will go with 23, 22.

393
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,513
YONSEI: 3, KAIST: 2
JEONG-HUN'S ANSWER WILL DECIDE THE MATCH

394
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,599
Twenty-three, twenty-two. That is correct.

395
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:09,269
Team Yonsei's Im Jeong-hun
won four points first.

396
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,895
The game ends in his victory.

397
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:17,402
TEAM YONSEI'S JEONG-HUN REACHES TIER 3
You'll be moved up a tier.

398
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,364
Team POSTECH will end up
in the Deathmatch, then.

399
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,366
CURRENT STANDINGS
TEAM KAIST: 1ST PLACE

400
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,077
TEAM POSTECH: LAST PLACE

401
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,163
My choice is Link the Colors.

402
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,415
TEAM POSTECH, LEE JU-YEONG

403
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,875
Let us have just one.

404
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,170
Keep your hand down.

405
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,756
Won't he choose Team POSTECH?

406
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,884
TEAM OXFORD, LEE SEUNG-CHAN

407
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,553
No, don't. Please give us this one.

408
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:47,724
Team Yonsei's Im Jeong-hun,
please select your opponent.

409
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,352
Let's have faith in Jeong-hun.

410
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,605
I will play against Team Oxford.

411
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,655
Yonsei didn't choose POSTECH
to have them go to the Deathmatch.

412
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,157
They took away POSTECH's chances.

413
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,117
Here's your question.

414
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,047
The time for memorization is over.

415
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,925
Please start the game with the color red.

416
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,761
I will go with 1, 10.

417
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,721
One, ten. That is correct.

418
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,057
I will go with 11, 16.

419
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:30,767
What?

420
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:32,811
He's wrong.

421
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,355
Eleven, sixteen. That is incorrect.

422
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,816
I will go with 16, 14.

423
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,526
I will go with 19, 25.

424
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,277
I will go with 8, 12.

425
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,570
That is correct.

426
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,156
Team Yonsei's Im Jeong-hun
won four points first.

427
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,825
The game ends in his victory.

428
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,495
Jeong-hun doesn't disappoint.

429
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,039
I can't believe
he could memorize all that.

430
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,959
TEAM YONSEI'S JEONG-HUN REACHES TIER 2
You will be moved up a tier.

431
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:59,546
I thought I could take out anyone
in Link the Colors.

432
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,964
I felt really confident.

433
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,969
I will go with 7, 22.

434
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,846
I will go with 11, 17.

435
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,557
I will go with 15, 25.

436
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,101
Fifteen, twenty-five. That is correct.

437
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:15,270
He's killing it.

438
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,273
TEAM YONSEI'S IM JEONG-HUN
CAN REACH TIER 1 WITH A WIN

439
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,941
What's the score? Are they tied at two?

440
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,317
It's 3 to 2.

441
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,278
Who's winning? Is it Jeong-hun?

442
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,697
I will go with 1, 2.

443
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,408
One, two. That is correct.

444
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,743
It's 3 to 3 now.

445
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,161
Please get one wrong.

446
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,122
I will go with 8, 14.

447
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,042
Eight, fourteen. That is correct.

448
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,712
THE 2ND PLAYER GETS 1 MORE TURN
EVEN IF THE 1ST PLAYER WINS 4 POINTS

449
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,048
Come on, Yu-chan. Score a point for us.

450
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,425
Remember what you saw.

451
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,969
I will go with 20, 5.

452
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,138
Twenty, five.

453
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,349
That is incorrect.

454
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,977
Team Yonsei's Im Jeong-hun
won four points first.

455
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,479
3 WINS IN A ROW
The game ends in his victory.

456
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,485
Team Yonsei's Im Jeong-hun reached Tier 1.

457
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:08,531
CURRENT STANDINGS
TEAM KAIST: 1ST PLACE

458
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,325
BOTTOM 2: POSTECH, OXFORD

459
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,203
It'll be Team Oxford
versus Team POSTECH, then.

460
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,290
Team Oxford is our competition now.

461
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:20,835
If no one challenges Jeong-hun,
one of you needs to go for it.

462
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,004
- If I lose, we'll be left with no points.
- I know.

463
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,466
I'll hand over the host title
to Park Se-hwan.

464
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,386
Team Yonsei's Park Se-hwan,
please step forward

465
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,930
and select the next game.

466
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,224
My choice is Ladder Assembly.

467
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,103
- Can you do the ladders well?
- Yes, I can.

468
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,146
TEAM OXFORD, HAH EUN

469
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,606
TEAM SNU, YUK JUN-HYEONG

470
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,692
TEAM POSTECH, LEE JU-YEONG, JEON JI-SEONG
About time.

471
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,319
I doubt he'd choose anyone
from Team POSTECH.

472
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,280
I will play
against Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong.

473
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,908
There are only two games left.

474
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,244
I think we can take on Team Oxford.

475
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:58,164
At the moment, Team Oxford
is in the lead with one point.

476
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:02,752
But if a member of Team POSTECH
reaches Tier 3,

477
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,797
while a member of Team Oxford
is moved down a tier,

478
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,133
the two teams will be tied.

479
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:11,636
But as the team with the bigger tier sum
will be declared the loser,

480
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,847
Team Oxford will end up in last place.

481
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,057
Here's your question.

482
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,311
What the heck is that?

483
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,648
That's one heck of a diagonal line.

484
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:25,567
- Look at that.
- What is up with that?

485
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:36,327
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong,
please state your answer.

486
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,581
My answer is 2, 1, 3, 5, 4.

487
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,584
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong.
That is incorrect.

488
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:47,213
My strategy was
narrowing down to two possible cases

489
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,215
and checking one of them out quickly.

490
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:54,054
Out of the five ladders, I tried to tackle
the ones with fewer rungs first.

491
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:57,098
Doing so helped to figure out
the destinations of three ladders.

492
00:25:57,182 --> 00:26:00,393
With the two remaining ladders,
rather than checking them myself,

493
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:04,689
I chose to gamble on the 50% chance
and try out one of my answers.

494
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:05,899
Even if I got it wrong,

495
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:10,070
my opponent would have been shaken
by my quick response.

496
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,197
With only ten seconds given to an answer,

497
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,742
he would likely get flustered
and waste away the ten seconds.

498
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:20,163
Your ten seconds have passed.
Both of you may answer now.

499
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,665
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong,
please state your answer.

500
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,502
My answer is 2, 5, 3, 1, 4.

501
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,380
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong.
That is correct.

502
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,758
You will now be acting as the new host,

503
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,928
YUK JUN-HYEONG REACHES TIER 3
and you will also be moved up a tier.

504
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,514
My choice is Ladder Assembly.

505
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,015
Please raise your hand.

506
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,101
Give us a way out.

507
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,436
- Please.
- Pick us!

508
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,896
Provoke him or something.

509
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,609
I will play against Team Oxford's Hah Eun.

510
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:55,782
This match could decide my team's fate,
so that put me under a lot of pressure.

511
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,743
Here's your question.

512
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:01,996
Damn it.

513
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:04,958
- Six ladders.
- I know.

514
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,127
Look at the state of those ladders.

515
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:10,380
How are you supposed
to even go down those things?

516
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:20,056
I think it's 1, 3, 2, 4 in the middle.
That's what I think.

517
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,310
That made me jump. I was so startled.

518
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,940
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong,
please state your answer.

519
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:34,237
My answer is 5, 1, 3, 2, 4, 6.

520
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,950
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong.
That is correct.

521
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:44,039
- How did he get it so fast?
- That was amazing.

522
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,081
Totally.

523
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:48,335
TEAM SNU'S YUK JUN-HYEONG REACHES TIER 2
You'll be moved up a tier.

524
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,754
Team Oxford's Hah Eun
will be moved down a tier.

525
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:51,838
HAH EUN IS ON TIER 6

526
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:56,134
Only one game remains
for the Pyramid Game.

527
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:59,137
If a member of Team POSTECH
wins the final game

528
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,097
and reaches Tier 3,

529
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:06,269
Team Oxford will be declared as the loser
as their sum of the tiers is bigger.

530
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:09,022
TEAM POSTECH, LEE JU-YEONG

531
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:12,025
TEAM OXFORD, CHOI WON-JIN

532
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:20,450
It wouldn't be a stretch to say
I had the final say

533
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,370
in which team would get eliminated.

534
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,832
I will play
against Team POSTECH's Lee Ju-yeong.

535
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:31,586
I thought it'd be unfair for them

536
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,172
to face the Deathmatch
without getting a fighting chance,

537
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:37,884
so I selected Ju-yeong
and did my best in the game,

538
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,261
so that the best man could win.

539
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,057
Just relax.

540
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,852
Team POSTECH's Lee Ju-yeong,
please step forward.

541
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,361
I considered Yuk Jun-hyeong
as a strong contender.

542
00:28:56,444 --> 00:29:00,240
But I steeled myself not to back down
and told myself I could take him.

543
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,743
Here's your question.

544
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,122
We're counting on you, SNU.

545
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,542
Let's make a dramatic twist.

546
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,169
Please, Ju-yeong.

547
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,354
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong,
please state your answer.

548
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,773
My answer is 3, 4, 5, 2, 4, 1.

549
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:34,774
No, wait.

550
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,736
TEAM SNU'S YUK JUN-HYEONG
MENTIONED 4 TWICE

551
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,698
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong.
That is incorrect.

552
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,660
Man. I can't stand the suspense.

553
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:50,165
My answer is 3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1.

554
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:56,296
Team POSTECH's Lee Ju-yeong.
That is incorrect.

555
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:10,310
I think the answer is 3, 5, 6, 2, 4, 1.

556
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,073
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong,
please state your answer.

557
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,825
The answer is 3, 5, 6, 2, 4, 1.

558
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,912
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong.
That is correct.

559
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,206
TEAM OXFORD: 1 POINT

560
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,499
That was close.

561
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,753
TEAM POSTECH: ZERO POINTS
SET TO COMPETE IN THE DEATHMATCH

562
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,340
Team SNU's Yuk Jun-hyeong reached Tier 1.

563
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,259
That concludes Pyramid Game.

564
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,762
- I did it.
- Well done.

565
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,057
At least he gave us a shot.

566
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,101
Let's shake hands with them
before we leave.

567
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:56,481
The final results of each team
will now be announced.

568
00:30:56,564 --> 00:31:00,151
Team KAIST placed 1st with 12 points.

569
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:03,738
I was over the moon about the results.

570
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:06,741
It felt like a reward
for surviving two Deathmatches.

571
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:10,370
This season's Team KAIST is much better
than the one from last season.

572
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:11,454
They're so good.

573
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:14,582
There's no doubt
about Team KAIST's skills.

574
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,584
Yeah, I was amazed, too.

575
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:20,839
It was like a wake-up call,
teaching us not to get complacent.

576
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,632
Team SNU placed second

577
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,509
with eight points.

578
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:29,305
Team Yonsei placed 3rd with 4 points.

579
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:31,433
That's such a relief.

580
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:33,309
You're the man, Jeong-hun.

581
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:34,978
- You saved us.
- We'll treat you with respect.

582
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,980
- That does make me feel good.
- You're amazing.

583
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:39,566
- We should treat you as our uncle.
- Hands down.

584
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:40,734
Let's call him Father.

585
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:44,821
Team Oxford is placed 4th with 1 point.

586
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:48,241
Team POSTECH is placed 5th with 0 points.

587
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,326
As Team POSTECH placed last,

588
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:53,288
they will participate
in today's Deathmatch.

589
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:55,707
I should've won that match. I'm sorry.

590
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,792
We know you did your best.

591
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,462
It was intense until the very end.

592
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:02,505
- It was a narrow escape.
- I know.

593
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:03,882
PYRAMID GAME, FINAL RESULTS

594
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:08,345
TEAM POSTECH: FACES THE DEATHMATCH
TEAM KAIST: SECURES THE BENEFIT

595
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,848
As the winner,

596
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:15,435
Team KAIST has secured the benefit
for the next main match.

597
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,525
Damn it. I'm so jealous.
It's a huge game-changer.

598
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,818
Tell me about it.

599
00:32:24,235 --> 00:32:26,446
Team POSTECH, you came in last.

600
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:31,409
Please go to the Deathmatch Hall
and wait for your opponent to join you.

601
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,119
Let's go.

602
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,959
My heart lurched just now.

603
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,130
I'll never forget how it felt
to head out for the Deathmatch.

604
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:45,674
That was us from yesterday.

605
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,474
I was determined not to go down like this.

606
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,444
Just as Team KAIST made their way back,

607
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:10,365
Team POSTECH will also come back
stronger than ever.

608
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,743
- All the red teams are gone.
- Yeah.

609
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:15,161
Everyone here is in blue.

610
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,540
And we're left with strong opponents only.

611
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:20,625
None of them are pushovers.

612
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:26,631
All teams, please return
to your base camps.

613
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,097
- I don't like this.
- What now?

614
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:35,849
This doesn't look good to me.

615
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:36,891
What happened here?

616
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,644
Someone gave our base camp a downgrade.

617
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,981
Is it going to be something like
taking exams? Like the CSAT?

618
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,483
It had better not be. I'm going home then.

619
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,864
We should never underestimate the others.
That's why we should focus on strategies.

620
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,991
Other contestants
are equally as good as us.

621
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,243
Anyone could win
if we all had the same plan.

622
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:56,661
That's why strategies matter.

623
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:58,413
- It boils down to concentration.
- Right.

624
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:01,583
Let's put that benefit to good use.

625
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:05,337
I wonder what today's benefit could be.

626
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,504
The benefit match

627
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:10,133
was impactful enough
to send a team to the Deathmatch.

628
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,844
- I wonder what the benefit will be.
- Me, too.

629
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,347
Whatever the benefit could be,

630
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,849
we won't be going home today.

631
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,100
That's for certain.

632
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,435
Team SNU...

633
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:21,644
We can't go down yet.

634
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,980
We're not extras.
We're the lead characters.

635
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:28,735
All teams. Please gather
in the Main Hall for the main match.

636
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:29,944
- Come on.
- Let's go.

637
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,821
Shall we do our chant?

638
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,073
One, two, three.

639
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:34,616
- Let's go, Team KAIST!
- Let's go, Team KAIST!

640
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,289
Today's main match is

641
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,209
CSAT without Exam Papers.

642
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:45,710
CSAT?

643
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:47,420
Why are they doing this to us?

644
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:49,673
Unbelievable.

645
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,675
Do we have to take the CSAT again?

646
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:54,594
Who here has taken the CSAT?

647
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:56,846
It'll be easier
to count those who haven't.

648
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,807
Raise your hand if you never took it.

649
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:01,559
Who hasn't taken the CSAT?

650
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:06,690
- That's more than I expected.
- A good many people.

651
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,858
- That's not bad.
- We might have a chance.

652
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,861
- Team SNU!
- Come on, you guys.

653
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:15,073
Why do we have
so many CSAT takers on our team?

654
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:16,783
They all had good grades, too.

655
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,994
Gyu-min attended a gifted school
and still received top grades.

656
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:21,996
STARTED SEOUL SCIENCE HIGH EARLY,
TOP GRADES IN CSAT

657
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,873
Jun-hyeong,
you only got two questions wrong.

658
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:25,208
Yeah, only two.

659
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:28,294
Unbelievable.

660
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:31,131
SNU will have such a huge advantage.

661
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:34,050
It could be a landslide win for SNU.

662
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:36,553
In CSAT without Exam Papers,

663
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:39,264
you'll only be given answer sheets.

664
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:43,935
You'll have to figure out the answers
by studying the scores you receive.

665
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:48,440
The team with the highest score
will be declared the winner of the game.

666
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:53,194
All teams will take
10 mock exams and 1 CSAT.

667
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:57,407
The mock exam results
won't be reflected in your final scores.

668
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:01,661
Your rank in this game will be decided
solely based on the final CSAT score.

669
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,788
It sounds like a debugging game.

670
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,791
All questions have five options.

671
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,795
Only one of them is the correct answer.

672
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,341
While there are
five possible options to choose from,

673
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:18,219
each option will be chosen 3 times
as answers to the 15 questions.

674
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:23,558
EACH OPTION WILL SERVE
AS ANSWERS TO 3 QUESTIONS

675
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,352
So, each option
will be picked three times?

676
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,771
The exam consists
of twelve 10-point questions,

677
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,357
and three 30-point questions.

678
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,443
The maximum score will be 210 points.

679
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,821
It'll be important to get the 30-pointers.

680
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:40,158
After the results of the 3rd
and 6th mock exams are released,

681
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:44,329
all teams will be given a clue
on the 30-point questions.

682
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:45,955
CLUES ON 30-POINT QUESTIONS TO BE REVEALED

683
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,625
This tests our reasoning skills.
It's a pure logic puzzle.

684
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:52,337
After the 6th and the 9th mock exams,

685
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,465
you can negotiate
with another team and find one partner

686
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:59,469
to exchange up to two answer sheets
of your choice.

687
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,013
- Information can be exchanged, then.
- That's nice.

688
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:06,184
If you fail to reach an agreement
within the time limit,

689
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:10,313
your answer sheet for that mock exam
will be shared with everyone.

690
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:11,648
ANSWER SHEET TO BE REVEALED

691
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,608
Those are the rules of the game.

692
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:18,488
If a tie occurs, the rank will be decided
based on the order of answer submissions.

693
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:23,827
The team at the lowest rank
will face the Deathmatch.

694
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,247
There's a high chance a tie occurs,
so we have to move at full speed.

695
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:28,873
I feel good about our chances.

696
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:31,876
We have to win when we have the benefit.
We shouldn't settle for less.

697
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,795
We shouldn't get complacent.

698
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,964
- I have my eyes on winning.
- We have to win.

699
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:37,882
- Gear yourselves to full throttle, okay?
- Okay.

700
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:41,261
All teams,
please start discussing your strategies.

701
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:44,180
You'll be given 20 minutes.

702
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,642
Can you tell us
what you figured out, Jun-hyeong?

703
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:50,020
- There are 15 questions in total.
- Right.

704
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:53,732
Each has 5 possible options,
which serve as the answer 3 times each.

705
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:55,650
- Yeah, exactly.
- Okay, then.

706
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:58,445
- So, the sum of the options should be 30.
- Right.

707
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:00,113
THE SUM OF EACH OPTION'S ANSWERS EQUALS 30

708
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:03,283
Let's say we answered all questions
with Option 1 and got 50 points.

709
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:06,119
That means Option 1
is an answer to a 30-pointer.

710
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:10,123
CHOOSING ONLY 1 OPTION TO DEDUCE
WHICH QUESTION IS WORTH 30 POINTS

711
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:11,958
- You're right.
- With this method,

712
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,837
we can figure out which options
are answers to the 30-pointers.

713
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,340
ABLE TO LOCATE
WHICH QUESTIONS ARE WORTH 30 POINTS

714
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:21,426
We know each option
is used as an answer three times.

715
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:23,053
So, I thought,

716
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:26,014
if we choose Option 1
for the first 5 questions

717
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:28,224
and leave the rest blank...

718
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:30,393
This was my initial strategy.

719
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,187
We have 15 questions in total.

720
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,856
We know that each option
should be used three times.

721
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:37,734
So, if we answered 5 questions
with Option 1 on the 1st mock exam

722
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:40,570
and repeat the process on the 2nd exam,
but with the last 5 questions,

723
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:45,241
we could learn the counts
of correct answers in the three parts.

724
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,453
The fact that each option
is used three times

725
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:51,498
is an important lead
in CSAT without Exam Papers.

726
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:53,249
Here is an example.

727
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,711
Let's use Option 1 on only 5 questions
on each mock exam 3 times.

728
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,714
If the 1st exam's results showed
that it had 1 correct answer

729
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:02,717
and the 2nd one showed
that it had 2 correct answers,

730
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:05,595
the quota for that option is filled,

731
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,432
so the same option will not appear
as an answer on the third answer sheet.

732
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:12,894
The problem is that we have 30-pointers.

733
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:14,562
We could be deceived by them.

734
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:18,358
If we divide the 15 questions
into 2 different sections,

735
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:21,277
- we could try creating an overlap--
- That's what I was thinking, too.

736
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:23,530
I'll give you an example.

737
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:25,824
Let's say the 1st mock exam
yields 30 points

738
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:29,244
and the 2nd one yields 0 points.

739
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,830
30 POINTS

740
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:34,332
NO POINTS

741
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,376
That narrows down our cases by telling us

742
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,670
that Option 1 is the answer
to 3 questions among the first 5.

743
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:39,754
THREE 10-POINTERS IN THE 1ST SECTION

744
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,631
That turned out to be a valuable find.

745
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:44,467
STRATEGY: LEARN WHERE EACH OPTION
SERVES AS AN ANSWER IN SECTIONS

746
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:47,220
- The 30-pointers are a pain.
- Yeah, it's now tricky to tell

747
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,639
if 30 points mean
three 10-pointers or 30-pointer.

748
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:51,933
- This just came to me.
- Yeah?

749
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,853
We can confirm
which are 30-pointers after 4 mock exams.

750
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,565
Four trials can determine which are which.

751
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:04,029
This is how we'll answer.

752
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:08,158
For the 1st exam,
we'll draw a line after Question 8.

753
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:10,076
- After that--
- That looks promising.

754
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,453
Right?

755
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:15,790
Adopting the binary system
can determine where the 30-pointers are.

756
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:18,126
If that option were the answer
to a 30-pointer, that is.

757
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,044
Right.

758
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:23,465
We decided to use this computer algorithm
called the binary search.

759
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,216
SNU'S STRATEGY: BINARY SEARCH

760
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,136
NARROW DOWN THE SEARCH
BY DIVIDING THE RANGE IN HALF

761
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:30,930
We'd quickly figure out which options
were used for 30-pointers.

762
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,057
OPTION 1 HAS A 30-POINT ANSWER

763
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,642
We'll then use this method
for questions 1 to 8 first,

764
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:38,063
then repeat the process
but only mark half of the range each time.

765
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:40,273
40 POINTS EACH TIME

766
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:43,026
If all 4 attempts got more than 30 points,

767
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:45,904
that means the only common element,
Question 1 would be worth 30 points.

768
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:49,949
STRATEGY: USE BINARY SEARCH
TO DETERMINE 30-POINT QUESTIONS' LOCATION

769
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,910
If we can confirm
the 30-pointer's rough location,

770
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:54,371
we can then pinpoint
where those questions exactly are.

771
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,668
- That sounds good to me.
- Since we all agree, let's do it.

772
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:03,546
- I think this is a great idea.
- Yeah, it's really neat.

773
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:08,051
We need to decide on two things.

774
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,429
We need a strategy
for the first mock exam.

775
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:16,267
At least 1 team will mark
all answers with Option 1.

776
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,978
- But why?
- But that would be so pointless.

777
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:22,982
That will only tell us
which option was used for a 30-pointer.

778
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,026
They'd tell us
where 30-pointers are anyway.

779
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,238
HINTS WILL BE GIVEN LATER ON
We don't need this now. Scrap it.

780
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:32,409
Why don't we mark random options
for the first mock exam?

781
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:35,120
That will be our baseline comparison.

782
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:37,706
- We need one later on, anyway.
- That is true.

783
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:41,584
We'd submit a randomly marked answer sheet
for the first mock exam

784
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:44,754
and use it as our guide
if that got us a high score.

785
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,172
STRATEGY: SET A BASELINE FIRST

786
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:47,132
Here's my suggestion.

787
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:49,676
I'll draw up the answer sheet
for questions 1 to 5.

788
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:53,346
We mark this part multiple times.

789
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:55,765
We'd have 15 questions, right?

790
00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:00,854
We'd divide them
into 3 sections of 5 questions.

791
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:02,605
Then, we'd analyze them.

792
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,651
ONLY 5 QUESTIONS WOULD BE MARKED
OUT OF THE TOTAL OF 15

793
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:09,446
We decided early on
that a few certain leads had more value

794
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:13,199
than a bunch of uncertain ones
in this particular game.

795
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:16,953
That was why we thought this strategy was
worth the many attempts it would need.

796
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,580
In summary,

797
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:21,541
we'd have 9 mock exams left,
starting from the 2nd to the 10th.

798
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:22,959
We'll divide them into three

799
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:26,629
and devote each set
to analyzing each part.

800
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:31,051
We'll then assemble instances
with the highest scores.

801
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:34,179
Won't that be for the best?
That's the summary of our strategy.

802
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:35,638
STRATEGY: GATHER THE ONES WITH HIGH SCORES

803
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:38,433
The first mock exam
has to have good results.

804
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:39,684
I know.

805
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:42,062
Trust me. I'll consult the higher powers.

806
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:46,483
The total is 210 points, right?

807
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:50,737
We need to milk that number
for all its worth.

808
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,780
Agreed.

809
00:42:52,113 --> 00:42:54,741
In CSAT without Exam Papers,
there are twelve 10-point questions

810
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:56,451
and three 30-point questions.

811
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,870
The maximum score you can get is 210.

812
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:01,122
MAXIMUM OF 210 POINTS ACROSS 15 QUESTIONS

813
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:05,126
We need to choose
what to remove from the 210.

814
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,712
- We should take out one of the options.
- Agreed.

815
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:10,590
We could just fill the empty spots
once we're done analyzing.

816
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:14,511
One strategy of mine
was leaving out Option 5 altogether.

817
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:18,223
We would only use Options 1 to 4
to complete our mock exams.

818
00:43:18,306 --> 00:43:22,018
Then, we would analyze the results
after five mock exams.

819
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:24,646
Since we already know
that the perfect score is 210,

820
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:28,108
if we got a total of 180 points
by only using Options 1 to 4,

821
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:30,819
then we would know that Option 5
doesn't have any 30-pointer questions.

822
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:34,531
Or if we got a total of 160 points
by only using Options 1 to 4,

823
00:43:34,614 --> 00:43:37,575
that would mean that Option 5
has one of the 30-pointer questions.

824
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:43,957
Our strategy focuses on using the fact
that we know the perfect score is 210.

825
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:48,253
We'll only get a 5-minute meeting
for the first 5 mock exams anyway.

826
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:50,171
To make the most of those five minutes,

827
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:53,883
we should decide how to answer
the first five mock exams now.

828
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:56,636
We devised a system

829
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,974
where rows of Options 1 to 4
and blanks would shift for each exam.

830
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:05,145
You have one minute left
to discuss your strategy.

831
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:06,980
CSAT WITHOUT EXAM PAPERS

832
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:08,398
I'm no expert in psychology,

833
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:11,860
but most teams will mark Option 1
for all questions of the 1st mock exam.

834
00:44:12,485 --> 00:44:16,364
Since that is likely,
we should ditch Option 1.

835
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:18,575
- Let's start with Option 3.
- We'll use Options 3, 4, and 5.

836
00:44:18,658 --> 00:44:20,035
Forget about Options 1 and 2.

837
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:23,163
We can exchange our information
to get hints for Option 1.

838
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:26,041
Let's not use Option 1
for our 1st mock exam answer sheet.

839
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:29,127
Let's start with Options 3, 4, and 5
and go from there.

840
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:33,423
Some other teams might use Option 1.
Let's see the others' scores.

841
00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:35,675
With some luck,
we can get their information.

842
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:38,845
TEAM SNU AND TEAM KAIST RULE OUT OPTION 1

843
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:41,765
The time for the strategy meeting is up.

844
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:45,935
All teams. Please gather
in the Main Hall for the main match.

845
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:51,066
Keep it down. One, two, three.

846
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:52,359
- Let's go, Team KAIST!
- Let's go, Team KAIST!

847
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:54,152
Team Ox.

848
00:44:54,235 --> 00:44:55,862
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

849
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,448
- What was that?
- I don't know.

850
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:00,116
- All I heard was "Team Ox."
- Same here.

851
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,951
I thought they said, "Bottle it up."

852
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,289
Your chant keeps on changing.

853
00:45:06,956 --> 00:45:08,166
We're fickle, you see.

854
00:45:08,249 --> 00:45:09,959
Please look forward to our next chant.

855
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:14,714
We'll now begin the main match,
CSAT without Exam Papers.

856
00:45:15,131 --> 00:45:17,676
I will now announce
the benefit of the game.

857
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:19,552
The benefit is

858
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,471
an additional answer sheet.

859
00:45:27,602 --> 00:45:29,688
I knew it. They get one more mock exam.

860
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:31,773
That's great.

861
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:36,277
The benefit can be used once
in one of the 1st to 6th mock exams.

862
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:38,530
Team KAIST can submit
two answer sheets then.

863
00:45:38,613 --> 00:45:39,823
ABLE TO SUBMIT TWO ANSWER SHEETS

864
00:45:39,906 --> 00:45:42,909
The extra answer sheet
can't be traded with other teams,

865
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:44,786
and its score won't be revealed.

866
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:46,287
NON-SHAREABLE SHEET
ITS SCORE WILL BE KEPT SECRET

867
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:48,498
Let's begin the main match,
CSAT without Exam Papers.

868
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,585
The first mock exam starts now.

869
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:56,172
You have five minutes
to submit your answer sheet.

870
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,803
We'll submit Options 3 and 4 on this turn.

871
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:03,972
We'll be submitting
two answer sheets at once.

872
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:07,017
Make sure not to check 3 on both.
Use 3 and 4 on each.

873
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,270
Our initial strategy relied on the fact
that we could narrow down the answers

874
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:13,648
by creating an overlap of 5 questions
on 2 answer sheets.

875
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,191
OVERLAP ANSWERS TO FIND THE 30-POINTERS

876
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:18,820
Instead of choosing just Option 3,
we chose Options 3 and 4 separately

877
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:21,197
to quickly gain information
on the two options.

878
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,574
STRATEGY REVISED TO CHECK OPTIONS 3 AND 4

879
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:24,784
The extra answer sheet's score
won't be revealed, right?

880
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:25,910
- Right.
- That's nice.

881
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,456
TEAM SNU'S BASE CAMP

882
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:32,292
I'm betting on Option 3
as an answer to a 30-pointer.

883
00:46:34,252 --> 00:46:38,590
TEAM SNU'S STRATEGY: FIND OUT IF OPTION 3
IS THE ANSWER TO ANY OF THE 30-POINTERS

884
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:41,509
For the first mock exam,
let's mark options randomly.

885
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:44,220
TEAM YONSEI'S STRATEGY:
SET A BASELINE FOR FUTURE COMPARISONS

886
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:45,472
He's talking to the exam gods.

887
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:48,141
That's not it.

888
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:53,438
I'll worship you
if you get 170 points or so.

889
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:55,732
I think these are the correct answers.

890
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:58,777
If no one objects,
this is the answer we'll use.

891
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,986
- I like it as is.
- Same here.

892
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,404
YONSEI'S BASELINE ANSWER SHEET

893
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,782
First off, are we using that system?

894
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:05,200
Let's use it for this time.

895
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:06,576
- As is?
- Yeah.

896
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,412
We only have five minutes,
so I had to be sure.

897
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:12,248
TEAM OXFORD MARKS THE ANSWER SHEET
AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED

898
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:15,585
Just how many correct answers
could we get with just ten attempts?

899
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:18,505
I would say it's impossible
to get all 15 right.

900
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:20,382
The total cases are the factorial of 15

901
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:22,467
divided by the factorial of 3
taken to the power of 5, right?

902
00:47:23,843 --> 00:47:27,639
A TOTAL OF 168,168,000
POSSIBLE ANSWER SHEET VARIANTS

903
00:47:27,722 --> 00:47:30,433
- Would any team get everything right?
- There's just no way.

904
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,560
There are way too many possibilities.

905
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:35,605
You can't get all 15 questions right
after 10 reviews.

906
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:39,484
Considering the game design,
I didn't think that a strategy existed

907
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:40,985
that would get you 210 points.

908
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:44,197
It didn't seem possible
with only ten chances to review.

909
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:46,574
Could we get 210 points
on the 10th mock exam?

910
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:48,827
If we can get ten more points,
submitting late won't matter.

911
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:49,911
Hold on.

912
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:51,538
- We can't go about it like that.
- Getting 210?

913
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:54,457
Our goal has to be
to get 210 points on the 10th attempt.

914
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,835
We should come up with a plan
to get there first.

915
00:47:56,918 --> 00:48:01,965
We'll consider changing courses
if something doesn't work out.

916
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:04,634
We shouldn't settle on surviving
when we have the benefit.

917
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:07,637
I believed that we had to aim
to win with the perfect score.

918
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:10,724
The first mock exam is over.

919
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:12,308
The second mock exam...

920
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:13,393
The third mock exam...

921
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:15,770
The fourth mock exam is over.

922
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:21,985
Your final CSAT scores will be announced.

923
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:23,820
Team...

924
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:28,324
You scored 210 points.
It's a perfect score.

925
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:33,288
WHICH TEAM SCORED 210 POINTS?

926
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:39,794
The first mock exam is over.

927
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:43,423
I'll now announce the results
of the first mock exam.

928
00:48:43,506 --> 00:48:44,841
Let's see.

929
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,470
Team Oxford, ten points.

930
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:53,224
Ten points puts us in a good place
to do some debugging.

931
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:55,268
Team SNU, 50 points.

932
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:57,979
OPTION 3 HAS A 30-POINT ANSWER
Not bad. No, it's actually good.

933
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,231
This is great.

934
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:02,275
Team Yonsei, 20 points.

935
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:03,193
Damn.

936
00:49:03,276 --> 00:49:05,612
That means we got none of the 30-pointers.

937
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:07,655
Team KAIST, 50 points.

938
00:49:08,615 --> 00:49:09,949
Yes!

939
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:12,243
We went with Option 3, right?

940
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:15,872
We know for a fact that Option 3
is an answer to a 30-pointer.

941
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:18,458
Let's begin the second mock exam.

942
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:21,628
We got 50 with Option 3
and 20 with Option 4.

943
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:25,215
OPTION 3: 50 POINTS, OPTION 4: 20 POINTS

944
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:27,050
Let's mark Option 4 for the 2nd one.

945
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:28,968
- Right.
- I agree.

946
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:33,765
CHOOSING OPTION 4
TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION

947
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:35,475
I bet SNU and KAIST
used the same strategy.

948
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:38,436
We can pretty much guess
the algorithm they used, right?

949
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,647
Team SNU was just like that
in the first season.

950
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:43,608
They banked on their smarts
and believed they would get it all right.

951
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:45,819
- They just kept going.
- That won't work with this game.

952
00:49:45,902 --> 00:49:47,237
Are all SNU students like that?

953
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,864
The second mock exam is over.

954
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:53,493
All teams,
please submit your answer sheets.

955
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:57,330
I'm so jealous of your benefit.

956
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:00,166
We've already used it,
so we're on level ground.

957
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,835
Did you use it already?

958
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:04,254
- But your envelope seems thicker.
- Really?

959
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:08,800
I'll now announce the results
of the second mock exam.

960
00:50:08,883 --> 00:50:09,968
OXFORD: 50, SNU: 10, YONSEI: 10, KAIST: 20

961
00:50:10,051 --> 00:50:12,512
- Each part has Option 4 as an answer.
- That's fixed. Great.

962
00:50:12,595 --> 00:50:13,847
Option 4 for each part.

963
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:17,267
Team KAIST used the 1st and 2nd mock exams

964
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:22,981
to confirm that each part has Option 4
as an answer to a 10-pointer.

965
00:50:23,481 --> 00:50:24,441
Shall we try Option 5?

966
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,360
I bet Team SNU went with either 1 or 5.

967
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,904
Checking Option 2 won't hurt,
especially if no one has tried.

968
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,281
- For the information trade?
- Yeah.

969
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:34,409
Then let's go with Option 2
for Questions 1 to 10.

970
00:50:35,243 --> 00:50:36,703
We'll use this for the third mock exam.

971
00:50:37,912 --> 00:50:39,539
TEAM SNU USES BINARY SEARCHING
One to four?

972
00:50:39,622 --> 00:50:41,291
- Do I mark Option 3?
- Yeah.

973
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:44,669
Don't worry about the 50 points.
I bet they're all Option 1 questions.

974
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:47,464
The teams that got 50 points
on the 1st mock exam must've done that.

975
00:50:48,214 --> 00:50:49,507
Are we still sticking to the plan?

976
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,426
We have to keep using it
until the fifth mock exam.

977
00:50:51,509 --> 00:50:55,305
STRATEGY: USE ALL OPTIONS EXCLUDING 5
ON THEIR ANSWER SHEETS

978
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:57,390
CSAT WITHOUT EXAM PAPERS
3RD MOCK EXAM

979
00:50:57,474 --> 00:51:00,852
OXFORD, SNU, YONSEI, KAIST

980
00:51:00,935 --> 00:51:03,146
I'll now announce the results
of the third mock exam.

981
00:51:03,229 --> 00:51:05,106
OXFORD: 10, SNU: 10, YONSEI: 20, KAIST: 50

982
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,858
Team KAIST, 50 points.

983
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,986
TEAM KAIST GETS ANOTHER 50 POINTS

984
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:15,325
OPTION 2, 30-POINTERS: 1, 10-POINTERS: 2

985
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:18,078
We received 50 points
for the 1st and 3rd mock exams.

986
00:51:18,536 --> 00:51:21,956
That meant that Options 2 and 3
were both answers for a 30-pointer.

987
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,333
ANSWERS TO 30-POINTERS: OPTIONS 2 AND 3

988
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:26,294
Since we've come this far,
I think we should treat 2 and 3 together.

989
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:29,005
Together? Then how's this?

990
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,926
We'll mark Option 2 on Questions 1 to 5
and Option 3 on Questions 11 to 15.

991
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:34,135
CHECKING OPTIONS 2 AND 3 TOGETHER

992
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:35,887
If that gets us a low score,

993
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:38,348
that will mean that the 30-pointers
are in the middle part.

994
00:51:39,307 --> 00:51:41,101
Team KAIST's initial strategy

995
00:51:41,184 --> 00:51:45,647
was to check the same option twice
by marking ten questions at a time.

996
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:48,608
Since they know enough
about Options 2 and 3,

997
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:50,110
they can check them together

998
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:54,322
and spare one mock exam for other uses.

999
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:56,241
TEAM KAIST SAVES A CHECKING OPPORTUNITY

1000
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:58,576
I don't know if you guys heard,

1001
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,247
but Team KAIST was so happy
when they got 50 points for the 3rd exam.

1002
00:52:02,914 --> 00:52:06,501
TEAM KAIST CHEERED OUT LOUD
AFTER HEARING THE 3RD MOCK EXAM'S RESULT

1003
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:09,045
- But that's just...
- I don't think that matters.

1004
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:11,423
But we could guess their strategy

1005
00:52:11,506 --> 00:52:13,967
if we could figure out
why they were so excited.

1006
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:17,387
What if we trade the information
and find that we have a better system?

1007
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,848
- Let's stick to the same strategy.
- All right.

1008
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:23,435
Can someone read out the numbers
for the fourth exam?

1009
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:25,562
- It's 4, 3, 3, 2, 1.
- That has a nice ring to it.

1010
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:27,856
- The 4-3-3 formation is the best.
- Of course.

1011
00:52:28,314 --> 00:52:30,275
Can you check the sheet one last time?

1012
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:32,819
I'm sure you made no mistakes.
Don't be so anxious.

1013
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:34,154
You know what CSAT is like.

1014
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:37,407
- Mark the wrong option, and you're done.
- I bet you've never made a mistake.

1015
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:40,660
I'll now announce the results
of the fourth mock exam.

1016
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:41,870
OXFORD: 50, SNU: 30, YONSEI: 40

1017
00:52:41,953 --> 00:52:44,706
KAIST: 70

1018
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:46,583
You scored 70 points.

1019
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:49,044
Wait. Hold on.

1020
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:51,671
- That makes no sense.
- Each part must have a 30-pointer.

1021
00:52:51,755 --> 00:52:54,382
- A 30-pointer in each, right?
- Wait. Hold on.

1022
00:52:55,258 --> 00:52:57,761
Seventy is a great score to have.

1023
00:52:57,844 --> 00:53:01,514
We likely got it with two 30-point answers
and one 10-point answer,

1024
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:04,142
so we could almost determine
where the two 30-pointers were.

1025
00:53:04,225 --> 00:53:07,937
ANSWERS TO 30-POINTERS: OPTIONS 2 AND 3
ONLY 1 REMAINS A MYSTERY

1026
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:10,982
With not so many chances left,
we must turn to our intuition.

1027
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:14,944
Don't you think the 30-point answers
are 2, 3, and 5 rather than 1, 2, and 3?

1028
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:17,822
- Let's use Option 5 this time.
- I think that's for the best.

1029
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:20,450
The fifth mock exam is over.

1030
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:25,580
I'll now announce the results
of the fifth mock exam.

1031
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:28,708
TEAM YONSEI SCORES ZERO POINTS

1032
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:30,460
- My gosh.
- They got a huge lead.

1033
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:33,171
We need that answer sheet.
Let's trade information with them.

1034
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:34,297
You scored zero points.

1035
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:42,222
TEAM YONSEI, ZERO POINTS

1036
00:53:42,305 --> 00:53:44,474
With the zero-point answer sheet,

1037
00:53:44,557 --> 00:53:48,186
Team Yonsei can rule out
all of the seven answers for the future.

1038
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:49,646
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED POSSIBILITIES

1039
00:53:50,146 --> 00:53:51,773
Other teams must be shaken.

1040
00:53:51,856 --> 00:53:54,150
"What strategy got them zero points?"

1041
00:53:54,484 --> 00:53:57,946
WHY DID TEAM YONSEI
ONLY ANSWER QUESTIONS 1 TO 7?

1042
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:02,033
I will now reveal the 1st hint
about the 30-pointer question.

1043
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:05,328
The sum of the 30-pointers is 19.

1044
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:06,788
THE ANSWERS ADD UP TO 19

1045
00:54:07,205 --> 00:54:10,250
We probably got 40
from a 30-pointer and a 10-pointer.

1046
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,754
That would mean
there's a 30-pointer in the 3rd part.

1047
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:16,423
CONDITION FOR 30-POINT QUESTIONS

1048
00:54:16,506 --> 00:54:19,009
It has to be at least 11.

1049
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:23,138
Considering that we have to stay
in the natural number range,

1050
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:24,889
if we calculate it like this,

1051
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:29,144
Questions 8 to 10 can't be a 30-pointer.

1052
00:54:29,227 --> 00:54:30,437
You're absolutely right.

1053
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:34,357
Why don't we mark Questions 1 to 7 only?

1054
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:38,028
- That's a good idea.
- We know there are two 30-pointers there.

1055
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:40,321
Let's go with Jeong-hun's idea.
Feed me the numbers.

1056
00:54:41,322 --> 00:54:43,533
YONSEI CONFIRMED THE WRONG ANSWERS
FOR QUESTIONS 1 TO 7

1057
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:45,076
2 AMONG THE 7 ARE 30-POINTERS

1058
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:47,787
Remember the answers we have
for the middle part.

1059
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:50,331
TEAM KAIST USED THE RESULTS
FROM THE FIRST 5 MOCK EXAMS

1060
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:51,958
TO LIST THE ANSWER COUNTS FOR EACH PART

1061
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:56,338
Our strategy was to analyze the data
by dividing 15 questions into 3 parts.

1062
00:54:56,421 --> 00:55:00,133
We figured out which option
should be used where and how many times.

1063
00:55:00,216 --> 00:55:02,635
THE DATA TEAM KAIST OBTAINED

1064
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:07,474
Then, we would deduce
the correct answers in each part.

1065
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:09,017
NUMBER OF ANSWERS FOR EACH PART

1066
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:11,978
Let's figure out the answers
for the middle part.

1067
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:13,772
This is all going so well.

1068
00:55:13,855 --> 00:55:16,191
The sixth mock exam is over.

1069
00:55:16,691 --> 00:55:19,986
OXFORD: 50, SNU: 30, YONSEI: 40, KAIST: 50
I'll now announce the results.

1070
00:55:20,403 --> 00:55:23,365
This is your 2nd hint
for the 30-point questions.

1071
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:26,451
All 30-point questions are odd-numbered.

1072
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:32,832
They gave us such a huge hint.

1073
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:35,085
Wait, does that mean
the 30-pointers are Questions 1 and 3?

1074
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:37,420
Are those three the questions
with the highest points?

1075
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,089
SNU'S CONFIRMS 1, 5, AND 13 AS 30-POINTERS

1076
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:41,341
This was our core strategy.

1077
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:44,052
"Find out one option
that has a 30-point answer,

1078
00:55:44,135 --> 00:55:47,681
and we can determine its number
in four attempts."

1079
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:50,558
The fifth mock exam is over.

1080
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:52,894
Question 13 is a 30-pointer.

1081
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,063
And its answer is Option 3.

1082
00:55:55,730 --> 00:56:01,319
FIGURED OUT THE 30-POINTER'S LOCATION
USING THE BINARY SEARCH

1083
00:56:01,736 --> 00:56:05,865
By then, we had learned
that Question 13 was a 30-pointer.

1084
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:10,120
We knew that much when it was announced
that the sum of 3 questions was 19.

1085
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:13,873
That narrowed down combinations
to Questions 1 and 5 or Questions 2 and 4.

1086
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:17,502
Then, the 2nd hint told us
that all 30-pointers were odd-numbered.

1087
00:56:17,585 --> 00:56:20,588
We could then confirm Questions 1, 5,
and 13 to be the 30-pointers.

1088
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:24,968
We need results from using Options 1 or 2.

1089
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:27,220
- Team KAIST got 70 once, right?
- Yeah.

1090
00:56:27,303 --> 00:56:28,430
Let's ask them for a trade.

1091
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,682
That'd be the best option.

1092
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:32,976
The remaining 30-pointer
has to be 3, 5, or 7.

1093
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:35,020
We only need to know which.

1094
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,939
We don't have many leads
for the first part,

1095
00:56:38,023 --> 00:56:41,067
so I want to prioritize that part
when we make the trade.

1096
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:42,819
Either SNU or Oxford would do.

1097
00:56:42,902 --> 00:56:45,572
- We can only trade with one, right?
- Right, exactly.

1098
00:56:45,655 --> 00:56:47,240
How about the 70-point sheet from KAIST?

1099
00:56:47,323 --> 00:56:48,867
That's a must, I think.

1100
00:56:49,242 --> 00:56:50,243
No other team had zero.

1101
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:51,619
With this,
they can rule out one option at least.

1102
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:53,496
Let's give them
our 5th and 6th answer sheets.

1103
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,873
Who are we trading with again?

1104
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:57,542
- Get 4th and 6th sheets from KAIST.
- That's right.

1105
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,044
- So, is that what we need?
- Yeah.

1106
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,254
I'm a great negotiator,
so I'll get them for you.

1107
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:04,716
I'm a master of bluffing, too.
I'll show you how it's done.

1108
00:57:05,258 --> 00:57:08,803
Please begin trading your answer sheets.

1109
00:57:09,637 --> 00:57:13,516
Two teams must first agree
to exchange answer sheets for information.

1110
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,269
You can trade up to two answer sheets.

1111
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:21,608
You can only trade information
with one other team.

1112
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:24,402
If the two teams fail
to reach an agreement,

1113
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:27,030
their answer sheets
for the sixth mock exam

1114
00:57:27,113 --> 00:57:29,199
will be disclosed to everyone.

1115
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:41,002
- Hey, Team KAIST.
- Yes?

1116
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:42,003
We got a zero once

1117
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:43,254
- and made some good guesses.
- I see.

1118
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,465
We have a zero with a lot of markings.
We even have a baseline to compare it.

1119
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:47,425
How many questions did you mark?

1120
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:49,135
How many do you want?

1121
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:50,553
How many would satisfy you?

1122
00:57:51,012 --> 00:57:52,722
About 10 marked answers
for the 0-point sheet.

1123
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:54,849
Let's trade our 1st exam sheet
we got 50 points on.

1124
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:57,852
- The 1st one?
- Only our teams scored 50 points for it.

1125
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,772
We marked 7 answers
on the 0-point answer sheet.

1126
00:58:00,855 --> 00:58:01,815
- Seven?
- That's right.

1127
00:58:01,898 --> 00:58:05,902
We have another sheet that used
the same answers on other questions.

1128
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:09,656
Trading with Team Yonsei
for their zero-point one isn't a bad idea.

1129
00:58:09,739 --> 00:58:12,075
That would allow you
to eliminate at least one option

1130
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:13,243
and cut down possibilities.

1131
00:58:13,326 --> 00:58:16,371
But you could easily get 50 points
by using the same options.

1132
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:19,666
We thought we might've used
the same strategy on the first exam.

1133
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:20,834
Yonsei is the better choice.

1134
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:24,337
If our strategy was the same as SNU's,
that means we got lucky with more points.

1135
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:27,549
- But Yonsei had a different strategy.
- And you can use it on your tenth exam

1136
00:58:27,632 --> 00:58:30,218
and use that one as a baseline comparison.

1137
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:32,303
You might need a hint
before the tenth exam.

1138
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:34,139
You might get confused on a key number.

1139
00:58:34,222 --> 00:58:35,306
You're such a smooth talker.

1140
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,767
It somehow feels like I'm being swindled.

1141
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:38,810
That's not true.

1142
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:40,103
He's the king of sales.

1143
00:58:40,895 --> 00:58:42,188
- Let's talk to Team Oxford.
- Should we exchange?

1144
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:44,190
You might need a hint later...

1145
00:58:45,775 --> 00:58:48,403
Will you trade with us?
We're offering a 50-point one.

1146
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:52,866
I'm sorry,
but my teammates want Team KAIST.

1147
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:54,868
Isn't Team Oxford interested?

1148
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:57,579
- Yeah, I think we're their first choice.
- We're very interested.

1149
00:58:57,662 --> 00:58:59,164
Let's not consider Team SNU.

1150
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:02,042
We had the same strategy,
and we had better luck.

1151
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:04,878
The strategies of Team SNU and Team KAIST

1152
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:08,298
may seem similar if you only consider
their first mock exam results.

1153
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:11,509
But in truth,
they are completely different.

1154
00:59:12,385 --> 00:59:16,931
While Team KAIST uses
tallies of answers in each section,

1155
00:59:17,015 --> 00:59:21,811
Team SNU prioritizes locating
the 30-point questions precisely.

1156
00:59:23,229 --> 00:59:24,773
- With who?
- Let's just make the trade.

1157
00:59:24,856 --> 00:59:26,524
- You have three minutes left.
- Hey, guys.

1158
00:59:26,941 --> 00:59:31,196
We used the benefit
because we had to before the sixth exam.

1159
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:33,281
- I'm sure you won't regret it.
- What are you offering?

1160
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:36,659
- Whatever you want.
- The 3rd and 4th. The 70 and 50 points.

1161
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:39,454
- Let's trade what each other wants.
- The 70 and 50 points?

1162
00:59:39,537 --> 00:59:42,874
We could help each other get 210 points.

1163
00:59:42,957 --> 00:59:44,209
If we're doing this,

1164
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:46,836
I want your promise
to trade after the ninth exam.

1165
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,837
Deal.

1166
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:50,715
- That'd be better for us, too.
- We're agreed, then.

1167
00:59:51,424 --> 00:59:53,468
1ST TRADE
KAIST - OXFORD, SNU - YONSEI

1168
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:55,053
KAIST: 3RD AND 4TH, OXFORD: 4TH AND 6TH

1169
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:56,638
SNU: 4TH AND 6TH, YONSEI: 4TH AND 6TH

1170
00:59:56,721 --> 00:59:58,807
Please exchange your answer sheets.

1171
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,767
SNU: 4TH AND 6TH, YONSEI: 4TH AND 6TH

1172
01:00:01,184 --> 01:00:02,310
So that's what you did?

1173
01:00:02,394 --> 01:00:03,687
I like it.

1174
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,440
You marked fewer answers than we thought.

1175
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:10,151
Thanks for making my job easier.

1176
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:12,362
- Just draw a straight line.
- Amazing.

1177
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,450
- I wish you luck.
- Thanks.

1178
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:20,620
- Let's get that perfect score.
- Oh, the perfect score...

1179
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:22,497
- Nice trading with you.
- Likewise.

1180
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:25,291
SNU NOW HAS YONSEI'S 4TH AND 6TH

1181
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,502
YONSEI NOW HAS SNU'S 4TH AND 6TH

1182
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:30,380
- Please exchange your answer sheets.
- Here's our fourth sheet.

1183
01:00:30,463 --> 01:00:32,173
OXFORD: 4TH AND 6TH, KAIST: 3RD AND 4TH

1184
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:36,678
OXFORD NOW HAS KAIST'S 3RD AND 4TH

1185
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:38,763
KAIST NOW HAS OXFORD'S 4TH AND 6TH

1186
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:41,516
Let's begin the seventh mock exam.

1187
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,894
- But we knew that already. It's useless.
- So there's nothing new.

1188
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:47,480
Damn it, we got a useless one.

1189
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:50,608
The sixth turned out to be a dud.

1190
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:52,819
They have a completely different strategy.

1191
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:56,489
We couldn't decipher the system

1192
01:00:56,573 --> 01:01:00,201
Team Oxford used to mark their answers.

1193
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:04,581
Judging by their strategy,
none of their answers would have helped.

1194
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:07,459
We were right to trade with Team KAIST.

1195
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:10,211
No correct answers here.
We can rule these out.

1196
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:11,546
OXFORD GAINS NEW INFORMATION

1197
01:01:11,629 --> 01:01:12,797
If I may say so myself,

1198
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:16,760
I think we had the perfect strategy
for the first five mock exams.

1199
01:01:16,843 --> 01:01:20,138
EVERY OPTION WAS MARKED ONCE
BESIDES OPTION 5

1200
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:21,222
In case of Option 5,

1201
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:25,143
if we subtracted the sum of our answers
from a total of 210 points,

1202
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:27,729
the result would help find the answers.

1203
01:01:27,812 --> 01:01:28,813
OPTION 5: 50 POINTS

1204
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:32,442
OPTION 5 CONFIRMED
TO BE AN ANSWER FOR A 30-POINTER

1205
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:36,905
One of Team KAIST's answer sheet
got them 70 points.

1206
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:37,864
KAIST, 70 POINTS

1207
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:41,493
We knew we'd be able to locate
the 30-pointers with that answer sheet.

1208
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,747
OPTION 2, 3, AND 5 CONFIRMED
TO BE ANSWERS FOR A 30-POINTER

1209
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:49,334
Team KAIST and we have the lead,
so we'll advance to the next round.

1210
01:01:49,417 --> 01:01:51,836
- We're way ahead of the others.
- We really are.

1211
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,546
We can get 90 points already.

1212
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,257
Another hint will tell us
where all the 30-pointers are.

1213
01:01:56,758 --> 01:01:59,135
What should we try on this mock exam?

1214
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:02,347
I feel uneasy about Options 1 and 5.

1215
01:02:02,847 --> 01:02:05,183
There's not enough information on them.

1216
01:02:05,266 --> 01:02:07,811
I'd like to get more information
on one part, at least.

1217
01:02:07,894 --> 01:02:10,355
Let's find the ones
we're sure about first.

1218
01:02:10,438 --> 01:02:12,107
That leaves us with Questions 9 and 13.

1219
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:14,317
If there's a 30-pointer,
it has to be Question 13.

1220
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:15,819
- Question 13?
- Yeah.

1221
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:18,113
TEAM YONSEI FOUND THE 30-POINTERS
If Question 13 is a 30-pointer,

1222
01:02:18,196 --> 01:02:20,407
AFTER TRADING WITH TEAM SNU
so are Questions 5 and 1.

1223
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:23,827
The 30-pointer has to be
one of these, right?

1224
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:26,496
IDENTIFIED MOST OF THE 30-POINTERS
We'll find them in 2 tries.

1225
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:27,956
Should we check Option 2?

1226
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:30,166
It must be one of the 30-pointers.

1227
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:33,420
I'll now announce the results
of the seventh mock exam.

1228
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:34,879
OXFORD: 10, SNU: 10, YONSEI: 30, KAIST: 10

1229
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:37,257
We got 10, so this can't be a 30-pointer.

1230
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,718
- I'll cross it out. I'll do it slowly.
- Okay.

1231
01:02:39,801 --> 01:02:42,679
TEAM KAIST ALSO IDENTIFIED
MOST OF THE 30-POINTERS

1232
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:44,848
Let's go with that,
and take a gamble here.

1233
01:02:44,931 --> 01:02:47,183
Why don't we take a guess here?

1234
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:49,185
We should take a small risk, at least.

1235
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,646
Let's try our luck on these two, then.

1236
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,773
Mark these with Option 3.

1237
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:55,692
We can plant wrong answers
as red herrings.

1238
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:57,944
ADDING FALSE INFORMATION
TO TRICK THEIR TRADE PARTNER

1239
01:02:58,028 --> 01:03:01,573
RED HERRINGS

1240
01:03:01,656 --> 01:03:03,408
Let's mark a few more answers.

1241
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:07,120
So, you want to slip in false answers
to gain an extra edge in the trade?

1242
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:10,749
RED HERRINGS

1243
01:03:10,832 --> 01:03:13,460
Our priority is not the trade.

1244
01:03:13,543 --> 01:03:16,755
We should focus on options
that would get us the most information.

1245
01:03:16,838 --> 01:03:17,881
OXFORD FOCUSES ON CHECKING ANSWERS

1246
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:23,053
I'll now announce the results
of the eighth mock exam.

1247
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:25,347
Team Oxford, 30 points.

1248
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,473
That rules out this one.

1249
01:03:26,556 --> 01:03:27,932
- Is Option 1 out?
- Yeah.

1250
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:31,353
Team SNU, 30 points.

1251
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:32,645
No way!

1252
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:35,899
3 ANSWERS THEY WANTED TO CHECK
TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT

1253
01:03:35,982 --> 01:03:37,108
We did it.

1254
01:03:37,525 --> 01:03:39,778
Team Yonsei, 110 points.

1255
01:03:39,861 --> 01:03:40,695
...110 points.

1256
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,199
5 ANSWERS THEY WANTED TO CHECK
TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT

1257
01:03:44,282 --> 01:03:45,283
Great job.

1258
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,370
Team KAIST, 60 points.

1259
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:51,956
All the answers we wanted to check
were right. And that's a 30-pointer.

1260
01:03:52,707 --> 01:03:54,834
I'll now announce the results
of the ninth mock exam.

1261
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:56,002
OXFORD: 0, SNU: 20, YONSEI: 10, KAIST: 0

1262
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:58,505
Now that the ninth mock exam is over,

1263
01:03:58,588 --> 01:04:01,591
you can trade up to 2 answer sheets
with 1 other team.

1264
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,969
We now have to decide
which answer sheets we should trade.

1265
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:08,139
- Why don't we ask for the 110-point one?
- I doubt Yonsei would trade it.

1266
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:09,641
But we could always ask.

1267
01:04:09,724 --> 01:04:12,602
Let's ask for that
and go for something else if they decline.

1268
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:14,437
That could better our chances.

1269
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:16,648
If Team Yonsei agrees to trade,
let's ask for these two.

1270
01:04:16,731 --> 01:04:18,191
- Agreed?
- Ones with 0 and 110?

1271
01:04:18,274 --> 01:04:20,110
Nothing stands out for others.

1272
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:23,613
I want the 7th and the 9th from SNU
or Yonsei's answers with 110 points.

1273
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:25,865
Yeah, I don't think
we have more to gain from KAIST.

1274
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:26,908
Same here.

1275
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,538
If they ask for the 8th answer sheet,
the one with 110 points,

1276
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:32,914
- we'll decline, right?
- Of course.

1277
01:04:32,997 --> 01:04:34,124
We'll just share it with everyone.

1278
01:04:34,207 --> 01:04:35,667
No, we have to trade something.

1279
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:39,963
TEAM YONSEI'S HIGHLY COVETED
110-POINT ANSWER SHEET

1280
01:04:40,046 --> 01:04:43,758
We need to see the bigger picture.

1281
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:48,013
We're far behind on 10-pointers,
so we can't get any of Questions 8 to 15.

1282
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:50,807
Don't worry.
They have to accept our offer.

1283
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:53,518
They would accept
rather than have their card revealed.

1284
01:04:53,935 --> 01:04:55,687
This is the stance we'll take.

1285
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:59,733
"The eighth answer sheet is off the table.
If you insist, we'll give up the trade."

1286
01:04:59,816 --> 01:05:03,611
You'll be given five minutes
to trade your answers.

1287
01:05:05,947 --> 01:05:08,783
- Are you interested in a trade with us?
- How many did you mark to get zero?

1288
01:05:08,867 --> 01:05:10,160
- Sorry?
- The zero-point sheet.

1289
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:11,453
- The zero-point sheet?
- Yeah.

1290
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:14,122
- Answers on the zero-point sheet?
- We marked a good few.

1291
01:05:14,205 --> 01:05:15,957
- We want to know--
- I can't remember exactly.

1292
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,876
- Really?
- The number wasn't easy to memorize.

1293
01:05:17,959 --> 01:05:20,628
We need to know before making a decision.

1294
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:22,505
- How many did you guys mark?
- They say it's a secret.

1295
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:24,758
I don't think
I can disclose that information.

1296
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:29,554
Let's say we make the trade.
Can we ask for any of the answer sheets?

1297
01:05:29,637 --> 01:05:30,972
Ask for anything except the eighth.

1298
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:32,307
- The one that got you 110?
- Yes.

1299
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:35,268
Then we don't have to trade with them.

1300
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:37,687
No, we have to.
Those two already made a deal.

1301
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:41,024
OXFORD AND SNU
Could we get your 8th and 9th

1302
01:05:41,107 --> 01:05:43,401
ALREADY MADE AN AGREEMENT
with our 7th and 9th answer sheets?

1303
01:05:43,485 --> 01:05:44,319
Shall we?

1304
01:05:44,402 --> 01:05:46,738
- How about this?
- Let's exchange 7th and 9th, then.

1305
01:05:46,821 --> 01:05:47,864
How about it?

1306
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:50,867
- Let's trade the 7th and 9th.
- A direct exchange.

1307
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,243
2ND TRADE
SNU - OXFORD, KAIST - YONSEI

1308
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:54,871
SNU: 7TH AND 9TH, OXFORD: 8TH AND 9TH
KAIST: 7TH AND 9TH, YONSEI: 7TH AND 9TH

1309
01:05:54,954 --> 01:05:58,166
Team Oxford and Team SNU,
please exchange your answer sheets.

1310
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:02,879
I doubt Team Oxford could gain anything
from our answer sheets.

1311
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:05,256
Mark Option 3 on questions
other than 2, 3, 9, and 10.

1312
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:08,593
TEAM SNU ADDED RED HERRINGS
NOT TO GIVE OUT INFORMATION

1313
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:12,514
Do they seem useful? Are these the copies?

1314
01:06:13,556 --> 01:06:14,808
Why did they do that?

1315
01:06:15,183 --> 01:06:16,893
They marked so many answers.

1316
01:06:16,976 --> 01:06:19,229
- Let's see...
- They seem to be falling behind.

1317
01:06:19,312 --> 01:06:20,355
Very much so.

1318
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:23,817
- They barely marked the sheets.
- What?

1319
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:24,859
These are almost empty.

1320
01:06:24,943 --> 01:06:26,986
- Really?
- Team Yonsei and Team KAIST...

1321
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,363
All we learned is one answer each.

1322
01:06:28,446 --> 01:06:30,532
- What was that?
- All we can learn is one answer each.

1323
01:06:30,615 --> 01:06:31,741
OXFORD MADE 3 MARKS ON 2 SHEETS

1324
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:34,786
Out of the 2 sheets,
only 3 answers were marked.

1325
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:37,872
That threw me off.

1326
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:41,668
We learned almost nothing from the trade,
and that got me worried.

1327
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:44,129
Please exchange your answer sheets.

1328
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,467
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1329
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,469
Let's advance to the next round together.

1330
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:53,596
YONSEI NOW HAS KAIST'S 7TH AND 9TH

1331
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,598
KAIST NOW HAS YONSEI'S 7TH AND 9TH

1332
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:57,308
- What?
- Throw them out.

1333
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:59,436
They're useless.
We know everything already.

1334
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:01,896
- We know that already.
- This is...

1335
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,314
You're right.

1336
01:07:03,773 --> 01:07:06,860
It's okay. It's not like we gave them
anything with substance.

1337
01:07:07,485 --> 01:07:10,739
Let's begin the tenth,
the final mock exam.

1338
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:12,240
CSAT WITHOUT EXAM PAPERS

1339
01:07:12,323 --> 01:07:14,784
Is there anything
we can determine with this turn?

1340
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:16,077
No, we don't.

1341
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:19,205
If we took a different approach
on all three,

1342
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:20,457
in that case...

1343
01:07:21,332 --> 01:07:23,251
I'll answer Question 9 with Option 3.

1344
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:25,128
How many points would we get
if that's right?

1345
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:28,214
If that's right, we'd get 160 points.

1346
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:30,050
And 150 points if it isn't?

1347
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,469
So, we only have one shot left.

1348
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:35,305
We shouldn't waste this
confirming something we know.

1349
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:38,933
Out of Questions 8, 11, and 15,

1350
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:41,061
we'll take a gamble on one.

1351
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:43,313
This is the best we can do
under the circumstances.

1352
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:46,316
I was fine taking my CSAT,
but I'm shaking now.

1353
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:49,027
Well, that's because you knew
all the answers in CSAT.

1354
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:51,029
Whereas now,
we don't even know the questions.

1355
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:54,657
The tenth mock exam is over.

1356
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:57,702
All teams,
please submit your answer sheets.

1357
01:07:57,786 --> 01:07:59,245
- Is it inside the envelope?
- Sure.

1358
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:02,665
Let's check one last time.
The tenth, check.

1359
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,959
See you soon.

1360
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:11,758
Good work, everyone.

1361
01:08:11,841 --> 01:08:14,552
THE FINAL MOCK EXAM ANSWERS
HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED

1362
01:08:19,891 --> 01:08:22,352
I think the best score
we could get will be 30.

1363
01:08:22,435 --> 01:08:24,688
I mean that for all 4 teams.
I'd say 40 tops.

1364
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:25,855
I'm sure of that.

1365
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:31,945
I'll now announce the results
of the tenth mock exam.

1366
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:34,531
Team Oxford scored 100 points.

1367
01:08:34,614 --> 01:08:36,366
Wait. We got way too many wrong.

1368
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:37,826
We only got 100 points?

1369
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:43,415
Team Yonsei scored 10 points.

1370
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:46,584
- It's not bad.
- It's good, actually.

1371
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:48,795
TEAM YONSEI: 10

1372
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:54,217
Please take your answer sheets
back to your base camps.

1373
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:00,181
Our logic must've been flawed.

1374
01:09:01,057 --> 01:09:03,518
The algorithm must be wrong.

1375
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:07,230
We only marked our answers
because we were so sure of them.

1376
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:11,526
But it turned out
we had 6 or 7 wrong answers.

1377
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,197
- We're sure about this, right?
- Yeah.

1378
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:19,534
We could get 200 points if we marked
the undecided slots with Option 1.

1379
01:09:19,617 --> 01:09:21,161
What? That makes no sense.

1380
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:22,078
Why not?

1381
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:24,330
One, two, three...

1382
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:27,083
Why do we have Option 3 marked 4 times?

1383
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,585
How did this happen?

1384
01:09:29,169 --> 01:09:30,670
Is the answer to Question 11 Option 3?

1385
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:33,590
Who did that?

1386
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:37,844
I mean, Question 8's answer
couldn't be Option 3.

1387
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:38,928
Because both of them...

1388
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:40,638
We screwed up.

1389
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:42,891
But the answer to Question 8 is Option 3.

1390
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:45,602
OPTION 3 HAS BEEN CHECKED 4 TIMES

1391
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:49,356
CSAT WITHOUT EXAM PAPERS
Let's begin the CSAT.

1392
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,816
You'll now be given 20 minutes
to discuss your answers.

1393
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,986
You can submit
your answer sheets at any point.

1394
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,614
Please note that if a tie occurs,

1395
01:09:57,697 --> 01:10:00,533
the rank will be decided
based on the submission order.

1396
01:10:00,992 --> 01:10:02,494
Go. Run for it.

1397
01:10:02,577 --> 01:10:04,037
- But shouldn't I wait...
- Run!

1398
01:10:05,663 --> 01:10:07,499
- Go. Run for it.
- But shouldn't I wait...

1399
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,085
1ST TO SUBMIT: SNU

1400
01:10:10,168 --> 01:10:13,129
2ND TO SUBMIT: KAIST

1401
01:10:14,005 --> 01:10:17,384
Can you prepare the CSAT answer sheet
as soon as we hear the results?

1402
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:21,096
PREPARING TO SUBMIT THEIR ANSWER SHEET
AS SOON AS THE CSAT BEGINS

1403
01:10:21,429 --> 01:10:23,056
- Have only two teams made submissions?
- Yeah.

1404
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:25,058
Others must still be looking into things.

1405
01:10:25,141 --> 01:10:28,103
They're far from done, then.
If they're not ready, that's why.

1406
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:30,814
We know the answer to Question 8 is 3.

1407
01:10:30,897 --> 01:10:32,482
How about Questions 3 and 12?

1408
01:10:32,982 --> 01:10:35,485
The issue starts from Question 11.

1409
01:10:36,695 --> 01:10:37,946
I'll write the confirmed ones.

1410
01:10:38,029 --> 01:10:39,698
HYEON-SEUNG DRAWS
A TABLE OF CONFIRMED ANSWERS

1411
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:42,575
We're sure about them.
You can write 4, 5, and 2.

1412
01:10:43,201 --> 01:10:45,203
All right, then. We're good so far.

1413
01:10:45,662 --> 01:10:47,288
OXFORD REVIEWS THEIR ANSWERS
Let's start over.

1414
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:48,373
- Okay.
- From the top.

1415
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,208
Let's take it slow.

1416
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:51,376
Nice and easy.

1417
01:10:51,459 --> 01:10:53,795
We've figured out
which ones were the 30-pointers.

1418
01:10:53,878 --> 01:10:55,839
What did we do next?

1419
01:10:55,922 --> 01:10:57,757
We considered Option 1 next.

1420
01:10:57,841 --> 01:10:59,092
RETRACING THEIR STEPS TO FIND ERRORS

1421
01:10:59,175 --> 01:11:00,927
- I'll erase them.
- Option 2 goes here.

1422
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:04,556
Was this the reason
we ruled out Option 3 for Question 11?

1423
01:11:04,639 --> 01:11:07,183
So, we don't know this one.
Do we not know how we got this?

1424
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,602
No, we don't.
That must be where it went wrong.

1425
01:11:09,686 --> 01:11:10,895
I see. Let's try again.

1426
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:13,440
We only have 20 minutes. We can do it.

1427
01:11:14,774 --> 01:11:18,695
Let me count the ones we're sure about.
That'd be seven.

1428
01:11:18,778 --> 01:11:20,822
TEAM YONSEI'S ANSWER SHEET

1429
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:23,158
Either Question 11 or 15
has Option 3 for an answer.

1430
01:11:23,616 --> 01:11:25,952
OPTION 1 HASN'T BEEN USED SO FAR

1431
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:29,873
Let's use Option 3 for Questions 11 and 15
and mark Option 1 for the rest.

1432
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:32,375
That's our best option
using what we know so far.

1433
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,044
I know. Let's go for it.

1434
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:35,795
Shall we take a gamble?

1435
01:11:38,506 --> 01:11:41,134
Two, one, four, five, six...

1436
01:11:41,718 --> 01:11:43,178
- Those work.
- Really?

1437
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:44,721
You're right.

1438
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:47,140
We need to mark our answer sheet.

1439
01:11:56,983 --> 01:11:59,402
TEAM YONSEI SUBMITS THEIR ANSWER SHEET

1440
01:12:01,446 --> 01:12:02,947
TEAM OXFORD SUBMITS THEIR ANSWER SHEET

CSAT WITHOUT EXAM PAPERS
ANSWER SHEET

1442
01:12:06,368 --> 01:12:10,789
That concludes the main match,
CSAT without Exam Papers.

1443
01:12:11,873 --> 01:12:15,752
Your final CSAT scores will be announced.

1444
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:20,548
Please.

1445
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:25,929
Team SNU.

1446
01:12:33,395 --> 01:12:35,271
You scored 160 points.

1447
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:39,776
Team KAIST.

1448
01:12:39,859 --> 01:12:41,528
Come on. Please.

1449
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:44,114
You scored 210 points.
It's a perfect score.

1450
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:49,411
TEAM KAIST GETS A PERFECT SCORE OF 210

1451
01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:52,414
SNU: 160, KAIST: 210

1452
01:12:57,377 --> 01:12:59,713
- What's gotten into Team KAIST?
- What's up with them?

1453
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:01,506
That's just insane.

1454
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:04,134
Team Yonsei.

1455
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:09,764
We decided not to overly rely
on personal abilities.

1456
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:12,183
Other contestants
are equally as good as us.

1457
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:14,519
Anyone could win
if we all had the same plan.

1458
01:13:14,602 --> 01:13:15,854
That's why strategies matter.

1459
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:19,149
We double-checked everything
and planned our strategies meticulously.

1460
01:13:19,232 --> 01:13:22,152
We wanted to make
every answer sheet count, too.

1461
01:13:22,235 --> 01:13:26,656
If we get an ambiguous score like 60,
we'd have to think about what to do next.

1462
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,867
We didn't let our guard down

1463
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:32,996
because we thought other teams
could get a perfect score, too.

1464
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:36,291
Our goal has to be
to get 210 points on the 10th attempt.

1465
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,752
Our goal has always been winning.

1466
01:13:38,835 --> 01:13:40,045
And since that's our goal...

1467
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:42,547
Stay on your toes,
even if things go smoothly.

1468
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:44,591
Stay focused on winning.

1469
01:13:44,674 --> 01:13:47,093
We have to win
especially when we have the benefit.

1470
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:52,682
Just like our team on the first day,

1471
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:55,268
Team KAIST took the benefit match
and the main match.

1472
01:13:55,352 --> 01:13:57,145
And their performance today

1473
01:13:58,104 --> 01:13:59,731
was also formidable.

1474
01:14:00,273 --> 01:14:03,902
CSAT WITHOUT EXAM PAPERS
SNU: 160, KAIST: 210

1475
01:14:04,694 --> 01:14:06,029
Team Yonsei.

1476
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:12,494
SNU: 160, KAIST: 210

1477
01:14:12,577 --> 01:14:14,621
You scored 160 points.

1478
01:14:14,704 --> 01:14:16,539
That's when I sensed that we messed up.

1479
01:14:17,499 --> 01:14:18,875
We submitted the answer first.

1480
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:21,544
TEAM SNU'S EARLY SUBMISSION
PUTS THEM IN 2ND PLACE

1481
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:24,381
TEAM YONSEI IS CURRENTLY IN 3RD PLACE

1482
01:14:24,464 --> 01:14:27,217
TEAM OXFORD NEEDS MORE THAN 170 POINTS
TO SURVIVE THIS ROUND

1483
01:14:28,343 --> 01:14:31,429
I was desperately praying
for some sort of divine intervention.

1484
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:36,601
Team Oxford...

1485
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:22,147
