been evacuated for malnutrition.

43
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,665
We couldn't free the boar
we found during canvasing.

Boar?

45
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:11,756
That's right, sir.

46
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:15,201
I thought it could replenish
our men's health...

47
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:17,527

the demarcation line?

48

49
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:25,182
I'll put this lunatic in front

Look at this.

52
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:36,082
He instructed us to eat
as much meat as possible.

53
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:40,406
That's exactly what
Sgt. Lim here is doing.

54
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:44,560
Then I'll go ahead and feed my men.

uphold discipline in the Party!

176
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,197
Yes, of course.

177
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,570
<i>I'm sorry, please don't kill me...</i>

178
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:17,804
But...

179
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:24,914
according to this report, Kim
confessed to making the map.

180
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:33,046
Then why is Sgt. Lim getting punished?

181
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:35,714
They were very close for a long time...

182
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,644
Very close?

183
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:47,578
Very close...

184
00:18:58,462 --> 00:19:00,211
- Lt. Park Joon-pyong.
- Yes, sir!

185
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:02,411
- Lt. Park Joon-pyong.
- Yes, sir!

186
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:04,203
Tell me.

187
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:08,962
Is there any evidence that
Sgt. Lim made the map?

188
00:19:13,525 --> 00:19:15,149
Very triumphant.

189
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,678
A desertion was attempted by your
men, and yet you all look triumphant.

190
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:25,426
I'll explain this one more time.

191
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:31,100
When Kim attempted desertion,
Sgt. Lim tried to apprehend him,

192
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,728
even though he cared about him.

193
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:37,168
Did you not say Lim was in control
of Kim when they were caught?

194
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:37,999
That's right, sir!

195
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,624
- Is that true?
- That's right, sir!

196
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,749
That's the truth.

197
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,457
What's more important than
facts during a judgment?

198
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,874
To analyze this incident with truth...

200

deserters popping up in our republic.

201
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:05,040
And do you think it's a good
idea to report about 2 deserters?

202
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:08,837

hero within our ranks,

203

<i>who caught the deserter?</i>

206
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,491
Kyu-nam, were you trying to desert?

207
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:16,734
Not at all.

208
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:20,237
I was only trying to
catch the deserter.

209
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:23,219
Right? You don't have
the conviction to desert.

210
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:24,800
Like father, like son.

211
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:31,857

00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:44,692

Is your mother well?

216
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:54,946
She must be happy about your discharge.

217
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:57,285
She passed away last year.

218

219
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:02,012
I think I heard that news.

220
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,152
No one to return home to. It
must trouble you quite a bit.

221
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:08,022
What will you do afterwards?

222
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,040
I have no troubles.

223
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:13,439
I will perform my duties to

something to boast about,

233
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:32,276

a reactionary deserter?

00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:21,101
This was only possible
due to the foresightedness

why am I reassigned here?

I can't die... I can't die...

353
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:30,657
I can't die... I can't die...

354
00:40:36,924 --> 00:40:38,291
Hey, Kim Dong-hyuk.

355
00:40:38,543 --> 00:40:39,833
Forgive me...

356
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:43,025
I'm sorry...

357
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:50,193
I'm sorry...

358
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:53,227
Why are you sorry for
missing your mother?

359
00:41:00,444 --> 00:41:02,147
I told you we'll leave
together tonight.

360
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:05,879
Let's go.

361
00:41:26,578 --> 00:41:30,753
All done? No trouble
carrying out your mission?

362
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:36,918
All seems to be in order here at
Hyunpoong-ri under your supervision.

363
00:41:37,847 --> 00:41:39,953
I'll make sure to
include it in my report.

364
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,665
- No need.
- Sir.

365
00:41:48,702 --> 00:41:50,672
Are you my girlfriend?

366
00:41:51,497 --> 00:41:53,290
How dare you whisper in front of him!

367
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:56,249
Comrade Lim requested gasoline,

368
00:41:56,487 --> 00:41:58,201
but this vehicle requires diesel!

369
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:01,875
It's suspicious that he doesn't know
what his operation vehicle takes!

370
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,773
Are you suspecting our
State Security comrade?

371
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,069
He was dispatched today,
that could happen.

372
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:41,215
Please do not take any offense.

373
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:43,077
Not at all.

374
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,661
I learned something
about your alertness.

375
00:42:47,035 --> 00:42:50,951
Very good, complete alertness.

376
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:54,367
We always strive for it, but it
never reaches a desired level,

377
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:57,975
and we'll cooperate with you
to the best of my abilities,

378
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:00,777
since you took kindly to us.

379
00:43:03,055 --> 00:43:03,782
Thank you.

380
00:43:04,086 --> 00:43:04,570
Hey!

381
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,233
Get him going with a
vehicle and one of our men.

382
00:43:10,386 --> 00:43:11,956
Just the vehicle would be fine.

383
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:14,310
My mission could be delayed
if I move in a group...

384
00:43:14,335 --> 00:43:15,143
Not at all.

385
00:43:17,015 --> 00:43:19,639
There may be backlash if
we don't support you fully.

386
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:24,136
Just as precaution, I'll back you up.

387
00:43:35,168 --> 00:43:37,250
He's Sgt. Lim Kyu-nam.

388
00:43:41,946 --> 00:43:42,698
Who is it?

389
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,769
A State Security agent I know.

390
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:48,332
I asked him about you,
he doesn't know you.

391
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:51,253
My affiliation and mission are
classified, don't you know?

392
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:54,269
It'd be great if you could verify
who your direct superior is.

393
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:57,497
Why? Can't remember
your superior's name?

394
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:03,467
Put me through Li Hyun-sang.

395
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:06,016
Is he still at the banquet?

396
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:11,105
He sent me on a mission while
he has fun at the banquet.

397
00:44:12,698 --> 00:44:15,397
By the way, why are you
in bed with a DMZ Police?

398
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:19,570
Watch your mouth before I
shove your head up your ass!

399
00:45:25,104 --> 00:45:26,990
Comrade Li, there may be a problem.

400
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:32,676
Lt. Hong Su...

401
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:34,533
Shut your mouth and
answer my questions.

402
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,121
Yes, our current location...

403
00:45:37,646 --> 00:45:40,174
Comrade Li the mission is going well.

404
00:45:41,336 --> 00:45:44,231
Kyu-nam, what will you do?

405
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:53,290
What's wrong with doing
what I want to do?

406
00:45:53,488 --> 00:45:56,370
<i>Come back, I'll make sure
your punishment is minimal.</i>

407
00:45:56,956 --> 00:46:00,121
No. I've decided my own future.

408
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:22,593
<i>Take him back to the division.</i>

409
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,957
Take a right.

410
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,178
Isn't it left?

411
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:28,521
Right.

412
00:46:37,565 --> 00:46:38,412
Step on it!

413
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,915
<i>For the Freedom and Happiness of People</i>

414
00:48:45,949 --> 00:48:46,972
So loud...

415
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:28,897
That son of a bitch...

416
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:39,451
Dong-hyuk! Run!

417
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:19,916
Tell me.

418
00:50:21,198 --> 00:50:23,656
How much of Lim's desertion
have you reported?

419
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,419
It was too crazy to report in...

420
00:50:27,414 --> 00:50:28,359
My apologies, sir!

421
00:50:29,957 --> 00:50:32,422
No need to apologize, you did good.

422
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:39,354
Commander, it hasn't been reported...

423
00:50:39,379 --> 00:50:41,428
<i>Hey, you! Hey! Hey!</i>

424
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:45,624
Are you out of your damn mind?

425
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:49,054
If you send me a company,
I'll wrap this up cleanly.

426
00:50:50,102 --> 00:50:54,226
Yes, I'll make sure to never
inconvenience you again.

427
00:50:59,787 --> 00:51:01,953
I'm gonna fuck him up...

428
00:51:30,892 --> 00:51:31,391
You okay?

429
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:17,668
Which unit sent you?

430
00:52:25,361 --> 00:52:28,448
Nomads, right? We're being chased too.

431
00:52:28,726 --> 00:52:29,918
We're on the same boat.

432
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:32,795
Get rid of them.

433
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:35,096
Please don't kill us!

434
00:52:35,121 --> 00:52:38,655
I barely got out of the holding
cell in Hyunpoong-ri!

435
00:52:39,374 --> 00:52:40,943
Please don't kill us!

436
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:45,040
Sang-gu, Sang-gu...

437
00:52:46,658 --> 00:52:48,824
Did you see Sang-gu?

438
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:50,007
What?

439
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:52,969
Did you see Sang-gu
in the holding cell?

440
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:58,947
Say you know, say you know...

441
00:52:59,235 --> 00:53:03,436
Don't try to bullshit us,
did you see him or not?

442
00:53:03,656 --> 00:53:05,238
I never heard of that name.

443
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,249
He's so clueless...

444
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:08,841
The bushy hair?

445
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:11,528
The bushy hair next door...

446
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:15,404
"I can't die... I can't die..."

447
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:18,860
There was a boy who mumbled
while staring at the wall...

448
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:20,861
Did he say how he was caught?

449
00:53:22,604 --> 00:53:26,823
I don't know but he said
he missed his sister terribly.

450
00:53:29,355 --> 00:53:31,123
Sang-gu's alive.

451
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,014
That's a relief.

452
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:45,692
How did you end up on the run?

453
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,082
We're not on the run.

454
00:53:47,677 --> 00:53:50,338
We're seeking a way to live after
getting kicked out of our village.

455
00:53:51,215 --> 00:53:53,135
But I'm more worried about Sang-gu.

456
00:53:54,461 --> 00:53:55,804
Why don't you rescue him?

457
00:53:59,561 --> 00:54:00,640
We can rescue him.

458
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:05,099
This is the Hyunpoong-ri station,
and the basement is the holding cell.

459
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:07,978
Security near the
entrance is too tight,

460
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,303
so the only way in is...

461
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:16,155
a window around back.

462
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:17,394
It must be locked.

463
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:20,749
No, guards open it
during cigarette breaks.

464
00:54:21,013 --> 00:54:23,540
I saw it, I saw it with my eyes.

465
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,290
This guy is expert at
peeping, it must be true.

466
00:54:34,825 --> 00:54:35,914
We rescue him tomorrow.

467
00:54:41,644 --> 00:54:42,434
Miss...

468
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:47,453
don't lose hope.

469
00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:17,127
There's nothing here.

470
00:55:18,525 --> 00:55:19,833
You make the judgment?

471
00:55:21,197 --> 00:55:22,066
Push forward.

472
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:24,042
It's the pursuit unit.

473
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:01,782
Stop.

474
00:56:04,302 --> 00:56:05,309
What's above you?

475
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:13,567
Desertion route found,
there's a hole in the ceiling.

476
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:16,965
The pursuit unit, take the right.

477
00:56:22,168 --> 00:56:24,208
Split into left and right flanks.

478
00:57:40,314 --> 00:57:41,147
Rear unit, deploy.

479
00:58:21,259 --> 00:58:21,868
Cease fire.

480
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,765
Cease fire!

481
00:58:26,027 --> 00:58:26,872
Search the valley.

482
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:54,588
Kyu-nam.

483
00:58:56,376 --> 00:58:58,943
No one will get out of here alive.

484
00:59:29,187 --> 00:59:30,644
Deserters spotted, 3 o'clock!

485
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,197
Are you deaf?!

486
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:40,809
2 deserters couldn't
fire all those bullets!

487
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:43,882
Get back to your position, get back!

488
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,664
<i>The Bastard I Loved</i>

489
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:40,732
What do you want?

490
01:00:41,669 --> 01:00:42,830
I enjoyed your performance.

491
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:46,405
<i>Not as good as you used to be.</i>

492
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:50,071
<i>What happened to the winner of
international piano competitions?</i>

493
01:00:50,243 --> 01:00:50,992
I'm hanging up,

494
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:52,333
<i>I'm working.</i>

495
01:00:55,369 --> 01:00:55,916
<i>What work?</i>

496
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,639
Chasing a mutt who fled home.

497
01:01:07,437 --> 01:01:08,666
You can't forget it, can you?

498
01:01:09,983 --> 01:01:11,326
<i>Our days in Russia...</i>

499
01:01:13,113 --> 01:01:14,695
<i>At the Saint Petersburg theatre...</i>

500
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:18,376
Tired?

501
01:02:18,808 --> 01:02:20,084
Not at all...

502
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:23,540
We're almost there, right?

503
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,999
You said that over a dozen times.

504
01:02:28,341 --> 01:02:31,841
Fine, but why must we
head back to our base?

505
01:02:32,494 --> 01:02:35,084
If we take an unknown path,
mines will blow us up,

506
01:02:35,203 --> 01:02:38,682
and reaching the mess hall is
as good as being in the South,

507
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:41,707
that's what you said a dozen times.

508
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,999
Fine, fine, but...

509
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,896
Please stop asking me.

510
01:02:46,138 --> 01:02:48,929
Talking is harder than walking.

511
01:02:49,469 --> 01:02:51,135
- Dong-hyuk...
- Yes?

512
01:02:51,706 --> 01:02:54,558
What do you want to eat
when you reach the South?

513
01:02:54,922 --> 01:02:55,685
Meat...

514
01:02:56,504 --> 01:03:00,641
There are many kinds of meat,
do you want beef or pork?

515
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:02,039
Chicken...

516
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:07,832
Many types of chicken too.

517
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,957
Chicken? Half fried?

518
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:11,540
Seasoned half.

519
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:14,415
Chug it down with ice cold beer,

520
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,681
damn, that must be heaven.

521
01:03:20,959 --> 01:03:23,065
Ryu, I don't think you're
fit to be a soldier.

522
01:03:23,413 --> 01:03:23,900
No, sir!

523
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:26,719
What was your dream before?

524
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,579
Go and fulfill that dream.

525
01:03:32,885 --> 01:03:33,787
My apologies, sir!

526
01:03:44,561 --> 01:03:48,934
Prove to me that your
decision is not wrong.

527
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:02,082
<i>Warning - This is a Military
Base, Trespassers Will Be Shot</i>

528

01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:14,667

Hello, Dong-hyuk's mother.

Whenever Dong-hyuk went into the DMZ,

625
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,389
he'd not only catch rabbits,

626
01:27:57,390 --> 01:28:01,470
but even a boar one time,
and fed the entire base.

for once, and we all had diarrhea...

with predicting weather.
