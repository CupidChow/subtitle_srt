(Chiga) Rumors spread everywhere that he lost the Meat Housing trial

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,643
I only need the ones who can win

3
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,640
(Asami) Are lawyers bored?

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,642
(Todoroki) That's amazing

5
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,978
That's how good his subordinates are

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,983
Is there anything more to say?

7
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:54,154
The suicide case of Minato City employee mentioned earlier

8
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,489
It was not a criminal case

9
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,326
(Asami) Last week, there was a suicide incident in Minato City's city hall staff.

10
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:04,664
{Minato City? 》 《Rumours say it's power harassment within the government office》

11
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:09,169
"Maybe the mayor's music club is involved too."

12
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,640
{(Asami) This might be the spark

13
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,980
But the bereaved family is not convinced

14
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,150
I see, is there a spark?

15
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:29,322
Will you burn it? The mayor involved in covering up the bus accident

16
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,324
It's a chance to cut

17
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:36,162
He told the family that they had a good lawyer.

18
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,832
Finally the final playball

19
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,836
Ah, damn it

20
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,171
It's uncool

21
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:49,309
But if you're going to attack a boss, wouldn't it be better to have some cards?

22
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,479
card?

23
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,982
This guy might become a card that drops the soundtrack

24
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,323
(Paulownia stone) Hello

25
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:09,162
Takashima is a classmate from elementary school, Otobe Mayor and his classmate from Otobe, and he is still going to golf.

26
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,332
If you hold on to your weaknesses, it might become a good card

27
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,334
Thank you

28
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:19,806
I see, so that means someone from us is diving in.

29
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,809
I have friends who are perfect for infiltrating

30
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,812
Yeah

31
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,814

33
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,153
Sorry, this is Kiriishi (Takashima) Ah, did you come?

34
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,155
Hello, what about the other day

35
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,992
I spoke on the phone and received a call from the National Tax Inspector.

36
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,829
I see, I see, let me know the details

37
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,331
Is it really okay?

38
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,501
I asked him because he said he was strong in tax audits.

39
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,337
I also have a tax accountant qualification

40
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,806
I handle tax cases well Yes

41
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:56,809
Ah hahaha →

My unscrupulous tax accountant would be anxious hahahaha

43
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,651
So will you really be investigating it?

44
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:09,489
If we received a call from the other party, we are sure that an investigation will be made soon.

45
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,325
Incidentally, when did you get in touch?

46
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,161

Hahahaha No

Please, starting tomorrow

77
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,322
I'll check out a lot

78
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,667
Just now, Kiriishi-kun

79
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,669
You're always quick to ask

80
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,006
Asami says it's a perfect job for paulownia stones.

81
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:44,310
It's true that this is not our field... (Uzaki) Does Kiriishi also work on tax evasion cases?

82
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,482
(Inoo) Now I'm a lawyer specializing in tax evasion.

83
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,485
The homepage has changed

84
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,488
Impersonate anything Chameleon paulownia stone

85
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,658
I'm so good at it~ Huh?

86
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,993
I see

87
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,663
What? Is Kiriishi-san married?

88
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,000
That gap is great too~ It's so funny~

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,671
Oh... So why are you teaming up with us?

90
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:16,476
Ah, it seems like something is the same day at the agency that was in front of those two.

91
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,644
Ah, what is the paulownia stone?

92
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:22,482
If you like, why not hire an intern?

93
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,989
thank you

94
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,659
Don't ignore it for a moment

95
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,829
Todoroki-san told me to help Kiriishi-san.

96
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:41,334
Even I don't need it, it's a bit helpful

97
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,170
Why do you know I don't have an assistant?

98
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,340
Is it because the assistant runs away?

99
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,010
I'm a hindrance, so I say it's a hindrance

100
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,146
That's an overstatement

101
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:58,651
Actually, if Kiriishi was impersonating an investigator

102
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:02,321
I wonder if there's no tax audit going to Takashima-san?

103
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:06,159
I was accused of the National Tax Agency's information provision form.

104
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:10,997
Based on the way that request was made, there must be something you actually want to hide.

105
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,667
Oh, you're too good to do it

106
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,669
Why did you add Uzaki?

107
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,807
Yeah? No, I feel like he and Paulownia stone are something to match

108
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,643
Eh, I don't think it fits perfectly

109
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,146
(Vibrator notification) Well, it's a kind of outside training session

110
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,820
Okay, then I have another matter

111
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,489
I understand that Inoo and Takaido are moving forward.

112
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,991
(Takaido) Sorry, I'm a bit of a no-no, is it okay to pass this time?

113
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,993
What? Ah, is that so?

114
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,496
Are you putting up a little bit of a different matter and doing something else?

115
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,836
Is that a rebellious phase?

116
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:54,474
24 Chai's rebellious phase? Isn't it cute?

117
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:09,322
(Matsubara) I still can't believe that Chiri chose to die himself

118
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:17,163
The two of you said that Chiri passed away was at the city hall?

119
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:24,504
(Matsubara) Chiri seemed to be worried about work after being transferred to a new department.

120
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,506
I was saying

121
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,642
I'm lonely in the city hall

122
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:34,146
That's because it made the mayor angry

123
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,149
(Matsubara) I also told the police →

124
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,486
There is no suicide note, so I can't prove it

125
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:48,828
(Misa) If we could hear more about this...

126
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,999
Matsubara-san

127
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,502
Would you like to file a lawsuit for Chiri?

128
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:02,308
Why did Chiri have to choose death?

129
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:07,647
Would you like to clarify the reason in a civil court case?

130
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,324
Are you getting along well?

131
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:23,162
Oh no... Kiriishi-san didn't tell me anything

132
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,999
This is going to file a lawsuit against Minato City and Mayor Otobe.

133

That matter is also important

136
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,474

So why are you doing something that will give you a client?

140

It's a conduct investigation

141

Do you always do this?

142
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,163
Uzaki I think the client is always sincere.

143
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,165
Always trust your own eyes

No... if you have any problems?

156
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,310
Actually, you're caught up in a troublesome thing

157
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,812
Is it a lawsuit? ah

158
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:52,318
It seems that the family of the suicide staff member has been insisted on by a lawyer.

159
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,820
Did you get encouraged by a lawyer?

160
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,822
This is the complaint

161
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:11,504
How about you? Can you accept it?

162
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,640
Of course

163
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,809

yes

166
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,483
You have to drive a stake that has come out too much

167
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,822
This is the ledger

168
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:33,492
Is this all? yes

169
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,164
(Whisper) What? Are you going to see all of this? Of course

170
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:45,337
Hey, the National Tax Inspector has contacted me that an investigation will be made...

171
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,340
Ah, nice to meet you as an assistant

172
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,177
Rather, the person in charge on the other side has changed from before →

173
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,013
The conversation didn't go well, so when did the investigation go?

174
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,650
I don't have time next Monday

175
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:03,823

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,329
(Paulownia stone) It seems to have a pretty good wing

178
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,671
Was he wearing me?

179
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,806
I wonder what you'll do outside of work!

180
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,342
A small company president spends his time in Ginza every night

181
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:27,146
This is like telling the investigator to be suspicious

182
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,152
If you want to get through a tax audit safely

183
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:37,323
Please provide all information that shows how money moves

184
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,659
I understand

185
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:53,005
(Takashima leaves)

186
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,644
Okay

187
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,648
How many groups are there today? Three of the other business managers in Takashima

188
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,318
I asked you to do that, I'm an oral argument from the sound club.

189
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:11,824
That partner, Chiga, was a lawyer and was there anything happening with Todoroki-san?

190
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,994
There are so many things in this world for so long

191
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,164
Is it possible that he had a love triangle with Chiga?

192
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,834
It's so funny! A record of winning streaks in court

193
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,170
What a winning streak? What is that

194
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,340
He lost to me in the trial that marked the agency's winning streak.

195
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,811
What is that? Pride Takasugi kun

196
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,647
That type is the most troublesome

197
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,485
Oh, by the way, is that okay? Is it Uzaki?

198
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,154
Yes, it must be hard

199
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,657
Looking at the ledgers, I'm sure I'll fall

200
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,493
I'm coming, yes please

201
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,495
(sneeze)

202
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,997
Ah sorry ah...

203
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,997
Okay

204
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:32,671
(President Judge) Matsubara Chiri, who worked at Minato City Hall at the time, was 27 years old.

205
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,641
Due to the mental pain I suffered at work

206
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:40,479
He committed suicide at home on February 20, 2025 →

207
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:44,149
In this case, a request for national compensation from Minato City and →

208
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,321
Two claims have been filed against Mayor Otobu for damages based on tort →

209
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,824
There's no doubt, there's no doubt

210
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,326
(Presential Judge) Defendant's Agent Do you have any questions?

211
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,328
No, there is no

212
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,666
(President Judge) So, what is the next oral argument schedule...

213
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,480
You did the meat housing matter.

214
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,316
Why is the music representative you?

215
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,986
I was thinking about being a partner this time,

216
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,657
Don't get too carried away

217
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,503
(Chiga leaves)

218
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,310
The trial has begun

219
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,646
is that so

220
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,150
I'll check again but

221
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:56,989
That means Chiri only talked to the two of you about work once.

222
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,991
yes

223
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,994
About a month before he died

224
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:05,331
I was crying about work

225
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,653
《(Misa) Chiri, are you okay? 》

226
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,825
《(Chiri) Sorry》

227
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,828
{It's completely... so it's okay}

228
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,001
{(Matsubara) What's wrong, what happened? 》

229
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,838
《Chiri What happened? 》

230
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,173
"I…"

231
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:53,645
"You made Mayor Otobe angry" "(Matsubara) What? →》

232
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,148
《Chiri》

233
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,651
《What's wrong?》

234
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:15,334
Has Chiri left a diary or something?

235
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,338
No, that kind of thing

236
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:23,809
What led Chiri to death in the trial?

237
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,145
That fact must be proved

238
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,480
If you remember anything, please let me know

239
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,482
Understood

240
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:36,321
Todoroki-san, I will do whatever we can

241
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,992
So please

242
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:49,501
Of course, I'll definitely win

243
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:01,013
Wow... I'm feeling dizzy

244
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,150
Haa...

245
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:15,494
That Kiriishi-san also knows about the accident, right? Father's

246
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,496
ah

247
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:24,837
Todoroki-san Why did you drag me into your agency?

248
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:33,145
Todoroki told me that my father was not responsible.

249
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,315
But it's

250
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:40,652
I wonder if the victim's family is harassed somewhere.

251
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,655
Come on

252
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,659
I thought that if it were Kiriishi-san, he would have heard something.

253
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,163
Uzaki Yes

254
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,332
Move your hands

255
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,837
I'm

256
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,641
Ahh

257
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,480
Wow...

258
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,485
(The sound of meat burning)

259
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,988
I didn't expect you to contact me

260
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,990
home

261
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,661
We also wanted talented people like Takaido-kun.

262
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,663
thank you

263
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,667
I think there are things that can only be done in a large office.

264
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,669
I guess

265
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,640
And there are only bad rumors over there as well.

266
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,009
yes

267
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,480
So what are the conditions for you to welcome us?

268
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:46,485
A trial has just begun with Todoroki-san now

269
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,989
About the office where you are

270
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,492
I would like to know a little more info

271
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,996
The bird standing there seems to be muddy traces

272
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:04,169
(The sound of meat burning)

273
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,948
What is this?

274
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,118
What does that mean? I checked the books in detail

275
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,454
Considering the size and business model of your company

276
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,624
Gross profit on sales is extremely low →

277
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,294
What's more, this has suddenly been showing signs of this for three years now.

278
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,797
it is…

279
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,466
Maybe it's because they sell good things cheaply

280
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,636
This supplement is a high quality

281
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:42,140
Based on the ingredients contained in it, the cost per box is around 150 yen.

282
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,611
You're trying to make a profit properly, aren't you?

283
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,281
There is, isn't it?

284
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,118
What are you talking about?

285
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,288
You said you should give us all the information, right?

286
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,460
1 billion yen in 3 years?

287
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,130
A fictitious invoice was issued to a factory in Laos where the production was ordered.

288
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,800
They've significantly increased the cost

289
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,803
So the gross profit is so extreme...

290
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,972
(Kiriishi) Takashima-san, the investigator

291
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:19,278
The sales and profits that should normally be calculated based on the size of the company and the business content.

292
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,615
It shows an unnatural discrepancy with the numbers actually declared →

293
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,618
Perhaps this time I've set my eye on it.

294
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:31,456
I guess the accounting staff was also at the president's discretion.

295
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,795
Now, the question is, what to do from here?

296
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,799
Takashima-san: Have you heard the investigator's name?

297
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,303
Imai... I was talking about Toshiaki

298
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,972
Toshiaki Imai…

299
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,977
Former National Tax Inspection Department, this guy is quite formidable.

300
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,979
Tax audit is tomorrow

301
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:58,283
This investigator would definitely poke him in such a sloppy ledger

302
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,453
Are you guys going to do something? I'll do something

303
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,790
In the first place, you were inflated, it's your fault... you

304
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,460
you? Are you good at acting?

305
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,463
What... what do you mean?

306
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,442
Our company's supplement called Sinpino

307
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,611
Resuscitation and repairing the foundations of human cells →

308
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,781
It has unprecedented benefits for anti-aging care

309
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:33,618
Resuscitation of cells Is that true?

310
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:37,622
Do you know about silica? I don't know

311
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,958
Also known as the mineral of beauty

312
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:43,795
For women who want to maintain healthy and youthful skin for a long time →

313
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,798
This is an aging care ingredient that has gained tremendous support.

314
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,302
It's something that all foreign celebrities are currently using.

315
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:54,139
Something... Isn't it ugly?

316
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,142
Um... listen seriously

317
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,144
Sorry

318
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,951
Wow...

319
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,307
(Imai) I'm Imai, an investigator, please

320
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,277
This is Takashima, the president

321
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,279
And he...

322
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,283
Ah, Accounting... I'm Adachi, the Chief Accounting Officer.

323
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,956
"Shall you be an employee? 》 《I'm not going to impersonate it, it's going to happen》

324
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,958
"But you guys aren't our employees."

325
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,127
{Tax audits can be called psychological warfare →}

326
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:26,798
"If an investigator doubts the contents of the ledger, he will quickly skip the question."

327
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,134
"Each interaction with the investigator"

328
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:33,305
{Please think of it as a battle that will greatly influence the results of tax audits}

329
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,142
《Battle...》 《Answers that are not acceptable for such a trash》

<Takashima-san: Can you do this as an accounting manager? 》

331
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,117
"it is…"

332
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:49,621
{I want to install your company's money flow}

{And also, may I read all the materials available here? 》

336

"Yeah…"

338
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,778
I'm Kudo, the head of product development

339
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,288
What materials did you ask for preparation in advance?

340
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,458
Yes, I'm ready there... Thank you

341
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,445
Introduction

342
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,615
Could you explain your business?

343
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:56,121
Yes Our business is mainly about the production and sales of health supplements.

344
00:25:56,121 --> 00:26:02,761
We develop products targeting women who are interested in health and beauty

345
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,430
What kind of work did you do before this company?

346
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,769
I used to work for a printing company.

347
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,938
I was working in printing

348
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:16,775
Why suddenly, this kind of health supplement business?

349
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,444
Why...?

350
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,949
home

351
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,117
Health supplement manufacturing

352
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:30,789
Many people start it as a business that makes money easily.

353
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,127
{The survey usually takes 2 days}

354
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,431
"In the morning of the first day, the investigators would be against the president."

355
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,433
Why did you start this company?

356
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,269
{What kind of customers are you targeting, etc.}

357
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,938
《I'll ask questions other than the main topic》

358
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:51,109
"However, there's nothing wasted about their questions."

359
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,613
"There's always a goal for even trivial conversations."

360
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:02,787
Actually... my mother's body has always been weak

361
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:07,959
I wanted to do some kind of business that supports human health.

362
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,131
I see, that's a wonderful reason, no, it's ridiculous...

363
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,101
By the way, does President Takashima have any hobbies?

364
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,105
Hobbies...

365
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,275
"You need to be vigilant even when asking questions about hobbies."

366
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,611
{For example, if you say golf is a hobby →}

367
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,781
{If a receipt for golf entertainment comes up later}

368
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:34,452
[This is a point where people are told that it is not about entertainment expenses but about personal use.]

369
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,289
《Hide the golf set》 《Please do so》

370
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,959
{Please answer "no hobby" to questions.

371
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:46,131
No, um... I'm all working

372
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,768
I don't have a hobby (Imai) Is that so?

373
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:53,104
{And finally, the real thing begins in the afternoon}

374
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,441
{The investigator will check the ledgers all at once from here}

375
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,953
Is it okay... yes

376
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,623
If you look at the slogans on your company's website

377
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,626
Sales seem to be doing quite well

378
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,962
Why is the gross profit on sales so low?

379
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,964
picture…

380
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,967
That seems to have suddenly dropped for three years now, but

381
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,770
Why did the profit margin drop so much?

382
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,939
it is…

383
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,781
"The National Tax Investigator is studying psychology at the Tax College."

384
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,950
"psychology"

385
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,787
"They don't overlook the habits and actions of people who lie."

386
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:45,457
{By the way, when Takashima-san is pointed out a lie →}

387
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,760
{I feel like I'm getting angry...} {Hey, that's not the case! 》

388
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,296
"ah…"

389
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:55,133
{Anyway, Takashima-san should not open his mouth carelessly}

390
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,435
{If you're thrust in, I'll come in}

391
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:03,775
In fact, the health food industry has been intensifying recently →

392
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,944
To differentiate ourselves from other companies, we also offer a way to differentiate ourselves from other companies.

393
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:09,114
Three years ago, we renewed our main product.

394
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,117
From there, the profit margin fell sharply.

395
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:16,121
Does renewing a product reduce the profit margin so much?

396
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,457
What kind of calculation? Ah no, that

397
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:23,962
The renewal has been improved to contain high-grade ingredients →

398
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,431
That's pushing up costs

399
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,268
High-grade ingredients... Yes

400
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:37,942
Ah... I, the person in charge of development, will explain this to you.

401
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,446
This supplement, Sinpino, our main product, is

402
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,617
Silicon, known as silica, is used as the raw material.

403
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,453
silica? Don't you know?

404
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,122
Aging care beauty, boosting immunity, etc.

405
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,958
It is a component that is said to have various effects

406
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,295
Show us the raw materials and cost of the silica

407
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,297
Ah yes eh

408
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,435
Please wait a little (Paulownia stone) Yes

409
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,438
Ah this

410
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,441
Here

411
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,114
Is it such a high cost?

412
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,116
Of course!

413
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,785
Silica is also known as the "Mineral of Beauty."

414
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:24,956
For women who want to maintain healthy and youthful skin for a long time

415
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:28,626
It is an aging care ingredient that has gained enormous support.

416
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:33,965
It's silica that all foreign celebrities are now using.

417
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,968
is that so

418
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:41,105
No, I think if I add such expensive ingredients, it won't be profitable.

419
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,274
I've told the president many times

420
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:47,445
But once you decide, you're someone who won't bending it haha...

421
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,116
Our philosophy is to create good products.

422
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,286
Incidentally, we aim to improve manufacturing efficiency.

423
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:59,290
We expect profit margin improvements from next fiscal year Yes

424
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,962
I see

425
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:09,767
So, is this improvement the reason why they changed their production plant to Laos three years ago?

426
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,937
Could you show me the factory contract?

427
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:15,106
Of course

428
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,960
Where does this sales come from?

429
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,298
Ah, this is sales of products sold by subscriptions. Yes

430
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:44,269
(Imai) Why do we change the trading company here every year?

431
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,105
It is for cutting costs related to transportation.

432
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:51,609
Every year, we compare several companies to decide which business partners are.

433
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,779
(Imai) Please show us the information that shows employee salaries

434
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,115
Yes it's available here

435
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,129
<It's a chameleon paulownia stone>

436
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,779
Thank you for your cooperation for 2 days

437
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,949
We will contact you with the results of the investigation later.

438
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,951
(Paulownia stone) Yes

439
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,787
It seems that there were some unreported sales.

440
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,123
Ah, I'm very sorry for this mistake

441
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,961
I'll report it properly here

442
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,963
So, sorry

443
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,100
(Kiriishi) Thank you for your hard work

444
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:56,774
(Imai and others leave)

445
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:59,777
Ah, I got through it - I'm glad

446
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,779
You did well

447
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,949
The survey results were later, but there were no major mistakes.

448
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:08,119
I'm glad I asked you after all

449
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,957
Will this be taken over by the money country where I desperately earned money? What?

450
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,293
It was really good

451
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:19,964
Ah, how about celebrating your victory tonight?

452
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,133
Of course it's my treat

453
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,770
Yes, please

454
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,272
This

455
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:37,115
Oh ha ha ha ha, you drink a good amount of drink

456
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,585
No, please drink it too

457
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,921
No, the investigator's question: That's exactly what you read, yes

458
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,258
Ahhh, that developer's monkey play was also good.

459
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,261
Monkey play? thank you

460
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,097
But is it a monkey play? Hahaha

461
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:57,602
No, but in this country, how much tax should I take, I feel like it?

462
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:01,272
As you said, recently, lawyers have been having a lot of trouble.

463
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:04,776
I want to do well like Takashima-san too.

464
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,278
No, I'm not that big of a thing

465
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,115
No no no no Takashima knows how to make money →

466
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:14,419
I'm sure there are a lot of things being done outside of the company, right?

467
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:18,923
Well, how to make money? ...There are a lot of things, hehehe

468
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,925
So, what do you mean?

469
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,761
Is it a topic of investment overseas?

470
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,764
I see, it's a really interesting story

471
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:29,100
No no no no no no my private life

472
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,603
What, that's not... we're friends who managed to get through tax evasion together...

473
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,273
She's loud

474
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:38,443
What would you do if asked? Hahahaha

475
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,612
Please don't waste it, please let me know at least a little.

476
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:45,750
We are not a decent lawyer either.

477
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,088
Hahahaha It's certainly true hahahaha

478
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:54,425
Ahhh, then maybe a bit nice

479
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,928
I'm sorry I'll call you later

480
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,930
Yes (Kiriishi) Thank you

481
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,932
Don't go to other customers

482
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,269
So, just touch it a little

483
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,271
(Shell)

484
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,110
《(Asami) This guy might be a card that drops the tunes》

485
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,746
"What is this guy? 》

486
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,949
"This Takashima is a man"

487
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,252
"I'm the president of a small and medium-sized health food company."

488
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,589
"It's been listed by the police for investment fraud."

489
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:28,426
"I heard from Division 2 and it seems there are quite a few victims."

490
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:32,096
"If it's a cash-on-contribution fraud, it's probably the police's job."

491
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:37,935
"Takashima is a classmate from Otobe Mayor and his elementary school classmate, and he is still going to golf."

492
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:41,272
《If you hold on to your weakness, it might become a good card》

493
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,441
"I see"

494
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,611
"So, someone from us is going to sneak in."

495
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,580
"I have a friend who's perfect for infiltrating."

496
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,584
"Yeah"

497
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,921
Excuse me

498
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,423
What exactly is this?

499
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,425
Takashima-san, what does that mean?

500
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:04,262
It's a temporary seizure from the court!

501
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,266
This is because creditors are able to collect the claims.

502
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:12,103
Apparently they filed a temporary seizure of Takashima's account.

503
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:15,773
Debt collection? Those who have been asked to invest from you

504
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:19,443
Apparently he filed it on the grounds of fraud

505
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,116
Is there anything you think?

506
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,587
{Because we will build a factory for manufacturing health supplements in Laos}

507
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,256
"You told me not to ride that."

508
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,759
"How much investment did Iida-san invest? 》

509
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,428
{Individually...} {10 million yen? 》

510
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,431
{So what about Takashima-san, who approached me? 》

511
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:45,269
"They said they lost the investment money they collected by a local representative in Laos."

512
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,606
"Takashima himself is also a victim of being deceived."

513
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:52,276
"Takahashi-san, why not file a lawsuit with us? 》

514
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,745
"But the other lawyers don't win anyway."

515
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:59,116
"It's okay, I'll always get the proof."

516
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:04,088
{(Takashima) My useless tax accountant would be worried hahahahaha}

00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,600
《☎ますねこださいます》

527
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,437
《☎And it's intentional to have been fraudulent》 《Ah》

528
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,275
Well, don't worry

529
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,444
Fraud is a difficult crime to prove

530
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:05,116
He must prove that he was planning on deceiving him from the beginning.

531
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,118
deliberately?

532
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,921
But, I'm not a fool who talks about such things

533
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,923
There's not normally

534
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:19,764
{The important thing is to take the person you are deceiving to the site}

535
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:24,101
"We're actually showing that we're building a factory here."

536
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,103
{Oh, I see}

537
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,105
"But won't you get caught? 》

538
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:32,777
"Of course, it's obvious that money is handed over to the locals and they'll be able to make a comment."

539
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,613
"Don't you tell me that? Wow, 《The interpreter is also a tutorial》

540
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,749
{I see~} {(Takashima) Hahahaha, that's perfect →}

541
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:43,587
"First class like me will pay for lies first."

542
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,924
"It's rare for a woman to come alone."

543
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,094
"No, I'd like to come here once."

544
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,096
"The ladies are really pretty now too."

545
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:55,433
"Moms are also very excited"

546
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,435
Ha...

547
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,105
Takashima-san, what's up?

548
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:04,942
Oh, you're not sure, did you intend this from the beginning?

549
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,279
What are you talking about? Did I do anything?

550
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,282
Ah, ah

551
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:15,252
If you are looking for a good agent, please contact us.

552
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,589
Let's do this

553
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,093
Ah, there's one thing you want to ask?

554
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,097
Takashima-san you

555
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:31,936
With the mayor of Minato City

556
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,773
Looks like a classmate

557
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,920
Total of 12 cases, claims for compensation of 180 million

558
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:54,258
(Takashima) What's important is that you're deceiving, take the person you're deceiving to the site

559
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:57,261
Here we will build a factory

560
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,263
The intentional fraud is also perfect

561
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,599
The other day, when I first went to an adult club

562
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,769
I heard this from the seat next to me

563
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:09,440
This is a pretty pile of stuff, and I was surprised

564
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,776
I think I'll get both gold and trump cards

565
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,945
Uzaki

566
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,949
Well done

567
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,253
I'm

568
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,600
Thank you for your hard work on Takashima matters

569
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,103
Great for a radish actor

570
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,605
Hahaha

571
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,108
Chameleon paulownia stone was amazing

572
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,449
Uzaki Yes

573
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,952
Todoroki is

574
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,921
I don't have a grudge

575
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,089
Huh?

576
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,759
Someone has sinned your dad

577
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,097
Todoroki and I left the previous office to drag him out.

578
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,438
A little bit...

579
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,607
Trust the old guys

580
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,747
that

581
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,117
If you like, why not go out drinking after this?

582
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,088
I refuse, I'm a downdo

583
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,094
Ha

584
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,096
You're a tsundere

585
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,602
(Junko) So what? You helped with tax evasion?

586
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,605
So it's not, so what did you do?

587
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,274
Hmm, well

588
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,777
It's complicated to talk about, isn't it?

589
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,747
Simply put, yes

590
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:00,117
Hmm, I did the Mouse Boy... I guess so

591
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,253
A mouse boy?

592
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,422
So it's not a good thing

593
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,591
Mom is happy

594
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:10,427
When you said you wanted to quit working as a salaryman and become a lawyer

595
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,763
I was worried about what would happen

596
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,433
He's on the side of justice

597
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,436
Is that so?

598
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:23,440
I wanted to show my dad that Ryo was also

599
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,952
Yeah

600
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,114
{(Ryosuke) That's not possible →}

601
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,116
{You should have passed the test properly →}

602
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,419
{There's no one like that in my house→}

603
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,422
"This is something wrong."

604
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,266
good morning

605
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:28,439
Todoroki-san, please let me do the trial for the sound club now.

606
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,943
Todoroki?

607
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,949
a?

608
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,754
(Sigh)

609
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,758
What is this

610
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,432
It's done

611
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,768
This is when it was a club

612
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,937
{Oh} {Oh wwww}

613
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,440
{Ah, I've captured the evidence}

614
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:10,447
You were hitting me hard

615
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,251
What about Takaido?

616
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:22,426
Takaido Where did you go? Todoroki-san

617
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,270
(knock)

618
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,272
(Chiga) Please

619
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,274
Excuse me

620
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,448
Welcome to Three Star

621
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,924
Disciplinary claim! ?

622
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:56,593
This could be the last trial for a lawyer

623
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:59,930
Maybe they're just getting in the way of the shit of one staff member?

624
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,433
Don't think that what you see is justice

625
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:06,270
I want to know the truth about why he took his own life
