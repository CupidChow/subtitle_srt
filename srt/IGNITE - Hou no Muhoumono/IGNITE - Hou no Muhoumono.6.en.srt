1
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,639
(Uzaki) What is this

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,341
(Todoroki) I got hit

3
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:10,643
This is when I was at the club...

4
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,979
《Oh! 》 《Wow, wow! 》

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,983
"Oh, I've captured the evidence"

6
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:23,656
You were hitting me hard

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,993
What about Takaido?

8
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,167
Takaido Where did you go?

9
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,169
Todoroki-san

10
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,809
(Sigh)

11
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,314
I'll go to my client

12
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,316
Hey, Todoroki!

13
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:04,330
(Chiga) I'm off the hook, but there's a case I want you to join

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,332
(Takaido) Yes

15
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,668
(Chiga) I'm sure the other person will be happy too

16
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,670
Hmm...

17
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,311
(Misa) Dad (Matsubara) Ah...

18
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,647
What exactly does it mean? This article is!

19
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:24,651
No, this is... We trusted Todoroki and asked for it.

20
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,321
It's written about something like this that's not something that's just a weekly magazine...

21
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,658
Is it really okay to continue asking like this?

22
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,995
Of course, there will be no impact on the trial.

23
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:39,999
Anyway, I want to know the facts

24
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,003
Leave it to us

25
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,312
Disciplinary claim! ? (Inoo) He's a bee in tears.

26
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,649
This is... The most serious disposal is the expulsion

27
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,985
Losing your lawyer for three years

28
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,321
Of course it's not that great

29
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,990
He inspires citizens to file a lawsuit

30
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,326
Get evidence for illegal activities

31
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,330
I don't know how you'll be judged if you take it at face value.

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,000
The requester is attorney Chiga.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,670
Eh, I've never heard of a lawyer himself requesting it.

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,340
You're totally on the enemy

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,308
That guy...

36
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,310
What will happen next?

37
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,646
First, the committee investigated the matter.

38
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,982
If the screening is found to be black

39
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,317
Going to the Disciplinary Committee

40
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,654
What? What will happen to Mayor Otobe's trial?

41
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,658
Put your pet off before this disposition is taken

42
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,996
Chiga's one was aiming for this timing

43
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,000
It's getting more interesting isn't it?

44
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,003
ah…

45
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,648
Uzaki

46
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,318
I know there's something I want to say about Takaido

47
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,655
Focus on the sound club's court now

48
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,990
yes

49
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,994
The late Matsubara Chiri is in Minato City Hall's Secretary Division

50
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,330
He was the mayor's secretary

51
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,999
But suddenly a year ago

52
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:24,337
I was ordered to transfer to a department called the Special Needs Policy Division.

53
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:28,308
And then he tried to commit suicide at home.

54
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,312
So Matsubara's family became plaintiffs

55
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,315
Along with a claim for national compensation from Minato City

56
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,985
He filed a lawsuit for damages against Mayor Otobu.

57
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,654
That you're dealing with the mayor

58
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:44,657
Is there any direct relationship?

59
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,993
Matsubara-san was one month before his death

60
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:52,332
I once told my parents that I was isolated in the city hall.

61
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:57,337
She apparently said it was because she made the mayor angry.

62
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,640
What made the mayor angry?

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,009
I don't know

64
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,312
There is no evidence to support that

65
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,983
You have to take testimony from within.

66
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,985
Of course it is

67
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:16,322
It's a pretty monolithic office

68
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,330
The Special Needs Policy Division

69
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,667
It was a new one when Matsubara-san was transferred, right?

70
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:31,638
I'm pretty sure it was that way, but I'm not sure

71
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,641
What exactly did you do?

72
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,978
I heard about a department that supports crop damage.

73
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,981
It's been a lot of heavy rain these days, so hmm

74
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,983
Hey

75
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,986
Yeah? Ah... I don't know anything more than that either

76
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,656
(Otani) Do you need something for our staff?

77
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,665
This is Kotani, the secretary section chief

78
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,001
It seems they've been asking about the place the other day.

79
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:06,639
It would be a problem if you do not ask questions to staff through public relations.

80
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,642
That's sorry

81
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:14,647
I was very sorry about Matsubara-san's incident.

82
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:19,986
However, there is no such fact that it is being sued.

83
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,988
Please take it

84
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:31,331
Todoroki-san says that the secretary chief has issued a racist order.

85
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,000
His personality is tough

86
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,640
what? No, nothing

87
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,645
After all, it would be tough if you couldn't testify from inside out.

88
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:50,316
Ah, I would be reliable if Takaido were there at times like this

89
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,985
It would be nice if Takaido was next to me

90
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,322
His personality is so strong - Takaido

91
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,324
Takaido

92
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,661
Takaido

93
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:11,671
I knew that Chiga-sensei would win against the lawyer he had sought.

94
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,639
You have a bad personality

95
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,311
What is it? I thought it would be easier to do that

96
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:23,649
And this could be the last trial for a lawyer.

97
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,652
Please be polite, thank you

98
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,333
Haa! ? What is that

99
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,668
I thought that was definitely the reaction

100
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,004
Why is the one on the enemy side?

101
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,341
And in the first place, why did you suddenly quit?

102
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,310
If you have a good offer, then you'll transfer to a lawyer.

103
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,646
No, that's not what we are, right?

104
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:58,651
We are all individuals who have come together with their own ideas.

105
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,987
but…

106
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,656
There was no advice! ?

107
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,160
Don't talk to Uzaki

108
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,162
Yeah

109
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,008
(Elevator arrival sound)

110
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,985
Right

111
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,657
Why did you sell it for?

112
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,659
(Takaido) What's that about?

113
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,662
It's a dumb weekly magazine

114
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,997
You're the only one who has that photo

115
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,334
First of all, that agency is doing it too is crazy.

116
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,670
Why did you quit without your consent?

117
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,005
And turn back to the enemy

118
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,008
Isn't it ugly? Is it ugly?

119
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,010
Have you been scouted by a major office?

120
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,313
Maybe it's higan?

121
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:05,651
Otobu may have driven Matsubara to suicide.

122
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,653
Why are you defending such a person?

123
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,990
Huh? Is that the job of a lawyer?

124
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,326
What if that was her lie? →

125
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,662
What if it was paranoid? This is the victim

126
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:22,001
Are you really saying that? Don't think that what you see is justice

127
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:26,005
And I can't win if I continue like this anyway

128
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:36,315
(Otobu) Regarding the incident regarding the deceased Matsubara Chiri

129
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:40,319
My sincere condolences →

130
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,990
Regarding the currently filed lawsuits

131
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,660
We will deal with it appropriately

132
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:55,001
Has there been another lawyer? Yes, it seems like they're asking about a lot of things.

133
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,337
I know not to let the staff say anything unnecessary

134
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,339
There's an election this year

135
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,342
Don't let it go wild

136
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:10,650
Matsubara helped me with measures to prevent heavy rain in the fields.

137
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,654
He's still young, but he's not going to die

138
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:20,660
Has there anything changed compared to before?

139
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,664
What do you think? He was always a good and cheerful girl

140
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,000
Ah but...

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,005
Once I was talking, I suddenly started crying

142
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,341
Did you start crying? Yeah

143
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,010
He said "It's okay"

144
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,315
There's only one girlfriend in Matsubara's department, right?

145
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,985
I think there were a lot of overlapping

146
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,987
ah…

147
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,658
Is this 5?

148
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,661
No, 6 things?

149
00:09:55,661 --> 00:10:01,000
The client who had been trying to get the inheritance division case had to be stopped after all.

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,002
Is that one too?

151
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:07,640
Since the articles in weekly magazines came out, projects have been flying more and more.

152
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,311
If bad rumors arise, clients will run away

153
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,314
Chiga's guy is serious about crushing us

154
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,985
I'm back, how was it?

155
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,321
Matsubara-san: The reputation among the citizens was good.

156
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,324
Apparently he was in charge alone

157
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,327
It seems like I've been feeling quite stressed

158
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,663
Sudden transfer from the secretary department

159
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,666
Unable to handle workload

160
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,003
It must have been given some kind of fate from the sound club.

161
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:41,007
The number of cases related to workplace bullying is on the rise

162
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:45,011
It's difficult to prove the fact of bullying.

163
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,648
I guess there are no witnesses from inside.

164
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,319
That secretary section chief was Matsubara-san's boss, right?

165
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,988
What? That person is the mayor's right-hand man, right?

166
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,324
I can't drop that type

167
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,998
Ah, is it Matsubara-san? yes?

168
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,334
It's "Weekly People," but it was also an article.

169
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,003
Why are illegal lawyers selected as agents?

170
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,673
Any personal connection? What is it? I'm suddenly

171
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,008
There's no personal reason

172
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,010
So what about the incident?

173
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,647
There are also voices saying that the deceased Matsubara also had a problem. What do you think?

174
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,650
yes? What does it mean?

175
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,988
No, there are also stories inside the city hall that Matsubara was overly complaining of harassment.

176
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,990
Do you have any thoughts about your parents?

177
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,992
What's that? Since before

178
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,995
My daughter is a victim, please come back now

179
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,672
(Aobu) I wonder if this will be okay to interrogate it? yes

180
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,642
If you answer according to the rehearsal, it's fine.

181
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,644
I see

182
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,648
The article was published as if it were fine

183
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,650
(Chiga) I hope I can do everything I can →

184
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,652
The election is near

185
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,987
(Sound) The third term is on

186
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,990
I don't do it, who will be the head of this city? →

187
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,661
I'm the only person to keep the parliament

188
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,663
It's as you said

189
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,667
Maybe I'm getting in the way of just one staff member's mischief?

190
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,311
Do you do it often? That's how it is

191
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,981
Push the other person mentally before interrogation

192
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,650
It's very effective

193
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,987
As expected (Chiga) Takaido-kun

194
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,657
I'll make facts that can be made

195
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:43,996
Take a closer look at my method

196
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:49,335
Yes I'm collecting testimonials that can be used within the city hall

197
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,337
Please

198
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,341
Mayor: What was the article from earlier?

199
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,643
Any problem? (Otani) No...

200
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:02,982
The press club is also urging people to not take the case too seriously.

201
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,318
Finish this trial quickly

202
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,989
yes

203
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:14,660
Do you want to stop litigation? Yes, from Matsubara-san's

204
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,663
Why did you come this far?

205
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:26,672
An article has appeared here that attacks Chiri-san.

206
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,008
By continuing the trial like this,

207
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:33,012
I wonder if the slander against Chiri will be heated

208
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,650
What about Todoroki?

209
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,985
Called to the Disciplinary Committee

210
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:47,993
Now, let's start the process for the Disciplinary Committee.

211
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,997
Are you attorney Kenjiro from Peace Law Office?

212
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,668
yes

213
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,642
(Takaido) Yes, the date for interrogation is the 22nd.

214
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,645
Preparation is underway

215
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,647
yes

216
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,327
{(Yumiko)Hey you →}

217
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,330
"Does that mean you lost the court? 》

218
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,670
{(Yumiko) What will you do about this compensation?

219
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,640
《Hey you! This is...→》

220
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,643
"Hey, what are you going to do? ?》

221
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,646
{(Yumiko's Crying)}

222
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,330
Hey

223
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,002
Is this article you guys too?

224
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,005
So what?

225
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,641
Don't do anything dirty

226
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:13,312
It was Todoroki who taught me that no matter how much you use it, you can win.

227
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,315
Have you moved to your office to do something like this?

228
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,652
teeth? Hey, to do something like this

229
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,321
Have you become a lawyer? I'll train you!

230
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,324
I'm thrustling my head in every single time about people

231
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,660
You don't know anything, do you?

232
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,663
It's going to get persistent

233
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,998
Because they're friends

234
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,672
Don't get in the way, anything is fine

235
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,316
Matsubara-san

236
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,652
Hello, this is Uzaki from Peace Law Office.

237
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,992
Sorry, could you please listen to me?

238
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,328
What happened to Todoroki-san?

239
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,999
Todoroki... there's a bit of a situation

240
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,002
Instead, talk...

241
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,005
You should have told me I'd stop litigation.

242
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,641
Why?

243
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,311
Why Chiri-san died will be revealed in court...

244
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,982
So why should Chiri's dignity be hurt?

245
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,652
it is…

246
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,654
Can you go home?

247
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,995
As a city employee, Chiri supported many people.

248
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:43,669
Locals said that Chiri-san helped me...

249
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,007
When it rains, water accumulates on the road and cars cannot pass.

250
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,642
{(Chiri) This is a road used by farmers.

251
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,645
《I will apply to see if the road repairs can be done with subsidies.》

252
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,981
"Really? That's bad, so many things》 {Yes}

253
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,318
{No no, please let me know if you have any other problems}

254
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,321
{It's helpful, then} {Yes, thank you for your hard work}

255
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,656
Please listen to any consultation without slacking off.

256
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,992
{Hey Matsubara-san} {Yes}

257
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,329
Can you listen to us as well? 》 《Of course》

258
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,331
{It's hot, it's again today} {Noo}

259
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,334
Each person faced me properly

260
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,003
{I understand, I'll tell you.}

261
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,313
That Chiri

262
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:33,318
Why did you take your own life?

263
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,988
I also want to know the truth

264
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,669
Ah, somehow the lawsuit was allowed to continue.

265
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,640
☎ What are you going to do? It's still a terrible situation

266
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,342
There's another card

267
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,024
(knock)

268
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,701
(Paulownia stone) Hello Takashima-san

269
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,037
(Takashima) What's up here?

270
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,674
You... (Paulownia stone) Please sit down, okay

271
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:33,045
I came because they said they would consult me ​​about compensation.

272
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:38,684
Takashima-san You are a classmate from Minato City Mayor and your elementary school student, right?

273
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,353
They still seem to be very close

274
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:47,025
Ah, it's Yoshimi, my classmate, what is that?

275
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,363
Have you ever heard of a woman named Matsubara Chiri, who was the secretary of the sound club?

276
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,366
It must have been his favorite

277
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,037
Is there any thoughts?

278
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,678
You'd also consider a settlement in the same lawsuit, right?

279
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,686
Before you pay off, first of all, right?

280
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:20,692
Also, "Can you think about it?"

281
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,030
yes

282
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,036
Mr. Kotani

283
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,673
what? Do something like an ambush

284
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,343
Otani-san was Matsubara-san's boss when he was in the secretary department, right?

285
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,679
It's a problem if you don't get it through public relations

286
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,683
You must have been consulting with Matsubara about the mayor?

287
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,685
(Takashima) When I invited one of my secretaries

288
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,355
I was talking about how it was about to be reported inside

289
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,691
I looked at it but

290
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,028
It was exactly about a year ago

291
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,698
I wonder if Matsubara was able to bear the mayor because of this?

292
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,034
Who is it in the first place? This person

293
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,369
Do you think you can believe this story?

294
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,371
please

295
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,343
Could you be a witness to the plaintiffs?

296
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,346
Huh? What are you talking about?

297
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,682
I'm from the city hall

298
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:21,687
That's why I'm asking Matsubara to work desperately as a city employee.

299
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,022
Why did you choose death?

300
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,692
Do you feel nothing?

301
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,695
So I don't know anything

302
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,698
Maybe that's again...

303
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:38,370
No matter who asks at the city hall, I don't know.

304
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,373
If you were a colleague working at the same workplace

305
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,042
You probably don't know anything

306
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,679
It seems like Matsubara-san wasn't there in this case, right?

307
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,350
Excuse me

308
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,024
Haa...

309
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:32,024
According to the claim, you will be a lawyer affiliated with the agency.

310
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:36,028
It says that he obtained evidence by committing violence.

311
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,698
Do you have any opinions about that?

312
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,682
(Door opens)

313
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,667
This time it's quite a difficult situation

314
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,337
You have no choice but to go with the card you own

315
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339
Yeah…

316
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:30,682
Matsubara-san, please tell us what happened just before Chiri-san died.

317
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,352
Anyway, I'm late every day

318
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,689
His face was also very relaxed and there were few words.

319
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,359
When did that start?

320
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,361
(Matsubara) After I was transferred to a new department,

321
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,364
There was something strange about it before that

322
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:50,001
Does this mean it was from when you were the secretary to Mayor of Otobu?

323
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,003
(Matsubara) Yes

324
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:57,008
Have you ever spoken to your parents about your workplace?

325
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,010
About a month before he died

326
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:03,348
I once cried, "I'm lonely inside the city hall."

327
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,017
Why? Did you ask?

328
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:09,020
(Matsubara) It's because he made the mayor angry →

329
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,690
But I couldn't hear anything more

330
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,361
If only we could listen to more stories then →

331
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,030
Maybe this didn't happen...

332
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:27,005
Matsubara-san You said you had been consulted about your workplace by Chiri-san.

333
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:30,342
Why didn't you listen specifically to the story at the time?

334
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,345
That's because Chiri didn't talk about it anymore.

335
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:38,350
Maybe you and Chiri weren't close to revealing their worries?

336
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,353
yes? (Chiga) I'll change the question

337
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:45,357
Chiri-san's relationship with you, your stepfather →

338
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,359
Have you ever been troubled?

339
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,361
what do you mean?

340
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:53,031
(Chiga) Chiri-san was in junior high and high school, and was due to her relationship with you.

341
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,667
Apparently he's been running away twice, right?

342
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,669
Certainly that's what happened

343
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,005
But that's already been around

344
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,008
Not only that, Chiri's childhood →

345
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:06,344
You've been reported to the child consultation center, right?

346
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:10,682
Because of neglect from you, your stepfather

347
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,684
(A chaotic audience)

348
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,686
it is…

349
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,688
I've never heard of it before too

350
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:22,027
You are complaining that the reason for Chiri's suicide is at work.

351
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,362
Is that really all?

352
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:27,332
Are you trying to say it's my fault that Chiri died? →

353
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,669
There were times when parent-child relationships were complicated, but I was

354
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,671
I love Chiri

355
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,673
You are the cause of this incident →

356
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:38,343
Isn't it just that you want to think that it's in your workplace?

357
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:42,347
Or maybe your lawyer tempted you?

358
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:46,685
The plaintiff's agent is reported in weekly magazines and other media →

359
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,689
We are inspiring the public to create conflicts

360
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,024
This time, I'll make up a reason why it's not possible

361
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:57,662
Wasn't they instigated them to sue for compensation?

362
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:03,668
Judge: This matter has absolutely nothing to do with the reporting of weekly magazines.

363
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:09,007
(Presentative Judge) Defendant's representative Please make this a question related to this case

364
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,009
excuse me

365
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,345
That's all from me

366
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,254
This is Takaido, the defendant's agent →

367
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,590
Otani-san was Matsubara-san's boss when he was in the secretary department, right?

368
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,593
Yes (Takaido) Matsubara-san as his boss →

369
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,595
I heard that he admired Otani-san

370
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,931
Before Matsubara passed away

371
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,268
Have you ever had any advice about your work?

372
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,271
No, there was no

373
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,942
(Takaido) Have you ever heard of any complaints or concerns you have in your new department?

374
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,945
No, there was none either

375
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,949
(Takaido) I see. Now let's change the question.

376
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,951
In his former secretary department

377
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,254
Have you ever had any advice from Matsubara?

378
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,256
yes

379
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,259
(Takaido) Did you mean the parents you mentioned earlier?

380
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,598
No, it's not

381
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,268
different?

382
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,604
What does it mean to be different?

383
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,276
What Matsubara-san asked about was...

384
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,582
It's about the mayor of Otobu.

385
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,589
Matsubara-san was in his time as a secretary department

386
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,258
I was sexually harassed by the mayor

387
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,260
(A chaotic audience)

388
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,262
what! ?

389
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:41,266
(Otani) Matsubara attempts to report this fact inside out.

390
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,269
He became the target of the mayor

391
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,271
Huh?

392
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,273
What are you talking about?! ?

393
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:53,945
At the time, I was first consulted by Matsubara.

394
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,582
"To the mayor? Is that really? 》

395
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,584
"yes"

396
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,921
{Mayor, please come and visit us tomorrow}

397
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,257
"Me and the secretary department team are scheduled to board the bullet train at 8:30.

398
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,928
"Ah, that's the matter, but the Secretary Division has not come."

399
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,931
"What? Are you both? 》

400
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,933
"Yeah"

401
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,939
"I only got you and me"

402
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:26,277
《Sorry, what do you mean? 》

403
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,951
"I'm not a child, you know, don't you? 》

404
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:38,256
《Wait a minute, what are you talking about? 》

405
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,598
Why do you think I'll take you on a business trip? 》

406
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:50,268
"Because you said you wanted to let them learn a lot."

407
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:54,272
"Yeah, I'm looking forward to you."

408
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:03,281
"So think about it better for your career."

409
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:15,927
{I wonder if I'll report this to the harassment consultation center}

410
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,930
"About the mayor? " "yes"

411
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,934
"I can't forgive this kind of thing."

412
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,272
(Otani) The following month, Matsubara-san →

413
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:31,943
I was suddenly transferred to the newly created Special Needs Policy Division.

414
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,279
Why isn't there a subsidy?

415
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,583
{This is only after applying and passing the screening...}

416
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,585
《That's not going to be in time》

417
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,921
"What is the counter for? 》

418
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,923
"sorry"

419
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:49,594
(Otani) There, he was forced to do work that could never be done on his own.

420
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,596
{Shall I go out drinking today?} {Yes! 》

421
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,598
{Call the usual place...} {I've already called}

422
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,600
{As expected...} {I can do my job}

423
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,936
《Thank you for your hard work》

424
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,271
"Today is my treat"

425
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,943
"that…"

426
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,946
"Can we share a little more? 》

427
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:13,251
"Even if you say that, that's the job of the Support Policy Division, so I'm sorry."

428
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,921
{But um...} {No, I'm busy too, sorry, sorry}

429
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:22,594
(Otani) Make sure that the other staff don't even look up to the mayor →

430
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,597
I didn't lend a hand to Matsubara-san.

431
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,938
《Huh...》

432
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:42,280
I think Matsubara-san was crushed as a result.

433
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,282
Hey, Kotani! What have you been saying since before? ?

434
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,584
Mr. Otani: False testimony will be charged with crime!

435
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,921
What's going on? It's getting more interesting

436
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,590
Otani-san, why did you suddenly say that?

437
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,594
it is…

438
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:01,599
Because I destroyed Matsubara's whistleblower

439
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,270
(Takaido) Wait, why did you need to do that?

440
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,939
it is…

441
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,608
This is the mayor's instructions

442
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:14,612
All internal reporting regarding the mayor is also included in the facility.

443
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:18,283
I was being given the mayor and I didn't do that!

444
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,952
Yes, stop it now! I!

445
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,923
If we can trust Matsubara-san's voice and become our ally

446
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,258
sorry…

447
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,260
I'm really sorry

448
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,596
The judge witness is in a state of confusion with extreme tension

449
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,933
Takaido Stop it!

450
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:40,271
Matsubara always had fun talking about his family.

451
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,607
And yet...

452
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,276
I'm really sorry

453
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,278
(A chaotic audience)

454
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,948
(President Judge) Stay quiet! Be quiet!

455
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:55,587
Something... it's become amazing

456
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,257
It's a home run that's a comeback

457
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,265
Hey Takaido!

458
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,602
What exactly does that mean?

459
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,938
What does that mean?

460
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,274
Have you not noticed yet?

461
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,276
Huh?

462
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,280
Takaido Kogyo

463
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:29,254
I don't remember that small company →

464
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:34,592
14 years ago I was forced to blame for a defective product from a business partner.

465
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:39,597
A town factory that went bankrupt with a large amount of compensation

466
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:44,269
By the evidence of the trial you fabricated

467
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,273
{(Chiga) Presiding Judge: This is after the fire accident→}

468
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,943
[Data from safety tests performed independently by Alecia]

469
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:56,581
[According to this, the fire detection sensor delivered by Takaido Industries is included]

470
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,950
Multiple errors have been reported

471
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,254
{(Ryosuke) That's not possible, he should have passed the test properly}

472
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:11,262
Have you ever experienced a company panicking about delivery tampering with your data? 》

473
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,598
{(Ryosuke) There's no such person in my house→}

474
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,267
"This is some kind of mistake"

475
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,608
The sensors delivered by Takaido Industries are

476
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,946
He certainly passed the safety test

477
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:32,951
Was it "making facts that can be made"?

478
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:38,256
He fabricated evidence back then too.

479
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,925
you

480
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:44,262
So then... it's too late to realize it

481
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:48,266
Well, you don't remember the guy you beat in the trial.

482
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,601
Was it you who insisted Kotani to reveal it?

483
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:54,272
Oh, this isn't an emotional guy like my parents' enemies.

484
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,607
This is my own stake

485
00:32:56,607 --> 00:33:01,946
I don't think you'll be allowed to do this

486
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,282
That's this line

487
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,251
Hey

488
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:15,259
Small businesses don't underestimate

489
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:42,587
{Welcome home} {Oh Toma, did you go home first}

490
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,589
{Yes} {Haha}

491
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,267
{That's it}

492
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,603
"I've stopped going to university after all."

493
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:03,608
《Why? Did your dad say they'll do something about the cost of university? 》

494
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,611
"I'm going to become a lawyer" "Lawyer? 》

495
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:12,950
{If you're a lawyer, you can pass the preliminary exam without going to university}

496
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:18,589
"I don't want to increase people like my dad anymore."

497
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:42,280
Oh, I'll start looking for a job right away

498
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,949
Huh, it's you again

499
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,951
Did you come and say something even if you hate it?

500
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,921
You were the one who let Otani-san tell the truth, right?

501
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,926
That person I don't know just spoke on my own

502
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,595
Hmm, is that so?

503
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,265
What? Did you come to say that? no…

504
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,604
I'll come back to the office

505
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,941
teeth? No, you're kidding, right?

506
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,276
No, I'm the type who can't joke about it

507
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,947
No, no, no, no, there's no way someone who normally sold their friends can go back.

508
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,282
Ahhh?

509
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,585
Ahhahaha

510
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:24,255
(Takaido) What's wrong, I don't think they're friends

511
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,592
No, that's not what I mean, hahaha...

512
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,596
Well, it's certainly not a decent office.

513
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,934
But what we can see

514
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,604
I think it's justice

515
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,613
Well, there's something a bit too much

516
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,952
Haa...

517
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,922
Well, it's fine

518
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,925
I understand, I'll go back

519
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,261
Yeah? Wait a minute

520
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,263
What is "I'll go back"?

521
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,932
Why are you reversing the position?

522
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:11,936
Or rather, you've said something to Otani-san, right?

523
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,272
Huh? Did I say something?

524
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:19,277
"You should answer according to this question or answer."

525
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,946
{Yes please}

526
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,949
"Understood"

527
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:30,588
{Otani-san, there's one more story}

528
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,590
"yes? 》

529
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,928
"You knew it, didn't you? About the sexual harassment that Matsubara had suffered

530
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,934
《What are you talking about? 》 《Information gathering is my specialty》

531
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:46,604
"Since I'm an agent, I could listen to as much as I want inside the city hall."

532
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,943
"Why did you decide not to do that? 》

533
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,613
"Maybe because you were scared to be the mayor's target? 》

534
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,950
"What's been going on since before? 》 《I heard it》

535
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,953
{When you were a young person in the Accounting Department}

536
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:05,590
{He was probably bullied at work...→}

537
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,593
{Mr. Matsubara, who was troubled by his relationship with the mayor, →}

538
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:12,263
"I should have relied on you, my boss first."

539
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,600
《You have destroyed it to protect yourself》

540
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:21,606
"That's how you made Matsubara-san something that's not possible either? 》

541
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:27,278
"It seems like Matsubara-san wasn't there in this case."

542
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,584
{Ah...}

543
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,923
{Takaido-san}

544
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,260
《I guess it's me》

545
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,930
《Tell the truth during witness interrogation》

546
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:53,604
"My other lawyer told me about it."

547
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:59,277
{This seems like Matsubara-san wasn't there →}

548
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,613
《Being that kind of person at work →》

549
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,284
"I should have known that it was the hardest."

550
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,254
{Even so →}

551
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,923
"I didn't give her anything."

552
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:20,264
Wow... well, that's fine

553
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:24,268
Hey, it's already open so I'll buy everything tonight

554
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,604
teeth? You are the one who treats you in the situation

555
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,607
Senior? You've never thought you were a senior, right?

556
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,276
Not once, but are you seniors?

557
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,613
No, if you've never thought of it, you won't be able to treat it

558
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,924
Well

559
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:57,601
Sorry everyone

560
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,612
Has the rebellious phase ended?

561
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:13,584
The project has been flying, so I have to find another spark

562
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,588
What about that disciplinary claim?

563
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,261
Hmm

564
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:30,935
Not even considered, and was avoided from going to the Disciplinary Committee.

565
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,271
It's you

566
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,942
I submitted a video of the club to the committee later.

567
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:41,278
Well, this is it

568
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,281
It's just self-defense after all.

569
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:48,586
Oh! Oh!

570
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,255
You don't cut out anything weird

571
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,927
But what about the stolen?

572
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,931
Statement: There's no such fact

573
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,601
Previously written by plaintiffs

574
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,605
Is that so?

575
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,777
Okay! This makes us feel safe and secure

576
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,946
Amazingly proven to be a great office

577
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,948
Yeah? I'll take lots of projects from here

578
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:21,585
oh! No, it's not particularly safe, though

579
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,587
Yeah? Yeah?

580
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,589
Yeah? Oh? Oh?

581
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,925
Yeah? Why don't you say anything?

582
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,928
Yeah? I'm trying to cheat something about this

583
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,281
I was completely encouraged by Todoroki-san.

584
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,951
Yeah? Please don't be fooled anymore

585
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,254
Did you put it on purpose, right? Past court records →

586
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:00,257
When my father loses the trial, the other lawyer

587
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,593
To teach Chiga too

588
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,260
I wasn't the lawyer

589
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,263
You don't have a court record?

590
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,265
You'll do anything

591
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,934
I don't know what you're talking about

592
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:46,937
You're way too much this time?

593
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:50,274
I was worried that I might become unemployed

594
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,611
(Takaido) Well, that's because Todoroki-san.

595
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,580
Yeah? Did I give it to you?

596
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,949
(Takaido) Yes to you?

597
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,951
(Takaido) Yes

598
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,933
Is there a mayor of Otobe?

599
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:20,604
Sorry, but... what are your appointments?

600
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:24,942
If you tell us Peace Law Firm, you'll understand.

601
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,944
(knock)

602
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,946
Mayor took me

603
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,949
Sorry, I suddenly pushed

604
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,952
What do you want to do with me, the other person?

605
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,921
The verdict has not been released yet

606
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,924
The recent reveal of a witness

607
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,927
It seems like there's a battle

608
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:48,265
In fact, we have a proposal

609
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:54,271
settlement? yes

610
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:57,274
If the mayor please give us some conditions

611
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:01,278
Here we have preparations to meet a settlement

612
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,949
What are the conditions for this?

613
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,952
One is

614
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,588
Compensation for the family

615
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,257
The other is...

616
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:17,261
A bus accident occurred in Minato City five years ago.

617
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,597
Of course you remember it, right?

618
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:25,936
An accident that was dismissed as driver's fault

619
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,940
I know that the police and Minatoichi joined forces to cover up

620
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,277
Why did you hide it?

621
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,581
What do you do when you know that?

622
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,953
My daughter is

623
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,255
I died in that accident

624
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,928
Tell me what you're hiding!

625
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:55,599
That's why we've come this far!

626
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,609
Is that what it is?

627
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,952
I'll tell you

628
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:20,257
I'm not the boss you guys think

629
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,943
(Sigh)

630
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:54,258
It's a group molester

631
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,261
It's been spreading so much now, and it's been coming up all the time lately

632
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,930
I wonder if there's anything about Mari's problems?

633
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,599
Kuroda is definitely going to catch him.

634
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,603
We are not a lifelong wounded existence
