1
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,949
(Todoroki) What do you think? Did you find it?

2
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,286
(Inoo) It's pretty hard to find a former employee at GI Technologies.

3
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,956
That's why I can't go into the main castle yet

4
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,125
Do your best and move your hands

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,127
(Takaido) I'm back~ Oh

6
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,129
Todoroki

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,131
Yeah? I found it

8
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,133
Huh? Huh?

9
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,637
GI Technologies' core members of development had retired just before the accident occurred →

10
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,639
That's what this guy is like

11
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,975
Well, Takaido (Uzaki) Ah

12
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,778
If you've been there until the last minute, you probably know something

13
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:48,448
Finally, I've reached the point where I can drag Ishikura down.

14
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:52,285
I'll get evidence of the system going out of control at all costs

15
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,288
(Ishikura) Are your preparations going well?

16
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,624
(Chiga) Everything is in no time

17
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,627
What are you going to do about the system error?

18
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:05,298
(Chiga) Data remaining on the bus burned in the wake of an accident, so none remains →

19
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,635
The rest is an error record that went to the company.

20
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,804
People and things that can be evidence

21
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,772
Both have been supported

22
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,608
{(Takarada) What specifics about the project at that time →

23
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:19,446
"Only some of our employees, including myself, know about it."

24
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:23,616
Can you list which employees have how much information? 》

25
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:26,953
{Each person I will talk to you}

26
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,955
"Are you going to do that? 》

27
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,459
{Takarada-san, you depend on the outcome of this trial}

28
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,794
"You'll lose all your company and assets."

29
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,630
《I know, I'll prepare it soon》

30
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,633
"please"

31
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,306
You have no more left

32
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:50,610
Don't let your feet get scrubbed again with personal grudges

33
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,780
I know

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,949
Mochizuki-san, Murai-san

35
00:01:55,949 --> 00:02:00,286
Both of them previously worked at GI Technologies.

36
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:05,291
(Mochizuki) Yes, I worked as a programmer until five years ago.

37
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,962
(Murai) I'm on the same team as Mochizuki.

38
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,966
We were told that the bus accident that occurred in Minato City five years ago was the cause.

39
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,636
Thinking it's in GI Technologies' autonomous driving system

40
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,638
We are conducting an investigation

41
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,608
I don't know much about the accident

42
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:25,778
We left the company two months before that accident happened.

43
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,947
Why did you quit?

44
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,953
I guess I can't keep up with the president's thoughts

45
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,290
So I started bumping into various things

46
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,294
Was that because they were told to hurry up with system development?

47
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,297
Behind that accident

48
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,300
There are people who are guilty of innocent sin

49
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,637
Please let me know anything if you know

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,310
That accident has always been in my mind

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,612
What does it mean?

52
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:05,618
Back then, the goal was to get the system out of the way quickly.

53
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,955
The error hasn't been completely resolved yet

54
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,625
So, the system errors were reported after all.

55
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,962
The error caused a bus accident

56
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,631
Is there a way to prove that?

57
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:24,637
If an error occurs in the autonomous driving system

58
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,639
The error signal is

59
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,975
First, the actual machine installed

60
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,977
I'll jump to the system company

61
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,614
The system company is the defendant's GI Technologies →

62
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,783
The evidence should have been deleted

63
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,952
Did you have no data left on the bus?

64
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,455
All the equipment that was installed burned

65
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,624
(Murai) Is that so?

66
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,627
There's one more

67
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,970
System monitoring company →

68
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,639
Self-driving is normal

69
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,141
Check whether the system is operating normally.

70
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,978
I always check remotely →

71
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:09,282
At the time, that company was outsourcing the monitoring part to an outsider.

72
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:14,287
That's right, after that, the surveillance system suddenly became in-house by the company.

73
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,290
The surveillance company that was entrusted to

74
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,294
(Mochizuki) is a company called Mobilino

75
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,296
Mobirino

76
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,969
Actually, there's one more request for you two.

77
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,473
Would you please testify in court as a witness?

78
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,475
Are we?

79
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,978
Yes, when you two were at that company

80
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,283
I would like you to testify that a system error has been reported.

81
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,453
Understood

82
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,455
thank you

83
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,625
(Elevator arrival sound)

84
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,966
(Executive Officer) Court, the company manager, please

85
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,635
(Okubo) Evidence preservation...

86
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,972
Records from the day should remain on the server.

87
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,974
Please help

88
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,445
I see, there were no monitoring records?

89
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,115
Yes, I guess Ishikura's side has already put his hands around.

90
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,117
I guess

91
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,119
Is it really difficult from the front?

92
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,622
It's Mobilino

93
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,793
There are few people, and there's something unvigorating

94
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,128
I see

95
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,130
Understood

96
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,132
(Kiriishi) Was it bad?

97
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,301
Haa... I was ahead of it

98
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,970
(Kiriishi) It's not an easy opponent after all.

99
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,283
If Kana was alive

100
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,619
I'll graduate from university next March

101
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,294
I sometimes think about it

102
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,298
Kana, who has been over 16 years old,

103
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,967
What path did you go?

104
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,969
Do you have a dream?

105
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,306
Does he have a boyfriend?

106
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,609
You don't want to smoke about me

107
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,979
That's all sorts of things

108
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,956
(Sound of placing a desk lamp on a desk)

109
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,628
That nightmare

110
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,966
Sometimes I get crushed

111
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,974
But that nightmare

112
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,978
The one who killed Kana

113
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,614
drag it out with this hand

114
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,785
It won't be over until you give a punishment

115
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,789
Haa...

116
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,626
Tongshi

117
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,963
I have a request

118
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,804
Welcome home now (Junko) →

119
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,306
You're going to eat dinner, right? Tonkatsu today! Yeah

120
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,308
Have you not had a lot of cutlets lately?

121
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:26,145
Because it's finally the last trial, there's no good guy.

122
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,281
Ah... ah, sorry yeah

123
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,616
Yeah? I ask my mom to give me a plaintiff again

124
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,618
What are you talking about?

125
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,288
If your father's innocent sin is cleared

126
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,957
Mom, I'll do anything

127
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,960
(The door opens) Ah, sorry, the store is finished...

128
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,130
(The door closes)

129
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,300
You...

130
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,303
Nice to meet you Uzaki-san

131
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,974
It's a bento shop with a taste

132
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,610
Was it suddenly? Did you come to threaten me?

133
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,980
No, I'll put it straightforward

134
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,785
Could you please withdraw the complaint against GI Technologies that we are currently filing?

135
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,121
Huh? What are you talking about?

136
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,959
I don't want the trial to last long either.

137
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,963
The Mobility City Project is related to national interests.

138
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,299
Because it's for national interest

139
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,301
Does that mean you should just accept it?

140
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,138
Of course, I will pay the appropriate amount

141
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,307
(Junko) Please come back

142
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,477
We

143
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,780
I'm not trying to judge for money

144
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,953
To clear my dad's regret

145
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,955
I'm fighting

146
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,294
Is that so sorry

147
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,297
But is that really okay?

148
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,635
Ishikura-san is the only one

149
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,970
Be prepared

150
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,141
I see

151
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,146
So, excuse me

152
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,782
(Door opening and closing sound)

153
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,620
Ha

154
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,123
(Uzaki taps Junko on the back) Oh...

155
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,638
Thank you

156
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,640
(Asami) Do you want to eat it?

157
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,976
Todoroki is enough for donuts

158
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,978
Hehe

159
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,781
I was able to search for the dark casino.

160
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,783
Kuno was also coming and going after all.

161
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,952
bingo

162
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,954
I mean, is it okay?

163
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,623
It's not an area that's easy to step into...

164
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,625
Thank you for your concern

165
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,628
But I also want to break the rules.

166
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,300
Ah, that's gone

167
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,776
I have to get you to win

168
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,778
(footsteps)

169
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,780
Ah

170
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,624
(Incoming call from the vibrator) Ah, sorry, I'll be excuse for a moment

171
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,793
Yes, this is Inoo

172
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,795
Huh?

173
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,136
Uzaki!

174
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,640
What about Junko?

175
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,975
The surgery is still going on

176
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,977
I see...

177
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,114
No, sorry

178
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,116
What if this happens

179
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,286
No, it's my fault

180
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,122
That's not true, it's my fault

181
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:09,128
I became a lawyer to protect what is important

182
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,464
in the end

183
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,133
I'm causing my mother to go through this

184
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,306
Ah... Todoroki-san, sorry

185
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,977
I don't want to lose it anymore

186
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,616
I don't want to lose anything anymore

187
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,662
Don't be kidding!

188
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,664
It's rare, you

189
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,666
Is this a place

190
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,170
(Incoming Vibrator)

191
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,172
Mochizuki-san

192
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,809
Yes, this is Ino. What happened?

193
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,811
☎ (Mochizuki) I'm sorry

194
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,647
I would like to refuse to appear as a witness.

195
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,649
What does it mean?

196
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,153
There's the matter about Uzaki's mother.

197
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,822
I wonder if we'll be experiencing that too

198
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,491
That's... this won't happen anymore

199
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,661
What would you do if it happened?

200
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,664
☎ Sorry I couldn't help

201
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,666
(The phone will be cut off)

202
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:29,008
Where are you going? It's no use staying still like this

203
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,010
(Door opens)

204
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,012
Ryoko-san...

205
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,014
Thank you

206
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,983
(Tongue tapping)

207
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,323
(The door closes)

208
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,993
Ou

209
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,830
What's that?

210
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,165
I was thinking of saying that...

211
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,167
Isn't that the case?

212
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,169
I almost said it

213
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,005
I've heard about Uzaki-kun's mother

214
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,009
I never thought he would be aiming for the plaintiff

215
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,314
Ah... it was unexpected

216
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,984
I'm going on with what I need to do

217
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,321
That's bad

218
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:20,159
Until now, I have been sending out cases that I couldn't save from criminal cases to you.

219
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,163
It's strange that the police and the prosecutors can't do that in the first place.

220
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:28,334
The time has come for this organization to break down once

221
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,336
you

222
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,672
We probably got quite inspired by it.

223
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,674
Maybe

224
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,344
I've become an outlaw too

225
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,315
I'm working another job too

226
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,819
(Elevator arrival sound)

227
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,992
Mochizuki-san

228
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,342
(Door opens)

229
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,818
It's been a while since I've come here

230
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,989
Ever since I handed Junko's business card

231
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,993
already…

232
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,663
I don't know if I can do the store

233
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,668
Before I first came to this shop

234
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:40,005
I hated your family

235
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,011
But what I saw here back then

236
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,647
Though I suffered from the fact that it was twisted

237
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,650
Your mother is living hard

238
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,652
It was Junko's appearance

239
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,324
I was inspired by the death of my daughter Kana.

240
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,327
I created Peace Law Firm

241
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,997
Well, it's basically for revenge

242
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,001
but

243
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,671
While meeting a variety of clients

244
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,675
There are people in the world who are not speaking up

245
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,345
I learned there are a lot of people

246
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,988
It's a trial I got involved

247
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,991
Of course you have the right to stop

248
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,161
But Uzaki

249
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,664
Until I grasp the truth

250
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,000
It's a little more

251
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,002
Just a little more

252
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,337
Your father, Yuuo

253
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,007
You can clear Kana's regret

254
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,010
That's why our friends

255
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,012
He's fighting

256
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,649
You're in

257
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,985
My office has changed

258
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,323
Both Inoo and Takaido

259
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,993
Due to your influence

260
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,995
I've become persistent

261
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,006
Asami and paulownia stones are the same

262
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,645
Sometimes ignore positions and rules

263
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,315
Take risk

264
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,318
He's trying to get the truth

265
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,321
You are

266
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,659
He fired us up

267
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,998
Uzaki

268
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,002
The trial is not over yet

269
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,004
Still alone

270
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:56,508
There are still people who can fight for your dad

271
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:04,650
In the end you'll do it

272
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,491
It's inside you

273
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,327
Only for that straightforward justice

274
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,329
Don't lie at all

275
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,984
Todoroki-san

276
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,994
I'll do it

277
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,152
(Door opens)

278
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,321
(footsteps)

279
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,060
It's coming out

280
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,067
This is Inoo, the plaintiff's agent.

281
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,069
Mochizuki-san, you

282
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,039
There was a bus accident until just before March 2020

283
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,044
You worked as a programmer at GI Technologies Inc.

284
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,381
What kind of work did you do there?

285
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:54,052
From then on, GI Technologies

286
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:59,057
We were developing systems for unmanned autonomous driving.

287
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:03,395
I was in charge of source code development as a programmer.

288
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,064
The autonomous driving system that was developed

289
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,368
Has there been any talk of actually trying it out somewhere?

290
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,704
Yes, it was supposed to be going in Minato City →

291
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,374
For the Mobility City Project →

292
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,710
I was in a hurry to obtain actual driving data on roads

293
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,048
How well was the system completed at the time?

294
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:28,720
The schedule was a phase where we collected driving data on public roads.

295
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,890
All errors have not been resolved yet

296
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,893
What is that error?

297
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,865
It's just a small probability

298
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:46,038
An error was reported during testing that the autonomous mode was unintentionally activated

299
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,042
If so, the bus with the system on it is running.

300
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,045
Suddenly, the autonomous driving mode is activated.

301
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,048
Brakes and other controls become unavailable

302
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,051
Does that mean there was a possibility?

303
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,554
I think there was

304
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,390
Yes (the audience is getting a stir)

305
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,060
As someone involved in development

306
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,063
That system shouldn't have been released yet.

307
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,065
Because of that

308
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,068
Many people will be sacrificed

309
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,704
I don't think it should happen

310
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,374
That's all from the plaintiff

311
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,379
Mochizuki-san You're just now

312
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:31,049
You mentioned an error in a system under development

313
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:36,221
You talked about this before you left the company, right?

314
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,390
If yes

315
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,226
What you said is the error

316
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,729
Whether it existed at the time of the accident

317
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,064
You probably can't know?

318
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,701
But you should not be able to resolve the error so quickly.

319
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,704
You said you left the company yourself, but in reality

320
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,541
Due to delaying development schedules multiple times

321
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,877
It was effectively a fired

322
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,046
You're because of that

323
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,215
Isn't he having a fate with the company?

324
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,717
Objection! This question has absolutely nothing to do with this matter

325
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,721
This is an important question to determine the authenticity of a witness's testimony.

326
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,060
There is no reason for the objection, so please answer the witness.

327
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,729
It was my intention to quit the company

328
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,065
It was a messy development schedule in the first place.

329
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,067
Is that so?

330
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:26,872
You To clear your grudge from being fired from the company for not being supported

331
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,541
A small system error that occurred at the time

332
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,544
Isn't this an exaggeration to make a claim?

333
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,713
That's not the case!

334
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:42,053
(Chiga) We would like to ask Takarada, president of GI Technologies →

335
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,389
From the earlier witnesses

336
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:48,226
About the autonomous driving program developed by your company

337
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,229
There was a story that an error was reported

338
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,231
Is that true?

339
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,867
Yes, system development is

340
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,370
It's a series of trial and errors

341
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,041
Of course we were aware of the error Mochizuki was talking about →

342
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,044
I was putting all my energy into solving this problem

343
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,380
Shows Exhibit 8 →

344
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,217
This is the work report dated February 18th.

345
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:16,721
Here we will explain "What was the malfunction of the autonomous driving system, which was a concern?"

346
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:20,392
"The test confirmed the resolution."

347
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,727
It is stated

348
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:27,232
Is this okay that the problem has been resolved?

349
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,068
If yes

350
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,705
About the system installed on the bus where the accident occurred

351
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,875
Does that mean there was no fact that Mochizuki had mentioned?

352
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,877
There shouldn't be

353
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:42,547
Leave the error and load the system into the car

354
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,549
That accident generally →

355
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,887
It's because the driver was taking drugs, right? →

356
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,223
It's completely unrelated to us

357
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:56,061
If there is an error in the system, where is the record left?

358
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,864
The actual vehicle and our company

359
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,700
And at the time, they asked for operation monitoring.

360
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,369
An error code is flying to a company called Mobilino

361
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,205
There's a record there, right?

362
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,207
yes

363
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:14,045
Apparently the plaintiff's lawyer has gotten into Mobilino.

364
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,381
It seems there was no record of that

365
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,717
thank you

366
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,052
That's all from the defendant

367
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,400
This is Takaido, the plaintiff's agent.

368
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,538
Takarada-san You're just now

369
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,707
Errors reported on the system that was under development

370
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,878
You said that it had been resolved at the time of the accident.

371
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,880
yes

372
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,384
And if there's any problem

373
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,220
In addition to your company, we were outsourced to operate monitoring at the time.

374
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,056
If an error code is sent to a company called Mobilino

375
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,392
yes

376
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,894
How many times do you make me say the same thing?

377
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,231
Is that possible that the record will disappear automatically?

378
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,233
there is no

379
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,235
Records disappear without permission

380
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,038
Is it possible that it will be automatically rewritten?

381
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,040
Objection! The judge

382
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,543
There is no evidence, and it is a very exploratory interrogation.

383
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,379
Plaintiff Agent What is the intent of the question?

384
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,883
Here's why I repeat such questions

385
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:29,721
I will present the judge's Ichiba No. 15, which I will be submitting now.

386
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:35,060
This was sent to Mobilino at the same time on the day the accident occurred.

387
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,395
A system error record

388
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,698
Yes (the audience is getting a stir)

389
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,866
what?

390
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,704
Yes, it seems I've surprised

391
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:50,542
This was from a server from Mobilino, who said there were no records.

392
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,378
I recovered the data and got it

393
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,714
Huh? Here

394
00:26:55,714 --> 00:27:01,386
There is certainly a record of the error code when the autonomous driving mode was activated.

395
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,556
Takarada-san, why is this?

396
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,558
How do you do that...

397
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,396
it is

398
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,398
(Black the testimony)

399
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,535
Because Mobilino has become our company

400
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,537
Huh?

401
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,706
Huh?

402
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:25,377
"Does it mean that they're acquiring Mobilino? To get an error record

403
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,213
{Ah} {Didn't there be anything in the preservation of evidence? 》

404
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,715
"Chiga must have put his hands around."

405
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:34,052
{But depending on how you do it, you might be able to get it back later.

406
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,388
{That's why I'll buy it from the company, normal}

407
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,390
"Mobilino's president is"

408
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,725
"Perhaps they're aiming for an exit"

409
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:45,063
"The truth is, after the contract was terminated by GI Technologies."

410
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,867
"The achievements have declined and even the best engineers have left."

411
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,870
"I'm sure they're thinking about selling it in a good place."

412
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,206
{No, but it's just a venture company.}

413
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,208
"What are you going to do with money?"

414
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,210
"Tung Stone"

415
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,380
Why are you firing a lot of lawsuits?

416
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,716
"I earned compensation."

417
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,053
{I'm just for this}

418
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,722
"I've lived for the last five years."

419
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:14,059
"Just to drag this truth out"

420
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,729
"Hats off to your obsession."

421
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,067
《In the future mobility society》

422
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,703
"What is your business with the operation monitoring system?"

423
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,206
"It's so attractive to our company."

424
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,209
"I'm grateful that you said that."

425
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,379
"I don't intend to sell the company yet."

426
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,048
{Hahahahaha...}

427
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,552
"Company has a loss for four consecutive years"

428
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,222
《Even excellent engineers abandoned

429
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,225
"Next business plans are not visible either."

430
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,563
《Such a downturn venture》

431
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,399
"I'm telling you it's attractive."

432
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,206
《What do you think? 》

433
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,042
"We're in a hurry too."

434
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,047
{(Tap the keyboard)}

435
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,383
{(Yoshino)...there are a lot of people using it.}

436
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,387
"Hey, did you say something? 》

437
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,389
{No, it's nothing}

438
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,059
《Recover your data by tomorrow》

439
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,394
{Tomorrow...}

440
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,730
"Are you a genius engineer, right? 》

441
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:30,869
As Takarada-san reminded me earlier

442
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:34,038
If the error record does not disappear automatically

443
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:37,375
Does that mean it was erased by someone else's hand?

444
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,047
What do you think?

445
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,050
It would be too bad to buy the whole company for proof.

446
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,219
It's typical of Todoroki

447
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,555
Objection! This accident already

448
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,557
Driver is affected by drugs

449
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:56,394
This is because the person was unable to make a proper judgment or drive operation.

450
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,396
Bus companies also accept it

451
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:03,868
Agent's claims are exaggerated by taking abstract possibilities.

452
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,204
Do you have any evidence?

453
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,709
there is

454
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,395
This is Uzaki, the plaintiff

455
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,399
From here I will explain

456
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,203
Certainly, the autopsy results at the time of the accident

457
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:43,374
Uzaki Yuo's body responded to the ingredients contained in anti-anxiety drugs.

458
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,376
Reported

459
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,379
But the truth is different

460
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,550
From now on, I will submit it as Exhibit 16.

461
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:56,054
Shows the forensic anatomy statement (typing on the keyboard)

462
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:59,390
This was at the time when Uzaki Yuo was in charge of the forensic autopsy.

463
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,392
It's from Dr. Kuno

464
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,394
what?

465
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,400
{(Kano)Hmm... Sorry →》

466
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,369
《Out》

467
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,205
"Is it over already? 》 《Huh? 》

468
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:18,042
"You're riding it now, isn't it? It's a waste."

469
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,044
{Well, well... Ahaha}

470
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,380
《Let's have more fun》

471
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,050
{Right ha, one more time}

472
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,698
《Whew…》

473
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,373
{Ahaha, okay?}

474
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,375
{(Hagiwara) It's the police! 》

475
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,543
《Everyone should just move! 》

476
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,545
"Hey, don't move! 》

477
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,547
《(The floor is in a state of uproar)》

478
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,549
{Ah, it's open! 》

479
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,387
《Huh?? 》

480
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,389
《Huh? 》 《Maybe →》

481
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,724
"Aren't you Kuno-san? 》

482
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:11,062
You can also do something you didn't see

483
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,064
"Is it true? 》

484
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:18,536
"You were in charge of an autopsy for the driver who died in the Minato City bus accident, right? 》

485
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:22,373
[An autopsy results submitted to the police]

486
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,375
"That's a falsehood, isn't it? 》

487
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,713
{Ah, it's... uh}

488
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,382
{Ah} {Is it okay}

489
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,384
《Shape like this》

490
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,386
{Guhh...Guhh}

491
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,388
{Ah...}

492
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,390
《There was, right? 》

493
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,394
"A strong request from the police upper elite"

494
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,863
{Why am I that?}

495
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,232
"Denuine gambling debt"

496
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:51,235
"You got it on, didn't you? 》

497
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,872
In fact, it comes from Uzaki Yuo's body

498
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:58,876
The drug reaction was not as clearly stated in the autopsy results.

499
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,878
Dr. Kuno testified.

500
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,880
Yes... isn't it different?

501
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,883
It's not true... what does that mean?

502
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:11,055
Police quickly identified the cause of the accident as a side effect of the drug.

503
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:14,726
The fact that the autonomous driving system installed on the bus went out of control

504
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,395
It's to avoid making it public, right?

505
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,231
What are you talking about? Behind it

506
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,368
The Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism at the time

507
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:28,039
Is there a presence of current Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishikura Shoji?

508
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,708
Ishikura?

509
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:34,712
Objection! From the moment ago, all claims that are not related to this matter have been repeated.

510
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,048
I'll explain the relationship from now on

511
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:42,387
This table shows the shareholder composition of the defendant on the presiding judge No. 12.

512
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,389
As this evidence suggests

513
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,725
GI Technologies' major shareholder is Ishikura's wife

514
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:50,061
This is a company represented by Miyoko.

515
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:53,698
GI Technologies received a large subsidy from the government

516
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,068
The mobility city project is now spreading everywhere.

517
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,871
I've now taken on the role of the main system

518
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,373
The company is aiming to go public soon

519
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,710
A structure has been created in which profits flow under Ishikura.

520
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,712
I agree?

521
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,715
Minato City, where the accident occurred

522
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,719
It was supposed to be the first city in Ishikura's Mobilicity Project.

523
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,388
Mayor Otobe was originally a junior of the Ishikura faction.

524
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,390
It must have been a lot of convenience

525
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,060
Stop saying whatever you want! But before the project was announced

526
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,396
An unexpected outrage occurred

527
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,067
Ishikura was trying to hide the cause of the accident.

528
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,536
He handed over the police and Minato city

529
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,376
My Father

530
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,046
He made Uzaki Yuuo a crime

531
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:52,056
Many companies are working sincerely to advance autonomous driving technology

532
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,725
It's the tragedy you guys have caused!

533
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,368
This was happening behind the Minato City bus rollover accident

534
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,370
It's true

535
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,617
Plaintiff Uzaki

536
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,989
Your deceased father

537
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,292
What kind of person was Uzaki Yuo?

538
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,797
My father...

539
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,637
He was a tough person

540
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,308
Karate, which I've been doing since I was little

541
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,979
I never let him rest from practice

542
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,316
just…

543
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,986
Whether you win or lose a match

544
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:01,459
He praises me for what he did very hard

545
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,629
He was such a kind person

546
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,969
You were the trigger for that accident

547
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:16,974
Apparently he quit his job and wanted to become a lawyer.

548
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,976
yes

549
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,979
That bus accident

550
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,982
As soon as it was reported that it was his father's fault

551
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,319
At my parents' house

552
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,622
Harassment and slander have begun

553
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,961
I was so frustrated that I couldn't do anything back then

554
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,965
Your loved one

555
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,634
To protect in the true sense

556
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,636
I became a lawyer

557
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:52,643
The truth about when Yuuo passed away

558
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,313
It's now revealed like this

559
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,617
What do you think?

560
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,963
My father...

561
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,471
My father

562
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,473
I want it back

563
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,977
It's strict

564
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,980
My kind father

565
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,482
Only one father

566
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:36,988
I want you to give it back to my mom

567
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:43,294
But I know that won't go well

568
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:47,298
So at least

569
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,637
My dad is straight for work

570
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,475
That he was a great person

571
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,644
I want to prove it

572
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,983
To those who criticised my family

573
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,987
To everyone in this world

574
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,293
My father was the best person

575
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,130
I want to say

576
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,976
That's all from the plaintiff

577
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,464
Hello

578
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,633
If you were the Secretary General, you wouldn't come here.

579
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,635
What are you planning to do?

580
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,971
It's tough, because of your trial

581
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:04,141
The approval rating of the Ono Cabinet fell flat

582
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:07,645
Maybe you're thinking of crying to the Secretary General?

583
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,147
Because of you

584
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,983
All of the efforts so far have been ruined

585
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,319
Have you tried so far?

586
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,122
What is the effort to cover up an accident?

587
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,958
What I see isn't what I see

588
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,960
It's the future of this country

589
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,130
I think about it more than anyone else

590
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,800
And yet, you ordinary people will keep making a fuss about small things

591
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,803
While the world is making a fuss about a vulgar scandal

592
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:36,640
More important bills have passed the Diet behind the scenes.

593
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,809
Many people don't know that

594
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,811
Look at the trees, don't see the forest

595
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,813
That's what the common people are

596
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,318
My daughter and Uzaki's father

597
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,987
Is it a small tree you call?

598
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,290
That's what it is

599
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,626
I see

600
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,628
Is that your justice?

601
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:01,966
But for someone who can't protect the tree in front of you

602
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,968
You can't protect the forest

603
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,470
Someone who can't protect someone in front of you

604
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,973
There's no way we can think of the future of the country

605
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:13,144
The great cause you're talking about is just self-satisfaction in the end!

606
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,649
I'm glad I was able to talk

607
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,287
Now you can do it without worrying

608
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,291
I'll soon find out

609
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,629
That we are wrong

610
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,635
Can you understand that?

611
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,972
Country interests? future?

612
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,975
We're not talking about that

613
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:49,146
Those who died in an accident

614
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,315
I'm talking about life

615
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,987
No matter how great you become

616
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,790
I'll go to hell

617
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,795
Uzaki

618
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:09,633
Sorry, my lawyer is cumming well and has a bad mouth, haha

619
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,969
It's no good, if you go to hell, you

620
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,638
That person can go by himself

621
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,640
ah

622
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:26,317
He is said to have been involved in covering up a bus accident that took place in 2020.

623
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:31,789
Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishikura announced his resignation at the Prime Minister's Office earlier

624
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,125
Due to the influence of the civil lawsuit that was recently lost

625
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,963
It is believed that this decision was reached due to concerns about a decline in the approval rating of the Ono Cabinet.

626
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,965
Chief Cabinet Secretary please say something!

627
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,133
Chief Cabinet Secretary please say something! Why are you silent?

628
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,302
Chief Cabinet Secretary!

629
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,305
(Hagiwara) Asami-san seems to be about to begin the investigation meeting.

630
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,307
OK

631
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:08,292
(Aya) Today I made a reservation at such a wonderful restaurant.

632
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,294
Thank you

633
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,797
Aya?

634
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,967
this

635
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,969
Huh?

636
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,974
Are you going to get revenge? Aurora

637
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,977
He remembered it

638
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,979
ah

639
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,649
Hmm, uhhh

640
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,785
Amazing thanks

641
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,298
Dad is

642
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,634
He was the dad we believed

643
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,644
Mom is very satisfied!

644
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,290
Did you report it properly?

645
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,292
yes

646
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,631
I protected my dad's pride

647
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,135
yes

648
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,137
Uzaki

649
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,308
Thank you

650
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:35,646
No, this is it

651
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:39,617
Thank you so much

652
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,289
Ahhh I'm finally moving forward

653
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,972
Ahhh, this is bad

654
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,308
(Mayor) What's wrong?

655
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,312
No, this from the factory over there →

656
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,315
Chemicals may be flowing into the river

657
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,451
(Mayor) Chemicals? Of course it's awful

658
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,988
This could also lead to health damage to residents.

659
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,625
What should you do? Mayor, will you sue your lawsuit?

660
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,128
That's a lawsuit like that

661
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,631
The village chief

662
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,633
The conflict is

663
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,635
You should wake up
