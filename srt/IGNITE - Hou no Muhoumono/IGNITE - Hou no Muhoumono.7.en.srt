1
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:09,009
(Solo) I'll say that, I think you guys are thinking

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,978
Not the boss →

3
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:16,983
Revenge? If so, I recommend giving up

4
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,486
Rather

5
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,988
No matter how you try, I can't get there

6
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:25,658
(Todoroki) Who is it? What's above you

7
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,660
(Sound) Is it okay?

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,998
I think there are some things in this world that you shouldn't know about

9
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:37,003
It's fine. Be clear whether the terms of settlement are met or not

10
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,646
Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism at the time of the accident

11
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,648
It's Ishikura

12
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,985
Ishikura?

13
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,491
The Cabinet Secretary?

14
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,827
You understand

15
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,997
I just have to leave it alone

16
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,667
Don't be fooled, let me talk

17
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:12,005
Everything Ishikura was trying to do in Minato City

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,323
(Inoo) What's wrong? At times like this

19
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,993
(Takaido) It's not so calm even looking at the people

20
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,663
Something unexpected happens

21
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,333
I've had to tell you that

22
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:45,004
Ino Takaido

23
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:48,475
Sorry, but from here on, for you two

24
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,643
Why don't you take a different action?

25
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,980
I can't involve you any more

26
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,985
Um... so quickly, what's going on...

27
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,987
You mean getting involved?

28
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,991
Please tell me exactly what you can't get involved in

29
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,495
I don't understand what it means to suddenly act differently

30
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:17,170
It's not crisp, it's probably about a bus accident five years ago.

31
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,007
Did you know? (Takaido) This accident was a hot topic at the time.

32
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:25,478
Moreover, among those involved, there are surnames Todoroki and Uzaki →

33
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,480
There's definitely something to do with it

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,983
(Kiri stone) It's true that you'll find out if you look it up.

35
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,987
What's more, it was just after a fight with the mayor's music club.

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,828
If you want to go down the boat, at least give it a reasonable explanation.

37
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,999
I don't need to be shy, I'm a friend

38
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,334
(Uzaki) Takaido You...

39
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,315
It's exactly as you say

40
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,152
There is a big fate between us and that accident

41
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,992
As reported at the time

42
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:17,330
Everyone died in the broken car

43
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,166
Among them...

44
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,009
My daughter was there too

45
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,318
(Asami) The cause of the accident was Uzaki Yuo, the driver of the bus company →

46
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,655
It was determined that it was negligence by Uzaki-kun's father.

47
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:48,494
My father took a drug with strong side effects

48
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,664
Apparently it was causing the bus to go out of control

49
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:56,502
But by chance, I was doing another investigation nearby.

50
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:01,007
See the accident on the day

51
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:05,979
So the fact that I noticed is distorted

52
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,315
The evidence was tampered with inside the police.

53
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,317
Does that mean it was under pressure?

54
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,486
Yeah

55
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,490
At that time, a project to put autonomous driving into practical use

56
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,993
It was moving under the surface

57
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,662
This is the Mobility City Plan.

58
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sure autonomous buses are being run all over the country.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,170
That's right, the first Test City of that plan

60
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,172
It was Minato city

61
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,175
So, on the bus where the accident occurred?

62
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,312
It probably had an autonomous driving system.

63
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,649
However, the test itself in Minato City was immediately after the accident.

64
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,651
It's been blank

65
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,987
What was it that didn't exist to move forward with the plan?

66
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:51,324
The truth behind the accident was buried in the dark →

67
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,993
Team up with the police

68
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:01,000
(Takaido) Then I don't really understand the meaning of different actions.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,003
After all, isn't it the place where he's finally cornered the sound club?

70
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,476
The enemy wasn't finished with the sound club.

71
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,979
But Minato City...

72
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,483
Right now, the plan is being pushed nationwide

73
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,485
Does anyone know?

74
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,487
No way...

75
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,991
Yes, the current Cabinet Secretary

76
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,327
It's Ishikura Shoji

77
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,001
Ishikura: It's definitely predictable

78
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,005
So

79
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,175
Well, I guess it's a bit of a read

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,979
I can't help but date you in such a big way.

81
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,983
Even if you spend all your money and time

82
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,487
At worst, there's a chance you won't get anything

83
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,658
So you guys are going to do it now...

84
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,993
Hey Ino-san

85
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,162
of course

86
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,498
Are you sane?

87
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:10,169
I haven't returned with a half-hearted determination, so I've just got on board the boat.

88
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,171
Because

89
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,312
I'll wear it to you

90
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:24,650
I have no intention of leaving it all out

91
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,652
Right, Uzaki

92
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,490
yes

93
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,661
I definitely want to catch the enemy

94
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,664
You just need to prove Ishikura's cover-up?

95
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,666
I'll help you

96
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,003
Someone's fate is our fate

97
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:48,341
You've changed some kind of character

98
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,477
Huh? That's not true

99
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,480
No, it's changed (Takaido) It's not changed

100
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,484
Ah, the betrayal that happened the other day, did you regret it a little?

101
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,987
(Takaido) What? that

102
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,156
No no no...

103
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,669
I knew a little about the two of them, but

104
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,339
I never thought I would fight the top of the country.

105
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,009
What's more, even Ryoko was involved.

106
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,312
Apparently he's been silent forever

107
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,648
It's been 10 years since I last met

108
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,983
Because it's a sensitive story

109
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:35,488
Ah, of course, she hasn't talked about Mari-chan anywhere other than Todoroki.

110
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,990
That's a thank you though

111
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,326
I thought so

112
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,496
To defeat the big boss together

113
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:48,000
I wonder if there's anything about Mari's problems?

114
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,004
That guy's coming out again?

115
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,642
Again, Ryoko-san is overprotective to me

116
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,312
Let me worry

117
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,651
What is his source?

118
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,988
I've experienced it five times since then

119
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,157
I'm used to it

120
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:18,831
Isn't he still scared somewhere in his heart when he says that?

121
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,334
Mari, 17, is

122
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,641
That's not possible

123
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,311
I'm already 27

124
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:37,149
I've long since lost my target

125
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,987
Kuroda Keisuke? yes

126
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,323
Man arrested for voyeurizing Mari

127
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,994
Ah, when Inoo was in high school

128
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,497
I've been in prison for the past year

129
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:55,501
4 criminal offences for molestation, only 1 year

130
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,005
The wounds on the part that was damaged continue more

131
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:03,643
Ino came to our house and was his first source?

132
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,981
He looks bright at first glance

133
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,818
I pretend to be friendly and try to follow someone as much as possible →

134
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,820
You know the reason for traveling by bike

135
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,657
I'm afraid to get on the train

136
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,660
There's no way out, so I can't let my guard down

137
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,998
That's how I casually defend my mind

138
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,336
I wish they could rely on more friends

139
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:34,340
It takes courage to rely on you, so this kind of problem

140
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,309
I see

141
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,645
I think it's okay now

142
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:44,984
If it appears, I'll beat you up

143
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,987
I said that when I was in high school

144
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:52,825
Hey, why does Ryoko do this much to me?

145
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,994
Because that's weird

146
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,998
Why does it have to be even stronger when you are victimized and injured?

147
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:03,002
As a police officer, it's frustrating to make you think that way.

148
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:07,807
I am able to live a decent social life thanks to Ryoko

149
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,010
I'm not doing anything

150
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,980
And the Otaku office

151
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,482
I'm also wondering whether it's decent or not

152
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,484
surely

153
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,991
Yesterday Takaido said "friends"

154
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,661
Ah you said that

155
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:34,000
I feel the same way too

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,004
Something is the only one person who can't get through

157
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,340
I feel pathetic

158
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,983
Shall I take you to your room, okay?

159
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,985
Really? Isn't it scary?

160
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,154
So stop overprotecting

161
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,324
I'm afraid of men now

162
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,326
It's not like night roads are scary

163
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,328
I'm fine again

164
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,997
It's really different

165
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:11,003
But... I'm not confident, maybe

166
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:16,175
When it's time for an emergency, it might not be possible

167
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,313
I couldn't refuse at that time

168
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,983
Because it was swallowed

169
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:29,989
Ah... I'm groaning again

170
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,491
I'll go home and go to bed soon

171
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,495
Ryoko is back too, come on

172
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,498
Good night Good night

173
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,500
thank you

174
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,151
It's finally out

175
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,153
Good morning Inoo-chan

176
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,989
Ah, what is it, Uzaki?

177
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,159
Yeah? It's not like "what?"

178
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,161
What? Why did you laugh?

179
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,163
Hehehehe

180
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,165
Yesterday, Asami said it to me.

181
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:17,002
I drank too much, so I asked him to go and pick him up from home.

182
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,338
Ah, that's what it is

183
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:23,008
How much did you drink really overprotective?

184
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,979
Yes, yesterday was already a gut-doo

185
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,982
That's bad, that's bad

186
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,319
But I don't know why is it me

187
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,988
Because Uzaki is the lowest

188
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,992
Don't stop doing that? I'm already there, and I'm usually older

189
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,329
Still a low-level, single-celled, stupid

190
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,332
Ino-chan is really cheeky, but unconventional and cute

191
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,835
Ah, sexual harassment, crime of insult under Article 231 of the criminal code

192
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,004
Don't you stop? That's what it is

193
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:58,477
Oh, by the way, have you heard anything else from Ryoko?

194
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,313
Huh? No, nothing in particular

195
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,316
That's fine

196
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,988
If there's something, say it

197
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,657
what up? Suddenly gentle movement

198
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,494
Oh, what's wrong? I asked about it or what happened? Let's hear about it

199
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,831
(Ishikura) Towards the global economy like it used to be

200
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:23,002
We must regain such a powerful national power.

201
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,638
To do that, it's technology

202
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,007
We are proud to be a technology powerhouse

203
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,477
I have to show it to the world again

204
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,482
Ishikura I'm tweeting again, what?

205
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,651
No, especially the new information

206
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,820
I'm irritated but

207
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,988
"I inspected a certain site yesterday."

208
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,492
"I was excited about technology that gives you a sense of the future."

209
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,661
I'm desperate for branding

210
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,163
Right, I feel an obsession

211
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:55,000
I mean, what is this photo? Did you like track and field?

212
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,803
Ah, what's wrong with this kid again?

213
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,006
Miura Ayane is a girl It's been spreading so much now

214
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,309
It's been coming up all the time lately

215
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,978
But the comments that were posted are pretty bad →

216
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,314
The photos are obviously awful purpose

217
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,316
You're taking pictures without your permission

218
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,153
ah…

219
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,807
《(Shutter Sound)》

220
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,003
《(Shutter Sound)》

221
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,980
This guy is spreading

222
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,657
《(Shutter Sound)》

223
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,160
He has a pretty scary face

224
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,329
What are you looking at?

225
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,331
Huh?

226
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,669
What is this? It's terrible

227
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,004
It's a bit malicious

228
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,313
I'd better let the school know this

229
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,315
Huh?

230
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,483
What high school? Show me a bit

231
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,988
Sakurabashi High School OK

232
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,996
Hey... ah, what if it's Sakurabashi High School?

233
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,165
My name is Uzaki, a lawyer.

234
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:11,003
Apparently a student from the track and field club has been voyeurized

235
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:15,007
Yes, personal information has also been spread on social media.

236
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,009
We're worried too

237
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,312
Yes, I think schools should take some measures...

238
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,020
Have you heard something from Ino-chan? No, not

239
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:34,026
Noooo, I'm a bit shit so I want to catch him

240
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,695
No, just being trash bad is not enough to do your job, right?

241
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,031
That cool you

242
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,701
No, I'm currently searching for Ishikura for you.

243
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,037
That's thank you

244
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,039
But now I'm prioritizing

245
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,043
It seems like this guy is running a suspicious dark website

246
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,012
a?

247
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,016
I'm just so annoyed, I can't forgive you

248
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,019
Are you selling crime videos?

249
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,522
Ah, it's completely out

250
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,359
What's more, despite being such a malicious site, there are a lot of subscribers.

251
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,529
Well, eroticism is a good-looking shinomaki with half-grace

252
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,032
Can you try and explore a bit?

253
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,034
(Sigh)

254
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,037
Yes I understand

255
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,507
No no, sorry, yes

256
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,011
Leave it alone

257
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,515
What? Does it mean that you'll deal with it at school?

258
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,852
No, he doesn't seem to be doing anything special

259
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,356
A lie... It seems he doesn't want to deal with the police.

260
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,025
I'm planning to quit track and field at high school

261
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,028
It's going to end when you retire

262
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,030
Can I take it again?

263
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,034
now? No, of course it's fine

264
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:54,373
I think this girl is probably enduring it

265
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,341
endure?

266
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,044
I'm actually hurting

267
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:03,515
I'm trying to suppress it and get through

268
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,687
But that's definitely a mistake

269
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,689
No matter how much you hold back

270
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,025
Someone who saw this picture became a stalker

271
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,360
There's a possibility that things can get weirder

272
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,362
Ino-chan?

273
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,034
Ah, sorry

274
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,704
I want to stop it before the worst happens

275
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:33,178
Well, I know a little

276
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,016
When is it when a person goes on a thrust?

277
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,854
surely

278
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,022
I might know if it's Uzaki

279
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,363
That's it...

280
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:56,368
I'll probably talk on the phone now

281
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,205
Something that happened to me before

282
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:05,043
That too, Uzaki

283
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,348
Is it okay to listen?

284
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:13,018
Yes, listen

285
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,187
Understood

286
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,536
☎ (Asami) That's good, the school also told him.

287
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:34,039
I'll try to talk to Ayane directly.

288
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,043
☎Thank you for your hard work

289
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,350
Sorry, I'm waiting, okay?

290
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,687
Okay, shall we go?

291
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,695
(Ayane) I'm grateful for your concern

292
00:19:56,695 --> 00:20:01,533
I really don't want to get any bigger

293
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:14,346
Can I talk about my own little bit?

294
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:18,684
Anything that would put a burden on that student...

295
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,686
Of course

296
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,527
I was in high school too

297
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,196
I suffered a similar damage

298
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,201
Are you talking about voyeurism?

299
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,203
Yeah

300
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:45,043
I'm not saying this because I want to instill trauma, though

301
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:51,016
I still can't take the train

302
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,685
It's still

303
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:57,022
Can you point your smartphone lens?

304
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,192
I'm twitching from the shutter sound

305
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,028
At the time, I was even given a hand

306
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:07,032
I walk and turn around

307
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,702
It was 10 years ago

308
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,672
Even if you don't force yourself to talk

309
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,041
Let me talk

310
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,044
I don't want to increase the number of people like me

311
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,349
I'm the same as Ayane

312
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,520
I was caught by a strange man at a club event.

313
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,203
{(Kuroda) Congratulations, it's great that we won}

314
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:48,507
{Hello...} {You were on the bench all the time today →}

315
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,509
{Ah but thanks} {Um...}

316
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,511
"I'm glad I was able to see Ino-san for a long time"

317
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,515
"But I really want you to play in the game."

318
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:02,354
{Because you can see a variety of poses that way}

319
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:09,027
After all, at the match venue

320
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:14,533
What, then, has it been since then?

321
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,035
Yeah

322
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:22,040
I've now been stole to trains outside of school.

323
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,343
worst

324
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,012
That alone was enough to scare me

325
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:31,016
One day, a photo of me wearing my uniform

326
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:35,020
My senior told me that it's on an adult site

327
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:41,026
So I can no longer continue volleyball

328
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,695
I understand

329
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,697
Feeling like I want to stop

330
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,034
Why did I get mad because of that guy?

331
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,037
So I told them everything in the police.

332
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,039
Then

333
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:59,044
More voyeur photos appear

334
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,681
Ah there are so many

335
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:10,021
Was he arrested properly?

336
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,023
Yeah

337
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,861
Violation of the ordinance for preventing nuisance for voyeurism

338
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,530
"Even if you leave after your sentence"

339
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,366
"I'll never get close to Mari-chan"

340
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,369
"I and the police will always protect you."

341
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:28,673
It was a reoffending and the fact that they were selling photos

342
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,177
And my PTSD was also considered

343
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,180
Ten months prison sentence has been issued

344
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,018
Only 10 months?

345
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:43,355
Oh, then come out soon...

346
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,526
Targeting only high school girls

347
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,695
He was a guy who repeatedly took voyeurism and molestation.

348
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:55,033
By the time I came out I had graduated

349
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,036
And

350
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:03,041
I heard that the man was released from prison again recently

351
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:08,013
I was really thinking it might be okay

352
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:12,017
Does that mean you're still scary?

353
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,525
I was dragging you, I couldn't refuse properly

354
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:29,534
I don't want Ayane to be like this

355
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:35,040
That's why I don't want you to give up fighting

356
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:51,356
Actually, I couldn't tell my parents or teachers

357
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,526
After that one

358
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:59,030
Men get scared

359
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:06,371
Even if you have a boyfriend

360
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,373
the…

361
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,676
It's okay, I know

362
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,012
Even if I stop athletics

363
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:18,183
When I think that this kind of feeling will linger on me forever

364
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,020
That's the scariest

365
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,024
My body

366
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,361
It feels like it's not yours

367
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,031
That's right

368
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,039
That's good

369
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,041
Meet Ino-san

370
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:51,516
I thought I had no choice but to carry it on my own forever

371
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:57,022
I won't tell anyone about what's happening now

372
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,357
I promise

373
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,027
thank you

374
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:21,346
what happened? I've been silent for a while now

375
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:32,023
Amazing, yeah?

376
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,026
Even though such a difficult thing happened

377
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,362
Become a lawyer

378
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:41,166
Isn't that both?

379
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,004
Hey

380
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:50,508
I wonder if there's anything I can do as a man?

381
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:55,347
Uzaki is surprisingly not a single cell

382
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,849
Ah, are you being made fun of again? I praise you praise you

383
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:02,020
I don't feel like I'm being praised at all, it's true

384
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,523
That's what I said earlier

385
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:09,828
That's what made me want to become a lawyer

386
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,497
Is that so yes

387
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,000
Just when I quit my club activities

388
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,670
I've heard about an OG lawyer.

389
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:24,009
That's when I came across words that really encouraged me.

390
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,345
Hmm, what word?

391
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:31,349
{(Eto) If you know the law, you can make a sound →}

392
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,019
{Even if you have no choice but to just accept it →}

393
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,522
{Even if you're scared and have no choice but to shut up →

394
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:42,527
"You should be able to stand up as long as you have legal knowledge."

395
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,330
I thought it was a good word

396
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,033
I decided at that time

397
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:51,002
I'll become a lawyer too

398
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,672
Is it just the first move?

399
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,674
It's great

400
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,511
So this agency is something strange about Inoo-chan.

401
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:04,015
But Ino-chan was in another agency before, right?

402
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,351
yes

403
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:12,023
But in my second year, I was forced to do a criminal case for the first time.

404
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:17,028
I couldn't believe my client

405
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,030
If you remember Kuroda

406
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:24,669
I was thinking that he was the one who hurt someone

407
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,672
But I have to defend

408
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:31,676
Of course it's tough

409
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,678
Yeah

410
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,682
that's why

411
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:41,352
I want to fight for someone who can truly believe in me

412
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,857
Peace is a strange agency though

413
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,359
It's better now

414
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,029
I see

415
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:55,500
If so, I want to fight for Ayane

416
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,670
Yeah

417
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:05,009
And also, my 17 year old self

418
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:08,012
I feel like I can save you

419
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:13,017
As expected

420
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:17,689
I'm glad someone will fight together

421
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:21,025
Certainly there is

422
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:27,499
So I'll support you with all my might until the end

423
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,501
Oh

424
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,003
Uzaki is also cheering up

425
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,507
I'm not feeling well because I don't come to my dad

426
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:38,510
No, at all?

427
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,512
Is it true? I'm eating a lot

428
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,514
Really, ah, that's good... That's good

429
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,691
Really, hideen, my heart is shit

430
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,027
You don't have to force yourself to look

431
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,030
it's okay

432
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,000
This isn't a molester-like tactic

433
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,002
It's true that there are actually victims.

434
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,004
It's a group molester

435
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:10,175
So they're human scum.

436
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,679
Wait, this is "Shaba"

437
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,348
Maybe he came out of prison

438
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:22,020
Takaido Can you check who owns this account?

439
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,356
I'll talk about the situation, I'll try to find it

440
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,358
thank you

441
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:32,197
We'll also gather other information that will help you grab their tails.

442
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,004
Yeah? Looks like there's something offline meeting

443
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,674
Let's go and beat these guys all over

444
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:47,679
Wait, there's no proof that you cornered me somewhere like that.

445
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,015
This is when you attack in a smart way.

446
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,017
So how?

447
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:57,188
Well, he'll do something about it

448
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,825
Is it true?

449
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,827
Finally

450
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,663
Yes, thank you

451
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,340
Kiriishi-san

452
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,512
Thank you for your hard work, no, that's impressive

453
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,849
They bought a handle name that they haven't posted in a long time and infiltrated an offline meeting.

454
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,519
I'm sure you've done some preparations, what are the characteristics of your account?

455
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,023
30 years old male Handle name is Sailor Colonel

456
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,193
I'd prefer a scarf sailor suit

457
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,496
By the way, what kind of things did Kiriishi-san buy?

458
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,498
Of course I

459
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,667
I'm a black gal fetish

460
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,338
of course?

461
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,340
What? Of course

462
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:57,382
(Lick lick lick peroncino) I'm really grateful to Rotel-san. The girl in that video is god

463
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,084
The reality of innocence is incredible

464
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,054
(Löther) That expression doesn't appear in the AV that was created.

465
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,056
(Fishing Fishnet Teacher) So did you see it? Ayane-chan

466
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:08,726
Wow, I saw it, it's precious

467
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,728
I'm sure he's a bird

468
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:14,065
If you filmed that girl's video, wouldn't it be pretty good content?

469
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:17,068
I guess it's L'Other (Lick Pe Peroncino), but it's the track and field club.

470
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,570
Don't you resist quite a bit? No, it's surprisingly good

471
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,240
(Lick lick lick peroncino) Is it really? (Fishing Fishnet Teacher) That kind of girl is more serious

472
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,576
It's like you can't make a sound because you're worried about the eyes of those around you!

473
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,081
Cool your head, will you feel better if you let your head blow away?

474
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,717
But they're getting mad here

475
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,054
What are you saying for them?

476
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,556
What happened? Are you in a fight?

477
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:42,560
No no no no, we were fiercely slamming each other's preferences.

478
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,063
Hahaha... No, I'm really sorry

479
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,566
It's fine, Colonel Sailor is free to express →

480
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:52,070
Also, the next scene is fine, isn't it? Yes?

481
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,074
That's right, but it's actually the first time I've seen it on site.

482
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,410
Ah, is it true? The one who keeps the room is Grandpa Bird, right?

483
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,080
Yes, can I introduce it if you like?

484
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,082
oh! (Lick lick lick peroncino)

485
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,552
Grandpa Birds, Grandpa Birds, thank you for your hard work

486
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,054
There's someone I'd like to introduce to you →

487
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,557
Colonel Sailor attends the first offline meeting

488
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,059
(Yoshino) Ah (Perople Pelopelo Nenchino) I want to participate in the next scene

489
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,062
Thanks to Grandpa Toriji, I am grateful to meet Ayane-chan.

490
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,065
No, I would like to let you go to the next location.

491
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,067
Even the camera clerk does anything

492
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,069
It's fine

493
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,071
Well then

494
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,075
(Peoplepelopelonino) There's an account that disappears, right?

495
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,578
Colonel Sailor is silly

496
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,080
All communications on the site are here...

497
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,082
(Perfect for Pelopelopelonino) What is it? Of course there is

498
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,084
That's interesting

499
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:47,892
Are you the representative of the video site? He originally looks like an incredibly skilled engineer.

500
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:52,063
They have a system of various services and are like celebrities in the community.

501
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:56,067
That's valuable information, I'll wash it

502
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,237
That idiot doesn't have to mess up

503
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:03,408
Damn it! I wanted to punch them all down

504
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,878
I've done it to you, I've been able to endure it, what is Colonel Sailor?

505
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,715
What is a colonel and why is he a little high?

506
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,717
Calm down

507
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,888
I'll keep that anger until the day I need it

508
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,724
I'll save it for you

509
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,065
It's really coming like this

510
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,568
A shitty crime prediction

511
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,072
First, let's take measures against group molestation X-Day

512
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,574
It would be better to go to school on that day by using a different route.

513
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:41,079
I definitely don't want to show her before these guys...

514
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,247
I'll definitely aim again

515
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:47,085
Is it better for the person to just throw a smash?

516
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,557
But you don't need this courage

517
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,560
There may still be other ways

518
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,062
Please let me go

519
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,066
After hearing about Ino-san

520
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,069
I've been thinking about a lot of things for a while

521
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,738
So I thought so

522
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,074
Protect yourself here and now

523
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,743
If you think it's okay

524
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:17,548
I don't think I'll get hurt any more

525
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,054
Yeah

526
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:28,059
Dark Vader was Kuroda after all.

527
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:32,063
That guy is going to take part in the photo on the day

528
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,571
I don't have to come...

529
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:45,576
Leave it to us, we'll definitely catch Kuroda.

530
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,082
Inoo

531
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,084
yes

532
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:57,221
If it goes well, what would you like to do with Kuroda?

533
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:03,561
Our business is to inspire victims.

534
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:09,066
But we have to punish them with punishment

535
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,736
I don't think this kind of damage will go away

536
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,074
Understood

537
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,549
(Approx. Melody)

538
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:29,387
The express train to Kitajuku will soon arrive on the 1st track.

539
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,557
Please hand it down to the inside of the yellow line

540
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:37,061
Soon, we will be on the express Kitajuku...

541
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:07,558
We will stop for a little time to adjust for 2 minutes.

542
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,240
Get away from that child!

543
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,879
Huh? What is it? I haven't done anything

544
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,415
I'm telling you to leave!

545
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,555
Huh? Is it Ino?

546
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:16,060
What is it? Is it a false accusation? I'll sue you.

547
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,896
He looks disgusting and doesn't get close, so he's holding it all down in the video

548
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,565
Yes, you know what will happen

549
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,567
Hey!

550
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,570
Let go!

551
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,572
Ayane-san, what are you taking a picture of?

552
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,741
Don't move, come out, yes, you go out too

553
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,743
Collage

554
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,713
Ah, ah...

555
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,250
I'm full of anger over here

556
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,562
(Takaido) Go out Go out Go out →

557
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,564
Get out

558
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:05,076
This guy is always helping me now and now

559
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:10,715
I also wanted to be a source of help to Ayane, like Asami.

560
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,717
That's right

561
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:16,554
You did a great job, Ayane-san, you were scared

562
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,724
No, it was fine

563
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:24,562
Because Ino-sensei and his friends were there →

564
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,565
I'll definitely lose

565
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,568
So I'll give them a passing score

566
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:34,572
He tried to prevent voyeurism without touching a finger.

567
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,741
I've also got certain evidence

568
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,743
surely

569
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,879
The power of everyone

570
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,882
It's the gift of Ayane's courage

571
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,385
That's not all

572
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,057
Mari-chan's strong is what's big

573
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:58,062
Your courage saved Ayane

574
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,398
There's no doubt

575
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,237
I'm going to cry, stop

576
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,739
It was really cool

577
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,909
I was already glaring at

578
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,079
Right

579
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,083
I could say it without being afraid

580
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,552
I was able to stand up

581
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:26,390
Maybe Mari is already 17 years old

582
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,394
Really well done

583
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:37,568
Ayane-san, is there just one thing?

584
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,737
yes

585
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:46,577
We are not a lifelong wounded existence

586
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:51,582
You don't have to keep dragging something like this

587
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,085
yes

588
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,056
Let's work hard together

589
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:07,565
It is often said to sexually injure others →

590
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,067
For the perpetrator, the immediate mild behavior is →

591
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:13,070
It will be a lifelong severe wound for the victim

592
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:18,242
But I don't think so

593
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,078
It may take some time but

594
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:25,549
We can live without being caught up in the past

595
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:30,054
That's why under this law

596
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:33,724
It is clearly stated that such selfish behavior will never be allowed again

597
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:36,060
It has meaning

598
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,576
Thank you Uzaki

599
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,079
Thanks to this, I solved a lot of things

600
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,081
Yeah

601
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:02,086
No, I feel like I want to say thank you

602
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,555
What, why are you thanking me

603
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:08,559
I was fighting together and fell into a lot of trouble.

604
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,561
Hmm

605
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,564
I don't really understand, but I'll accept the thanks

606
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,400
Oh thank you Takaido too

607
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,570
No, I'm not a big deal

608
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,073
But it was good

609
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,242
Really

610
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,079
What

611
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,081
ah

612
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,083
Yeah?

613
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:37,555
No, because the usual Ino-chan is back

614
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,561
Isn't it like you're back?

615
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,064
I got over it and moved forward

616
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:51,735
Oh something good

617
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,737
It must be

618
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,073
What about Todoroki-san?

619
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,409
Come on

620
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,079
I haven't stuck my head in so much, but I wonder what he was doing

621
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,415
Yeah…

622
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,552
That's good, I won't be arrested

623
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,055
Be grateful to me

624
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,058
Whether your information is present or not

625
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,894
It's a bit dangerous to go to the scene

626
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:21,065
A truly excellent system engineer

627
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,567
Ah, you're smart after all

628
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,070
What is it? It's creepy

629
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:32,076
Helping you build a system for any app or software and then leaving.

630
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,078
But the most profitable is

631
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:37,081
After I knew it was adult content

632
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,551
Do you run a porn site in addition to your main job?

633
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,087
It's a stressful way to speak

634
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,222
What is your purpose?

635
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:50,060
Your specialty is self-driving

636
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,064
If you were in the same industry, you know? GI Technologies

637
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:57,067
Apparently he was involved in a joint project a year ago.

638
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:59,069
What is that

639
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:04,908
Five years ago there was a bus accident in Minato City.

640
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:09,880
The bus was equipped with GI Technologies' autonomous driving system.

641
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,084
If you're in the same industry, you'll have some other information, right?

642
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,722
I don't know, what happened five years ago

643
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:24,395
Don't laugh, scumbag

644
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,397
I'll give you advice

645
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:30,067
Don't try a shitty site again, I'll destroy it again if I do it

646
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:36,407
Be grateful that your life will not be overstruck and end

647
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,409
What do you want to hear?

648
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,744
Everything you know

649
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,414
There are many things that you shouldn't thrust your head...

650
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,416
Okay, say it all!

651
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:50,387
I'm tired of listening to this, so that advice

652
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:55,559
Do you think it's a medical malpractice? My uneasy feeling is always not clear

653
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,895
Toa Hospital is a hospital that is popular with politicians.

654
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,564
Why is Kiriishi here? The matter of Toa Hospital is off

655
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:03,567
You might be trying to cover up your medical malpractice.

656
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,570
Will you do something? I don't have time here anymore
