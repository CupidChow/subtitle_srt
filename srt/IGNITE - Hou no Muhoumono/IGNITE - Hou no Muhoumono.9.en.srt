00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:15,815
(Second hand sound)

2
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:24,991
(Mobile call)

3
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,161
(Kana) Father's phone

4
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:31,164
(Mobile calls keep ringing)

5
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,333
father! (Todoroki) Hmm...

6
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,669
What time is it now? 7:50

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,341
Do it!

8
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,309
Yes Todoroki

9
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,147
Yes now? Ah, what's on the way to the office?

10
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:51,818
consultation? No, I have a lot of hands right now

11
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:56,156
Ah, I understand, then yes yes yes

12
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,992
Oh, it's dangerous, it's dangerous, it's dangerous, it's thank you

13
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,494
He's a good adult, so why don't you change your shirt?

14
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,497
It's okay, there's a change to the office

15
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:08,168
Mom Why did you marry someone like that?

16
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,004
Did you say something? No, anything

17
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,007
Come on, I'm hurry, yes, yes, I'm coming

18
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,176
Ah, um... What?

19
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:20,480
Have you forgotten something? Kana - As expected of a mother's daughter

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,317
I'm glad that it didn't look like my dad haha... I'm off

21
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,319
Oh, school, have fun, yes

22
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,322
Oh, that's right, I'll do the laundry when my dad comes home

23
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,324
And...

24
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,994
I love you, creepy

25
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,664
It's creepy! Take care

26
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,334
Ah... I'm going but I won't hurt

27
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,314
Hehe...

28
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,317
(Second hand sound)

29
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,986
I'll enjoy having this

30
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:03,156
(Second hand sound)

31
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,492
(Junko) Yeah... →

32
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,660
Right

33
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,662
Yoisho (Yuo) Junko is coming

34
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,831
Ah wait a minute, lunch box, lunch box

35
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,502
Yes, thank you very much

36
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,171
Are you okay with your hips? Ahh

37
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:22,308
I would be able to make it easier if my husband earned a little more

38
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,312
Hahaha... I'm satisfied, the lunch box is the best

39
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,314
Anyway, that's all I have to do with

40
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,316
Oh, that's right, Ryo will come over here this Sunday

41
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,318
Oh, I see, I understand, yes, yes

42
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm coming, please come

43
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,163
Oh, safe

44
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,832
Good morning Good morning

45
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,668
Good morning Good morning

46
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,007
Good morning Good morning Good morning

47
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,310
Good morning Good morning

48
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,479
Okay, okay, okay...

49
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,649
(Tamura) What if we clean up the decline?

50
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,984
This is the best placement for me

51
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,487
Hmm, ah

52
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,990
About the commercial buildings under construction of Ofuna Construction →

53
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,826
Local residents have been sued for the right to sunlight

54
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,664
I said it on the phone but I have a lot of hands now

55
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,500
It's good to help weak individuals

56
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,002
Please consider the profits of the office a little.

57
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,172
Sorry, but that's the only thing I can do

58
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,476
Anyway, please think about this case

59
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,146
Yes, I'll start thinking

60
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,148
(Kiriishi) Is it another sermon?

61
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,483
New project consultation

62
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,986
How about a little better?

63
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,988
I don't want you to tell me

64
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,491
I handle big projects and have a good look at the agency.

65
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:49,329
Oh, and what are you preparing for that?

66
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,331
No problem at all

67
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,334
Okay!

68
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,503
So, a lawsuit that doesn't really benefit the agency

69
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,505
Shall we go to win?

70
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,641
(Paulownia stone) If I change that sloppy shirt

71
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,477
Yeah? ah…

72
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,313
(Paulownia stone) I'll be waiting in the lobby OK

73
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,151
So you are the homeroom teacher

74
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,989
Even though bullying was being carried out openly in the classroom.

75
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,658
Didn't you realize that?

76
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:22,829
(Nonomura) Koda-san even when I asked him about it, he said it was fun.

77
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,831
(Koda) Don't be fooled!

78
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,166
So why did Yuka try to commit suicide?

79
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,003
Do you think you'll do that just for fun?

80
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,005
Koda-san, let's calm down

81
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,007
(Koda) Sorry

82
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,644
He also says it's a fun game, so as for school,

83
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,313
The perception that there was no bullying

84
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,316
Nonomura-san is no different

85
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,319
As a teacher who takes care of the future of children

86
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,488
There's no lie in what you're saying now, right?

87
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,824
there is no

88
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,993
Understood

89
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:58,498
Presiding judge: I will submit it as I am No. 12.

90
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,668
Show the documents

91
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,505
This is claimed to have been lost by the defense.

92
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,473
It's a business journal

93
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,477
November 20th, allegedly bullied

94
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,314
Nonomura-san, you're in that day's diary

95
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,817
He clearly states that there was bullying in the classroom.

96
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,153
(Chiga) Objection! I don't know who made it

97
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,488
This document is also unknown in relation to this matter.

98
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,659
These are the documents we searched out of the school's garbage!

99
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,495
For some reason, it was even shredded due to sloppy management.

100
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,332
Rather, we discovered it, it was abandoned

101
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,001
I want you to be grateful!

102
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,504
Nonomura-san, you are in your own self-preservation

103
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,809
There was a student in agony right in front of me, but I pretended not to see him

104
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,311
The victims who were despaired over this

105
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,481
I'm still living with great trauma!

106
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,150
And the plaintiff, the parent

107
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,986
Regret from not realizing my daughter's sadness

108
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,156
Nonomura has been suffering forever

109
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,828
Who is suffering the most right now?

110
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,832
You are the only one who can save that person!

111
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,803
Once again, how I felt when I wanted to become a teacher

112
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,805
Remember it!

113
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,312
(Nonomura) Bullying is...

114
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,983
there was

115
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,489
Haa...

116
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,638
Whew

117
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,808
You might have been hated

118
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,645
I just did my job (Koda)

119
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,817
Thank you so much...

120
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,823
I'm a father, but I don't notice Yuka's pain →

121
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,825
I couldn't do anything

122
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,995
Koda-san

123
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,665
You suffered more than enough

124
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,668
From now on, that's it

125
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,337
Please make Yuka smile

126
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:22,175
Can I do it for me?

127
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,478
This is something that only you, your parents can do

128
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,982
I think so much about my daughter

129
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,319
You can do it (Koda)

130
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,321
Thank you very much

131
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,323
Sorry Koda-san

132
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,659
Let's go

133
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,638
(Asami) This time was helpful too

134
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,174
Even if I praise you, I won't get anything

135
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:58,010
As a lawyer, I praise him

136
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,813
As a father, what if he was more appropriate?

137
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,649
What's that? When I suddenly had tea the other day

138
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,818
I asked Kana about a lot →

139
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,821
You should have a little more time

140
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,657
Wow... what is that? What? Before I knew it, Kana! ?

141
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:16,162
Sometimes girls of their age can't tell their fathers

142
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,665
Asami! Wow... what is it? Ha, what you can't talk about

143
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,001
Hey, ah, wait a minute

144
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,341
(Kiriishi) I don't think I'll be back yet

145
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,309
What about you? Is it up?

146
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:34,647
I'm going to eat with my wife now, we're still as close as ever.

147
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,317
Is it roaring?

148
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,653
(Kiriishi) Kana-chan Isn't it about time for her birthday?

149
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,655
Ah, that's right

150
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,991
How about celebrating once in a while?

151
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,495
Every year, I say we're going to celebrate in a grand way.

152
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,998
But I don't need it because it's creepy

153
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:56,669
I'm still as dull as ever in adolescence except for work

154
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,006
Ah? A child who hates his father

155
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,175
Do you think you'll send something like this?

156
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,652
Kana lost her mother to illness →

157
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,821
He's only 15 years old →

158
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,991
Is it really lonely?

159
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,995
Hehe...

160
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,667
(Paulownia stone) First

161
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,002
Tired

162
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,339
I'm home…

163
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,818
(Sound)

164
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,324
Welcome home now

165
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,827
What about dinner? I ate at the office

166
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,330
Leftovers are in the fridge

167
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,832
If you want to eat, come on

168
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,008
what? No, it's nothing

169
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,979
I'm going to sleep Good night

170
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,981
good night

171
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,319
(The door closes)

172
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,828
(Cooking sound)

173
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,831
What are you doing? ? Yeah?

174
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,166
Sometimes we have breakfast together

175
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,503
Isn't it bad? Haa...

176
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,172
I'm waiting

177
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,808
We will be happy

178
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,484
Yeah

179
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,154
Kana's birthday next week, yes

180
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,658
After all, let's party at home without parent and child getting in?

181
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,827
So it's creepy that you don't need it, why? ?

182
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,498
what? It's fine to have your friends celebrate it all the time

183
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,668
Give it to your dad this year

184
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,170
I've already made a promise, but somehow

185
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,340
Let your dad celebrate your lifelong wish!

186
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,643
Hmm, please!

187
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,482
Well, I'll talk to my friends, is that true?

188
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,819
It's a promise, no... I mean, I just made a promise

189
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,322
I have to keep my promise, no promise

190
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,327
Yes, if you break your promise, you're guilty

191
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,837
(Shell)

192
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,475
Kariya-kun, can I ask a question? (Kariya) Yes

193
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,645
Birthday present for first-year high school daughter

194
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,648
What do you think I should give you? What! ?

195
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,652
No, that's why my daughter, a first-year high school student, is a 16th birthday present

196
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,654
What do you think would be happy to give?

197
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,323
Huh... (Kariya) What's wrong? Suddenly

198
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,992
I don't know what's wrong, I'm in trouble

199
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,994
What did you get when you were 16 years old and were you happy?

200
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,996
☎ (Kana) Suddenly, I'll open my birthday plan

201
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,165
☎ My friend had prepared it for me

202
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,835
That's good ☎ It's not good at all!

203
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,170
☎ Or rather, wouldn't you say it earlier?

204
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,644
Oh

205
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,489
do not have

206
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,824
There isn't

207
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:44,497
Hmm...

208
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:49,502
Oh! Ah, yes, it's good

209
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,008
(Vibrator notification)

210
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,820
Hmm

211
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,990
(Operating your smartphone)

212
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,330
Hehehe...

213
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,506
Haa...

214
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,819
(Sleeping)

215
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,651
Kana What time will you be back today?

216
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,653
Hmm, maybe about 5 o'clock

217
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,323
If I know the time to go home, contact me and my dad will be prepared too.

218
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,825
Yes, yes, I understand that's definitely

219
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,996
I'm coming, please come

220
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:30,002
(Second hand sound)

221
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,042
(Hagiwara) Is there another robbery case? There have been a lot of recent cases.

222
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,845
Today we checked and asked about the surveillance cameras around the site.

223
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,181
I'll do it thoroughly, yes, I'll try

224
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,183
We spoke to Minato City's jurisdiction.

225
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,361
Thank you for your hard work! Thank you for your hard work

226
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,863
Yuuo-san's beloved wife's lunch box every day is fine

227
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,199
(Yuo) Well, the taste is good

228
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,534
I just can't help but eat this

229
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,371
A man of a good age isn't cursing at all →

230
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,673
Hehehe...

231
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,844
Good job, thank you for your hard work

232
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,513
In the afternoon? What number? It's number 14

233
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,683
Yes thank you please

234
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:34,867
(Second hand sound)

235
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,705
Ah!

236
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,843
Todoroki: Should I make a complaint?

237
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,179
Go home quickly and celebrate properly

238
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,183
Ah... that's bad, thank you

239
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,024
Really sorry today! (Yeah) That's fine

240
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,527
But I'll definitely get it on the weekend

241
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,530
Yes I know

242
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,865
Oh, bye-bye!

243
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,202
(The door closes)

244
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,838
Ah, sorry, I'll ride it!

245
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,210
Ah, sorry thank you

246
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,179
yes

247
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,354
Please be careful as we will depart

248
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:58,517
(Second hand sound)

249
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,020
Okay

250
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:14,366

253
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:36,021
(The second hand sounds slower)

254
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,524
Wow! What is it?

255
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,196
Excuse me

256
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,865
Yeah?

257
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,867
Huh?

258
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,539
(Yuo) Everyone please hold on

259
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,041
What's wrong! ?

260
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,043
Ah!

261
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,045
Wow! What is it? ?

262
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,014
(horn)

263
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,684
Hey, what's wrong? Really smells! What is it...

264
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,686
Haa Haa Haa Haa

265
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,691
Why! ? Stop Stop!

266
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,027
stop!

267
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,199
There's no clue for now

268
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,534
Don't complain, I'll go next

269
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,371
(horn)

270
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,373
(Sudden brake)

271
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,342
What... what do you do? ? That

272
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,344
Follow me! (Hagiwara) Yes!

273
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,513

274
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,683
Ah! Ah!

275
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,352
(Yuo) Stop! Stop!

276
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,690
Ahhh!

277
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,194
Wow! Ah!

278
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,367
Wow! dangerous!

279
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,370
Ah! Haa Haa Haa...

280
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,674
Ahhh! father!

281
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,839
(Short it)

282
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,178
(siren)

283
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,856
(Explosion sound)

284
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,201
Hagiwara! Emergency and firefighting! yes! →

285
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,370
This is Hagiwara from the Metropolitan Police Department's First Investigation Division, bus explosion occurred at a construction site →

286
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,372
Please support us as soon as possible!

287
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:50,349
(siren)

288
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,360
Ah...

289
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,039
Ah...

290
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,374
Kana...

291
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,843
Kana!

292
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,346
Kana...

293
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,348
Kana!

294
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,369
Asami-san, let's go

295
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,038
We did what we could

296
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,040
Yeah

297
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,514
(Numata) Wait... wait! Hey, a bit →

298
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,850
Hey, wait! Please wait!

299
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,852
This is an order from above

300
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,188
(Numata) So you think I'll be convinced! ?

301
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:40,192
Numata Let's stop, there's nothing we can do →

302
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,361
You know that

303
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:48,533
I'm Asami from the First Investigation Division, what happened?

304
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,702
(Ishikura) It's okay Otobe-kun →

305
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,705
Yes, please

306
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,848
Otobe-kun and Minato-ichi can no longer be used

307
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,350
Please give it a reason to cut it

308
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,187
(Kitamura) I understand this message from the Deputy General of the Metropolitan Police Department.

309
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,189
"The process finished without any problems."

310
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,692
Please say thank you

311
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:18,363
For plans, please urgently suggest another location.

312
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,365
I understand

313
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,368
There's no way to stop it like a silly accident

314
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:27,205
This plan depends on the future of the country.

315
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:31,042
(sobbing)

316
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:52,364
Kirisoku I'll lend you my face after this

317
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,866
There's something I want to talk about

318
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,369
What is it? At times like this

319
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,039
Excuse me

320
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,209
I'm Uzaki's wife, bus driver →

321
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,345
My husband has been doing something really difficult this time

322
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,515
I'm really sorry →

323
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,852
I know it's rude to come here →

324
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,854
But... please go home

325
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,193
I want to apologize for a word...

326
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,528
Please

327
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,530
Please go home!

328
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,535
I'm sorry!

329
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:34,673
I'm sorry! I'm sorry

330
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:38,677
Sorry... sorry sorry

331
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,017
(Announcer) Assume he was driving a bus while taking medication with side effects

332
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:50,188
Driver Uzaki Yui is suspected of negligent driving death

333
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:53,692
It has been revealed that the suspect was referred to prosecutor's documents while still dead.

334
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,694
(Turn off the TV)

335
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,038
(chime)

336
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:12,043
Todoroki! I have a story, open it

337
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,683
Haa...

338
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,524
Please come back

339
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,027
I want to be alone now

340
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,696
There's an important story about bus accidents.

341
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,340
(Asami) I'm really tough about Kana-chan too

342
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,676
I was right in front of me, but I couldn't do anything

343
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,678
I can't help but feel frustrated

344
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:50,849
That's why I want you to know too →

345
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:55,020
That bus accident isn't just an accident

346
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,190
What does it mean?

347
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,827
The evidence gathered by the jurisdiction on the night of the accident, all →

348
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:06,498
Confiscated by a person from the Metropolitan Police Department and the next day

349
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:10,001
The evidence returned to the jurisdiction has been tampered with.

350
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,170
More photos of brake marks that shouldn't have happened →

351
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,172
Driver will be on the day of the accident →

352
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:17,175
He was taking medication with strong side effects

353
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,177
All the evidence

354
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:22,180
It was tampered with the driver's fault

355
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,520
What have you been saying since before?

356
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,691
(Kiriishi) On the day of the Minato City Mayor Otobe

357
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:36,194
I suddenly changed my plans and came back from a business trip →

358
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:40,332
It's just a civilian accident, so there's no need for the mayor to move that far.

359
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,501
So what is it?

360
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,171
There's a mastermind behind that accident

361
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,674
Someone who has enough power to even move the mayor

362
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:56,014
Wait...

363
00:26:56,014 --> 00:27:00,018
That's... That's weird

364
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,523
Kana is...

365
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:10,028
Kana is just...

366
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,831
He was a normal high school student

367
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:17,669
I haven't done anything bad

368
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,171
Why... why

369
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,173
Get caught up in such a conspiracy

370
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,176
I had to die!

371
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:29,180
Asami, you guys, the police work

372
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,516
Isn't it about protecting the citizens?

373
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,020
That police!

374
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,355
Why are you doing something to protect the perpetrator?

375
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,026
I know

376
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,029
The police's senior citizens were involved in this cover-up.

377
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,032
no doubt

378
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:51,670
I will always be able to unravel the truth behind this accident

379
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,673
(Asami) If the culprit is found →

380
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,841
As a lawyer →

381
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,178
I want him to be buried

382
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,848
Todoroki I'll help too

383
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,854
Until then am I just waiting?

384
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,661
Don't be kidding, you guys

385
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,663
(Tap the desk)

386
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:22,033
Don't be fooling, I'll gather information too

387
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,004
(Kiriishi) What are you going to do? ?

388
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:30,842
If you can, request disclosure from Minato City Hall and the police.

389
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,013
Find a clue to the person who killed Kana!

390
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,688
(mouth) Todoroki-san

391
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,524
Huh? Todoroki? Don't make a fuss

392
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:52,497
Todoroki... Did you come out?

393
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:56,835
Tamura: There's a story

394
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,003
What are you thinking as a lawyer?

395
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,507
That's the only thing I can do now from my office

396
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,343
Please request disclosure from the police and Minato City Hall!

397
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:08,179
There's no way I could allow that

398
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,516
Tamura: This is for justice!

399
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,853
As a lawyer, there is no justice here... For your justice

400
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,855
There's no way we can destroy the office!

401
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:22,193
(Tamura) Hey, we Todoroki, the lawyers work for us.

402
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:26,030
Not just for justice, for clients →

403
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,001
If you fight in court, you will receive compensation →

404
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,004
What can you do as a father and lawyer?

405
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,507
That's the limit!

406
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,845
That's right...

407
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:43,848
What can you do as a lawyer for this firm?

408
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,184
That's all

409
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,190
I'm calming down from this agency, Todoroki!

410
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,693
As an individual, it would be fine to request disclosure.

411
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,830
Hey…

412
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,835
Hey, Todoroki!

413
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,340
You stay here and I'll do it alone

414
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:20,185
No, there's no point in disclosure.

415
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,187
No, that's why!

416
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:26,691
Haa... it's fine now

417
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,362
Haa...

418
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,331
(Tongue tapping)

419
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,008
(Tongue tapping)

420
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,513
Haa... damn it

421
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,018
Haa...

422
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,016
(Sigh)

423
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,018
(Sound)

424
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,011
Haa...

425
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,659
that…

426
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:14,666
Todoroki-san! I'm really sorry! →

427
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,168
What my husband did is not allowed!

428
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,338
I'm really sorry!

429
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,677
Please raise your face

430
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,988
What happened to this?

431
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,824
Ah... Something my address is

432
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,493
Looks like it's been posted online →

433
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,330
My son is also an idiot, so find someone who writes about it →

434
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,332
I've hit you

435
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,834
And now I'm at the police station

436
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:56,674
My husband took the lives of many people →

437
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,678
It's only natural that we take responsibility for that.

438
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,182
But... →

439
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,485
My husband was so serious

440
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:12,824
I think I shouldn't take such a drug.

441
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,826
sorry!

442
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,995
I should never say this to Todoroki-san →

443
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,997
I'm really sorry!

444
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,834
The police have nothing to do with graffiti?

445
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:28,506
Assault and graffiti are different things

446
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:33,511
And we can't talk about that

447
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:04,175
That accident and slander are different

448
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:08,179
If this spray can was used for doodles

449
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,349
You may have fingerprints left, so save them

450
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:14,018
What... talk to a lawyer

451
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:17,155
To the person who is suing your son for assault

452
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:20,491
Tell us about the fingerprints of this spray can

453
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,828
My son tries to stop doodles

454
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:27,331
If it's done, the story should change a lot.

455
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:31,669
But... put a surveillance camera somewhere

456
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:35,339
It's proof of emergency

457
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,508
For those who posted this address online

458
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:41,179
You can respond by requesting a caller information disclosure

459
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,648
Uzaki-san

460
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,653
I'm sorry

461
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:55,993
I hated you guys

462
00:34:55,993 --> 00:35:00,665
But you guys that were wrong

463
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:05,169
I'm a person who lives according to the law.

464
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,339
When those people are in trouble

465
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,676
My saving is through law...

466
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,811
It's a lawyer's job

467
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:20,651
So Uzaki Junko

468
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:27,825
If you get it done, try to fight back!

469
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,830
but…

470
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,334
Is it okay for us to do that?

471
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,171
Of course

472
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,007
Please

473
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,009
Please live

474
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,348
thank you!

475
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,817
sorry!

476
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,486
You said that

477
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,990
Thank you so much!

478
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,325
thank you! →

479
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,829
thank you

480
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,165
Tick!

481
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,834
(Junko) Sorry...

482
00:36:55,813 --> 00:37:00,017
Welcome home (Uzaki)

483
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:02,153
sorry

484
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,158
You're a chore no matter how old you are

485
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,493
sorry

486
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,997
I'll keep an eye on you from now on (Junko)

487
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,334
The lawyer came and taught me how to fight.

488
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,170
lawyer? (Junko) Ryo is not arrested

489
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,340
I was able to leave thanks to the lawyers

490
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,817
(Kiriishi) What is "Peace" an ironic name

491
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,486
Isn't that a good name?

492
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,823
Peace is something to be ripped off

493
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,160
Asami, we're alone

494
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,330
I can't find the truth behind that accident

495
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,167
Continue to gather information inside you know

496
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:56,007
Don't go bankrupt before you get there

497
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,678
It's okay, there's a strategy

498
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:05,483
It's a dangerous strategy for a lawyer

499
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:09,820
I want to sue you, but I can't sue

500
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,325
It seems he won't be dealt with in criminal cases either

501
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:18,829
There are many people who are scared behind the villains

502
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,165
What are you planning to do?

503
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:28,005
You should start a conflict

504
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,176
(Inoo) I want to save my trusted client

505
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,178
Even if you burn it

506
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:40,484
It's okay, it's true that it's abilities are guaranteed

507
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,321
Please

508
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,493
(Takaido) I've received a lot of invitations...

509
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,497
Why is this place, what am I?

510
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,668
No, you're the type who gets bored if you're just normal, right?

511
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:02,173
In addition, he is also the type who carries a lot of things.

512
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,510
We have a very special way

513
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm plucking money from the villains

514
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,817
Huh... aren't you interested in that kind of thing?

515
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:16,654
Well, I'll hear about it

516
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,491
Look this is the official character of Peace Peace

517
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,494
I made it - isn't it big?

518
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:27,164
Two information from Asami is separate from that

519
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,167
Five cases that could be spurred →

520
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,670
Of course there's a shortage of staff

521
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,506
However, we are so easy

522
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:38,008
Can anyone please...

523
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,345
what up?

524
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,991
(Junko) Maido!

525
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,496
I'm going to work part-time (Junko) Ah, romance

526
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,498
If this continues, I'll be ruined by debt

527
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,000
You quickly decide where to find a job, you know

528
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,002
(Junko) Come on! Yes

529
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,481
Ah, Todoroki-san!

530
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,817
Thank you for your help in that section

531
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,819
Are you your current son?

532
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,989
Oh, son, what about work?

533
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,324
Even so, I'm a lawyer

534
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,326
ah…

535
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,329
It seems I realized it thanks to Todoroki-san →

536
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,332
Power can't protect anyone →

537
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:38,836
That's why I'm going to become a lawyer and protect the weak.

538
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,674
Leave work and come back to my parents' house

539
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,844
I somehow managed to pass the bar exam

540
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,181
I can't find a job

541
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:54,318
That girl is straightforward and stupid

542
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,988
That's why it seems like it's not good for the great lawyer's office.

543
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:03,994
I think there are some agencies that are looking for such people.

544
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:10,334
After that, I became independent and started my own office.

545
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,337
If you like, please give this to your son

546
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:17,341
No, that's it! It's hard to come if you know the situation

547
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,677
That I am involved in that accident

548
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,812
Please keep it a secret, but...

549
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,349
If you think it's a bad guy, I'll reject it

550
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,822
thank you

551
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,495
Oh, they all look tasty

552
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:43,167
(Humming from "Do Re-Mi's Song")

553
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,004
Huh? There's one

554
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,511
Is it here...

555
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,183
I don't have one of my donuts

556
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,152
Come on

557
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,999
Maybe you guys ate it! ?

558
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,001
What... Ah!

559
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,003
You ate my donuts! ?

560
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,506
Hehe...

561
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:31,015
(Second hand sound)

562
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,018
Ah... okay

563
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,988
Sorry, I'm late!

564
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:41,825
Uzaki: Late Senpai, the punishment, clean the toilet.

565
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,827
Huh? It's still just a minute ago

566
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:46,830
You guys don't get into trouble over silly things

567
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,501
Let's start the meeting

568
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,337
(Uzaki and Ino) says

569
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,508
(knock)

570
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,177
Please excuse me

571
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,482
Teacher: One point

572
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,988
(Kitamura) Apparently there is a law firm that sniffs the bus accident.

573
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,492
(Kitamura) Representative: Todoroki →

574
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:18,495
He was the plaintiff's agent in the trial of Mayor Otobe →

575
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:23,167
In addition, he is the father of the victim of the bus accident.

576
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,004
Let it do as you please

577
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,673
No reason to do anything with a simple lawyer

578
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,842
yes

579
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,481
(Kitamura) Excuse me

580
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,483
(The door closes)

581
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,155
Hmm

582
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:48,826
All connections The situation is as shown here

583
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,662
Everyone has their heads right?

584
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:55,666
Of course, everything is here

585
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,836
I have been causing numerous conflicts up until now

586
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,839
It's all for this fight

587
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,009
The risks are huge, but are you prepared?

588
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,512
It's persistent, you've checked it a number of times already

589
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,348
It means everyone is prepared

590
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,817
Don't worry, from before you

591
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,986
Things that are important won't go away

592
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,657
I know

593
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,659
Okay, I'll crush them

594
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,827
Let's think of a specific method!

595
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,830
That's good, let's do it! Okay!

596
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,338
This is the real battle!

597
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,509
My husband has been sincerely working at work

598
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,011
There's no way I'd take that kind of medicine!

599
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,514
There is no possibility of poor maintenance!

600
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,816
Let's admit that it's not just a rat.

601
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,318
I've got enough cards to fight

602
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,988
No matter what you use, you can defeat Ishikura
