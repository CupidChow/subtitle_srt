1
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:35,001
{(Todoroki) You're already in my palm}

2
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:44,310
"You've got 5 million yen in debt, your family's lunch shop"

3
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,647
{(Uzaki) Why do you know that?

4
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,650
{Because I returned all of that}

5
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,653
{Did you return it? 》

6
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,324
"I made it out at my office"

7
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,326
《What do you mean?》

8
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:04,330
{So until I work 5 million yen.}

9
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,333
"It's a pain if you quit."

10
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,304
{Ah! ?》

11
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:19,312
(Inoo) It looks like Uzaki collar was attached~ Wan

12
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,982
(Takaido) Please work for the amount of debt

13
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:26,319
No, I haven't admitted it yet

14
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,823
Todoroki-san, I really can't accept the matter from yesterday.

15
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,492
Uzaki I'm very busy today

16
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,494
If I bring the materials, I'll go (Inoo/Takaido) is...

17
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,496
I haven't finished talking yet, but where are you going?

18
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:40,467
Tokyo District Judgment: Class action lawsuit against food poisoning incident that occurred at a festival last year

19
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,802
Are you staying home today, your work?

20
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,804
This is a case that is progressing smoothly now.

21
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,974
That I don't want to be bothered by the ignition guy

22
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,810
What is that? Ah, I'll buy you a souvenir

23
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,813
Ah, I'll receive your package and pick it up, please

24
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,815
Make it a good girl

25
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,817
a little bit!

26
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:02,322
If anything happens, respond

27
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,327
(The door closes)

28
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,329
What's that

29
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,332
(Uzaki's sigh)

30
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,301
I'm not good at being away from home

31
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,972
(Door opens)

32
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,974
(Kyoko) Sorry

33
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,979
(Kyoko) Ah...

34
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,981
Yeah?

35
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,650
Todoroki's office

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,486
Is it right here?

37
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,659
Thank you very much

38
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,661
home

39
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,330
That's Takayama Kyoko

40
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,468
This is Uzaki. Uh, do you have any advice from Todoroki?

41
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:53,473
Ah, yes, a friend of mine helped Todoroki-san.

42
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:57,477
I heard that he was very kind to me at the time.

43
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,979
Is Todoroki?

44
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:04,317
Actually, there's something I want to talk to Todoroki.

45
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:08,821
Ah, sorry, unfortunately, Todoroki is out now

46
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,991
Is that so? yes

47
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,327
Ah, what should I do →

48
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,798
I don't know any other lawyers.

49
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,801
{If anything happens, take action}

50
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,973
Um, by the way

51
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:31,477
If you're okay with me, can you talk to me?

52
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,479
What? Is it okay?

53
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,481
Of course

54
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,984
Ah... thank you

55
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:42,989
No, I'm Uzaki, a lawyer

56
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,992
Thank you very much

57
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,306
Is it really okay?

58
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,309
Please, our stew is excellent

59
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,645
Please enjoy

60
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,647
Looks tasty

61
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,819
Ah, it's so tasty

62
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,323
It's probably a small store, but it's been running in the local area for a long time.

63
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,325
Hmm, is Kyoko the shop?

64
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,328
I took over from my father and I'm the second generation

65
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,797
Wow, that's a good shop

66
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,799
thank you

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,970
So who is a client?

68
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,976
Hello~ Hello

69
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,989
He is Quon

70
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:54,327
Foreign technical interns working at Hokari

71
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,329
Technical trainee?

72
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,303
(Kyoko) He comes from Vietnam and works at a fishery processing factory in town.

73
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:08,308
Falling from a tetrapod along the coast a month ago →

74
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:13,313
Maybe there may be some aftereffects left

75
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,983
(Kyoko) His family →

76
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,320
Working from morning to night →

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,991
I send most of my salary to my family far away.

78
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,632
He says he accidentally lost his alcohol.

79
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,002
I don't think he's that kind of child

80
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:40,306
Kuon I don't know if I'll be able to work again with that kind of body

81
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:45,978
Hey, can't you get compensation or anything like this from the company or the government?

82
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,980
Hmm

83
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,652
If you get injured while working or commuting, you can apply for a worker's accident.

84
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,654
(Sigh)

85
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,657
(Sigh)

86
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:04,330
Is Kuon a customer at the cafeteria?

87
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,301
Customers

88
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,138
...But it's not there though

89
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,140
{Yes, yes}

90
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,649
{Huh, a moment...}

91
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,651
《(Quon) carry》

92
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,325
{Ah... thank you}

93
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,997
{Huh, hey you! 》

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,002
《Eat (Kyoko)》

95
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:47,640
"Is it really okay? 》 《Because it's just too good》

96
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,977
"but…"

97
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,980
{What are you shy about, eat it}

98
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,653
{Itadakimasu} {Yes}

99
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,326
"delicious! 》

100
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:10,329
"I've never eaten it even though I watched it every day."

101
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,633
{(Kyoko) That's good}

102
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,303
Are you working at the port? 》

103
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,640
{Yes, I work in Futami Fisheries Processing}

104
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,642
"yes"

105
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,316
And sometimes

106
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,985
Give me the rest of the shop

107
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:37,323
I'll help out at the store instead.

108
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,992
Is that the relationship?

109
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,996
(Large noise)

110
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,634
(Kyoko) Kuon! Ah already

111
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,003
Don't overdo it

112
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,307
Kyoko-san, yes, are you okay?

113
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,644
(Kyoko) Oh, here's Uzaki, a lawyer

114
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,646
It's Uzaki

115
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,648
Kyoko asked me to

116
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,651
I wonder if I can help Kuon-san.

117
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,321
Will it be useful? yes

118
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:13,326
If you'd like, could you please tell me more about the accident?

119
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,632
This is just me being clumsy

120
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,635
Why at a tetrapod at night?

121
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,305
I wanted to see the sea, so I like the sea at Hokari

122
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,307
Then it fell

123
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:32,645
I asked the doctor and he said he had a lot of injuries on his legs.

124
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,315
If you have an accident while working, you can get money.

125
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,985
So I'm in the wrong

126
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,988
Kuon...

127
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,991
It's okay I can work again

128
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,662
(Kyoko) Don't push yourself too hard anymore

129
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:53,332
It's no good, why not do it!

130
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,302
He went out of his way to rely on Todoroki-san.

131
00:08:56,302 --> 00:09:00,306
The old stories have nothing to do with it, so what are the newcomers asking for?

132
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,475
You said you should deal with something if something happened

133
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,644
There's probably a range of support!

134
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,812
There's something Kuon hasn't said yet.

135
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,315
What should foreign trainees do to fire up?

136
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,651
What should I do... I guess I can't make a lot of money

137
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,987
It's not cheap or expensive, right? It's cheap or expensive!

138
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,989
He said he was kind

139
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,991
I'm so passionate, where did I do it? With kindness...

140
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,630
♫~Let's eat crab

141
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,633
♫~ Let's go shy

142
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,137
♫~ It looks like it's too picturesque

143
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,974
♫~A charming long happy beach is so insane

144
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,311
♫~Let's go to the beach, why did you follow me?

145
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,314
No, Uzaki definitely thought I'd do it on my own

146
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,649
I don't trust it quite a lot

147
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,985
What? Did you think it was reversed?

148
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,322
What about jumping on the car? Are you rampaging at the club?

149
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,992
Yes Yes Yes

150
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,995
♫~Let's eat crab

151
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,998
Not crab, it's a golden tree.

152
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,000
♫~ Eat the golden monkey...

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,303
Oh, it's the sea

154
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,976
Um?

155
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:13,145
Ino-chan is convinced by the way our agency does it?

156
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,315
Ah, plaintiff, you mean it's a stolen thing?

157
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,484
Well, to put it simply

158
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:22,488
Hmm, it's not about us

159
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,992
It's fine as long as the client is satisfied

160
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:31,497
Because the lawyers are the ones who speak for someone else's voice

161
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,308
Ah, the sea is quiet

162
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,311
(Kota) It's scary, the sea of ​​the holly

163
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,813
(Uzaki/Ino) What? (Kota) There's a ghost

164
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,983
What? Is it a ghost? At the sea?

165
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,654
Yes, bad kids will be taken away

166
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,656
Oh... Kota

167
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,492
Sorry, believe me strange rumours

168
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,663
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, that kind of local superstition

169
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,632
ghost…

170
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,476
(Chiga) It's been a while, Todoroki-san

171
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,645
This is Chiga-san

172
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:23,149
The Toshu University trial was done in a flashy way.

173
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:28,988
Oh, I'm glad it reached a major office.

174
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,657
How did you get the evidence of drugs?

175
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,659
it is

176
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,996
It's a trade secret, ha ha ha

177
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,333
You should be careful in various ways

178
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,004
Thank you for your advice

179
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,976
Takaido-kun

180
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,981
You're a talented person who passed the bar exam in your teens.

181
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,984
You have to cherish your career more

182
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,000
(Futami) Sorry for keeping you waiting

183
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,002
This is Futami, the CEO

184
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,004
Please, please

185
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,640
I'm Inoo from Peace Law Office, which we'll be accepting orders.

186
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,642
Ah, hello, it's Uzaki too

187
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,644
Ah, hello

188
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,980
From Tokyo, all you need?

189
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,982
It's nothing

190
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,984
Sorry all of a sudden

191
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,320
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

192
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,322
Could you please tell me?

193
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,326
The accident was tough

194
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,330
Please take a look at anything yes

195
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,332
It's over there (the two of them) Thank you very much

196
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,634
Yes, huh

197
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,304
It's here, please

198
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,307
Please take a good rest

199
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,310
Please come here

200
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,648
Eh, we're processing seafood that was harvested with sails here.

201
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,650
Wow, amazing

202
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,652
Did you eat something with the sailfish?

203
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,654
Ah, what would be better now?

204
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,323
Right now, it's a golden one after all

205
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,325
Wow, the raw sardines are also delicious

206
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,494
Ah, that's nice, it looks delicious

207
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,496
yes

208
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,633
Ah, those people?

209
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,303
Oh, all the trainees who have come here at the same time

210
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,973
Everyone is hardworking and really helping

211
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,976
Good luck to everyone

212
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,648
(Futami) Yes, I'll show you next time

213
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,326
I'm worried about Kuon's injuries too.

214
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,328
He's very caring

215
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,332
He was like a big brother to the trainees.

216
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,636
I'd be happy if he recovered and came back

217
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,638
Because it's outside of work

218
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:03,809
As a company, we cannot do anything.

219
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,980
Sorry I couldn't help this time

220
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,983
No, thank you very much

221
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,985
thank you

222
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,988
(Sekiguchi) Futami-san, Sekiguchi-san!

223
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,991
Ahhh hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey it was just good

224
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:23,662
Here is Sekiguchi, who is the representative of the supervising organization for the trainees.

225
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,999
My name is Sekiguchi from Hokari General Development.

226
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:31,303
(Futami) They regularly come to see the trainees because they care about their children.

227
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,973
Thank you so much for the distance today

228
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,975
No, it's ridiculous, if there's anything

229
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,310
Thank you for telling me anything whenever you want

230
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,313
Well, Sekiguchi-san, head deeper

231
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,316
So, sorry

232
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:14,480
Hmm! A delicious

233
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,482
Huh? What is that a joke?

234
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,652
You really eat it deliciously

235
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,488
No, this is already a victory, it's so tasty

236
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,657
Thank you for the happy meal

237
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,493
Thank you very much

238
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,333
So you found out something at work?

239
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,303
Oh no, the president was still a good person.

240
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,307
But why did you think of him so much?

241
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,643
See, um... Kyoko also pays hospital fees.

242
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,645
ah…

243
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:53,986
(Kyoko) If her son were alive, it would be about the same as Kuon.

244
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,656
When I was 6 years old, I drowned in the sea

245
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,994
My husband who went to help me also

246
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,332
That's right...

247
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:12,304
Also, come to an unknown country and do your best for your far-off family →

248
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:16,642
I wonder if watching that kind of thing makes me want to support you

249
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,313
So maybe it's an unnecessary help from my aunt

250
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,984
I want Kuon to have a smile

251
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:33,492
Yes, is it okay to serve salted grilled?

252
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,995
Thank you so much, I'm so happy

253
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,163
Stop that, seriously I'll do this

254
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,633
Yes, I understand, yes, I'm sorry

255
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,305
I've also reported it to the boss.

256
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,474
Yeah

257
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,977
There are over 400,000 technical trainees.

258
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:57,649
Even though trainees are often treated as labor force,

259
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,651
That's right

260
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:03,322
The current system has many problems.

261
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:08,327
Unpaid salary violating the duty to be taken into consideration; Excess working hours

262
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,829
This is the three major problems in trainee cases

263
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,665
Ino-chan is a collection of walking case laws or something?

264
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,635
My strange nickname is harassment

265
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,305
Knowing the law is

266
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,809
Because it means you can make a sound

267
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,647
"This is weird"

268
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,650
"That's mine"

269
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,987
That you can make that kind of voice

270
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,990
But you don't know the law

271
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,993
Just like you can't speak anything

272
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,001
what? no

273
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:55,641
I think it's a little similar to the reason I wanted to become a lawyer.

274
00:17:55,641 --> 00:18:00,312
No, before I studied law

275
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,982
Something I misunderstood was to help someone...

276
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,485
Uzaki: Will that story be long? Huh?

277
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,654
Let's stake out quickly

278
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,656
excuse me!

279
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,658
It's okay to have such good stories from Uzaki.

280
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,494
It's not like I'm trying to talk about it well, so it's a waste of time

281
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,634
Those two are still going to fire

282
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,636
Apparently

283
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,973
Is it okay? Let me do that

284
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,975
Even if I say that, I won't listen to him

285
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,977
I want to use a car over here

286
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,979
Well, don't say that

287
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,981
More than that

288
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,651
I came up with one good thing

289
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,322
What shall we do?

290
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,269
It's here

291
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,939
Sorry

292
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,276
(Chan) You guys...

293
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,612
You saw us in the factory

294
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,614
Something you want to talk about?

295
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,285
Wow... there's nothing

296
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,955
Is it bad to be with us?

297
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,435
Is it okay not here?

298
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:43,282
Was Chan on good terms with Kuon?

299
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,284
yes

300
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:50,289
Kuon was a Japanese guy →

301
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,625
Come to Japan to make money →

302
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,961
I don't know anything →

303
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,964
He always helped me

304
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:04,269
Will he be able to work again?

305
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,607
That's... I don't know

306
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:12,611
But I'm trying to find the truth for that reason

307
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,615
I said earlier that I hadn't seen him since the accident

308
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,619
Maybe you're not allowed to go visit me

309
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,623
Chan, please let me know if there's anything you're hiding.

310
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,966
Kuon is...

311
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,971
I'm protecting us

312
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,942
If you fight against the company

313
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,946
I'll cause trouble for us too

314
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,948
Is it annoying?

315
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:56,288
He and us may not be able to stay in Japan

316
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:01,293
So, after all, Kuon got injured while working.

317
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,966
But then you should consult with the supervisory organization...

318
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,968
I can't do that

319
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,272
Technical trainees are in a weak position in the system

320
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,276
If you have a problem with your training location, you may be forced to return to the country.

321
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:22,281
(Mobile call)

322
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,283
Sorry

323
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:34,626
(Vietnamese)

324
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,600
Sorry I have to go again

325
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,276
Um... what I said

326
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,946
President, please don't say it

327
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,288
Okay

328
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:07,959
All that's left is to file a lawsuit if Kuon tells the truth.

329
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,961
Let's go to the hospital

330
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,299
Ino-chan!

331
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,301
Yeah…

332
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,943
Huen

333
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,946
Heen

334
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,949
Huh?

335
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,619
Hen? Hen

336
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,621
What are you doing?

337
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,293
Huen Zuen

338
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,628
So what are you doing? Ah, the boat is this!

339
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,630
Ah? That's it

340
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,767
Does Uzaki believe in ghosts? What are you saying all of a sudden?

341
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,270
You said that the child I met at the port says that there are ghosts in the sea of ​​Hokari.

342
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,606
Ahhh, no, do you believe that?

343
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,609
I don't want to believe it

344
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,948
Hey, will you head to Hokari Port now?

345
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,950
Hokari Port? Why? It's fine, head towards me

346
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,952
So why? It's fine, head over!

347
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,954
I understand!

348
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,624
(Paulownia stone) Why me?

349
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,293
Please, paulownia stone

350
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,963
That's a case he's doing on his own

351
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,632
If it goes well, it's quite profitable, right

352
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,601
There are a lot of overlap now

353
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,270
I'll prepare the list here

354
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,273
(Sigh)

355
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,276
It can't be helped, as expected from the same

356
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,945
I love it already! Stop it

357
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,449
Friendship has turned into love, stop now

358
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,619
(The door opens) (Asami) The man is really close

359
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:45,290
Oh, is it okay for Detective Asami to hang out with the law firm?

360
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,960
But it's rare for you to gather together

361
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,963
This is special today

362
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:57,602
(Asami) Last week, there was a suicide incident involving a Minato city hall employee.

363
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,939
Minato City? Yes, that Minato City

364
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,276
The police haven't done any further investigations though

365
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,280
Rumors say it's power harassment within the government office

366
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,285
Perhaps the mayor's music club is involved too.

367
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,125
{(Sound Club) For those who have been victims...→}

368
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,127
"We have condolences due to the out-of-control bus."

369
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:26,131
"It is extremely regrettable that a disaster occurred."

370
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,604
This might be the spark

371
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,610
Can you look into this in more detail?

372
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,612
Even if you don't say

373
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,949
(Asami) Are you going now?

374
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,951
I have work

375
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,955
It's been a while since we met the three of us, so are you going out drinking?

376
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:57,963
(Door opening and closing sound)

377
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,967
So, two people will go together or not

378
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,969
I'll pretend to be worried

379
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,972
How long will that be shut up with Uzaki-kun?

380
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,941
Don't tell me anything, my terrible boss

381
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,944
That's right

382
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,447
Maybe it's about time

383
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:24,289
(Door opening and closing sound)

384
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,292
29 28

385
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,294
So... so what's that?

386
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,296
Hey, explain it

387
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,965
Ah 27 There it is!

388
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,967
What is that ship?

389
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,969
(Truck driving sound)

390
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,971
Will someone come?

391
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,942
Uzaki: Let's go?

392
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,944
Oh tchi ​​oh

393
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,284
Get off narrow →

394
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,286
Get quick!

395
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:58,623
I'm just asking, but we're lawyers

396
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,626
Ah... Since Uzaki came, all the crazy things have been said.

397
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,628
No, it's my fault?

398
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,631
The worst thing is not aware

399
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,435
Hey I've got on

400
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,274
(Start the ship's engine)

401
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,276
Uzaki I'm going

402
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,278
What does that mean?

403
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,223
(Turn off the ship's engine)

404
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,192
Let's go

405
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,866
Do it soon

406
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,887
Walk quickly!

407
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,864
What is it here

408
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:17,202
I don't know, but it definitely isn't normal

409
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,205
Yes Yes Thank you for your hard work

410
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,877
Yes, thank you for your hard work, take care

411
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,879
Yes, thank you for your hard work Yes

412
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,885
Why did you know about the ship?

413
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:38,890
(Vietnamese)

414
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,526
What are you talking about? I'm Inoo Mari

415
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,529
He said he was a 27-year-old lawyer.

416
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,531
This case has to be done

417
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,200
I just learned the self-introduction in Vietnamese

418
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,202
Wow, that's great

419
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:55,874
Then, just now, Chan called, "27 Ships."

420
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,877
You're amazing plagiarism

421
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,882
Yes, don't get hurt and do your best →

422
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,885
I wish you the best

423
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,861
Okay, I'll go yeah

424
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,548
Okay

425
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:54,866
That's probably something bad

426
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,868
You're doing it

427
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,205
(Sudden brake)

428
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,207
What are you guys doing?

429
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,209
Ah, yeah

430
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,544
Hey, Ino-chan!

431
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,882
Ah, no no no no

432
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,219
I happened to be on a different date and got lost

433
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,221
Who is this?

434
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:19,224
Hey, don't run away, hey, catch me!

435
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,529
You

436
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,534
Wait

437
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,882
Oh

438
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,219
Haa Haa

439
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,222
Hey!

440
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,191
Calm down

441
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,694
Uzaki ride!

442
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,865
Yes! I'm jealous!

443
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,869
OK！

444
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:07,539
Ah hey!

445
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:10,542
I'm riding on a stolen bike

446
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,189
Kuon-san

447
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,192
How's your body?

448
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,195
I just can't walk

449
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,871
on second thoughts

450
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,874
You were lying

451
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:46,878
Huh? I heard it from Chan

452
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:51,182
Kuon thinks about the people around him.

453
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,185
You're not saying anything

454
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,856
You are processing Futami Fisheries

455
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,192
Are you being forced to do illegal work?

456
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,530
Kuon What does that mean?

457
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:11,536
That company has a hidden face

458
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,877
Why are you silent?

459
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,180
Is it okay to stay like this?

460
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,184
So what should we do?

461
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,187
This is not my country

462
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,857
Here

463
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,528
No one will protect you →

464
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,530
That's why

465
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,533
Don't say that!

466
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:46,871
I think of Kuon as the sailor.

467
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:50,875
I want you to rely on me whenever there is something

468
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:54,345
So don't say that

469
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,850
Kuon-san

470
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:04,188
We will be your voice

471
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,193
The pain and pain you all suffered

472
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,195
I'll make a loud voice

473
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:14,532
This trial is not just for Kuon

474
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,869
It's also for Chan and others.

475
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,204
So please

476
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,207
Make everyone's thoughts to us

477
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:26,177
Can you leave it to me?

478
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,851
Kuon

479
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,195
Uzaki-san

480
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,865
Me

481
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,204
We

482
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,342
Please help me

483
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,185
It's decided

484
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:11,182
Mr. Kuong You came from Vietnam as a technical trainee.

485
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,851
The past two years in Hokari Town

486
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:17,522
Yes, you work in Futami Fisheries Processing

487
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,690
You are the company's current time

488
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,861
He filed a lawsuit on the grounds of breach of duty to take safety into consideration.

489
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:30,535
Could you tell me about the situation of the injury that occurred in the accident that occurred on January 24th?

490
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,537
From the doctor

491
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:37,875
He was told it was a serious injury that could leave behind aftereffects.

492
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,512
You drink alcohol along the coast at the time of the accident.

493
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,183
He said it accidentally fell off the tetrapod

494
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:49,854
What was the actual injury you were doing?

495
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:01,532
It's when I'm at work

496
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,534
What is work?

497
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,870
Do you work in a factory?

498
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,872
No, it's not

499
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,508
So where did you suffer the injury?

500
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,510
I don't know, I don't know

501
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,512
What does it mean?

502
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:21,185
I was always blindfolded and taken by boat

503
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:25,523
Who was taken to?

504
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:36,200
To Futami-san →

505
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,204
After work, I'll go from the port

506
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,876
That's all

507
00:35:56,854 --> 00:36:00,691
Just now, Kuon was taken by boat.

508
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:04,028
I testified that he was injured, but is that true?

509
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:09,867
No, I'm not sure what Kuon is talking about.

510
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:15,206
I'm shocked to be done to sinfully dismissive

511
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:20,511
I see, the judge, I will show you the Exhibit 6.

512
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,849
This is a map that shows the geography of Hokari Town.

513
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,186
Futami-san Do you know about this peninsula area?

514
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,856
Yes I know there is, but that's...

515
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,860
It is said that it will come out to the sea near this sailing

516
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,862
Do you know about ghost rumors?

517
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,532
What are you talking about? I saw it the other day.

518
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,870
From Hokari Port, the lights and the others head towards this peninsula where no one is expected to exist.

519
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,874
(Defendant Agent) Objection! The judge's agent asks questions that have nothing to do with the matter.

520
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,878
Presiding judge to judge the credibility of the statement

521
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,848
I will play the video of the A.14 I am planning to submit now.

522
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,852
That's probably something bad

523
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,522
You guys, what are you doing?

524
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,525
Hey, Ino-chan!

525
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:12,196
Futami-san's midnight chase was fun

526
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,869
Ah, hey!

527
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,539
What are you doing?

528
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,507
Hello

529
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,509
Ah...

530
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:29,513
This video was filmed in the peninsula area shown earlier.

531
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,516
The ones shown here are the trainees.

532
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:36,187
The place where technical interns are conducted is determined

533
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,857
But why is it not Futami Fisheries processed?

534
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:46,197
Are they working on industrial waste disposal work outside the designated time?

535
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:57,875
But this video isn't from the time of an accident.

536
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:01,178
It's not proof that this guy was injured

537
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:04,849
(Defendant Agent) Objection! As shown on the roles for Judge Ex. 7 →

538
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,852
Kuon finished work at 5pm on the day of the accident.

539
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:11,188
The judge to judge the credibility of the evidence

540
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:15,526
I will play the video of the 15th I am planning to submit.

541
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:20,197
This is the car that was parked in the location earlier on the day of Kuon's accident.

542
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,034
This is the video recorded on a drive recorder.

543
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,536
On the day of the accident, 10:40pm

544
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:30,207
Here we can see the injured Kuon-san clearly.

545
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:34,178
(Futami) So I told you to be careful

546
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,180
(Sekiguchi) This has reduced one person

547
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,182
(Futami) Yabbee

548
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:43,187
Who is it, who is it

549
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,189
(Door opens)

550
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,201
Kuon-san

551
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,206
All of my friends also fought

552
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:06,177
{I took it from the car}

553
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,180
Can Quon win? 》

554
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,184
《It's okay, trust us》

555
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,524
Damn it...

556
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,526
Who is it?

557
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,197
Who is hey Futami, please calm down

558
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,199
Hey hey! Futami-san Futami-san!

559
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,202
(Presential Judge) The defendant! Quietly

560
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,873
The logo shown in this video is

561
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,876
It is developed by Hokari General Development.

562
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:43,848
The president, Sekiguchi, also serves as the representative of the trainee supervising organization.

563
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:47,184
Check whether the training is properly conducted.

564
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,187
I'm in a position to teach

565
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,189
Those two become guilty

566
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,860
We have been undertaking the handling of industrial waste for several years now.

567
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,530
They repeatedly dumped illegally in this Hokari Peninsula area.

568
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,532
Ah, go home

569
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,868
That doesn't leak to the surroundings

570
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,871
Trainees who are not afraid to indict

571
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,673
He drove to reclaim every night

572
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,877
Objection! It is an attempt to dress up a wet genus that is illegally dumped.

573
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:16,847
It's a remarkable insult! Which one has been dragged into crime?

574
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:20,851
Kuon kept quiet about this truth

575
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,855
This is because he feared being fired from his employer Futami Fisheries Processing.

576
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:29,860
Consider not only yourself but also the positions of the trainees around you.

577
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,864
I was seriously injured, but I kept quiet about it all the time.

578
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,867
This is the truth

579
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:41,539
Kuon was forced to bring in at the landfill site.

580
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,509
It became a laying down of industrial waste that had collapsed.

581
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,511
It's just

582
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,514
About an injury

583
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,517
Let's make a fuss

584
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,853
Hey!

585
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,855
Haa

586
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,197
It's over It's over

587
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,534
The future technical training system

588
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:14,538
We will replace the new developmental work system

589
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,208
Under the new system

590
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:21,879
I hope that no one will ever have the same feelings as Kuon.

591
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,854
That's all from the plaintiff

592
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:43,200
Yes, sorry to keep you waiting~ Yes →

593
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,202
It's excellent

594
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,180
Come

595
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,190
Congratulations on winning

596
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,194
Since when did you start moving?

597
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,197
Class action lawsuit filed later

598
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,535
{I came up with one good thing}

599
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,537
Why am I?

600
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,506
"If it goes well, it's quite profitable."

601
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:26,510
{What do you think about the illegal work that you have been experiencing in the past}

602
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,512
"Would you like to charge the company? 》

603
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:31,181
Can you do that now? 》

604
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,183
"it's okay"

605
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:37,187
It was a source of past trainees who were working in Futami Fisheries Processing.

606
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,190
Is it because it makes more profit than compensation from individuals?

607
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,192
People are not listening

608
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:45,195
It expanded the possibilities

609
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,869
The possibility

610
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,205
It's money

611
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,856
Where trainees transfer to

612
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,859
thank you

613
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,197
If you want to sue your employer

614
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:23,701
Think about the workers' future plans too.

615
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,207
Well, even in the case of Futami and the others' illegal dumping.

616
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,876
I'll praise you for reaching it

617
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:36,513
Criminal charges will also be filed for violation of the Waste Disposal Act

618
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,183
Um... yeah?

619
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:44,521
Why did you pay my debt?

620
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:48,525
No matter how shortages there is

621
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,862
I don't remember going that far

622
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:57,534
It's a pain for you to quit

623
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,536
What does it mean?

624
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:16,520
My daughter died in an accident five years ago.

625
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,523
What...

626
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,527
That's a bus accident

627
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,197
A bus accident?

628
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:32,870
Your father was the driver, that accident

629
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,512
You are the family of the perpetrator

630
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,351
I mean I am the victim's family

631
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,191
What's suspicious is the manufacturer

632
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,694
The weak are the prey to the major companies. It's a typical example.

633
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,696
There's no such a good company

634
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,698
I hate them, those ignorant and friendly guys

635
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,866
He's the guy who abandoned his company

636
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,370
Can you forgive the dreams of two parents and children be taken away?
