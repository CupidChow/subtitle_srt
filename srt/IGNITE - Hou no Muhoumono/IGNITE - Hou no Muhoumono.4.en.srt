Do you know that Yuuo was taking drugs with side effects? 》

00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,347
{As a family, please say a word.

[In interviews with investigators...] [Substantiated death due to negligence...]

"This is a case where it would be called a suicide act, or a murder act."

7
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:32,397
{(The phone is ringing)}

8
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:33,299
{Crew and passenger...}

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,303
((TV audio: Bell's voice over the phone))

10
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,948
(Uzaki) Is Todoroki the victim's family?

11
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,951
(Todoroki) My daughter is

12
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,621
I was on that bus

13
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:58,625
It's not a coincidence that I handed my business card to your mother.

14
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,629
I went to look at the bento shop of my own volition.

15
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:08,301
I'm curious as to why that driver's son became a lawyer.

16
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,971
I can't help but say something like that... what?

17
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,976
Assuming Todoroki was the victim's family

18
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,946
Why am I here...

19
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,615
I'll tell you, follow me

20
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,957
Me and you too

21
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:35,962
I'm sure I'd thought a lot about that accident.

22
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,965
What do you think was the truth?

23
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,301
I don't know

24
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,636
But at least

25
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,306
The cause of the accident is currently considered to be true

26
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,608
That's all a lie

27
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,977
Is it a fact?

28
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:54,614
Driver Uzaki Yuo was the day of the accident

29
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,283
Break the rules set by the company

30
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:01,955
I took a drug with a strong side effect and ran the bus.

31
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,625
As a result, they fall into a state of confusion

32
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,961
A major accident

33
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:12,632
This is the fact that was established at the time.

34
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:16,636
You're stupid, there's no way your father would break the rules

35
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,973
I have almost the same opinion too

36
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,609
Asami is the same

37
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:26,946
(Asami) Yes, there is a huge darkness hidden in that accident.

38
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,948
Nice to meet you Uzaki-kun

39
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,950
Who is it?

40
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,952
(Kiriishi) I'm a friend, don't worry

41
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:38,625
Asami Ryoko is a detective from the First Investigation Division who provides us with internal police information.

42
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,627
criminal?

43
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,296
The accident five years ago was as you said →

44
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,966
I can say with certainty that it's not Uzaki Yuo's fault.

45
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,970
Why? Despite all that sacrifice

46
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,973
There is no sufficient investigation

47
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,609
Everything was handled by the main office.

48
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,280
Perhaps the police crushed it inside

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,617
That means there's something I want to hide

50
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,620
I can't forgive you

51
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,958
Minato City teamed up with the police to hide the truth.

52
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:17,630
The mayor's music club, the top of the group, must always hold something.

53
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,301
I'm about to grab that tail right now

54
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:25,638
Do you understand why you need it? Uzaki

55
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,608
If you know, grow quickly

56
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,978
I hope there's always a big game

57
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,615
(Asami) I'm looking forward to it Uzaki-kun

58
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,952
(Kiriishi) I don't care either way, don't get in the way

59
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,979
(Moderator) He said he could create a big revolution.

60
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:10,617
(Tomita) Yes, the panels developed by our company are made of wood, but they are not easily burned.

61
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,619
It has high heat storage properties

62
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,288
A new insulation panel?

63
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,624
Yes... this is good

64
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,960
(Inoo) Apparently it's selling point is that it's hard to burn even though it's wood.

65
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,963
Yes, it's delicious

66
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,299
But we've been fried in the morning...

67
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,635
My bad mom just really does

68
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,637
{(Junko) Yes, please give this to everyone and bring it with you.}

69
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,973
{What, what is this, what does it mean? 》 《You'll be given the debt as a surcharge》

"There's no way I won't give anything back."

71
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,978
So what kind of spark is this?

72
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,614
This development is pretty weird

73
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,950
(Tomita) Summer is easy

74
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,619
It's warm in winter because it stores heat

75
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,956
It's great if it's cool in the summer and warm in the winter

76
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,625
No, the development itself is amazing

77
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,961
The manufacturer is suspicious

78
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,963
This meat housing is a company

79
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,633
I had an incident at the agency I used to be.

80
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,303
Ah, he's sued, rights matters

81
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,973
(Takaido) I'm sure it's a company that has grown rapidly over the past few years.

82
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,610
Yes, one after another, patents

83
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,946
He rose to become a major manufacturer at an extraordinary speed.

84
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,949
I dig it out because it smells bad, and as expected

85
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,952
There have been many times in development related matters.

86
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,954
So I'm a habitual plagiarist

87
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,290
Are you sure your target's eye is here?

88
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,626
Makita Zaiki Store

89
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,295
It's a small company with a craftsmanship

90
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,965
The weak are the prey to the major companies. It's a typical example.

91
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:38,304
So let's start a fight

92
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,306
Uzaki

93
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,608
That's my snippet

94
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,282
(Tomita) The structure is made of wood fibers and a breathable sheet and board.

95
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,284
(Ichiya) What do you mean?

96
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:55,288
Our invention is a layer structure that maximizes this effect.

97
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,291
(Kumamoto) Don't be kidding me, it's all my ideas

98
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,626
(Kawashima) What do you do?

99
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,963
I'll check with Mr. Kinoshita, who is in charge.

100
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,965
(Kumamoto) President We're going too

101
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:10,636
No, everyone will wait here and go by myself

102
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,608
(Takano) It's a bit lie (Kawashima) What will happen to this?

103
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,277
Why do you do this?

104
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:23,950
It was Kinoshita who said he wanted to support development.

105
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,953
(Kinoshita) We need to check each other's perceptions.

106
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,288
Oh, even if you say recognition

107
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,291
The materials are combined according to the drawings we drew.

108
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,293
Please stop accusing →

109
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:39,298
That insulation panel is a new product made by our engineers.

110
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,969
So why do we have the exact same drawing?

111
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,971
I don't know

112
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,975
If that's the case, then maybe that's what I imitated. →

113
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,612
Anyway, the patent has already been obtained.

114
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,948
Is this the purpose from the beginning?

115
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,953
What does it mean? I trusted you

116
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,623
I don't really understand the story

117
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,292
Isn't it so unfair to apply for a patent?

118
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,961
(Ikezawa) I will make a statement as an advisory lawyer, but →

119
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:13,633
If there is an invention, it's only natural to apply... I'm not talking to you.

120
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,970
This is a plagiarism of technology no matter what anyone says.

121
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,973
(Kinoshita) President, please calm down

122
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,975
As for us

123
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,946
I would like to continue to do business with Makita.

124
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,950
(Ikezawa) I'm currently asking for a renovation project for public housing in the city →

125
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,953
That's important to your company too

126
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,622
Are you thinking about quitting the transaction?

127
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,959
(Ikezawa) Isn't this a transaction due to a good relationship?

128
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,302
President Makita

129
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,972
Can I talk a little about it?

130
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,974
Which one would you like?

131
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,977
My name is Todoroki, a lawyer.

132
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,949
How was Meat Housing's response?

133
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,284
Why the story?

134
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,287
I just heard from the employees.

135
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,958
I think you're probably in trouble

136
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,630
It's a great help, President Makita

137
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:25,638
No, I'm going to have it, but it's fine

138
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:42,622
Ah, what about everyone?

139
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,291
I went up early today

140
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,960
I'm just standing there and going for a drink

141
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,298

143
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,304

He kept on stepping well →

148
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:17,957
The company that the previous generation left behind is not going to go bankrupt

149
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,628
Isn't it different?

150
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:27,633
The company he dumped and forced on me

151
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:33,973
(Ichiya) Then stop calling me that young president

152
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,977
Sorry

153
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,279

Wow, are you a mom? (Kumamoto)

00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,968
The young president died of illness when he was in middle school

158
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:06,305
Well, there were many difficulties, but now he's a great manager.

159
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,975
What happened to your previous father?

160
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,612
That's right... Yes?

161
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,981
Why were you talking to me like this?

162
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,617
Have you forgotten about it yet? A little bear

I'm studying social studies

168

(Takaido)♫~Youth Days

177
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,970
After I grew up, I started working for a construction material manufacturer.

178
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,973
If you have time, come back to the factory →

179
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,308
I was talking about things with my previous generation →

180
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:20,279
Looking back, we both were researching insulation.

181
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,949
All to develop this company.

182
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,622
(Kumamoto) That's when the previous generation evaporated

183
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,957
(Kawashima) Kuma-san Let's stop now

184
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,961
It's fine, so let me ask you at this point Kawashima →

185
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:41,300
I can't believe it, but suddenly she ended up making a woman and disappeared.

186
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,611
"Are you really going to throw it all away?"

187
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,615
{(Kazuhiko) Ah}

188
00:11:56,615 --> 00:12:01,287
"I'm not involved with the company anymore."

189
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,956
《What will you do about development?》

190
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,959
"We've finally made it this far."

191
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,629
"Wouldn't all of our employees make happy?"

192
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,968
"I was so interested"

193
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,304
Do as you please

194
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,610
《(Tongue click)》

195
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,619
(Kumamoto) Everyone is panicking

196
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,956
I was a bit nervous because I had a child too →

197
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:41,627
But the CEO must be the one who's hurting more than anyone else →

198
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,296
I'm still grudged →

199
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,967
Why does this happen?

200
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,638
But after that, everyone stood up together

201
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,974
The young president has reinstated the crisis

202
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,978
I worked for the company I worked for, quit quickly and come back, and worked as hard as I could.

203
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,980
Wow, he's a cool person

204
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,948
I'm a benefactor

205
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,619
If I was only thinking about myself, I should have gone to work.

206
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,622
But he came back for us

207
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,959
Kuma-san, just listening to my story makes me feel warm

208
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,296
In comparison, where and what did the previous generation do?

209
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,965
Poor Kuma-san, the young president

210
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,302
It's about parents and children, so it's better not to talk

211
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,307
Oh, good work, it's fine

212
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,310
Nishi-chan's Nagabuchi was the best,

213
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,279
What were you talking about?

214
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,949
Takaido This company is the best, it's super hot

215
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,285
You're really a good guy

216
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,955
(Kumamoto) Okay, I'll keep telling you more, please drink it, yes

217
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,291
Oh Takaido sings more

218
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,293
Sing, sing, sing

219
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,296
Thank you very much, good night

220
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,634
Okay, I got a lot of information out

221
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,970
Maybe I'll consider it at the office tomorrow

222
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,306
Usu, I'm happy, I'm not

223
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,309
Isn't it quick? Have fun, good night

224
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,952
Takaido It was a hot night, wasn't it?

225
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:17,623
No, there's no such company, I have to help you.

226
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,627
Are you still saying you're helping, this is business too

227
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:26,298
No, no, that's true, but they're nice people, so it's even more exciting.

228
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,301
Are you a good person, I thought it was shit

229
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,971
Huh? You, where are those people?

230
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,307
I hate that kind of ignorant people

231
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,611
Let's talk about how weak people can't be crushed

232
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,615
What is that terrible way of saying it is so passionate, you're annoying

233
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,951
Conversely, you're too cold

234
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,953
Don't get involved with drunk people

235
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,624
Get even more hot, Takaido

236
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,293
You won't get hot

237
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,963
Hey, is that bad?

238
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:02,968
Oshi I understand, sit down and drink again Let's talk

239
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,972
I can't do it, but I'm going home so do it alone today

240
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,608
What is it? It's so good

241
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,246
Don't be kidding these guys

242
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,594
{Are you sure Toma: The weak ones will be exploited →}

243
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,264
"You don't go on this side."

244
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,595
ah…

245
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,269
(Takaido) I understand the situation

246
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,607
However, even if we are currently insisting on the young president of Makita, there is not enough evidence.

247
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:53,245
There is no way to prove Kazuya is a true inventor

248
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,583
Yes, there's no way the meat housing would allow a copy of the drawing.

249
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,919
Just having the same drawing is not proof

250
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:05,257
It's certainly proof of which one drew first.

251
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,926
The only thing that can be considered as a witness is

252
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,596
My father was involved in development from the beginning, but...

253
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,599
Even if he is now missing, and is found →

254
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,269
Individual testimony is unlikely to be strong evidence

255
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,272
After all, that's the wall

256
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,274
Wait a minute

257
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,943
What if that was found? Takaido (Takaido) Ah?

258
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,945
See, the bear said

259
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,947
Ah... Research Diary

260
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,583
Parents and children were always watching (Takaido)

261
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,253
Hey, if it's a diary, wouldn't it be worth the age?

262
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:38,257
Certainly, if your diary has ideas and dates are clearly marked

263
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,260
It should be objective evidence.

264
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,263
Uzaki's lucky punch

265
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,932
Who's the lucky punch?

266
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,270
Todoroki-san, is it okay to move a bit in your own way?

267
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,939
Ah, of course (Takaido)

268
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,582
What is it Takaido: Isn't it motivated?

269
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,924
Wow, we were developing insulation here.

270
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,927
Yes, I've had to do the test here many times

271
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,596
We all created it together

272
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,599
Amazing, so cool, bear

273
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,601
Right?

274
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,604
...Even so, Nii-chan was a lawyer.

275
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,941
I was wondering if I could help you after hearing about it yesterday.

276
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,944
Thank you, I told that person too

277
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,947
We're simmering, please

278
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,583
Yes, so I have a request

279
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,587
What research diary Kuma said is? Do you know where it is now?

280
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,922
Ah, that

281
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,924
Come to think of it, where is it?

282
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,262
(Ichiya) Hey, what are you doing?

283
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,931
(Kumamoto) Oh, President I've made a strong ally.

284
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:57,936
I met Nii-chan yesterday, and I'm a lawyer.

285
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,939
I have no intention of filing a lawsuit, please come home

286
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,276
Why did you want to help me...

287
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,246
Kuma-san, I'll do the company

288
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,915
But (Ichiya) That's fine

289
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,587
Shall we talk somewhere else?

290
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,928
Well, thank you Kuma-san

291
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,930
Oh, see you again

292
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:32,604
I can understand how I feel about the employees

293
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:37,276
However, isn't it a little too early to just accept this here?

294
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,244
I'll get it back for another job

295
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,246
Let's fight

296
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,248
I heard it from the bear

297
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,918
How much do you value this company?

298
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,587
So how do you win?

299
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:52,257
If you've gotten this far, it's not possible anymore

300
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,594
I came today to break through that

301
00:19:55,594 --> 00:20:00,599
We believe the chance lies with your dad

302
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,268
Huh? My father has nothing to do with it

303
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:07,272
If your father is a witness, he might be able to provide strong evidence.

304
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,943
For example, a research diary I've been keeping for a long time

305
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:16,248
He's the guy who abandoned his company

306
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:20,586
I will never cooperate and I don't want to be furthermore.

307
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,921
Where is your dad going now?

308
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,258
i don't know

309
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,595
I should be living somewhere as I please

310
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,936
(Kawashima) Sorry

311
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,939
what?

312
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,276
I have a little something I want to talk about

313
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,248
Actually, I

314
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,584
I know where the previous generation is

315
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,563
First, I would like to ask you what the lawyer would need?

316
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,932
I'm sure they said it was about the Makita Rubber Store.

317
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,568
No notice of acceptance has been received

318
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,903
Whose behalf is it here?

319
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,240
You have to just do something that doesn't matter, you have to do something wrong

320
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,909
It's time to be taken away

321
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,253
It seems like there's a habit

322
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,256
Most of the innovations you have achieved

323
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:34,926
It would be unnatural that such similar examples exist

324
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:40,565
All discussions have already been completed, and we have won all the lawsuits →

325
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:45,570
If you're a lawyer, you'll understand this weight, right?

326
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,908
Please go home when you're satisfied

327
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,912
In the first place, there is no obligation to tell you anything

328
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,584
I hate that expression

329
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,586
yes?

330
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,589
(Takaido) He's very confident, but

331
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:10,929
If there are any drawings that were drawn long before the date you completed the drawings

332
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,932
What will happen?

333
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,935
That's not the case

334
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,905
It's just our idea

335
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,909
(Kinoshita) Please come home

336
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,912
is that so

337
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,916
I might win if I had a research diary

338
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,585
I was upset when I put on a sickle

339
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,922
☎I see, the key is my father after all.

340
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:40,258
Yes, but there's a place to stay

341
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,929
☎Go to Uzaki, where there was a harvest here too.

342
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,931
Huh?

343
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,935
Yes I understand

344
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:57,576
(Takaido) Twitch Why did you become a fireworker with this guy... Before you knew it,

345
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:01,913
I'm expecting growth, let's go Takaido

346
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,916
Huh? Noisy...

347
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,564
thank you

348
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,904
What kind of use do you want?

349
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:30,575
Do you know what's happening at Makita Rubber Store right now?

350
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,913
As you can see

351
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,917
I'm so busy with my own life

352
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,587
Assuming that the company's technology was plagiarized

353
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,923
His son Ichiya sued

354
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,261
It is being considered to wake up

355
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,931
I came here to be a witness.

356
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,235
I refuse

357
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:02,908
I did something sorry to my son

358
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:06,912
I don't have any faces to meet now

359
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,586
I don't remember the development details.

360
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:20,258
I don't have any intention of interacting with the company anymore

361
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,594
Isn't it pathetic?

362
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,907
What's that hiding it?

363
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,580
The sudden disappearance I heard about is also strange.

364
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,916
Isn't there a secret situation no one knows?

365
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm not hiding anything

366
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,923
I just can't get my head turned out because of debt

367
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:55,594
I'm continuing to pay 60% interest on loan sharks

368
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:59,564
That's illegal, you're being deceived so you have to fight

369
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,567
I know it's illegal

370
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,571
That's why I'm asking what to do

371
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:13,578
No matter how impressive an invention or aspiration

372
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:17,249
Once you become the exploited

373
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,918
I can't get out

374
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,587
This also has a disgusting look

375
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:28,593
I'm scared now, I can't move

376
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:35,233
I understand, then

377
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:38,904
Please tell me the loan shark dealer

378
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,909
Todoroki-san, I'm going

379
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,578
Todoroki-san

380
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,915
Todoroki! Oh... That's it...

381
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,917
good morning

382
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,586
What is that injury Did you do something again?

383
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,255
Let's go and light Kazuya-san

384
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,926
I won't say anything anymore but what will I do?

385
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,261
Of course I'll break through the front

386
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,236
If you don't know, I'll say it clearly

387
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:16,241
They say they won't put the company at risk in court that can't be won.

388
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,579
I found a chance to win

389
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,914
So how?

390
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,917
I asked my father to be a witness.

391
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,919
Did you meet him?

392
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,921
We met and talked

393
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,224
If that's true, then the president will be together again with the parents and children...

394
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,894
Bear

395
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:40,899
Is that guy coming?

396
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,234
We are continuing to negotiate

397
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,905
That's right

398
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,908
There's no way it's coming

399
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,577
The man who abandoned his company is now

400
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,246
(Kawashima) President: How to say that...

401
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:59,551
I won't do a trial so please go home

402
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,893
You and your children have been enthusiastic about researching that insulation material

403
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,895
Because it was their dream

404
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,897
Please come home already

405
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,234
It is possible for parents and children to develop what they discover together

406
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,237
I was happy, I don't remember

407
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,906
But my father suddenly betrayed me

408
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,242
I can't forgive that

409
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:28,246
What is your purpose for speaking? Go home already!

410
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,249
I haven't given up on that dream yet

411
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:38,890
The dreams of two parents and children have become everyone in this company's company's dreams, right?

412
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:44,562
Nii-chan can you forgive me if I take away something so important?

413
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:50,235
Everyone who works loves the company, so what's more

414
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,905
You, the CEO, is so loved

415
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,908
This kind of company

416
00:27:56,908 --> 00:28:00,245
A president like you

417
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:05,917
It should be a step forward for small and medium-sized enterprises that are being exploited!

418
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,556
Let's fight President →

419
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,559
I can't thank you for all of what's been up to now →

420
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,229
But this is about pride as a craftsman.

421
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,899
There's no chance of winning

422
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:26,237
If they cancel their contracts, we'll be on the streets.

423
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,573
President, please

424
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,242
The previous generation will surely come

425
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,913
So, could you please show me where we both work together again?

426
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,915
Kawashima

427
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,551
We'll do whatever we can to ourselves

428
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,554
I do whatever life I do

429
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,901
He's pushed me this far

430
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,904
I still can't decide

431
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,579
Our pride

432
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,248
Will you get it back?

433
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,251
yes

434
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,920
I'll entrust it to you

435
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,558
I asked

436
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,229
Leave it to me

437
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,901
Let's get started

438
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:08,907
Today is the date for questioning, and the witness, Makida Kazuhiko, is there?

439
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:14,245
I'm late now, so could you please leave it later?

440
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,247
I see

441
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,550
How about the defendant's agent?

442
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,920
It would be great if it really came

443
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,222
As a defendant,

444
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,892
(President Judge) Let's start as soon as we arrive

445
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,567
(Ikezawa) Exhibit 6

446
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:40,238
Is this drawing drawn by a craftsman at Makita Rubber Shop?

447
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,909
No drawings drawn by our technicians.

448
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,246
There was a report on it on the day I drew it, so it's no doubt

449
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,548
(Ikezawa) When is that?

450
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,918
It's December 15th, 2026.

451
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:57,555
The history of the email with the drawing attached is still available

452
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:03,895
(Ikezawa) So why do Makita Zaikuten have the same drawings?

453
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:07,899
I believe our original drawings have been plagiarized.

454
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,568
That's not possible

455
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:14,906
All of our employees and craftsmen know, so please ask.

456
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:18,243
I understand that small businesses are also difficult and difficult.

457
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,578
Please refrain from accusations

458
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,917
(Takaido) When you had dinner with Kazuya

459
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:30,889
You offered to help with development costs by paying in addition to the usual transaction.

460
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,892
No, I've already finished work and sometimes I drink it

461
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,894
I'm not talking about that

462
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:41,900
However, the transaction price has risen once since the day you eat →

463
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,570
This is proof that you were helping

464
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,574
You guys get a report of the development status →

465
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,244
He stolen the invention, it's not true.

466
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:58,917
So why do Makita Ruiki Store have such a similar drawing?

467
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,552
(Kinoshita) This is a common occurrence in this industry.

468
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,222
Maybe I came up with a similar product

469
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,557
We completed it first

470
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,561
First of all, the transaction price increased

471
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,898
I wanted to help Makita Zaikuten's business troubles.

472
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,567
In fact, I know the business situation very well.

473
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,904
I've given up on a variety of jobs to save it,

474
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,573
I feel like I've been given a favor back

475
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:26,577
Is that what you said? Kazuya-san Kazuya-san

476
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,918
That's why it was invented there.

477
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,921
I'd like to ask about insulation panels

478
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:41,225
Please tell us what ideas will be the origin of the invention?

479
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,562
Our company has been in the past few years

480
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:48,232
We were researching minerals with special properties →

481
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:51,569
The flame retardancy and the properties of wood

482
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,906
Furthermore, if we add the heat-generating property of the fibers

483
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,909
When big innovation occurs

484
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,580
So please tell us about the difficulties involved in developing it.

485
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,916
There wasn't much trouble

486
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:10,221
I knew the structure and mechanism, so I just had to steadily move towards my goals.

487
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,891
Don't be kidding

488
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,895
I've been researching since I was a child

489
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,232
I've finally finished it

490
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,235
Was there no hard work?

491
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,904
Don't let it be foolish too

492
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:30,241
(President Judge) Please refrain from making quiet and irregular comments

493
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,243
Is it okay now →

494
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:35,913
If you want to ask about development, I'll answer as many questions as I can.

495
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,915
(Presential Judge) Plaintiff: Any other questions? →

496
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:42,920
If not, I'll move on to interrogation with Makita Kazuhiko. Did you come? →

497
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,224
If you haven't come, that's all for today →

498
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,893
Plaintiff: Is that okay?

499
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:53,564
(Presiding Judge) Plaintiff: What do you think?

500
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,903
(Door opens)

501
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,912
It's very late

502
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:13,918
The late witness has arrived

503
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,556
{Please tell me about that loan shark dealer}

504
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,892
《Listen, what are you going to do?》

505
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,895
"No, I'll clean up my debts"

506
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,900
"And then could you come to court? 》

507
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,238
{Please call the representative.}

508
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,574
{I don't recommend it very much}

509
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,913
"What's up? 》

510
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,915
"I'm from a law firm."

511
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:48,920
"I came here because I wanted to get Makita Kazuhiko's unnecessarily interest to be revoked."

512
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,556
"Ah... I don't want to cause any trouble."

513
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,559
《You know the money lending business law》

514
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,894
{This is a complete violation}

515
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:00,898
{Ah, don't you know?}

516
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,569
《(Lock)》

517
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:08,906
"Look at the situation, I'm saying I'll look sad if I don't shut up."

518
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:12,910
First of all, no money is permitted without registration.

519
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,581
"Interest exceeding the upper limit interest rate is of course illegal."

520
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,920
《Oh no 》

521
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,556
《Ohhh》

522
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,560
"Calm down, this is self-defense."

523
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:35,900
"Unregistered money lending business will be sentenced to imprisonment of up to 10 years or fined up to 30 million yen."

524
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:40,571
"Learn money is fined up to 10 million yen in prison for up to five years."

525
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,907
"here we go"

526
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,243
《What are you going to do?》

527
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,552
OK?

528
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,554
yes

529
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,893
Kazuhiko-san

530
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:06,230
Please tell us how you came up with insulation panels

531
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:12,236
When Kazuya was a child, we played with a bonfire and played with him.

532
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:18,910
At that time, Kazuya realized that there was a tree that was not burning.

533
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,245
So

534
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:26,551
I'm starting to think that maybe I could make insulation from wood.

535
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:30,555
I think Kazuya started developing the project when he was a child.

536
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,557
(Kazuhiko) Yes

537
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:37,562
Then my son became an adult and started developing together.

538
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,565
In other words, the origin of this invention is

539
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,568
Is there no doubt that it is with you, parents and children?

540
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,571
(Ikezawa) Objection, obvious guidance.

541
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,574
There is no evidence to prove when development begins

542
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,243
I got it today so I'll submit it later

543
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:56,581
Here is a new evidence:

544
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,250
Kazuhiko-san, this

545
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,221
This is the research diary you used to develop insulation panels.

546
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,223
Yes →

547
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,560
This is something I've worn every day for over 20 years

548
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,897
The way the drawing is completed →

549
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,234
I think it's written along with the date

550
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,237
This is the same question as the defendant just said

551
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,574
Please tell us about the difficulties involved in developing this insulation panel.

552
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,913
That's already

553
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,916
There are many

554
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,919
For example, the combination of wood and minerals

555
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,556
Which percentage should be increased, and how many high temperatures should be pressed?

556
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,892
The result will change completely →

557
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:46,564
If you increase the proportion of minerals in an attempt to prevent burning, it won't harden.

558
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,233
Raise the press temperature to harden it

559
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:52,570
It's going to break this time

560
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,906
(Kazuhiko) And then

561
00:37:55,906 --> 00:38:01,245
I think it was difficult to think about how to make the heat-generating effect only in the cold season.

562
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:07,918
We have made the materials to make sure water vapor passes well according to the temperature.

563
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,921
Hearing my son's opinion

564
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,895
(Kazuhiko) This is

565
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:22,566
Thick or thin, it's not good

566
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:27,571
I've tried again and again

567
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:32,243
When was the result of that hard work and it was completed?

568
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,578
(Kazuhiko) I won't forget

569
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:39,250
It's June 10th, 2018

570
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,920
You can prove that

571
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,889
(Kazuhiko) Of course

572
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:49,894
The date the drawing is completed is written in the research diary.

573
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,906
This is proof

574
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,575
That concludes the interrogation

575
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,919
I was thrilled

576
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,921
(Door opens)

577
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,570
Thanks to that, it was helpful

578
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,907
It's just that I've protected my skills.

579
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,243
It's not you

580
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,247
Kazuhiko-san

581
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,250
To my son who has protected the company so far

582
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,220
Isn't it okay to express your gratitude?

583
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,891
What should I say now...

584
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,560
(Ichiya) It's fine

585
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,897
I feel bad when someone says something I never thought of

586
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,236
(Kawashima)

587
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,571
Please tell me the truth now

588
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,574
Kawashima Don't say anything bad (Kawashima) Please say it I can't stand it

589
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,910
I promised!

590
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,556
(Kawashima) Kazuya

591
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,225
The previous one is

592
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:32,730
He protected my old man and disappeared

593
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,902
What is it about?

594
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,237
What's the story?

595
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,908
My father is

596
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:47,578
A huge gambling guy

597
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:53,551
I took on a loan from a dangerous loan shark dealer.

598
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:59,890
Kazuhiko became the co-guarantor for the debt.

599
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:06,897
(Kawashima) The previous one was a classmate of my father.

600
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:10,901
Still, the previous generation said, "I hope you'll be openly at work."

601
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:14,905
"Please look forward to Kazuya" →

602
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,575
Sorry

603
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,911
In that way

604
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:24,915
I protected the company

605
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,918
To keep the Yakuza closer to the company

606
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:31,222
Living quietly

607
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,558
It's the same thing that's gone

608
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,230
I caused trouble to you →

609
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,234
That fact remains unchanged

610
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,237
Forget everything

611
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,906
Well then

612
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,246
Would you not do it together?

613
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:02,553
Shouldn't we do it together again?

614
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:32,249
It's just now

615
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:38,556
I want a craftsman who is knowledgeable about insulation.

616
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,230
It's a hassle to search

617
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,233
Shall we do it together?

618
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,918
thank you

619
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,894
president

620
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,575
good

621
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:45,222
Remove me from all staff?

622
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,559
(Chiga) Ah, sorry, but can you do that?

623
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,229
That's... That's too much

624
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:56,900
Rumors are spreading everywhere that he lost the Meat Housing trial.

625
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,904
You seriously undermined the trust of the agency.

626
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,242
That's... I only need the ones who can win

627
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:08,912
It's fine now

628
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:16,920
Uzaki What is that face so creepy, grinning

629
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,891
Well, I think we've come to feel like a team too

630
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,894
I'm feeling good about Todoroki-san Uzaki

631
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:28,565
Isn't it okay? In fact, I'm starting to look like a lawyer at my office.

632
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,901
Well, little Todoroki

633
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,237
I might have been better off going here

634
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,906
Uzaki I don't think so yet

635
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:38,242
Don't say that, Inoo

636
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,247
Huh? I just called you "Ino-san"

637
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,916
Don't say hard things, Inoo

638
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:55,225
Why did you put on Uzaki? It's a kind of outside training

639
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:58,896
Are you impersonating an employee? Tax audits can be called psychological warfare

640
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:02,566
Maybe it's going to be a card that will drop the soundtrack, so win no matter what.

641
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:06,236
This is your chance to cut off the mayor who was involved in covering up the bus accident.
