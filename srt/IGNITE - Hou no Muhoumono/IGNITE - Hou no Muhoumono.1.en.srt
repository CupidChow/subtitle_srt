00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,617
(Vibrator notification)

2
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,971
Wow, what is it?

3
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,976
(Driver) Everyone, please hold on, what are you doing?

4
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,646
Wow, ahhh...

5
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,964
(Explosion sound)

6
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:09,135
(An ambulance siren)

7
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,137
(Uzaki) Ha ha ha

8
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:15,642
Haa Haa

9
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,977
Haa

10
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,480
a…

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,317
Hmm...

12
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,287
(Junko) Rui! How long are you sleeping? →

13
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,957
I told you to help me out today because you had a catering reservation!

14
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,959
Ah!

15
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:39,966
(Junko) Ah, the mix is ​​three fried chicken, croquettes and fried shrimp.

16
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,302
Huh? Yes yes

17
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,971
I mean, 550 yen is too cheap

18
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,974
Happiness is better if it's easier to get

19
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:51,311
So I won't reduce my debt, did you say something?

20
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:55,315
When will you not work as a lawyer?

21
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:59,285
Also, the agency is just a matter of just being decided, so it's just a matter of 10 have been dropped.

22
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,287
Count every time, huh

23
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:06,126
You finally passed the exam after quitting your job, right?

24
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,964
Ah hey this

25
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,801
who? There are lawyers and customers in the store.

26
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,138
Please contact me if you like

27
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,474
Mother

28
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,476
hey hey

29
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,980
Wow, Peace Law Office...

30
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,318
Sorry for the inconvenience

31
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,956
Sorry for the inconvenience, brother, you're fine

32
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,958
Is that a good shoe?

33
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,294
Oh, it's 31, I'm still young

34
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,630
You should do a lot of things, yes

35
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,965
I'm going to work as a lawyer soon

36
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,967
Haha, bigger dreams are better

37
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,304
No, it's not a dream, it's also a bar exam.

38
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,974
Ah, I see, I see, I see, first of all, it's important to think you've passed

39
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,644
No, I don't think I got it, I really did.

40
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,146
Hey! a?

41
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,148
Is it okay? What is it?

42
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,785
Hey, I don't leave this place here, oh my goodness, sorry

43
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:09,289
What should you do? Can you guys make a compensation for this wound?

44
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,293
Ah, I'm really sorry, oh?

45
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,962
Ah, sorry, where did you hit it...

46
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,298
This is this

47
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,633
Is this? Oh there

48
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,803
Sorry for the moment

49
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,313
It looks like the damage is different

50
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,982
Hey hey hey

51
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,618
You can call a lawyer and sue him.

52
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,620
What?

53
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,794
Big brother, stop

54
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,631
Ah, what? It's fine, it's a waste of time

55
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,300
(The door closes and the engine starts)

56
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,806
Sorry for the inconvenience

57
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,983
Is it here?

58
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,970
(Take a deep breath)

59
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,976
Ah huh

60
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,616
Ah, shit

61
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,287
Excuse me (Todoroki) You ate my donuts

62
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,289
I bought this in a row (Inoo) It's not me

63
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,624
No no no no you have a criminal record

64
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,960
I have a criminal record but there is no evidence of this

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,962
Um, I'm the one who came to the interview

66
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,133
In the first place, don't they separate the word "donuts"? Is there such a law? What Article and Paragraph of the Civil Code?

67
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,302
(Takaido) Noisy

68
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,972
Article 258, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code: Dividing common goods

69
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,976
If discussions are not reached between the co-owners, you can request the division Yes Win

70
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,980
Um, when did I say I'd share this?

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,617
The bottom line is the heart of sharing.Do you have a heart?

72
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,619
Um! (Todoroki/Ino) Ah! ?

73
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,292
Before becoming a lawyer, I worked for a security company.

74
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,462
I used to do jiu-jitsu at karate since I was a child.

75
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,465
I'm confident in my strength and determination. What kind of appeal is that person?

76
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,302
Well, it's been an interview since you

77
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,305
You all the other agencies have gone down, right?

78
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,309
Huh? How did you understand?

79
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,978
No connections in the preliminary test group

80
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:49,315
Plus, I almost passed the bar exam last place.

81
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,785
First of all, this will fall out as a document...

82
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:57,623
Why did Uzaki-kun want to become a lawyer?

83
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,629
it is…

84
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:09,469
I thought there was something I couldn't protect with just strength

85
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,480
Yes recruiting

86
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,317
Huh? So adoption

87
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,987
Is it okay to hire? Yes, did you pass the bar exam?

88
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,623
That's right, is that okay?

89
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:34,293
There's a meeting for the next project right now. Will you be there?

90
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,132
Is it okay? Hmm

91
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:47,306
Now, start this week's fire conference

92
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,643
Tinder?

93
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,981
What about this person?

94
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,483
Starting today, I'm a newcomer who joined us

95
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,786
This is Uzaki, please

96
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,121
I don't know yet... and something good

97
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,123
Has anyone found it? yes

98
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,626
Inoo Yes

99
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:10,630
Nowadays, skinning drugs that are popular among young children are experiencing serious side effects

100
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,799
Is it a diabetes drug?

101
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,468
Looking at the reviews, it looks like there will be quite a few people.

102
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,638
Is it a class action lawsuit about health damage? Is there any good?

103
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,308
Did something fall into Takaido's information network?

104
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,812
(Takaido) Rumors that affairs are rampant in the tower apartment in Azabu

105
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,781
Ah, the rumored highway man affair, yeah

106
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,452
Um... Residents are high class people, such as managers and executives.

107
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,456
If we defeat the wives who are sacrificing, the compensation will be high.

108
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,958
Um, huh?

109
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,960
Sorry, no

110
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,630
What does it mean to be thrust for a while now?

111
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,966
That's a good question

112
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,470
(Leave the cup) Uzaki How do lawyers get money?

113
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,973
That's at the client's fees

114
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:58,978
Yes, the only time a lawyer will receive money is

115
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,482
Without a lawsuit, we can't eat

116
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,452
Ah, due to judicial reforms since 2000

117
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,288
The number of lawyers has doubled over the past 20 years.

118
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:13,626
As a result, the number of cases per person attorney decreases every year

119
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:18,130
It's a long time ago that lawyers can make money.

120
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,968
We're fighting over a lawsuit now

121
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,638
However, the lawsuit is at the client's will.

122
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,307
Hmm, it's sweet

123
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,309
Hehehe?

124
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,481
It's not good to just wait for a conflict to arise

125
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,451
That's...

126
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,622
You should just have a conflict

127
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,293
That's our way

128
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,301
You thought you had just come with a dangerous cousin, right?

129
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,803
(Vibrator notification) Yes?

130
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,642
Okay, it's done

131
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:06,145
Everyone is coming out now, it's the top priority

132
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,781
Yes yes

133
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,317
Are you coming out too?

134
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,153
I need your strength

135
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,971
"Your power"

136
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,973
Are you the driver?

137
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,980
Um sorry

138
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,983
I don't know your names yet

139
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,985
Ah, was that so?

140
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,621
I'm the representative of the agency Todoroki

141
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,457
Ino is behind and Takaido is behind

142
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,960
Ah, good luck newcomer

143
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,629
Ah, please, huh

144
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,298
I'm probably older than me

145
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,300
Well... I'm not looking elsewhere

146
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,637
If you fly more, where do you go to the outskirts of Tokyo?

147
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,973
Newcomers should just drive

148
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,642
Human User: Did you say something rough?

149
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,645
No, I said nothing

150
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,647
I didn't say it, I didn't say it

151
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,983
Yamagami Kogyo?

152
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:21,153
Three years ago, at Yamagami Kogyo's ready-made concrete factory

153
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:25,791
One of the workers died after falling into a sandy silo during a night shift.

154
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,961
Eh, the cause of death was asphyxiation death due to burying alive

155
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,963
It's a case of a silo fall

156
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,466
Why did you enter the silo?

157
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,968
Wasn't the safety belt hook attached?

158
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,304
That's a common issue

159
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,306
That's often come out soon

160
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,308
Well, initially at the factory

161
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,977
An investigation has been conducted on measures to prevent accidents.

162
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,980
In the end, it was an accident caused by the person's carelessness.

163
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,982
The investigation has been cancelled

164
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,985
(The car outside will blew the engine)

165
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,288
Wow, a disgusting sports car

166
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,624
That's the president, Yamagami

167
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,961
My son, Vice President, Yamagami Mitsuteru (Kouki)

168
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,631
And Todoroki wonders that the company had negligence.

169
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,634
Ah, the fatality of a working person

170
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,970
The compensation is high

171
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,140
That's how you say it's expensive... It's here

172
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,642
yeah? The target is

173
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,980
(Shun) Mama~ (Misaki) Ah haha

174
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,150
Shun, sorry, I'm late

175
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,152
Yes, was it fun? Yeah

176
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,788
(Misaki) Okay, Inoo Let's go

177
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,123
Yes, can I go too?

178
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,626
Huh? Well, it's fine

179
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,128
Stay quiet

180
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:39,965
Is it Saito Misaki? yes

181
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,968
We are lawyers

182
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,638
lawyer? What kind of use would you like?

183
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,642
About the fall of his husband, Saito Yuji, which occurred three years ago

184
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,144
Can you talk to us? What is your purpose?

185
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,480
Sorry for the sudden

186
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,615
Can we be of any help?

187
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,151
yes? You told me to shut up

188
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,788
I wonder if there is anything I can do about my husband's accident.

189
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,459
What is it to be powerful?

190
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,961
What kind of strength will it help?

191
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,465
That was just an accident →

192
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,634
I will not talk to anyone who is unrelated

193
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,971
(Misaki) Let's go

194
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,644
I was disliked because of Uzaki

195
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,315
Well, as expected

196
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:34,453
If the person is not good, I'll let the others get it exposed

197
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,290
Understood, haa

198
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,964
What? Is it my fault? It's the same no matter how you look at it

199
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,301
What, so? What happened to the divorce trial?

200
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:53,639
No, in the end, the lover will be a witness and it's a hellish scene.

201
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,143
What? Is that happening? No, really, everyone should be careful

202
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,645
Stop it, no...

203
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,314
Ah, ah, and that's what I said earlier

204
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,316
Everyone, what about the accident?

205
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:08,454
Ah, I've heard it from my husband, but do you know?

206
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,957
Yuji: You took on the night shift on the day of the accident, right? →

207
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,795
Poor Yuji was guilty of the company

208
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,130
Have you ever heard of it? That's not the case

209
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,299
After Yuji passed away, Misaki-san →

210
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,802
It was Yamagami who hired him to the company.

211
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,970
Yes, the company is in a way →

212
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,973
He's a benefactor, so is he benefactor?

213
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,978
(Yoshida) We also have a lot of support from Yamagami Kogyo.

214
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:37,650
It seems that all of the construction projects around this area are Yamagami-san.

215
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,985
Ah sorry

216
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:44,623
Here we do everything from house to demolishing heavy equipment.

217
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:49,295
So what is the lawyer saying?

218
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,965
No, at Yamagami Kogyo, three years ago

219
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,968
There was a fall into a silo, right?

220
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,470
That's just an accident

221
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,307
What's it now? It's been tidying up, right?

222
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:05,644
Even if you clean it up...someone is dead, and Yamagami-san

223
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:10,649
Did you also give the bereaved family a condolence fee? It's not that the company is bad

224
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:14,620
Don't let it go back now, okay?

225
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,958
thank you

226
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,627
What is that way of saying

227
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,130
Everyone doesn't say anything except for an accident.

228
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,968
☎It's strange how far the police investigation went at the time.

229
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,471
I know that it's a local influential person

230
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,473
(Vibrator notification)

231
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,646
Uzaki Let's go

232
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,316
Hehe

233
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,319
Ah... Hello

234
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,291
Shun

235
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,962
Can you come into the house first? Yeah

236
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,302
I came home and what's it?

237
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,973
What actually happened that day?

238
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,142
Would you like to clarify it at the trial?

239
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,978
trial?

240
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,649
I can't do that

241
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,985
Maybe I got a lot of condolence money from the company

242
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,988
Can't you say anything?

243
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,124
So what do you say?

244
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:29,128
Todoroki-san, there's no way to say that, right? You should just shut up.

245
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:33,966
I saw a photo of Misaki and Yuji during the autopsy.

246
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,969
There are strange bruising marks on my lower body

247
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,471
Where do you want to check this photo... again?

248
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:44,310
Please take it easy, don't step further

249
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,317
already

250
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,619
This is fine

251
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,965
Uzaki

252
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,968
Let's go back to this day

253
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,782
Mom, what?

254
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,320
Did you draw this mom? Yeah

255
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,972
thank you

256
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,966
{What is this?}

257
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,471
"Who's the one who did this?"

258
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,641
《It's fine》

259
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,311
《This is fine already》

260
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,462
(Takaya) Yamagami-san please do something about that →

261
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,632
Most of the town's construction projects have been moved to Yamagami-san...

262
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,968
You say it was decided by a legitimate bid, right?

263
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,304
You're people who don't know either

264
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,640
(Mountain) Calm down

265
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,477
We're also doing our best to help this town →

266
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,146
It's disappointing to say that like that

267
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:05,317
Shake yourself? Don't be fooled! (Rather) Please stop speaking a little louder

268
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,986
(Kiriishi) I think it's better to be careful about words more than that →

269
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:12,458
This is Kiriishi, the lawyer at Yamagami Kogyo.

270
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,628
Construction projects are appropriately carried out, if you are unhappy →

271
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,797
Will you fight in court? If so

272
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,967
From here on, I will record any further comments.

273
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,470
Hey, let's go

274
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,805
(together) Yes

275
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,141
It's more stupid to try to do it properly

276
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,644
Lightning, be careful about your words

277
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:36,982
I might get someone else to take my feet down again

278
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,485
(Rather) I know

279
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,288
President: There's a strange lawyer behind the scenes.

280
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,290
lawyer? Ah yes

281
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,294
What happened? What happened? There's an important story

282
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,630
Yamagami-san, yeah?

283
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,299
It's Yamagami-san

284
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,302
My name is Uzaki, a lawyer.

285
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,304
What is the lawyer for?

286
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,975
Regarding the accident in which Saito Yuji from your company died

287
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,477
I hope to hear more about that time.

288
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,147
Why do you mean that now?

289
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,983
Who is your client?

290
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,152
you? He's the counsel here

291
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,454
Counsel

292
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:20,626
I've talked to Mr. Yamagami, but the lawyers probably don't have the authority to investigate.

293
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:25,964
Does that mean there's something you want to hide?

294
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,635
Are you a newcomer? It's not going to be a story

295
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,139
What if you were a newcomer?

296
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,647
Huh? What's up to the office?

297
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,982
Oh, are you an acquaintance of Saito?

298
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:47,619
No, I'm not an acquaintance, please stop now

299
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,989
Misaki-san It's definitely not good to say this is fine anymore...

300
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,960
Please take it apart, it's a nuisance for doing something you like.

301
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,630
Why don't you understand now, Misaki-san? Actually, my family too...

302
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,799
Please go home! Misaki-san

303
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,637
Please

304
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,975
Please go home

305
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:25,624
Sorry, I suddenly came over

306
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,632
What is that guy?

307
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,974
Saito-san

308
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,644
Are you going to go to court now? home

309
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,813
My company's blessing

310
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,815
Don't forget

311
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:06,965
Idiot guy! What will you do if you hit someone you're going to sue?

312
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,968
Sorry, I never thought there was a lawyer.

313
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,471
No, it's not that, so is Uzaki even more dangerous than you imagined?

314
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,473
Is that so? As you imagined

315
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,642
It's crazy, but that lawyer is another bad guy.

316
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,311
I know, newcomers say they're talking... do you know?

317
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,314
Todoroki-san, I hacked around Yamagami Mitsuaki, who was asked to

318
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,984
Takaido - After all, he's a capable subordinate who should have

319
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,986
Right? What

320
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,290
On the day of the accident, Kouki had a drinking party with a friend he had promised.

321
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,126
Apparently they had cancelled at the last minute, so did something happen on the day?

322
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,295
And one more

323
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,131
Kouki changed his beloved car immediately after the accident →

324
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,633
This is a photo from the day before the accident →

325
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,636
So here's a picture two weeks after the accident

326
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,806
It's ahhhh, the car is off

327
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,475
Hey, what's wrong?

328
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,479
This guy is next to this light, he's right

329
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,983
I was in a demolition factory the other day.

330
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,985
Yeah?

331
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,289
{Sorry}

332
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,961
Uzaki: Let's go?

333
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,131
Let's go~ Get along well

334
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,136
Should you wait here?

335
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,972
Don't do anything unnecessary

336
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,974
yes

337
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:28,313
You guys again I won't talk anymore

338
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,650
(Mitsui) Ah, I'm tired, thank you for the meal this time.

339
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,987
Sorry, but there's someone like Mitsui here, right?

340
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:40,292
(Yoshida) Mitsui? There are, but what is Mitsui?

341
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,627
(Mitsui) Ah, that kind of thing has arrived →

342
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,629
Yes, be careful →

343
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,633
It's okay Kouki-kun, I won't say anything

344
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,969
Yes, I'm tired

345
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,308
Ahh

346
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,815
Ah, a moment!

347
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,460
Wait, cola! That idiot

348
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,970
Wow ah

349
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,639
Don't let me get away, what's that?

350
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,641
Hey, here and there

351
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,310
Wait, wait, wait, wait

352
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait

353
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,316
Wow wow wow

354
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:42,788
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

355
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,624
Hey, stop it!

356
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,462
Ah... Itte

357
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:55,967
Ah, ah, Mitsui-san, this is definitely too much

358
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,970
The compensation in this case is extremely expensive

359
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,972
Do you know some?

360
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,975
(Uzaki taps on the bonnet) (Mitsui) Hii

361
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:07,312
So why did you run away?

362
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,586
Misaki-san

363
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,590
I'm sorry the other day

364
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,927
There was not enough consideration

365
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:27,766
Could you please listen to me again?

366
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,610
You guys should just go to court and get the money, right?

367
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,615
After that, what will happen to me and Shun who live here?

368
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,284
You don't know how the bereaved family feels, do you?

369
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,590
I understand

370
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,593
A little bit

371
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,264
My dad too

372
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,101
He died in an accident while working

373
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,103
Huh?

374
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,940
It was a traffic accident

375
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:15,614
The police judged it was his fault.

376
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,116
He was treated like a murderer by the public

377
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,952
Ah... but

378
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:24,422
My father was enthusiastic about work

379
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,758
There's no way that accident would happen

380
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,595
At least, my son, I believe that

381
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:34,599
Yamagami Mitsuteru is the day after the accident

382
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,935
I'm scrapping my car

383
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,605
Yuji's death was not just an accident.

384
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,611
So what is it?

385
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,947
What can you do? To me

386
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,953
The police won't make it a case

387
00:25:55,954 --> 00:26:00,926
There are still ways to fight civilly

388
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:04,429
That's the last path to revealing the truth

389
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,934
All the feelings Misaki has at the moment

390
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,603
To us

391
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,773
Can you leave it there?

392
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,285
This is fine now

393
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,287
I won't let you say that

394
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,592
a…

395
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,595
It's really persistent

396
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,597
Huh?

397
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,767
Whether you refuse or refuse, it'll come

398
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,937
Sorry

399
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,107
It's just that giving up is bad

400
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,957
Uzaki-san

401
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,928
yes

402
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,935
I'll sue

403
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,944
This is Kiriishi, the defendant's agent.

404
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:36,915
You are violating Yamagami Kogyo's obligation to take safety into consideration →

405
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:40,585
He filed a lawsuit, but in the police investigation at the time of the accident,

406
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,921
No defects found in the company's safety measures →

407
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,257
You know that it wasn't a criminal case, right?

408
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:50,595
Yes, Yuji's accident was a very unfortunate thing.

409
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,931
But you were after Yuji's accident

410
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,100
Apart from industrial accidents, from Yamagami Kogyo →

411
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,603
You've received 3 million yen in condolence money, right?

412
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,573
Yes, it's more than enough sincerity from the company.

413
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,576
You filed a lawsuit

414
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:09,581
My lawyer told me that the statute of limitations is approaching

415
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:14,586
Didn't you think this was your last chance to get money from the company?

416
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,921
That's...

417
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,425
It's not about money

418
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:25,930
After the accident, you were hired by Yamagami Kogyo with the kindness of President Yamagami →

419
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,600
Salary of a company that is so beneficial to you →

420
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,436
Isn't it not strange that it's perceived like that?

421
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,938
Opposed, Chief Justice

422
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,274
It is a right to file a lawsuit.

423
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:41,079
The defendant's agent's comments just insult Misaki.

424
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,082
(Presiding Judge) Agent: Will the questions continue?

425
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,585
No, Misaki, who was convinced of the accident at the time,

426
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,256
I've now changed my opinion 180 degrees

427
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,592
I thought it was unnatural →

428
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,594
That's all from me

429
00:29:57,762 --> 00:30:02,433
He's going to attack in a bad way

430
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,917
Yamagami-san You have been back then

431
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,252
As the president of Yamagami Kogyo

432
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:25,590
I was in a position to manage my shifts

433
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:30,929
It seems that Yuji's night shift was decided on the day of the accident.

434
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:35,600
Yes, there was a sudden vacancy for the night shift worker.

435
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,603
I see, I'll change the question

436
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:42,273
Yuji was in an accident the night

437
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,944
Did you really work in a factory silo?

438
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,946
(Mountain) Yes? (The crowds of audience)

439
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:52,584
Objection: The intent of the plaintiff's representative question is unknown.

440
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:57,255
The shift data for Yuji worked on the day is as shown in the shift data for the No. 8.

441
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:01,593
The judge's shift data was created

442
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,929
I'm asking because I want to confirm

443
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,934
So, briefly

444
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:14,272
Shows Exhibit 8

445
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:19,577
This is Yamagami Kogyo's shift data on the day of the accident

446
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:23,581
Check this property and the last modified date

447
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:27,752
It will be 9:20am on April 16th.

448
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:31,589
Hmm, Yamagami-san

449
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,925
Why the day after the accident

450
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,427
Has the data been updated?

451
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,930
There's something about updating data?

452
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,267
Usually entered a few days before work days

453
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,269
Why only on this day

454
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,105
Was it updated the next day?

455
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:51,276
(Mountain) It was three years ago so I don't remember very well.

456
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:55,580
I see, that's inconvenient, because inconvenient

457
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,582
If you don't remember

458
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,258
That's all from the plaintiff

459
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,076
Yamagami Mitsuteru You are the day of the accident

460
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,246
Have you seen Yuji working night shifts?

461
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,582
(Kouki) Ah, yes I was at work too.

462
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,587
However, an employee who saw Yuji that day

463
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:40,091
Did you know that there are none other than the two of you?

464
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:43,261
Well, it's not strange because one person is basically working on night shifts.

465
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,931
It seems that the camera records in the factory have already been erased.

466
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,900
Why is that?

467
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,236
That thing, what has it been like for a while?

468
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,572
Objection, judge, this accident

469
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,575
It should be a major premise that it is during business hours.

470
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,912
The plaintiff's agent has been asking questions that are unclear.

471
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:04,749
I'm listening to it to judge the credibility of the statement

472
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,919
(President Judge) Please give me a quick tit

473
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,589
Kouki-san You are the day after the accident

474
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:16,561
On April 16th, you've been scrapped your favorite sports car.

475
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,930
Tch, what's it this time?

476
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,899
It must have just happened to be broken

477
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:26,738
If it's broken, you should have it repaired, so why scrapped it?

478
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,575
Has something inconvenient happened?

479
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:35,246
Is it my own way to not get rid of my own things?

480
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:40,585
You are about 7:30pm, an hour before Yuji's death

481
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,588
Not in the company, but elsewhere

482
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,923
Wasn't he having a traffic accident?

483
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,926
Huh? There's no way that such a thing can happen

484
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,929
The judge's representative's question has nothing to do with this matter.

485
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,898
I'm listening because it has something to do with it

486
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:57,068
Presiding judge: I will submit it as Exhibit 15 now.

487
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,237
Shows the report

488
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,573
As shown in the photo, Yuji's body

489
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:06,577
The calves on both legs are about 40cm from the ground

490
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,913
There were deep bruising marks

491
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:12,917
This is a CG photo of Yuji's height

492
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:17,922
If you touch the same car as Kouki's then, you can contact us here.

493
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:23,261
The position of the bruise coincides with the front part of the car.

494
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,563
If you have a photo like this, you can just leave it to us, right?

495
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:30,568
So what? Is there any proof that I got caught? Kouki-san, please calm down

496
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,570
yes

497
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:42,914
《Aim for the glow?》 》 《Now there is no definitive evidence to break down the mountain here》

498
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,250
"That's why I'm aiming for that stupid son to get a rag."

499
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,256
Wow

500
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,561
This is Uzaki, the plaintiff's agent.

501
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:59,230
I'll submit it as evidence later

502
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,067
The defendant testified that he was at the company at the time of the accident.

503
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:07,405
It is important to the credibility of its

504
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,741
Kouki-san

505
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,077
Do you not recognise this?

506
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:18,249
A sports car you should have scrapped

507
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,585
In fact, it's still there

508
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,727
My junior Mitsui was trying to sell it overseas.

509
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,096
That guy... Incidentally

510
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:35,233
Kouki was left with blood stains in the trunk of the car.

511
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,902
You know who it belongs, right?

512
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,904
(The crowds of audience)

513
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:47,078
The judge's agent is proceeding with speculation arguments without evidence.

514
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,581
Kouki-san, did you drive Yuji-san?

515
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,917
Ah... did you get it?

516
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:56,587
Wait a second, there's an objection Kouki-san, you don't have to answer

517
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,589
It's hiit!

518
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,926
(The crowds of audience)

519
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:06,230
That's... Yuji...

520
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,900
(Kiriishi) Mitsuteru-san, you don't have to answer

521
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,237
Kouki-san, me, that time

522
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:16,073
I told my dad to take me to the hospital, light shine →

523
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,075
What are you talking about?

524
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:21,245
It took

525
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,247
Not a murder tort

526
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,250
{If you file a lawsuit against the company's obligation to take safety into consideration}

527
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:31,589
"Yes, when it comes to court questions about factory safety management, let the other party be careless."

528
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:36,093
"In the middle of the interrogation, Kouki blames him for murder."

529
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,898
Well, I told him to bring him to the factory...

530
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:44,735
Wait a second, why am I going to have to do that?

531
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,905
Bribes to local lawmakers

532
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:53,077
You've learned this fact from Yuji, right?

533
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:57,415
"Yuji said he found out about the company's fraud."

534
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,084
Yamagami bought a local lawmaker.

535
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:03,921
"We had construction-related bid information being released behind the scenes."

536
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:08,259
"I had a question somewhere in my mind."

537
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,229
"but…"

538
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,234
{For the sake of the born Shun →}

539
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,736
《Give me money from the top of the mountain →》

540
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,738
{Hired}

541
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,743
《It's really pathetic》

542
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,745
Kouki-san

543
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,582
Yamagami-san

544
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,252
Saito Yuji is

545
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:38,256
Not to fall into the silo, but to you

546
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,258
I was killed

547
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,931
《I'm heading over》

548
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,900
{Wow} {(Sudden braking and collision sound)}

549
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,740
On the day of the incident on April 15th, around 7:30pm

550
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,409
While driving, Kouki was on a road near the factory.

551
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,579
I hit Yuji on my way home.

552
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,582
When Mitsuteru said to take him to the hospital

553
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,251
If Yuji dies like this

554
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,420
No one knows the fact of bribery

555
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,922
With that in mind, you put him in the car

556
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,925
I instructed Kouki to go back to the factory.

557
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,564
Based on the estimated time of death

558
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,234
Yuji's breath may have still been there at the time.

559
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,236
{(Yuji) Ugh...}

560
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:29,573
And yet you guys thrust him out of the silo

561
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:37,081
The accident three years ago

562
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,251
Taking advantage of the accident that Kouki caused.

563
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:44,088
A murderer who pretended to be a silo fall accident that happened

564
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,558
Yuji is

565
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,261
You were killed twice by a parent and child!

566
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,735
Misaki is unable to rely on anyone in the enclosure of Yamagami Kogyo.

567
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,737
I can't speak up

568
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:05,409
I had no choice but to accept Yuji's death.

569
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:12,416
That's all from the plaintiff

570
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:36,073
Uzaki-san, Misaki-san, thank you for your hard work

571
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:39,243
It's not finished yet but...

572
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:43,080
I'm heading ahead, yes

573
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,583
I'm tired

574
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,253
How can I really say thank you?

575
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,923
It took me three years but

576
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,093
I feel like I'm finally moving forward

577
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,396
No

578
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,399
Misaki-san

579
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,567
I'm my first client

580
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,237
Huh? Ah, that's right

581
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,239
yes

582
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,909
Ah... he was a bit of a pushy lawyer.

583
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,245
Ah sorry

584
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,915
But I was saved by that force

585
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,919
What I was screaming in my heart all the time

586
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:26,590
Uzaki yelled at the court

587
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,561
Become my voice

588
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,230
Thank you so much

589
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,903
home

590
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,406
Be a great lawyer

591
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,408
yes

592
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,411
Excuse me

593
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,726
Wow

594
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,095
Hey, Uzaki Are you going to do that again?

595
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:08,399
Huh? Also? It's irrelevant

596
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:13,070
Yuji was killed twice by a parent and child!

597
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,072
No, that was a real punch line.

598
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,074
I think it worked for a draw battle, but? Feeling too good

599
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:19,076
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

600
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,412
That person really can't you put it in?

601
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:25,749
I'm stupid, but I might use that heat

602
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:28,419
Eh, "Eh" I'm a senior than you

603
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:32,723
I'm not good at that kind of person who exposes his emotions

604
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,261
It's in the way, let's go

605
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,231
Huh? Ah, on the mountain

606
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,567
This invoice yes, thank you for your hard work

607
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,569
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit, what do you mean?

608
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,072
I didn't tell you, but actually this is always

609
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,408
Partners! ?

610
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,078
I was organising it before the trial

611
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,080
Haa! ?

612
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,750
"My name is Kiriishi" "Lawyer? 》

613
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,254
{He doesn't look like a woman} {he recently opened in this town}

614
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:07,091
I contacted my prey before we headed out.

615
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,393
{(Vibrator Notification}} {All right, it's done}

616
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:13,230
"Everyone will come out now, it's the top priority."

617
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,900
"I received a complaint from Saito Misaki."

618
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,902
《Don't worry》

619
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,904
Gradually, I'll get into my pocket

620
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,906
Is there still some shift data? 》

621
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,908
{I think it's still there}

622
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,413
Looking for cracks in prey

623
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,751
Poison

624
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,254
And with a face that never came to eat

625
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,924
Stand in court

626
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:43,394
Tossing lawsuits and win using all means

627
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,230
That's Peace Law Office

628
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,733
Well, it's not peaceful at all, though.

629
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,069
Thanks to you, my plans have almost gone wrong

630
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,406
No, no, is this possible in the first place to do something like this?

631
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,408
Like fooling your client

632
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:01,245
Since we have separate offices, it's physically possible.

633
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,748
But... could you follow the rules and protect Misaki?

634
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:10,921
(Clap your hands) Okay, thank you everyone for your hard work this time too

635
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,923
Win the trial for the wrongdoing you committed

636
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,393
Reparation: 150 million

637
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,395
Reward is 50%

638
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:21,732
What? 50 p.m. Is that how you take it? You're taking risks, obviously

639
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,734
The client agrees too

640
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:27,571
I made a lot of money, so will I get some meat that is expensive tonight?

641
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,908
Ah, I'm fine with that, so please give me a bonus

642
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,910
It's the same

643
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,913
Ha ha ha yes yes

644
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,082
I want to receive a bonus and eat meat too

645
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,084
No, do it either way? Why?

646
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:44,254
What's this? I can even get cold noodles for the finish

647
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,590
☎ (Asami) Thank you for the matter on the mountain

648
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,927
I was told about a good spark.

649
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:54,565
(Asami) The silo accident occurred at the time, and the police were killed when they were not suspected of the incident.

650
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:58,736
Yamagami's parent and child have also begun a re-investigation on suspicion of murder.

651
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,905
☎ Your civil evidence has worked

652
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:04,241
I see

653
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:08,245
The photo of the autopsy that I sent me was helpful too.

654
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,582
Police also report the autopsy results of Yuji's autopsy.

655
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,585
Apparently they didn't go that far at the time

656
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,755
The complexions of the local influential people are probably

657
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:21,558
Is the narrow world something that can be held?

658
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:25,396
That's right, what about that child?

659
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,899
ah

660
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,235
It took a good job

661
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,738
Yoisho (Junko)

662
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,907
Did you tell your dad you could become a lawyer?

663
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,576
Yes I'll tell you now

664
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,578
what?

665
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:44,915
(Ring the bell)

666
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,231
Sleeping from the target suicide attempt this time →

667
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,567
He is Nishida Mato's younger brother

668
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,570
You're sueing the perpetrator, right? This university is the whole thing
