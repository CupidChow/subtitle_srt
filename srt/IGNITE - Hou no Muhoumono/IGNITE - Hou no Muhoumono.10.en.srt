1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,974
(Junko) I was responsible for my husband's health →

2
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:10,643
If you are taking medicines with strong side effects →

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:13,646
There's no way I don't know

4
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:18,485
(Isokawa) So, is it that the accident was caused by the husband's fault?

5
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,988
Yes, someone suddenly hit you

6
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,991
There was a problem with the maintenance of the bus.

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,494
That's all I can think of →

8
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,997
But it was dismissed by a sloppy investigation

9
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:35,001
It seems like the husband is responsible for everything

10
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,471
Police have already concluded the cause of the accident.

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,974
I'm saying that's bullshit

12
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,643
(Todoroki) Junko calm down

13
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,648
excuse me

14
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:53,153
Is there any evidence that you didn't take the medication?

15
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:03,496
My husband has been working sincerely for 30 years.

16
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:09,469
Even alcohol was only drinkable on the day before my break.

17
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,473
I'm not going to take such a drug.

18
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,976
"trial? A bus accident? 》

19
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,647
{(Uzaki) I want to clear my father's name}

20
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,982
"I'm thinking of suing the bus company"

21
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,320
"So I want my mom to become the plaintiff."

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,322
《To me? 》

23
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,659
"I'll be in court as an agent."

24
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,497
《Whew…》

25
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:42,001
"I don't want you to listen, don't be surprised."

26
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:46,473
"Actually, Todoroki-san is"

27
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,642
"The family of the victim of that bus accident"

28
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,312
《So? 》 《Huh, aren't you surprised? 》

29
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,981
《So what? 》

30
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,317
{Ah, sorry}

31
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:01,988
"No, there's so much I have to talk about."

32
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,324
"I'll tell you everything up to today"

33
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,659
{If that's what my mom agrees...

34
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,661
{That's fine, not really} {Huh? 》

35
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,998
"I wish I would become the plaintiff, right? Yes I understand

36
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,000
{Ah, no no no, there's still no explanation...} {Good, good}

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,003
"Mom doesn't know what's difficult anymore."

38
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,973
《If you're going to do it, decide, do it.》

39
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,975
"ah…"

40
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,977
{Thank you for your cooperation}

41
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,313
{Something was easier than I thought}

42
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,483
"Thank you so much to everyone..."

43
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:37,490
{Please, Todoroki-san, please.

44
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,994
《I'll win, sure》

45
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,471
"This is where the real battle begins."

46
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,648
Is it just an assertion that you haven't taken any medicine?

47
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:07,487
Here we will show the autopsy results of Uzaki Hiroo, the number 4, →

48
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,989
Eh, here from Uzaki Yuo's body →

49
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,660
The reaction of the ingredients contained in anti-anxiety drugs has been shown →

50
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,497
These ingredients have side effects such as a decrease in attention and concentration →

51
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,632
Also, when the effect of the medicine dies

52
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,635
Sometimes hallucinations are visible →

53
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,004
Some people are delirium

54
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,473
These symptoms occur while driving

55
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,642
A bus accident occurred →

56
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,312
Isn't that a consistent story?

57
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:37,650
Such symptoms have been together for a long time and have never seen them.

58
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,988
It's possible that he couldn't tell you and was suffering alone, right?

59
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,658
It's impossible, actually, when I interviewed an employee

60
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,495
Your master is from an excessive sense of justice

61
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,999
I heard that he was isolated after being smoked inside the company →

62
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,636
Stress caused me to lose my mental health and took anti-anxiety medication

63
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,972
Isn't it a fully conceivable story?

64
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,474
So how did you get the medicine? →

65
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,977
It's a drug you can't get unless you go to the hospital, right?

66
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,981
There are many ways to get medicines, even if it's not a regular route.

67
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,984
As long as there is evidence of this, Uzaki Yuo →

68
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,988
It's hard to move because I took medication while driving.

69
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,491
Now it's time to make it a poor maintenance

70
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,494
Isn't it quite unreasonable?

71
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,000
Haa...

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,004
We would like to ask Mr. Hamaoka, the director of Minato Chuo Bus.

73
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:35,475
Regular vehicle inspections What kind of system was the maintenance carried out?

74
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,977
(Hamaoka) Ah, in line with the regulations of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism

75
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,980
It was carried out regularly

76
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,984
How often does it? Ah, in addition to checking every three months

77
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,655
We conducted extensive inspections every year.

78
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,992
Three months? Did you only go there that often?

79
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,996
No, of course, I do daily inspections every day →

80
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:02,001
From the time you hear that it's a regular inspection, you answered every three months.

81
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,637
Regular inspections and daily inspections are different things

82
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,974
Did the vehicle that caused the accident have cleared those two?

83
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,476
Yes, there was no problem

84
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,479
Can you prove that? Of course

85
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,650
There is a maintenance and inspection record book at the office.

86
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,654
Otherwise, the government will punish you.

87
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,990
I see

88
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,994
The inspection was definitely carried out according to the maintenance sheet.

89
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,998
In the unlikely event that the maintenance chart had not been tampered with.

90
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,334
Is that what you mean? Objection

91
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,637
The defendant has stated that the maintenance had been properly done.

92
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,306
(Inoo) Here is the evidence submitted to the defendant.

93
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,643
Exhibit 8th certificate was on by Minato Chuo Bus at the time.

94
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,645
A maintenance inspection table is shown

95
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,647
This includes the day of the accident

96
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,650
This is a maintenance record that goes back a week.

97
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,319
Certainly there are circles on all items

98
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,656
(Hamaoka) Of course, I'm doing well at Yochi

99
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,326
Maybe some of the buses that were running were old cars.

100
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,663
Of course, in that case, like this maintenance chart

101
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:07,333
Isn't it unnatural that all the items are fine?

102
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,470
It is the result of daily maintenance.

103
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,974
Have all the vehicles never been defective?

104
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:19,145
They neglect daily inspections and use circles appropriately

105
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,647
Isn't sloppy management rampant?

106
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,984
I would like the judge to stop doing good things!

107
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,321
Sloppy management is insulting the defendant →

108
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,490
I'm asking for retraction

109
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,993
"This is the real battle! 》

110

116

{Yes, yes} {Thank you for your hard work}

133

I'll give you a straightforward look

174
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,487
Maintenance of Minato Chuo Bus

175
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,657
Do you think it was enough?

176
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,998
No, no doubt

177
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,000
I think it was insufficient

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,469
(It's disgusting) However, the maintenance and inspection list

179
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,638
All items have circles

180
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,974
Does this mean that it is different from the truth?

181
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,478
Yes, what is the actual vehicle condition:

182
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,648
It must be called a very different maintenance chart

183
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,984
So it's been tampered with?

184
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,655
(Horikiri) It's pathetic, but it's

185
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,658
(It's getting disgusted)

186
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,994
Was there any problems with the vehicle before the accident?

187
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,665
Not only that period, but every three months of inspection →

188
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,635
Multiple vehicles have been damaged or worn out

189
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,305
Did you not report it to the company?

190
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:18,477
Of course, but they weren't able to meet

191
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:23,649
{Please} {Yes, fufufu...}

192
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,318
"Horikiri-kun's appraisal is strict"

193
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,988
"If I were to get on you, any vehicle would be treated like a lazy one."

194
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,658
{Director: Minimum maintenance is required to continue operating safely}

195
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,994
{We're doing it on the last minute too}

196
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,664
"We can't afford to cut everyone's salary by spending unnecessary expenses."

197
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,333
{But...} {If there is a really dangerous vehicle}

198
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,638
{It's going to fix it properly. I'll check it out for now}

199
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,641
{Please, especially the brakes from car 8 and the air tank from car 10...

200
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,978
{I said I'd watch it, I'm busy with the next one too}

201
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,650
{(Horikiri) is...}

202
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,653
{(Yuo) I've just returned}

203
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,989
{Ah, welcome home} {(Yuo)}

204
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,159
{Ah, Uzaki-san, how's the brakes? 》

205
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,662
{(Yuo) Ah, it's dangerous if you don't pay attention}

206
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,498
{Maybe it lasts for the next regular inspection}

207
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,634
《It might be worse than that》 《That's right》

208
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,471
"Oh no, I've told the director a few times."

209
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,639
"I know the situation"

210
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,975
{Well, it's still okay}

211
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,644
{We will drive with caution too}

212
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:30,316
{I'm sorry, I put a burden on it} {No, it's not Horikiri's fault}

213
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,652
《We will carry the product while ensuring the safety of our customers》

214
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,654
"That's our job."

215
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,656
{As you said}

216
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:41,660
"Ah, Uzaki-san drives so safely that he's stubbornly safe."

217
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,165
{Hey hey, I'm protecting the diamonds properly} {No doubt}

218
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:51,003
{Haha...} {Thank you for always having a hard work}

219
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,475
"well"

220
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,982
I think it put a burden on the driver too.

221
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,986
At the very least, I'll try to ensure the minimum safety.

222
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,489
We worked overtime every day

223
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:14,660
So why are circles lined up on the maintenance chart?

224
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,997
(Horikiri) I write down the exact situation every time I do an inspection →

225
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,633
And I submit it to the director every time.

226
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,635
but…

227
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,973
All maintenance charts for the next day are circled

228
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,643
After submitting it to the director

229
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,646
Everything was tampered with a circle

230
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,648
So, is it?

231
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,651
Yes thank you

232
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,990
This is Takaido, the plaintiff's agent.

233
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,993
From now on, written by Horikiri, the official site of the 16th issue →

234
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,996
Here is an image of the original maintenance table →

235
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,998
Here is the same vehicle as before →

236
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,302
Is this a maintenance sheet before it's tampered with?

237
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:01,473
Yes I tried to keep it in the image once I knew it would be rewritten.

238
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:05,978
As you can see from the date, at the last inspection before the accident →

239
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,981
There are issues with multiple vehicles →

240
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,985
However, Minato Chuo Bus still decided that it was OK →

241
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,487
Leave this to reduce expenses

242
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,990
Did you rewrite the maintenance chart?

243
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,992
yes

244
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,494
Now, I'll ask you

245
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:26,498
What about the vehicle where the accident occurred?

246
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:31,470
Unfortunately, I didn't maintain that car.

247
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,974
I don't know the exact condition of the day

248
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,143
However, based on the testimony so far

249
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:42,314
Do you think the bus that caused the accident had a poor maintenance?

250
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:46,318
Objection! It's unrelated to the accident vehicle

251
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,988
Now, let's change the question

252
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,660
Why didn't you say this before? →

253
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,996
I should have said it when there was an accident

254
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,998
I agree

255
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,002
Now

256
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,638
I regret it

257
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,477
Didn't you protest against the tampering?

258
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:16,982
I did it at first, but I was too meticulous and I was so tempted to smoke.

259
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,986
A mood of mocking me was wafting through the company

260
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,990
Eventually I'll start shutting up too

261
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:30,496
But in the midst of all this, only one person spoke to me together

262
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,466
It was Uzaki Yuo

263
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,635
《I can't keep quiet anymore》

264
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,972
"This is beyond the level of saving money."

265
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,474
"What would you do if something happened? 》

266
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,644
"That's why they say they'll do it in the next three months."

267
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,646
《It doesn't last that much》

268
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,482
{Following Horikiri-kun's correct maintenance chart}

269
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,652
{Please repair the vehicle immediately}

270
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:57,656
"Uzaki-kun, what if you let your shoulders go down? 》

271
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:01,994
"There are some things that need to be ignored during work."

272
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:05,998
{You're more serious than serious, you're so serious →}

273
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,000
{Hahahaha...→}

274
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,636
{There's a slight problem, it's fine to run it.

275
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,306
{There have been no accidents at all} {It's too late after an accident}

276
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,976
(Horikiri) Uzaki-san spoke seriously →

277
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,479
Even when he was insulted, he didn't give up and continued his claim →

278
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,317
I should have acted earlier for Uzaki-san.

279
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,491
I've given up on it for five years...

280
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,994
I'm sorry

281
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,999
If I had said more strongly

282
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,468
Such an accident...

283
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,978
That Uzaki-san

284
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,982
I can't believe he took any medicine that violated the regulations.

285
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:02,988
I'm sure there was a problem with the vehicle.

286
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:12,998
Horikiri-san, thank you for your valuable testimony.

287
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,641
The judge As mentioned in his testimony

288
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,644
The vehicle that caused the accident may have been poor maintenance.

289
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:30,149
Above all, there is a possibility that Director Hamaoka had been aware of this.

290
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,485
Please give us another opportunity to interrogate, as there is something I would like to ask you about.

291
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,488
As a defendant, I don't think there is any need for that →

292
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,491
I've already spoken about your understanding

293
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:46,999
(President Judge) The court will be asking about the maintenance status of the vehicle.

294
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,001
I want to check again

295
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,004
Only that will allow interrogation

296
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,642
(Hamaoka) Oh...

297
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:11,657
Now, let's visit Hamaoka again.

298
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,660
Was there any problem with the bus where the accident occurred?

299
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,496
(Hamaoka) No, not

300
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,999
Based on Horikiri's testimony and the 16th Issue, it's as expected.

301
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,636
Isn't poor maintenance at your company?

302
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:28,474
There's none, actually at my company

303
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,976
There have been no accidents other than that...

304
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:35,481
Hamaoka-san: What caused that bus accident?

305
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,983
If it's due to poor maintenance

306
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,986
Your social responsibility is immeasurable

307
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,993
Cutting the tail is a common method for those in power.

308
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,999
{(Hamaoka) Is it a settlement? 》 《(Sound club) That's right》

309
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,635
{Minister Ishikura set up the service}

310
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,639
"The Minister? So the cause of the accident is definitely...

311
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,642
"It was the driver who was driving it."

312
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
"Automatic driving mode remains off"

313
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,981
"It was explained that it would just make AI remember the paths of the region."

314
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,483
{So it's a malfunction...} {Is it okay?}

315
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:16,321
"This is just something that person is doing as part of his risk hedge."

316
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,991
{Even the dead}

317
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,993
"Is it allowed? 》

318
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,496
"It's fine, as long as there's a backbone called Ishikura."

319
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,498
"We won't sink"

320
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,635
"We will continue to support you in all aspects in the future."

321
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,639
《That's good》

322
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,643
I don't know what you're clinging to

323
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,312
The distorted protection will never last

324
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,649
You'll lose everything

325
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:48,487
A familiar person has proven that recently, right?

326
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,991
(Reporters' voices and multiple shutter sounds)

327
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,471
There's no way there's a bad maintenance

328
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,977
It must have been checked carefully.

329
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,980
Why can you say that?

330
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:20,986
That bus had an autonomous driving system.

331
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:24,489
It was managed to obtain accurate data

332
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,995
what? If it's abruptly, say something better than that

333
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,497
It's true

334
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,634
With GI Technologies' autonomous driving system →

335
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,637
I was taking driving data from the test operation.

336
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,473
From 2 weeks before the accident to the day

337
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:45,644
It is certainly possible to prove that there are no defective maintenance on the bus →

338
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,646
My liability problem doesn't occur

339
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,482
You cannot be allowed to give a casual testimony in court.

340
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:55,487
Lawyers know the best that they don't lie in court.

341
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,991
I can clearly say this here

342
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,660
There is no possibility of poor maintenance

343
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:08,000
(Hamaoka) That accident was definitely the driver's fault.

344
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,617
(Kitamura) The trial as a result seems to have been closed in an overwhelmingly advantageous situation →

345
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,121
I think it's almost a victory (Ishikura) Is that so?

346
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,290
Well, I've never tried to win

347
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,959
Whichever you go, there's no impact

348
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:38,964
What if the perpetrator's family sues the bus company for compensation?

349
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,433
Hahaha...

350
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:45,971
What kind of reading is that it's too off point, it's not even a funny story

351
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,941
As you said, it doesn't seem to capture anything

352
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:53,945
In any case, there was a possibility that Minato City had been cut off.

353
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:57,949
I took an unnecessary detour, but it was better than persisting in barren land.

354
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,452
Was it a proper cut in losses?

355
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:05,457
As a result, the spread of autonomous driving in Japan is accelerating.

356
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,293
Finally

357
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:11,963
Just a little more until my long-cherished wish was achieved

358
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,968
cheers! (Everyone) Cheers!

359
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,604
No, it was really exactly what I was aiming for

360
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:23,608
This is what it means to lose a match and win a match

361
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,945
It was a perfect journey, the plan was perfect

362
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:30,949
There is also evidence of the introduction of the autonomous driving system that I wanted the most

363
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,452
Applause for the enemy testified!

364
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:38,623
That Director: I said that the bus in the accident had AI installed.

365
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,625
Did you say it in court?

366
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,629
What's more, it's clear that GI Technologies is involved.

367
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,599
That testimony will remain as a court record.

368
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,436
It will be effective evidence in fighting the main castle trial.

369
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,939
Okke, Okke, I want to be nice

370
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:58,944
Junko-san This time, Yuuo-san didn't say anything about his stigma.

371
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,947
I know, I'm still in the middle

372
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,617
Of course, I've been given an explanation from my son.

373
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,953
I'm looking forward to this future

374
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,955
thank you

375
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:14,960
But I was surprised, and I can't think of an incredible strategy

376
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,963
I'll do anything to defeat Ishikura

377
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,133
"With my father's bus company? 》

378
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,436
[Set a lawsuit against the director for breaching the duty of safety consideration]

379
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,438
{It's a bad maintenance of the vehicle}

380
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:30,609
"How do you prove that autonomous driving is out of control due to poor maintenance? 》

381
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,944
"The goal is Ishikura, right? 》

382
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:37,949
《There are two main steps to defeat Ishikura》

383
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,129
The first one is the bus that caused the accident.

384
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:55,600
Proof that it was equipped with GI Technologies' autonomous driving system

385
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,136
The second is that the system is out of control.

386
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,439
Proof that the accident was caused

387
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,608
《You need to break through these two stages, but unless you confirm the first one,

388
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,278
《You cannot go up to the ring to defeat Ishikura》

389
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,281
"Do you mean letting the director speak during a trial? 》

390
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,618
"Yes, it's a violation of the duty of safety consideration to pull out a gaffe."

391
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,455
《But one-time battle》

392
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,958
《It's not going to be a serious gamble》 《But it's not a bad bet》

393
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,627
"Hopefully, Ishikura will lick us."

394
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,629
"May be a guide"

395
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,966
First, you need materials to push yourself into court.

396
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:32,437
"If that's the case, I'll get on the bus company."

397
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,607
We won the bet, we're yeah

398
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,943
As planned, it has passed the first stage.

399
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,612
Thank you for your cooperation once again

400
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,949
I'm glad I was able to help

401
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,284
I've never felt so nervous

402
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,286
He was proud (Junko) What?

403
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,789
It's so different from my son, I don't want it!

404
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,458
teeth? Have you seen my serious acting?

405
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,627
That's how I elicited testimony

406
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:59,631
teeth? It was terrible, "What is it? Abruptly?" I came out

407
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,967
"If it's an excuse, say something better."

408
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,970
It's true that they're making unnecessary plays, and it made me irritated, and it made me irritated...

409
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,273
It's not an unnecessary or a small play, so I did a big play

410
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,609
It's a big play, so it's a shitty play

411
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,278
I don't look like that, I'm exaggerating too much

412
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,020
(Ring the bell)

413
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,999
(Asami) I'm glad to meet you

414
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,675
Isn't the room dirty? I'm sure Kana is angry

415
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:47,012
With that in mind, this is the result of working hard every day.

416
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,515
I'm sure Kana is also laughing with excitement

417
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,685
What did you talk about?

418
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,655
I finally got here

419
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,491
I guess you're watching

420
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,994
Thank you

421
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,998
It was a long time, but I reached my destination.

422
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,001
I've got enough cards to fight

423
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,337
Thanks to them for working hard

424
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:16,007
Huh, it's true that the Young Team did more than I expected.

425
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,677
So this is where the adult team comes in.

426
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,513
First, from today, Ishikura's shadow

427
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,016
I'll announce the results I've made under the surface

428
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,686
The key figure in this battle is...

429
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,023
Forensic anatomy doctor Kuno Nobuyuki →

430
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,026
The man who was in charge of the autopsy of Uzaki Yuo

431
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:39,998
If you attack from this guy, you should be able to uncover the connection between Ishikura and the police.

432
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,500
How did it work?

433
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,004
Even though they are called big politicians, the police are different organizations.

434
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,673
Why did such a tedious cover-up go through?

435
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,509
Academic association of the university that one attended →

436
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,511
Hoshokai meeting photo →

437
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,680
The man next to Ishikura →

438
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,017
Current Deputy General of the Metropolitan Police Department, Aoyagi Hiroji

439
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,520
Deputy General... What benefits did you have and did you cooperate?

440
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,657
Aoyagi lost to a promotional race within the police.

441
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,493
He had completely lost his path to becoming a police chief.

442
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,663
That's a well-known story in the Metropolitan Police Department.

443
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,666
Under such circumstances, that accident happened

444
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:18,670
So Ishikura brought sweet honey to negotiate.

445
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,672
It's quite possible

446
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,675
Ishikura, who is probably in a pinch, →

447
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,678
He appealed to Aoyagi to become a politician →

448
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:30,348
If you support yourself on the condition of cooperation

449
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,018
Transitioning from a central government ministries to a politician?

450
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,020
It's perfect timing

451
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,022
Certainly not passing by

452
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,492
But how did you do the cover-up?

453
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,496
Yes, the Deputy General gives instructions to the Transportation Director.

454
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,998
The manager on the field will follow the instructions of his boss →

455
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,501
Perform tampering

456
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,503
That's all for the procedure

457
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,505
Tch, you idiot

458
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,674
(Kiriishi) But what about this Kuno?

459
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,009
The police could control it.

460
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,011
Doctors are different

461
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,681
Why do even doctors take part in the cover-up?

462
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,016
He was taken advantage of his weakness and tamed

463
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,018
weakness?

464
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:11,356
(Asami) Kuno seems to be sure of his skills as a doctor, but he has problems with his behavior.

465
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,491
That's where I thrust

466
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:19,998
(Asami) Is it okay? You guys and other multi-use buildings underground shop

467
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:25,003
Your job is to sneak in and become a regular

468
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,672
Do you know what store is there?

469
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,008
Dark Casino

470
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,011
There's no way you don't know, boy

471
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,514
When will the irregular casino be held?

472
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,516
Can you find out?

473
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:42,020
Are you kidding me? Who has to do such a troublesome thing?

474
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,022
There's still so shut up

475
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,024
If you can sneak in well

476
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,660
Becoming friends with this guy →

477
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,998
And certainly, the day this guy comes to the dark casino will seize time.

478
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,000
This is your job

479
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,003
Why should I do that?

480
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,506
A frequently spoken criminal

481
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,675
What is it? The sins of these children

482
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:07,178
Yes, this guy is a leaf

483
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:10,014
And this guy is running the sugar daddy

484
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,684
So maybe this guy was a scam →

485
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,686
We found them all at our club.

486
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,655
Oh, remember, OK, I'll remember

487
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:22,827
I'm not gonna... If you're cumming, I'll arrest you

488
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,999
How do you get in?

489
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,669
Security is so strict, it's easy to find a pseudonym

490
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,671
I don't use fake names

491
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,007
Please bring your ID with your real name

492
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,343
Huh? What if you get scammed?

493
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,012
It's better than being copied by me here →

494
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:44,015
If I get the information safely, I'll miss it

495
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:47,519
He's still young, so wouldn't he be better off tracking the possibilities?

496
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,023
Invitational letter

497
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:57,495
If you ask me anything, just say it to someone I met at my club.

498
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,497
So please

499
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,337
(Hagiwara) Ah Asami-san, what are you going to look into this?

500
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,339
It's fine, come on

501
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,675
Under what conditions will they move to attack?

502
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,011
I want to know how to match up

503
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:16,681
But this isn't my jurisdiction, it doesn't matter.

504
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,683
You'll catch the bad guys, right?

505
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,654
First class leader!

506
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:32,664
Asami It seems like he's doing something unnecessary again

507
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,334
What do you mean by unnecessary things?

508
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,004
Did you bring up the materials from the Security Division? What are you looking into?

509
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,006
It was just right

510
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,343
I wanted to talk to you about a certain dark casino.

511
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:49,013
It is a place that is outside its jurisdiction and is a hotbed of crimes we deal with.

512
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,683
It cannot be said that it is outside of its jurisdiction

513
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,019
Sometimes you can't miss it if it goes too far →

514
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,656
How did you get information about that dark casino?

515
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:02,994
I can't teach you because it's a unique method of research.

516
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,663
What are you obsessed with?

517
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,667
It's decided

518
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,671
It is to protect the voices of good citizens

519
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,653
(Ring the bell)

520
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,503
Hahahahaha...

521
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,172
Hahaha... Hahaha...

522
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,341
Scary Why are you laughing?

523
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,478
No, just remember a little about the trial the other day

524
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,480
Hahaha... huh?

525
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,652
Something pounding? Are you nervous? I was nervous but

526
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,987
What was fun

527
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,989
What is that? What is that?

528
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,991
Mom helped me

529
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:11,663
That way, the heart usually pounds, hahaha...

530
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:15,667
Yes sorry

531
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,002
Until now, I've been silent

532
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,007
But something...

533
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,010
I joined an office like this too

534
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,646
I don't think it's a coincidence

535
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,987
Me and my mother for 5 years

536
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:38,656
You've been living a life desperately

537
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,993
Right

538
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:47,665
I feel that I normally can't digest it

539
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,668
I forced myself to go on

540
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,009
So I managed to live a laughing life

541
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,011
Right

542
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:04,148
No matter what anyone says, we've been trying our best

543
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,487
But it's really

544
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:14,492
No matter how much I deceive it

545
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,664
Something here is unsettling, it won't go away

546
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,666
of course

547
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,002
I'm feeling frustrated

548
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:30,008
I think I've finally come to the point where I can face it.

549
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,012
It took me five years but

550
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,986
Here I'll fight to defeat this frustrating

551
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,655
I'm going to seriously heal this wound

552
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,661
So now my friends are the best

553
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,665
This method is also

554
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:58,002
I believe I'm definitely right

555
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,505
Ling...

556
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:05,009
It's okay, mom feels the same way

557
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,647
I see

558
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,983
If so, it would have been good

559
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,657
Um... um

560
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,660
Actually, mother

561
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:27,665
I've been in touch with Todoroki since then.

562
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,668
What?

563
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:36,808
(Junko) That accident took a lot of things from us.

564
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:44,315
(Junko) It was such a sudden and unreasonable breakup, right?

565
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:52,156
(Junko) We didn't know what to do with those left behind

566
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:58,663
(Junko) But Todoroki-san forgives us

567
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:04,502
(Junko) On top of that, she reached out to help her.

568
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,339
A helping hand?

569
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,175
See, when you committed an assault

570
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,312
You said there was a lawyer who helped you.

571
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,647
Huh?

572
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:20,985
What, then, what inspired me to become a lawyer...

573
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,987
Todoroki-san

574
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,658
Haa...

575
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:33,498
Todoroki taught me how to fight →

576
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,000
Sorry to keep quiet

577
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,669
Ugh

578
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,639
Back then

579
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:47,011
It must have been like every day is in a storm

580
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,481
There's no doubt

581
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:55,486
Thanks to Todoroki, the storm has passed

582
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,658
It's not a clear sunny day yet

583
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,001
I've been feeling frustrated forever

584
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:16,474
I want to clear my mother's dad's regrets

585
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,645
Yeah

586
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:25,483
You have pride and determination, right?

587
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,656
Yeah

588
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,326
No matter what you use, you can defeat Ishikura

589
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,663
If that's the case, even a mother can do anything

590
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:42,500
Look at your eyes now

591
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,474
(Uzaki laughs)

592
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:57,315
My mother has long been prepared

593
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,657
Now, let's eat fried food and cheer up.

594
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,661
Yeah

595
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,670
"(knock)"

596
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,474
《(Yuuu) Ran, I'll enter》 《What? 》

597
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:31,983
"You're not going to say anything that will make you sad, mom."

598
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:36,320
{Because I don't like fried foods anymore}

599
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,322
《Huh...》

600
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,658
{You}

601
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:45,997
{Even if you're too hard, you have to eat it.}

602
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,501
"Why should I do that? 》

603
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:54,005
"Because it's something my mother cherishes."

604
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,642
That's what my mother's pride is

605
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,647
"Ryo Family and friends"

606
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,650
"What kind of person do you think you mean? 》

607
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,985
{I don't know}

608
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,658
《Daddy is》

609
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:17,995
"I think what's important is the same person."

610
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:23,668
{(Yuuu) That fried food comes from Ryo's grandma to his mother→}

611
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:27,338
"It's a pride that has been handed down with care."

612
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:31,008
"If that's the case, you have to cherish it too."

613
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,979
Because it's family

614
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,320
"I can't make someone special sad"

615
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,991
"That's justice, do you know? 》

616
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,493
"Yeah"

617
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,338
I'm coming, that's too early today

618
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,640
Well, I'm really motivated (Junko) Oh~ →

619
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,176
Oh

620
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,312
Yes, it's good, it's obvious after all.

621
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,314
Well then, please everyone

622
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,316
Yes (Junko) I don't have towels at that point

623
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:12,917
Yes yes

624
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,998
good morning

625
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:31,001
Oh Uzaki It's pretty early

626
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:42,012
What are you looking at? It's disgusting

627
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:46,650
No, I think Todoroki-san is the one who's coming soon

628
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,487
That's how motivated you are

629
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,489
That's right

630
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,161
Wow...

631
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:03,000
That Todoroki-san, yeah?

632
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,005
Thank you so much to today

633
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:12,643
What is that unclear words of gratitude

634
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:19,483
Ah, I... Are you able to become a force?

635
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:23,654
Huh? See, you said it before

636
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:27,324
Grow up so that you can have a big game anytime

637
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,660
I wonder what it is

638
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,666
I've decided that the situation has been settled

639
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:40,671
We have decided to file a claim for damages against GI Technologies.

640
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,008
Are you satisfied?

641
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,644
Evil

642
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:50,648
We need to gather evidence and testimony towards the lawsuit.

643
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,984
The strategy is finally starting

644
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,986
Is there any way to do it?

645
00:40:55,986 --> 00:41:00,658
First, start by approaching former employees who have left GI Technologies.

646
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,994
Once everyone is together, it's a strategy meeting right away.

647
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,497
Thin!

648
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,672
(knock)

649
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,508
(Employee) President Is it okay now?

650
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,177
(Takarada) You can see that you're busy

651
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,646
What report do you need now? (Employee) Yes

652
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,984
So what is it?

653
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,986
(Employee) I received the complaint.

654
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:33,657
complaint? Does that mean you were sued? (Employee) Yes, that's what it is

655
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,659
Who are the plaintiffs and agents?

656
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,661
The plaintiff is Uzaki Junko

657
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,499
The agent is Todoroki Kenjiro, the representative of Peace Law Firm.

658
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,501
Hmm

659
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:48,005
I see, I will file a lawsuit against you...

660
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:53,644
That means you may be able to see a lot of things

661
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,981
Why do you think so?

662
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,650
Looking at Minato Chuo Bus' court records

663
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,153
My system was installed on the bus.

664
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,322
The director testified →

665
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,992
It's pretty well prepared

666
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:11,495
I see, the trial that seemed misguided

667
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,998
It was a process of solidifying evidence.

668
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:17,001
It was well fitted

669
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,670
The victim's family and the perpetrator's family?

670
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,007
Let's admit that it's not just a rat.

671
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:26,010
Innovation requires sacrifices

672
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:30,014
I wonder why I don't know, they're stupid guys

673
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,982
I totally agree

674
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:35,319
Of course, there was a malfunction error.

675
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,656
It's a level that doesn't happen in real life

676
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:42,660
There's no way 100% of technology in this world

677
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,663
That's a very reasonable opinion

678
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,665
That coincidence one time

679
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,668
It happened while collecting driving data

680
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:55,005
In short, I was unlucky

681
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,642
It's the probability of a landslide or a plane crash.

682
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,646
There's no way technological innovation is possible because of fear of such stupid numbers

683
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:07,318
I actually managed to overwrite some nice data for two weeks.

684
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:12,656
Ah... It's the first time I've been forced to do so

685
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:17,661
The enemy is facing you with an incredible obsession →

686
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,663
How should we deal with it?

687
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:29,006
So, to a man with the same level of attachment

688
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,508
Let's say you ask for a defense

689
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,645
Are you there? Such a person

690
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,982
Only one person has a feeling

691
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,656
(Chiga) Yes No →

692
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:48,993
Thank you for giving me such a valuable opportunity →

693
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:53,998
Yes, I will be fully satisfied

694
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:58,002
Excuse me then

695
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:41,478
That family has been carrying the crimes committed by GI Technologies.

696
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,648
