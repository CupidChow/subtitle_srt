1
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:37,303
(Uzaki) Wow

2
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,307
(Turn off the motorbike engine)

3
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,144
(Music is leaking)

4
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,981
(Inoo) You're here, did you wait?

5
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,650
What is it, are you riding a bike?

6
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,820
Any problem? Well, it's better

7
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,489
And what? Call me this place

8
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,325
I've managed to win the lawyer's debut match.

9
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,327
I think he has a face that doesn't float

10
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,329
Are you worried? No no no no

11
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,000
What's the only thing I hate seeing that painful face?

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,170
Well, I'll have a fuss today!

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,138
Hmm!

14
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,643
(The music resonates)

15
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,813
Haa...

16
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,482
Wow it's still painful

17
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,484
It's quite quiet, but I can't believe it

18
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,820
Are you the type who can't play at a club? teeth?

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,822
When I go, I go a lot

20
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,158
The standard Jizo type excuse that came out is Ha

21
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,797
Hey, hey, Uzaki, let's dance together

22
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,333
It's sober, but it's so excited

23
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,635
Because I'm not in the mood

24
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,637
Uzaki

25
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,807
You came in at your own will, right?

26
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,143
If so, I have to decide and work

27
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,979
Younger people are in a good mood

28
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,981
Don't preach? Huh?

29
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,650
You're younger, aren't you? I'm a senior

30
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,820
That's fine, "Ino-chan"

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,656
So, I'll ask that senior one

32
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:06,826
Is that a lawsuit okay? Of course

33
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:10,663
I'm basically anything okay, Peace

34
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,632
Anything? Yeah

35
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,168
Wooo! So is that too?

36
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,137
(Takaido) Put your hands up!

37
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,474
♫～

38
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,476
Why is he DJing?

39
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,478
here we go

40
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,814
It seems like it's been around for a long time

41
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,983
DJ TomA

42
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,652
Apparently it's pretty famous in this area

43
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,821
3 2 1 Let's go！

44
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:41,995
♫～

45
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,164
Wow, that's insane! The best!

46
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,167
Uzaki Let's dance! No, hey... I'm fine! Inoo-chan

47
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,802
It's dangerous! I don't get it

48
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,806
TomA! Wooo!

49
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,477
(Junko) Get quick! You're sure to be late!

50
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,148
(Junko) What are you thinking that you're suddenly late?

51
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,484
Apologise to everyone

52
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,819
I've finally picked it up, so uh no, but yesterday

53
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,156
I was left with the guy from the office until the morning, so I don't make any excuses! Lawyers are on the side of justice!

54
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,158
I hope so... just take a moment!

55
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,160
I'm coming! Yes please come

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,162
(Uzaki leaves)

57
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:20,333
(Todoroki) This time it seems like it will be a huge spark, so I hope it will connect well.

58
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,469
It seems like it's worth moving just by the current information.

59
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,471
Okay

60
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,640
I'm late!

61
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,642
Has it finally arrived (clicking your tongue)

62
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:33,479
I'm sorry it's over now. I've drilled a hole in an important meeting.

63
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,648
It's not affecting you don't need your brain

64
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,319
Hmm... What? Uzaki: You overslept?

65
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,988
That's how it is, so Shut up

66
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,157
Haa, so pathetic

67
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,659
I invited the club to encourage him,

68
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,995
You want to encourage him? About Yamagami Kogyo

69
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,997
It looks like it's still dragging on

70
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,999
What's it?

71
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,168
Is it surprisingly naive?

72
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,470
I've been able to become a lawyer

73
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,974
I think that that will continue to happen in the future... Which mouth is it?

74
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,643
I guess it's you who pushed me

75
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,645
Getting an attorney infiltrates the other party...

76
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,981
Wasn't Saito Misaki grateful?

77
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,655
If we hadn't tried to hold back, that matter would have ended in the same way.

78
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,658
Which of the following is the justice in this case?

79
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,662
This is our way

80
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,632
If you don't like it, go back to interview hell

81
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,303
Go back, junior

82
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,476
"Attempted suicide in the university rugby club"

83
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,978
I feel tired

84
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,982
Don't say anything, get excited, and where is the source of that article?

85
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,819
I've looked into it, anonymous posts on social media seem like the trigger.

86
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,490
I only picked up a small web media

87
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,659
Well, it's still rumoured for now

88
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,496
It's time for us to eat, I have to hurry...

89
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:01,334
"Students who attempted suicide are not expected to wake up unconscious."

90
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:05,004
Today, the first time a parent information session will be held

91
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,974
I'm sure I'll get through it with beautiful things anyway.

92
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,311
I'll just shut up and drive, I'm also a lawyer

93
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,980
Please tell me more details

94
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,482
Overslept and details Who missed it?

95
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,319
That's sorry, I'm really sorry, I'm really

96
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,157
Will you also be suing someone this time and filing a lawsuit?

97
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,326
Of course

98
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,495
You should start a conflict

99
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,664
(Vibrator notification)

100
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,805
(Asami) Haa, please give me a quick beg again

101
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,807
Wow

102
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,144
(Hagiwara) Asami-san seems to be about to begin the investigation meeting.

103
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,146
OK

104
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,302
Alright! Ugh!

105
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,304
Oh, go go go!

106
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:16,976
Bullying means sue the perpetrator, right? no

107
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,145
This university is the whole thing

108
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,647
Whole? Really, it's a bad idea

109
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,817
a? I'm aiming for the billions

110
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,821
The individual perpetrator's ability to pay is pretty obvious, isn't it?

111
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,991
That's a huge company when it comes to a university.

112
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,494
You have to pursue responsibility for that

113
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,797
Learn to violate the duty of safety consideration.

114
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,799
Learn, learn

115
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,302
Ah, it was supposed to be a young man in the future

116
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,972
Future income value

117
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,141
Make the university pay a lot

118
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,643
Isn't that inappropriate?

119
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,147
You're attempted suicide, right? Maybe I'll still wake up

120
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,649
You should do what you say

121
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,319
What? Isn't that girl really angry?

122
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,660
(Kamiyama) It's a good movement, Souto! →

123
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,996
Keep that in shape!

124
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,166
That's the target of this time, Nishida Hayato.

125
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,469
He is a player who has also been named to the Japanese national team by age group.

126
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:20,473
He is Nishida Mato's younger brother, sleeping after attempted suicide.

127
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,476
That girl's brother...

128
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,812
(Naito) Meet! (members) Yes

129
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,816
(Kamiyama) We'll definitely win the Kanto League this year →

130
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,985
You'll definitely win by preparing for the final battle with the next International University!

131
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,987
(Members) Yes!

132
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,989
(Kamiyama) So let's close the captain (Naito) Ugh →

133
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,991
I'm so busy! (The members) Thank you for your hard work!

134
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,661
Well, I think there's still more to do until the game →

135
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,163
I did my best and was in the best condition... Okay! We'll gather information too

136
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,165
(Members) Yes! Uzaki

137
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:50,002
Should you bring this to the parent's information session?

138
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,307
Don't do anything unnecessary

139
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,817
Haa

140
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,489
The venue for the information session is here →

141
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,825
Thank you very much, the information session is here

142
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,662
The information session venue is here The information session venue is here

143
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,003
But it's next

144
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,006
If you beat International University, you'll win

145
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,475
He's the strongest of all time Nishida-san →

146
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:34,313
Hayato-kun has become a good player (Nishida) No, there's still a long way to go →

147
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,983
You have to become a player that will make your team win

148
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,986
Are you mentally unstable about your big brother?

149
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,489
Don't worry because the game is near

150
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,491
it's okay

151
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:49,495
I'm telling him to concentrate on rugby.

152
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:57,169
(Okura) This time, some of the things on the Internet →

153
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:01,140
It seems they are being told to do whatever they want

154
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,310
I am the chairman

155
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,648
This tradition has been created together with you! →

156
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:12,985
I don't think it's that easy to shake

157
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,656
It's okay. Chairman: Article like that doesn't bother you!

158
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,658
That's right! That's right!

159
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,660
(Applause and voices of support)

160
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,829
(Whisper) What is this

161
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,831
thank you

162
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,634
So, from the lawyer, what happened this time?

163
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,305
We will explain what we will do in the future

164
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,476
(Matsumoto) I'm Matsumoto, a lawyer →

165
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,480
In response to this incident, we quickly set up a research team within the university →

166
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,482
I have created a report →

167
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,819
I will report the results of that

168
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:54,660
Are you all from the rugby club? Is it okay to have a little time?

169
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,996
Are you from the media? Yeah

170
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:01,334
If you'd like, I'd like to hear about Nishida Mato's story.

171
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,636
(Souto) There's nothing to say

172
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,806
It's an important game so please keep quiet

173
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,975
(Naito) Hey, let's go, yes

174
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,815
I've been taught completely

175
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,817
Well, of course

176
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:21,988
I guess it's strict directly on the members, what should I do?

177
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,990
Huh, really? (Takaido) Yes →

178
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,492
You can just make a fuss in the VIP room or something like that.

179
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,995
(Female college students) Eh!

180
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,164
After all, cheerleader clubs are gorgeous, isn't it? Again

181
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,166
No, they're really cute kids

182
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,168
I want to fill in the floor

183
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,805
That guy is really

184
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,975
It's going well I'm doing a good job

185
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,979
Isn't it too much? Is it okay?

186
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,983
Is that okay?

187
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,487
Survey results

188
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,822
There was no fact that could be found to be bullying.

189
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,824
Apparently it was good

190
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,661
Everyone, please rest assured →

191
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,996
That's all for the report

192
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,666
Huh? Is it over already?

193
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:11,170
So if you have any questions from parents...

194
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,642
everyone! Let's fight together!

195
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,644
(Applause and voices of support)

196
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,652
Um!

197
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,488
question! Is that okay?

198
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,661
The internal investigation

199
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:40,166
Specifically, how was it done?

200
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,168
(It's getting disgusted)

201
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,638
The event was mainly conducted on campus listening.

202
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,307
Who are you targeting?

203
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,310
What kind of listening did you hear?

204
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,813
Personally identifiable information cannot be disclosed

205
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,148
Please understand

206
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,151
(It's getting disgusted)

207
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,490
Ah, okay, big brother →

208
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,826
The next match is the biggest!

209
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:10,996
No matter what kind of game it is, I don't think it's more important than life's problem.

210
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,500
It could have been a life lost to bullying!

211
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,469
There must have been a report that there was no bullying!

212
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,804
No, it's weird to just decide that

213
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,307
So is the school lying?

214
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,810
If you take a lighter look at our traditions, I'm not sure, you bastard!

215
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,981
What if a person dies because of that tradition? ah?

216
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,984
Don't you feel sick of applause?

217
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,986
What kind of nerve do you have?

218
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,988
What is it, you bastard! ah?

219
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,157
What are you doing? Please stop for a moment! →

220
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,159
a little bit! Please stop

221
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,995
Without even a proper investigation, there was no bullying?

222
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,164
Don't be kidding! Isn't it your convenience?

223
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,801
What is this guy! One person is about to die!

224
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,171
Sorry for taking up the trouble

225
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,641
It's cheap if the parents agree

226
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,643
I'll try to put out the fire soon

227
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,812
Please at an important time

228
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,482
I can't spread any more rumors

229
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,318
What? Kamiyama-kun

230
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:10,156
We will ensure that players do not get any noise.

231
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,324
(knock)

232
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,494
please! Come in

233
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,809
We spoke to people who seem to have a connection with the rugby club, mainly to the point of contact →

234
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,812
Everyone invites to club events, and their way of doing things is frivolous

235
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,648
It's easier to get information in places where it's freed

236
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,650
Thank you for your hard work

237
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,653
How many injuries are you?

238
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,823
Your chin is snuggled, Uzaki, why?

239
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,494
I'm in trouble with an alumni of the rugby club

240
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,997
I've only given one instruction, don't do anything unnecessary

241
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,999
What... Why did you get into it?

242
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,336
It's not a suicide, it's just a matter of worrying about the next match, so it's weird.

243
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,005
So then a fight? Ha... That's right

244
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,142
Mix in the midst of that alumni, put your palm bottom in your chin

245
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,144
teeth…

246
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,147
Have you all got any harvest?

247
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,983
Just now Takaido has succeeded in picking up girls.

248
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:15,154
Huh? What are you doing while I'm being beaten?

249
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,156
Damn it...

250
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:21,660
If they were going to hide them, I wouldn't let them go

251
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,664
(Souto) Thank you for the meal

252
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,168
Sadou

253
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:34,306
I think you know, but don't forget that you all are hoping for it and supporting us.

254
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,308
I know

255
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,646
Now, don't think about unnecessary things, just concentrate on the game →

256
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:44,650
The future will change depending on whether you can get this

257
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,652
(Souto) Yes

258
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,654
I'll definitely win

259
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,491
(Singing voice leaks)

260
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,661
Why is it karaoke?

261
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:59,832
Noisy places are great for cleverness.

262
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,501
You can bring it in (Asami)

263
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:06,305
I've got the list I want so I'll send it

264
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,975
As expected, wouldn't you beg too casually? →

265
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,979
It's not as easy as you might think it would be to get information from the police.

266
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,315
It's always helpful

267
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,484
That's bad for me

268
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,153
It's a huge misunderstanding but I'll ignore it

269
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,823
This time it was information about a different department, so it must have been difficult.

270
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,326
For me, it's always bad

271
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:31,830
I'm persistent, I'm just moving for my purposes

272
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,001
Be sure to handle it carefully

273
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:39,638
Do you want to follow this from here? Takaido will do something about it

274
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,808
He's strong in the underworld (Asami)

275
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,978
So what's going on?

276
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,980
The newcomer is

277
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,316
I'm gonna...

278
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,985
Maybe I'll wait and see first

279
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,323
Wow...

280
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,494
Nishida Hayato, right? Who is it?

281
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,496
My name is Uzaki, a lawyer.

282
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:08,334
I want to hear a little about you, my brother

283
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:12,004
I don't want to wait and make a fuss

284
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,474
But if your brother is now due to bullying

285
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,643
I definitely don't want to leave it alone

286
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,147
My brother didn't have any practice

287
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,316
That's all

288
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,987
Maybe they'll give up everything because practice is tough?

289
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,489
I lost to myself

290
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,325
The weaker ones can remain

291
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,495
It's not a sweet world →

292
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,331
It's a game where everyone's future is crucial

293
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,167
You definitely have to win

294
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,470
Don't get in the way anymore

295
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,355
Is this one?

296
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,195
(Iiyama) Ah...

297
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,364
Where is it? Mato-kun

298
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,834
(Iiyama) Um!

299
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
yeah?

300
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,175
(ECG monitor sound)

301
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:29,515
It saved me, tell me the hospital room

302
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,850
Why did you call me?

303
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,686
I saw it once at school

304
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,022
Ah yes

305
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,359
Today... Are you visiting Mato?

306
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,361
yes

307
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,364
Ah, um... why the lawyer?

308
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,201
I want to clear his regret

309
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,203
To do so, first

310
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:55,174
I want to know the truth about what happened to Mato-kun.

311
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,177
Makoto is already...

312
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,179
I can't speak

313
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,182
Yeah

314
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:07,853
So I want to take a good look at my face

315
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:13,025
And I wanted to tell you that I'll definitely bring it to light...

316
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:16,528
It's impossible, what's the truth from that rugby club →

317
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,530
I don't think it's coming out

318
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,200
It certainly has a distorted atmosphere

319
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,671
The information session was also a bit unfair

320
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,174
Ah... maybe the rugby club?

321
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,512
Already... I've stopped

322
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,017
What is this incredible information?

323
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:42,187
As expected from Ryoko, you can be reliable

324
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:46,024
No, thank you! I was scolded for begging too much

325
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,360
Fuja, based on this guy →

326
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,696
I'll try and follow it on my side, please

327
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,700
Okay, it seems like we can keep up the strategy.

328
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,202
Well, if there's no irregularity

329
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,204
Irregular...

330
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,173
What about Uzaki?

331
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:05,677
Come on... rave reviews Isn't it just a thrust into the air?

332
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,180
It's a story I can't forgive

333
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,016
Don't be fooled by licking people's lives

334
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,854
Ah... sorry

335
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,359
Thank you so much for talking

336
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,362
Your story is a valuable testimony

337
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,697
Thanks to that, I think I can move forward

338
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,669
I can't get over what I ran away →

339
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,839
I might never move forward again

340
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,342
So →

341
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,346
I hope that at least clears up Mato's remorse

342
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,851
Please please

343
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,522
Leave it to me

344
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,860
I've decided not to allow this kind of thing

345
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,673
(Uzaki leaves the room)

346
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,344
Look

347
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,680
What are you talking about? Calm down once

348
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,182
Anyway, I'm going to the Nishida family now

349
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,185
It's no good anymore... Todoroki-san doesn't seem to stop

350
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,187
Let's go now is fine

351
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,023
Eh, not good! I'll stay there and seriously

352
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,360
I'll be there soon, so don't move!

353
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,362
Yes

354
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,031
Ah, it's annoying

355
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,369
I'm coming!

356
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,338
Please!

357
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,840
(Bike engine sound)

358
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,348
You, let's think about it a little and act

359
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,017
Huh? Have you heard it? Share some information

360
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,019
Let me go and talk early

361
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,021
Damn cheeky!

362
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,735
Sorry, I suddenly came over

363
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,237
Let's fight this case in court

364
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,239
What to do to tame

365
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,242
There's no way that can be done before an important match

366
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,578
This means that Mato-kun was not affected.

367
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,913
Is this also proof that he was victimized?

368
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,916
Why... are you on that side?

369
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,086
Uzaki Let's calm down once, there's no way parents can overlook bullying their children!

370
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,255
It's a hoax! That kind of thing!

371
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:35,560
Is it okay? In the unlikely event that you and the idiots on the internet actually have a rumor about it →

372
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,562
What happens when you sue that?

373
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,898
The section is just gone

374
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,234
Mato-kun is...

375
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:45,237
I'm still asleep

376
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:49,574
I'm asleep because I can't tell anyone what I think

377
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:54,413
(Nishida) Mato couldn't be helped... he was weak

378
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,749
Can't you do it? Did you say it seriously now?

379
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,752
(Nishida) No matter what anyone says, the answer is the same!

380
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,255
Please come back already

381
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,257
Go home!

382
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,564
(Masako) Please don't come again

383
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:16,234
My husband's thoughts remain the same

384
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,571
Is it okay to ask one?

385
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,573
yes

386
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,243
Mato-kun... Have you left a suicide note?

387
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,581
I've asked a painful question

388
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,917
very sorry

389
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,087
I'm inevitably worried

390
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,423
Our wish is

391
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:42,094
It's not just about clearing up Mato-kun's regrets

392
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:45,397
When Mato-kun wakes up in the future

393
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,400
I think I'm going to need money too

394
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,402
from now on…

395
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,572
I hope to be able to help you a little

396
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,077
There are no suicide notes

397
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:02,914
At least in this house

398
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,084
(Masako) Excuse me

399
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:11,256
(Door opening and closing sound)

400
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,258
Will? yes

401
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,561
Is that obviously a way of saying that?

402
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,563
I see

403
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,904
That's it

404
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,906
How did you know that?

405
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:31,410
Ah... take action calmly

406
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,080
Psychological stress and anxiety can be seen in gestures

407
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,750
It came out twice when you were having a relationship with your father

408
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,752
The word "proof" and

409
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,723
React to words like, "I can't express my feelings to anyone."

410
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:48,727
All I can associate from that is... a suicide note

411
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,564
That's amazing

412
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,233
I looked at all that in detail

413
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,069
If the will comes out, it's going to be a big card

414
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,907
I've also got testimony from my best friend

415
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,912
I'm going to go on a fight

416
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,753
(knock)

417
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,255
Excuse me

418
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,724
What kind of thing is this for you?

419
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,727
This is the bullying of Nishida Mato

420
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:26,231
You're the one who's as rumored, please stop mucha.

421
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,233
What's the mucha?

422
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,903
We are entrusted by Nishida Mato's mother.

423
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:35,740
(Matsumoto) That's not possible, why do you think so?

424
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,410
No, I have not received a notification of acceptance

425
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,414
Ah, I think it'll arrive tomorrow

426
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,083
If so, I'll ask you again as soon as I receive the notification.

427
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,419
Apparently you have a suicide note

428
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,588
Written by Mato

429
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:55,393
My mother asked me that she left it at school

430
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,738
Can you confirm it?

431
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,415
How did you get to me?

432
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:22,087
Hmm, is it a cooperation between the information network at the part-time job and the national power?

433
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,723
Don't be fooled, what is the power of the state?

434
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,893
I'm not trying to have you in peace, because I don't want to fuck you

435
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,895
(Tongue tapping)

436
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,898
You can't do anything, yes

437
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,734
So, will you take a look at this first?

438
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,248
(Masato) Let's go

439
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,724
Souto, I'll raise my pace, I can't do it

440
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,726
Hey wait, big brother

441
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,398
Big Brother

442
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,567
(Makoto) Hayato, run more

443
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,736
You have great taste unlike me →

444
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,906
If you have the body, you can become an amazing player

445
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,908
surely

446
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,411
Big brother is not good just because of his physical strength

447
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,247
You... Souto, you're cheeky

448
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:40,732
What are you guys thinking until now?

449
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,401
Showing the will means

450
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,905
Are you going to admit that there was bullying?

451
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,075
There is no mention of the school's involvement here →

452
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,410
In the first place, there is no mention of bullying

453
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,412
I wanted to check that

454
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,748
So why did you hide it?

455
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,251
It's because it's inconvenient

456
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:04,089
Until the parents kept things they had taken care of

457
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,894
I have many thoughts on whether to take it or attack it

458
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,731
How shall we proceed?

459
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:16,901
For the sake of the players, there will be even more damage to the rumors...

460
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,903
I want to avoid it

461
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,905
Don't be kidding

462
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,075
Would you like to negotiate a settlement?

463
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,077
Todoroki-san!

464
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,583
I refuse

465
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,888
I'm glad you refused, is it okay?

466
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,557
I was so bluffed even though I wasn't entrusted to my parents

467
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,726
It's not okay It's illegal for now

468
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,728
That's right, it's illegal

469
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,730
Huh?

470
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,733
That lawyer is desperately trying to confirm with his parents.

471
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,903
Maybe it's been discovered that it's a lie now. Yes, that's bad, isn't it?

472
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,073
It's bad, so persuade your parents as soon as possible

473
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,409
You have to really turn the lie over

474
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,078
Please, Uzaki, no, me?

475
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,580
What if you can't turn it over?

476
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,582
That's the end

477
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:08,253
A fire that's firmly thrusts!

478
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:13,425
Huh? That's messed up, you...

479
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,732
A university lawyer explained it over the phone →

480
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,068
Apparently your way is illegal

481
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,905
I apologize for taking the slightly wrong way

482
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,074
Then go home!

483
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,877
There's something I really want my parents to see

484
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,547
Which side are you talking about?

485
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:41,052
You guys found this suicide note, right?

486
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,725
Why help cover up?

487
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,729
The word bullying is not used here at all.

488
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,398
That's Mato's kindness

489
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,235
Seeing something like this, I'll take it in

490
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,405
Why can you squeeze it over? ?

491
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,409
Because I'm a parent

492
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,711
I'm a parent so I can hide it

493
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:10,215
I don't know what you're talking about! It's for Souto's future!

494
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,718
That's the same feeling, so don't you understand that? ?

495
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,721
(Door opens)

496
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,226
father

497
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,228
What's going on now?

498
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,730
Hayato... (Nishida) You should go down

499
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,734
What is the suicide note... your big brother?

500
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,740
Souto-kun's older brother was suffering from harsh bullying.

501
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,410
Don't do anything you like! This suicide note

502
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,048
Relaxation for pain and unfulfilled dreams

503
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,384
and

504
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:50,054
His feelings for his younger brother are written...

505
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,892
(Drop the bag)

506
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,894
To me?

507
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:04,235
Mato-kun, don't destroy your future

508
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,739
I kept quiet and endured the bullying

509
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:12,076
But at the very end my heart runs out

510
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,078
He settled himself

511
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,548
(Shumbling)

512
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,723
Why did you hide your suicide note?

513
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,562
Hey

514
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,400
I'm successful with this

515
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,902
There's no way I'm happy!

516
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,240
(Crossing from my knees)

517
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,214
Souto-kun

518
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,717
You couldn't face this fact

519
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,887
There may be a variety of circumstances

520
00:30:55,887 --> 00:31:00,225
But you must have felt it too

521
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,561
It's cruel but

522
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,898
You're one of the people who pretended not to see

523
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,568
Maybe it's too late

524
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:13,238
nevertheless

525
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,875
I think you should take the right action now.

526
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,051
Lawyer

527
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,225
I…

528
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,062
I want to sue

529
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,391
Violence against Nishida Mato was rampant within the club.

530
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,895
(Chapter) Yes, Mato was actually injured a lot.

531
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,564
When was such assault taking place?

532
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,566
I'm practicing

533
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,736
Put your knees in a crowded play or hit them with your elbow →

534
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,072
I've seen it many times up close

535
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:58,076
If there is obvious violence during practice, someone around you will notice it, right?

536
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,378
(Chapter) I was surrounded by a group and hurting me so I couldn't see

537
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,081
Isn't that common during play?

538
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,049
(Member) That's true, but...

539
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,051
But in Mato's case... so

540
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:11,222
Can you show that it is bullying? it is…

541
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:14,392
That means it's not a clear understanding →

542
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,394
That's all

543
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,899
Iiyama-san You are a close friend of Mato-kun.

544
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,902
Apparently he was always nearby

545
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:28,873
Was there any bullying against you and Mato?

546
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,876
yes

547
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,712
Who was leading the way?

548
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:39,384
This is Captain Naito Shota

549
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,887
On the ground, and during weight training,

550
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,724
I was hit with lots of belt fittings around my waist

551
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,727
Please tell me what you've been committed other than assault

552
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:56,067
(Iiyama) My jersey and uniforms get soaked before practice →

553
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,737
Spikes urine

554
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:04,709
Does that mean they couldn't escape violence?

555
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,378
I quit the club →

556
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,883
But Mato has his younger brother, Hayato →

557
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,218
I don't think I wanted to run away →

558
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,220
I was always bragging

559
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,724
My younger brother started playing rugby because he admired me →

560
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,894
So it won't end up being uncool

561
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,896
After quitting the rugby club

562
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,232
Have you ever had any advice from Mato?

563
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,903
Just once before committing suicide

564
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,239
Can you tell me what's going on at that time?

565
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,543
"I can't hold it all"

566
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,711
I was saying

567
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,549
What does "can't hold it all" mean?

568
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:49,887
I don't know what I can say, but I can't hold it all together

569
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,889
I was crying

570
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,891
Finally

571
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:57,395
Could you tell me where you often went to play with Mato?

572
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:01,065
Have you ever been to a night club, for example?

573
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,068
No, I've never been to that place

574
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,572
is that so

575
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,074
Presiding Judge That's all

576
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,544
(President Judge) will take a break here for about 10 minutes.

577
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,547
(Matsumoto) I'll be asking Mr. Kamiyama →

578
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:21,052
Do you think there was bullying within the rugby club at Toshu University?

579
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,054
I agree

580
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,223
Maybe there was...

581
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,725
(It's getting disgusted)

582
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,228
Is it your intention to know?

583
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:35,233
Yes, now that I think about it, I think there must have been bullying.

584
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,569
(Matsumoto) What is the just statement

585
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,072
The university neglected its duty of safety considerations to bear.

586
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,574
That's what it means

587
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,543
yes

588
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:50,214
I think I, the director, had neglected it.

589
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,383
(Heads fly around)

590
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:56,387
(President Judge) Quiet, quiet!

591
00:35:56,387 --> 00:36:01,225
I will show the suicide note written by Mato-kun, No. 2.

592
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,895
This suicide note was managed by the school.

593
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,397
Do you know that?

594
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:09,066
Yes I knew

595
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:13,070
So please tell us how the suicide note was passed to school.

596
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:18,075
Apparently it was their parents who first discovered the suicide note.

597
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:22,380
After seeing Mato-kun attempting suicide, his parents then

598
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,882
Read the will in the last mental state →

599
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,385
I was confused about how to handle it →

600
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,387
And the kids... →

601
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:32,723
No, worrying about the future of the rugby club →

602
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,726
He left it at the university

603
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,729
For your parents' wise decision

604
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,065
{Thank you}

605
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:45,236
《We can't hold it all together》

606
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:49,240
"This is a delicate question, so can you please refrain from mentioning it? 》

607
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,543
He intentionally concealed the will.

608
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,379
...Do you accept that?

609
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,050
There was a lot of that kind of awareness

610
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,052
(It's getting disgusted)

611
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,890
I'll come to Coach Kamiyama

612
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,061
You've never consistently admitted bullying, right?

613
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,730
Yes, the statement

614
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,066
I didn't know about bullying

615
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,402
It says it does not constitute a violation of the duty to be taken into consideration.

616
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,873
He has now made statements that he has changed his claims and admitted.

617
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,875
Why is that?

618
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:29,547
Because I heard Iiyama-kun's comments earlier

619
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,883
It's true that I'm trying to fulfill my long-cherished wishes at university →

620
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,219
Just think about winning →

621
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,389
I couldn't stand with the feelings of the sub-members.

622
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,059
I was wrong, I'm not qualified as a leader

623
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:48,065
Ah, Kamiyama-san

624
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,402
Please keep the monkey play around with that

625
00:37:55,239 --> 00:38:00,077
There is a clever calculation in today's testimony, right?

626
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,213
What is it about?

627
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:07,218
Some students in the rugby club use special painkillers.

628
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:09,720
Is this true?

629
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,557
It is a narcotic painkiller that prevents pain

630
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,560
It is originally intended for treatment

631
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,564
It is a very highly addictive and dangerous drug

632
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,901
It was originally used within the rugby club for medical purposes, but

633
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,904
Eventually, the players surrender to pleasure.

634
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:30,408
The number of addicted people increased in the fourth grade, isn't it?

635
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,077
Objection! There is no connection between the question and this matter!

636
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,213
The real darkness you all have is not bullying

637
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,215
It was a student's drug use

638
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,217
(It's getting disgusted)

639
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:42,219
So change your argument

640
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,389
Are they trying to close the lawsuit in order to admit bullying?

641
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,559
The judge! Why hide it like that

642
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,397
Is it wrong because universities continue to receive 5 billion yen subsidies from the government?

643
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:55,399
(Heads fly around)

644
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,401
(Judge) Stay quiet!

645
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:01,238
And then he brought the medicine to Mato.

646
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,876
That's the most insane bullying

647
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:09,080
Mato-kun made that a pain... it's a delusion!

648
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,382
Until now, there's nothing like this anywhere

649
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,384
Is it also evidence?

650
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,389
Is it proof?

651
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,895
{So, will you take a look at this first? 》

652
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,567
{(Takaido) Does anyone know who is familiar to you? 》

653
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,570
{I can't say it} {Ah, yes}

654
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,873
{Then I might take a look at this too}

655
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,709
"You're also a list of drug dealers on the list →

656
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,711
{I'd be fine to scatter this one though}

657
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,713
《(Tongue click)》

658
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,717
{There are several people who know about it} {Thank you}

659
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,719
{Then someone please tell me

660
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,722
{This and...}

661
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,891
{And this} {Yes}

662
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,560
{It's already enough, give me money quickly}

663
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,230
{I'll still have one more... I'll trade with them}

664
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,732
{I would like you to specify the date and location}

665
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,403
{Date is 1am on the 22nd →}

666
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,405
《Location is...》

667
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,407
{(The music resonates)}

668
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:14,245
{I'll check again, first take a picture of the moment of the transaction with a hidden camera}

669
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,548
{Then contact me and hold the actual medicine} {Agree}

670
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,550
"learn"

671
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,729
{There's no doubt about it.}

672
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,731
{It also matches the information of (Takaido) person}

673
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,400
{Let's make the deal as is} {Ugh}

674
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,406
"What's wrong with Uzaki? 》 《Uzaki Can you hear it? 》

675
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,408
{What are you doing, Uzaki} {Uzaki Uzaki! 》

676
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,244
{Wait a minute, Uzaki} {Ahh, what are you doing? That guy really?}

677
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,881
《Todoroki-san, Todoroki-san! 》 《Uzaki Stop! 》

678
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,717
"Uzaki! quickly! 》

679
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,727
"Hey! These shits

680
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,898
"What are you coming in without permission? 》

681
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,234
{Uh! 》

682
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,236
{OK} {Oh!} 》

683
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,049

"I! 》 《Uh...》

688

{Uhh...}

689
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,236
{Cuckoo...}

690
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,072
{Hey... ah}

691
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,408
{You're heavy, you're...}

{I'm drowning in something like this} {Uzaki! 》

00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:59,717
"Oh, I've captured the evidence"

695
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:03,387
The judges here provide evidence from what we just said...

696
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:08,559
The judge! I am offering a court withdrawal here, as I am extremely leaping from this case.

697
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,561
It's too late! The judge...

698
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,897
The judge!

699
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:16,734
We will also be offering a temporary suspension from this side.

700
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,404
picture?

701
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,073
(Tap the desk) Why did you agree to the settlement? ?

702
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:26,544
Also, if I had given the evidence, I would have won completely!

703
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:30,381
win? What is the state of winning?

704
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,051
It's all about revealing it and winning the trial!

705
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,555
But if you exposed your medicine

706
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,891
After the rugby club has ended, that girl's future has also been cut off.

707
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,562
There's no point in swallowing the damage and doing that was a success!

708
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:48,732
Don't force your will on the plaintiff, you idiot!

709
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:52,403
Which is the idiot? Are you kidding? ?

710
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,738
I'm not kidding

711
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,242
I'm always serious

712
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,545
{This trial}

713
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,214
"What do you want as a family? 》

714
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,216
"What do you say?" 》

715
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:09,053
"Can we just end the bullying pursuit?"

716
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,722
"Will they even pursue medicine?"

717
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,391
"No matter how much Mato himself is forced to do it."

718
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,394
"I kept refusing the drug"

719
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,230
{But, inevitably...}

720
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,735
"The public is exposed to being a drug carrier."

721
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,404
{Yeah, well, the courier}

722
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,740
{Because it was forced to do it}

723
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,544
"I will always protect Mato's honor"

724
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:38,382
"Should I just have them all pursued? 》

725
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,887
"Souto-kun, what do you want to do? 》

726
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:49,560
{It's true that my brother was involved in something wrong →}

727
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,062
{But if I hear it's forced}

728
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,898
{I don't know what the answer is...→}

729
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,234
{But it's clear}

730
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,903
If my brother wakes up

731
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,874
"I want to play rugby again together."

732
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:11,215
{(Souto) He wrote that here}

733
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,885
{Because I'm the same thing →}

734
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,721
"That's a convenient story, isn't it?"

735
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,723
"What should I do?"

736
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,730
{I have a suggestion}

737
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,568
This is the best choice

738
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:34,071
I will not accept any complaints

739
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:38,709
That's fine now I don't need this anymore

740
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,711
Will you quit?

741
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,713
Haa...

742
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:49,053
However, that's not the case

743
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:56,226
You're already in my palm

744
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,900
It's the sea~ What will you do if you listen to foreign trainees?

745
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,071
Are they haunted? Please let me know if there's anything hidden in the ocean
