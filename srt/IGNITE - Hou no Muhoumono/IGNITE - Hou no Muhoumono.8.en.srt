{(Yoshino) What do you want to hear? 》 《(Todoroki) Everything you know》

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,809
{It's better not to thrust your head in there, so there are a lot of things there...

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,479
{It's fine, say it all! 》

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,647
"I'm tired of listening this one."

5
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,649
"That advice is"

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,322
(Takaido) GI Technologies? Does that company's system have been on that bus?

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,824
Yes, and not just that

8
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,660
At the time, it was still a small venture company.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,499
Apparently they were rushing to develop autonomous driving with the support of the government.

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:37,003
"The development speed of GI Technologies at the time was abnormal even from the outside."

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,006
"I guess they wanted to do a test run early."

12
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,642
《Test run? 》 《Automatic driving》

13
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,812
{The more actual driving data you have, the more accurate it becomes.

14
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,481
"That's why we're rushing to test drive on public roads."

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,818
《What else? There's something you still know.

16
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,988
"Stop that assassin's eyes"

17
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:02,662
"The rest is that the government has given you a huge subsidy."

18
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,999
"There are many mobility venture companies."

19
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,668
"I heard that the president has a political world and the pipeline."

20
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,337
Politics? What is a pipe? 》

21
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,807
{I don't know that much}

22
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,646
(Uzaki) So, this GI Technologies has something to do with the company.

23
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,316
This company focuses on AI technology

24
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:28,655
They have a wide range of tasks such as autonomous driving of cars and hospital operation systems →

25
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,991
A recent example of the implementation is Suzukiya Motors →

26
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,661
Toa Hospital Yotsuba Shinkin Bank

27
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,164
(Inoo) Ah, wait a minute, Toa Hospital...

28
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,667
Huh? yeah?

29
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,836
Ah, what's wrong after all?

30
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:47,006
Ah, I received a consultation from the family of a medical malpractice that occurred last month at Toa Hospital.

31
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,476
Seriously you were planning to listen to this week?

32
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,479
I would normally take it but now the situation is...

33
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,815
No, let's do it, I don't want to go either, but now the accident is the priority, right?

34
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,818
But if the company is involved in GI Technologies at the hospital

35
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:02,989
Maybe they'll get indirectly closer, don't pester right away, is it a wild boar?

36
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,492
That's why it's no use to be a daze here

37
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:10,330
That may be true, too. The East Asia Hospital is a hospital that is popular with politicians.

38
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,999
Maybe there's something

39
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,803
Well, certainly there might be something

40
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,506
yes

41
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,143
Some people see this and are happy if there's a donut here?

42
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,812
But if someone else sees the same thing

43
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,149
I feel pessimistic that there is a hole in this place

44
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,318
Do you understand what this means? Is it philosophy or something?

45
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,323
The future changes depending on how you view things.

46
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,829
It's okay to go

47
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,165
Hmm, well, that's what it is

48
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,335
Yes well

49
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,473
You're the type to be happy with your dog

50
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,816
(Residence) Thank you for coming

51
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,486
Thank you for your disappointment about your family

52
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:10,990
I think it's a difficult situation, but could you please tell me the details?

53
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,493
yes

54
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,329
On March 10th, my father

55
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,333
I had surgery for a cerebral aneurysm at Toa Hospital

56
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,835
I was fine as soon as I had surgery

57
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,506
Two days later, I had subarachnoid hemorrhage...

58
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,477
(Residence) I was still 58...

59
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,813
What kind of explanation would you give from the hospital?

60
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,316
The surgery was a success

61
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:40,987
Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred after surgery, far from the treatment site.

62
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,323
Is the surgery successful?

63
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,492
So you think that Sumin is a medical malpractice?

64
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,163
I don't know what's true either

65
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:56,336
My uneasy feeling hasn't cleared up forever...

66
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,338
So what about your mother?

67
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,640
I haven't told my mother

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,978
I'm sure if I said I'd sue the hospital, I'd be against it.

69
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,313
but…

70
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,818
Sorry

71
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,823
I'm convinced in my head...

72
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:22,495
I couldn't get the hospital's words to say when my father died...

73
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,665
{(Igari) After a sudden change in health, I had to go through a test immediately}

74
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:30,803
[Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred far from the area that was treated]

75
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,806
{As us}

76
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,175
"I can only think that I was unlucky."

77
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:41,314
It's something like a manual and it's just a matter of calm.

78
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:45,652
It wasn't even the surgeon, Dr. Kono, who was explaining it.

79
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:49,489
I mean my father has lost...

80
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,994
Hmm, something is wrong, what do you think?

81
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:58,665
I don't know the truth yet, but something's offended

82
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,000
Huh? Because

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,504
I wouldn't be able to forgive him if he said that his family had died

84
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,641
Continue the investigation

85
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,643
ah

86
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,821
Wow, it's quite big yeah

87
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,158
As expected from politicians, what information about the surgeon?

88
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,495
The surgery was performed by a neurosurgeon, Kono Ryohei

89
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,498
Apparently, he is the youngest department head of this hospital

90
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,501
In fact, he'll help you in the end

91
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,805
It's no use to be as daze as this person said

92
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:42,642
Takaido: After all, the character has changed, right? Ah, I would never have come before

93
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,645
Let's go split

94
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,483
Are you going?

95
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,985
Something is so enthusiastic, I'm breathing so hard

96
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,488
Is Dr. Kono such an incredible doctor?

97
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:59,826
(Hayashi) That's right, he's called a famous neurosurgeon around here.

98
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:04,497
But the other day a patient passed away, right? Was the surgery a successful?

99
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:08,501
Well, brain diseases are scary (multiple footsteps)

100
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,803
Ah, that's Professor Kono

101
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:14,807
(Kono) Hello (Hayashi) Do you want to ask Dr. Kono for surgery?

102
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,809
I'll be waiting a few months

103
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,480
Are you waiting that long? It looks like a restaurant where you can't make a reservation

104
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,150
Because Kono-sensei is the poster doctor here.

105
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,153
(Whispering) Come here Come next conference From what time?

106
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,989
Well, it's 2pm (whispering) Thank you for your hard work

107
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,993
Hayashi-san, what are you doing?

108
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,162
Ah, I can't go, can't I go for an inspection?

109
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,164
Ah, thank you so much, that's right

110
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,166
No, sorry, take care

111
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,335
Excuse me

112
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,341
How was your fatigue?

113
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:53,646
What I learned from here is that Dr. Kono is quite popular and busy.

114
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:59,318
Also, doctors really walk like "white towers."

115
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,821
Right, that's it?

116
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,158
Please check the main castle more carefully

117
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,494
This hospital is definitely in the hospital, GI Technologies

118
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:13,166
Apparently the director who had installed the operational system was decided by the decision.

119
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,335
Seriously? I was able to hear that well

120
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,638
Well, I'm good at collecting information.

121
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,175
Ahhhh I heard from the nurse

122
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,144
Is it hard to get from the system manager?

123
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,647
I can do it but... but?

124
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,983
Huh? Kiriishi-san!

125
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,986
Huh? Ah

126
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,988
(Kiriishi) Why are you guys here?

127
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,158
Ah no, I'm looking into the hospital here now

128
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,994
What? Kiriishi-san is here why?

129
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,668
(Aya) Nice to meet you, Aya, Nice to meet you

130
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,003
Everyone at Todoroki's office?

131
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,474
Yes, I'm always very grateful to Kiriishi-san.

132
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,009
I have so much to ask, and nothing comes up

133
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,978
I know that

134
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,980
Sorry, suddenly while in hospital

135
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,151
It's okay, it's okay, I've always said that I'd let this person meet a colleague

136
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,987
I'll be hospitalized for the surgery next month.

137
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,323
Are you hospitalized for an examination? yes

138
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,325
Do you know that a cerebral aneurysm?

139
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,995
Aya is fine, it's not something to hide

140
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,499
Part of the artery in the brain is expanding like a balloon

141
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,001
And if it gets too big...

142
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,170
Pan! That's it

143
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,339
Are you okay

144
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,175
I'll do the surgery to prevent this from happening

145
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,311
This guy always looks like this

146
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,481
You didn't say that as if I was going to die

147
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,984
You're generally taking your illness too lightly

148
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,486
I'm not thinking it's light

149
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,156
I'm sick, so if you get such a painful face

150
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,493
What's cured will no longer be cured!

151
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,829
It's so painful...

152
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,333
Is that the surgery perhaps Dr. Kono?

153
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,003
Yes, why did you know?

154
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,473
Oh no, ask me, "I'm the doctor who signs at this hospital."

155
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,477
Hmm, it seems my surgery is a little difficult

156
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,813
I was introduced to Professor Kono, who is experienced by an acquaintance.

157
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:12,318
Hey, you said you were investigating the hospital, but is this an incident?

158
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:18,491
Yes, the witness in the incident I am currently pursuing is currently hospitalized at this hospital.

159
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,497
Ah, I was surprised

160
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:28,501
That kind of Kiriishi-san is the first time I'm so excited

161
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,503
Stop it

162
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,473
Actually, it's Dr. Kono, Aya's surgery.

163
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,475
Wasn't you okay with not saying that?

164
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,978
Noooo I can't say it

165
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,981
What should I do? Are you going to continue investigating Kono's case?

166
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:48,487
So, in the first place, didn't you trace the system company from this hospital?

167
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,489
oh dear

168
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,997
Did you meet Aya?

169
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,166
Ah yes by chance

170
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:06,505
I thought I was doing well, but I never thought I was hospitalized.

171
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:10,309
What's more, depending on the situation, it's Toa Hospital...

172
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:14,146
You know Todoroki-san, Aya-san very well

173
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,649
Aya and Kiriishi

174
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,819
I was working there too, because I met him at my previous office.

175
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,822
《Paulownia stone》What do you think after this? 》 《Today is dinner with Aya》

176
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,491
"You said that last week too."

177
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,994
"Which is more important, the peer you occasionally invite? 》

178
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,496
"It's Aya and I'm a downdoor."

179
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,832
{Yes, yes, that's right}

180
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,168
"That tie, kitten? 》

181
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,805
"Is it bad? I got it to Aya

182
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,008
{No, I'm not saying it's bad though}

183
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,010
{First} {Oh}

184
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,980
That guy was Aya's number one ever since

185
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,985
What are you going to do about the hospital?

186
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,155
Hmm

187
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,824
No, I don't know yet

188
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:05,331
As a friend, I would like Aya to have surgery.

189
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,668
But Kono is a doctor

190
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,004
If you were as you stared at...

191
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,007
It's all complicated

192
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,009
yes

193
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,318
(Sayuri) Will you suing the hospital with Dr.?

194
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,989
Oh no, it's still a possibility

195
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,324
Please wait, that's not what I'd sue...

196
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,660
Mom, listen

197
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,329
I still don't agree

198
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,834
Professor Kono said he couldn't be satisfied with it, and he did his best.

199
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,170
To repay such a favor

200
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,006
Is Sayuri convinced?

201
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,475
I think that was my husband's destiny too.

202
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,811
destiny?

203
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,813
Dad was still 58

204
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:58,150
I know! However, other hospitals said to have had a difficult surgery.

205
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,154
If you blame someone who wasn't the teacher did it, you'll get hit with it.

206
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,156
But the hospital's explanation...

207
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,659
Stop it now!

208
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,161
It's fine now

209
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,998
I'm trying to accept my dad too

210
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,673
I think you were surprised by the sudden story

211
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,809
I'll be doing some more research here too

212
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,812
Let me talk again

213
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,989
Eh, this is a very rare case of a cerebral aneurysm.

214
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,159
It was held at my Toa Hospital the other day.

215
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,164
This is a case in which two aneurysms are attached and subarachnoid hemorrhage has been confirmed.

216
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,334
The size of the aneurysm is as follows:

217
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,669
Craniotomy will also be considered...

218
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,340
Cass... Casserter?

219
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,176
K-Catcher Technique...

220
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,312
(Funaki) It's not going to get it's not going to get it's not going to get it's not going to get it

221
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,648
Catheter catheter surgery and

222
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,651
Huh? I had to cut my head during cerebrovascular surgery

223
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,320
Thin catheter tubes are passed through the blood vessels.

224
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,324
Then use coil wire-like items from inside the tube.

225
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,827
How to perform surgery from inside the blood vessels

226
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,497
Passing the vessel through the blood vessel... What does it mean?

227
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:22,334
Unlike craniotomy, there are no scars left on the head.

228
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,171
The current trend in cerebrovascular surgery

229
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,173
Is that so?

230
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:32,478
There was no coil compaction and the aneurysm embolization was created as expected.

231
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,981
A sign doctor at Toa Hospital...

232
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,317
It's a great thing

233
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,655
It was really amazing, thank you very much

234
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:47,827
Isn't it a strange place? Doctors boast about their achievements

235
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,995
Well, the academic conference is

236
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:54,500
Doctors and hospitals can take mounts to get a bragging battle.

237
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,002
Do you know what doctor status is?

238
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,339
Is it something that doesn't fail? Yes I won't fail

239
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,642
It's a little old man, it's a drama story

240
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,644
Ah that

241
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,648
I'm doing a difficult surgery, I'm saying

242
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,651
It would be better to have a very difficult surgery

243
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,988
Doctors think that their achievements are big.

244
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,657
That's right, inside

245
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,328
There are even doctors who can only boast about surgery.

246
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,496
Something is stupid

247
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:28,334
Hehehe, you're a doctor, isn't he? A reporter?

248
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,336
No, I'm a lawyer

249
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,671
Be... Bebe... Lawyer? what

250
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,640
No, is it some kind of trial?

251
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,811
Ah, well, that's how it is a doctor?

252
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,313
(Impersonation of Uzaki) Well, that's how it is

253
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,649
No, why am I imitating it?

254
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,319
Is it a trial involving cerebral aneurysm surgery?

255
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,656
Yes, that's quite difficult

256
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,659
That's right, it's pretty much the doctors

257
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,329
I will not accept my mistake as medical malpractice

258
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,333
You're not going to make the one who ran with all your might in time

259
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,170
Would you blame him for making a mistake? No, if you're at full strength, you can't blame it

260
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,340
Hey, right? Doctors like that

261
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,809
If the results of the surgery are all the responsibility of the doctor

262
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,145
I'm going to have surgery so I'm not going to have a doctor

263
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,481
Yeah

264
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:19,485
Just a place far from the treatment area

265
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,488
Subarachnoid hemorrhage...

266
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:27,493
It's a bit of a problem with bad luck

267
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,331
This is my phone number

268
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,501
If you have anything you want to ask, please call me anytime.

269
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,503
Thank you very much

270
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,505
yes

271
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,993
Igari Sensei I'm this kind of person

272
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,331
Do you need something for me? Sorry all of a sudden

273
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,001
The doctor was in charge of Sumi Takashi's surgery, right?

274
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,812
Hey, are you looking for someone? Ha!

275
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,815
Ah, you don't have to talk the other day

276
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,484
Is there a reason why you can't stand it?

277
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,320
Ah, actually

278
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,322
I'm looking for this nurse

279
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,326
Ah, this guy is a operative nurse

280
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,162
I'm a specialist in surgery so I rarely see you.

281
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,666
Ah, I see, that's true

282
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,336
Could you please tell me more about the day of the surgery?

283
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,673
There's nothing more than what was written in the medical record, and the bereaved family is not convinced.

284
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,175
I will not answer

285
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,012
If you have any questions, please go to the hospital

286
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,154
Ah, it's no good, I couldn't bring it out

287
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,656
This one too

288
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,161
Besides Kono, he was involved in the surgery.

289
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,663
My junior, Dr. Igari

290
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,167
Nurses and two radiologists

291
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,169
And anesthesiologist

292
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,506
I have to get testimony from this person...

293
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,475
Only the surgical staff know the truth

294
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,311
That's why medical trials are difficult

295
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,982
With that face, does that feel like zero harvest?

296
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,651
How was Takaido like that?

297
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,821
I found one fray

298
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,657
I found only one (in a mimicking Takaido)

299
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,160
Fragment... It's not, tell me

300
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,497
{(Aizawa) What did you think about today's surgery? 》

301
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,499
{(Ishida) What do you mean? 》

302
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:51,170
{Didn't you forcefully proceed to the catheter? 》

303
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,340
{It also looked like the wire caught a blood vessel and injured it}

304
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,810
"I guess Kono-sensei said there's no problem."

305
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,812
"but…"

306
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:05,150
"I didn't even take a close look during the operation that I had time for a flight..."

307
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,986
《Don't underestimate anything unnecessary》

308
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,330
After all, the toilet is

309
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,666
It's a secret garden

310
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,335
It's about Sumin's surgery!

311
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,672
I'll check out Kono's schedule for the day

312
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,341
They've hid them after all

313
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:39,118
As I said the other day, we have no intention of sue.

314
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:44,790
Subarachnoid hemorrhage at a location far from the treatment site is not so easy

315
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,960
Mom, it's weird after all

316
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,629
You stay quiet, why are you going to shut up?

317
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,800
Hey dad is dead

318
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,471
Maybe he was still alive

319
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:07,613
Sayuri: During the procedure of the catheter from the hospital,

320
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,283
Did you not talk about the possibility that the blood vessels were damaged?

321
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,286
It wasn't there but...

322
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,955
What does it mean? The hospital

323
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,792
It may be hiding an accident that occurred during the surgery

324
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,794
Huh?

325
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,299
mother…

326
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,976
One thing I can think of...

327
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,445
what?

328
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:45,117
I talked to my husband who was in the hospital the day after the surgery.

329
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,619
At that time, I feel a headache

330
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,789
Did Takashi, who has a headache, say that?

331
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,958
What, why didn't you say it?

332
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,295
It wasn't like it was hiding it, it was postoperative pain, isn't it? If you say that

333
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,797
My dad said that too

334
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,466
He said he told the nurse to tell him.

335
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:05,137
What's the explanation from the hospital? There was none

336
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,140
He was very well after the surgery.

337
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,277
It is believed that Takashi had no symptoms that were experiencing.

338
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,113
Sayuri-san

339
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,950
Would you like to reveal the truth?

340
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,453
But... if you go to court

341
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,957
Can you win? To the doctor

342
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,960
Catheter surgery involves angiography

343
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,297
Moreover, Dr. Kono should have saved the video of the surgery for the presentation →

344
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:36,301
If you get it, you'll get closer to the truth

345
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,137
The feelings of both of you

346
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,974
Can you leave it to us?

347
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:51,617
Don't say "It's fine now"

348
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,624
mother

349
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:06,298
I want to sue

350
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,455
He is the enforcer of the Tokyo District Court.

351
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,959
Please ask the person in charge of this hospital...

352
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,462
{In the case of a medical trial, before a lawsuit}

353
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,966
"There are many cases where an application is made to the court to preserve evidence."

354
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:45,637
{Normally, only the hospital has medical records and medical records that could serve as evidence}

355
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,774
(Ito) I'm Ito, Director, what exactly is it?

356
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,610
Currently 10:30am

357
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,446
Presents evidence conservation decisions

358
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,782
"Evidence may be discarded after the lawsuit is filed."

359
00:21:56,782 --> 00:22:00,285
{We will hold it in advance to prevent it from being tampered with.}

360
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:04,956
From now on, we will carry out the maintenance procedures for Mr. Sumi Takashi's medical records and other matters →

361
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:10,629
Please prepare this for a complete set of medical records including medical records.

362
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,298
Isn't it? A video of the surgery?

363
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:18,970
Yes, to be precise, it seems that I forgot to press the record button and couldn't take a picture.

364
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,972
There's no way that such a thing can happen

365
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:25,977
There was no mention in the medical record that Takashi had complained of headache symptoms.

366
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:29,114
I can't take a video, my medical record is white

367
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:33,285
Preserving evidence means seizing evidence before it is hidden by the other party →

368
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,621
It looks like something's being read ahead

369
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,610
It's Kiriishi-san, right?

370
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,448
Thanks to this, the evidence was deleted before the evidence was preserved.

371
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,952
Sorry, but get off the Toa Hospital matter

372
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,454
Huh? I should have said that

373
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,791
Aya will have surgery soon

374
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,961
I know that, stop pretending to be justice

375
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,597
Being pretentious of justice...

376
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,100
Kono may be covering up medical malpractice.

377
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,437
That's what you just want to think like that, right?

378
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:29,441
You're just being influenced by the plaintiff's feelings.

379
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,777
If you say that, then Kiriishi-san

380
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,614
Isn't it just that you want to think that Kono wasn't doing that?

381
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,116
If so, what would it be?

382
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,452
Will you do something?

383
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:44,289
Aya's surgery is very difficult and there are few doctors to request.

384
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,958
I don't have time here anymore!

385
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,296
Shut up the outsiders

386
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,601
I'm not an outsider so I won't be silent!

387
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,273
There should still be a way!

388
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,943
You're persistent, you

389
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,284
(knock)

390
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,455
It was late, what happened? Ah

391
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,957
Ah, no, nothing

392
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,462
I bought some Japanese sweets so I can have tea

393
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,272
There's some way...

394
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:51,456
Sorry I've got this body

395
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,626
I'm busy with work

396
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,963
You don't have to worry about that

397
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,765
You always say that

398
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:04,102
I've never been to a good relationship since ancient times, so I've returned to my house

399
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,773
Todoroki-kun also said this, right?

400
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:12,777
He won't mind if he refuses

401
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,281
Hey

402
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:20,619
If I'm gone then don't worry about remarriage

403
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,787
What are you talking about?

404
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,956
It's common in movies too

405
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,959
He lives with the feelings of his dead wife on his shoulders

406
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,295
If that's what happens, I'll be careful

407
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:33,131
So that won't happen

408
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:36,601
Because if you die you can't tell them that either, right?

409
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,771
You're a weird thing, so

410
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,440
So I'll tell you first

411
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,946
Of course I'm fully willing to live

412
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,449
And if the surgery goes well

413
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,619
I want to go see the aurora again

414
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,955
Aurora?

415
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,457
Honeymoon Revenge

416
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,962
I went to Finland to see the aurora

417
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,599
On the day I was looking, I caught a cold and fell asleep

418
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,268
You couldn't watch me either, did you?

419
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,271
So revenge!

420
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,114
ah

421
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,951
I can go, I'm sure

422
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,953
Yeah

423
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,760
What, there was no video during the operation?

424
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,762
yes

425
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,766
Well, it's a lie that I couldn't take a video

426
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,269
I guess so

427
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:50,609
Will the trial continue like this? Your friends are waiting for surgery, right?

428
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,446
Patients have no choice but to cling

429
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,117
Of course, surgery

430
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,621
There's nothing that the person or their family can do.

431
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:06,958
Only the doctor in front of me holds that fate

432
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,596
The patient has no choice but to rely on that.

433
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:17,435
So if there's someone who betrays that kind of feeling

434
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,771
I can't forgive

435
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,611
That's your justice

436
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:30,615
Sorry, it's not enough just to feel

437
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:34,619
If there's a way

438
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,290
He was a member who was directly involved in the surgery.

439
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,626
But no one's mouths so easily

440
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,595
Twitch

441
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,265
You, the doctor, I don't know how to live

442
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,768
Huh? That kind of thing

443
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,270
The world of doctors is always

444
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,607
Envy and jealousy are swirling

445
00:27:55,607 --> 00:28:00,111
what do you mean? Kono is the hope of the brain surgery world.

446
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:03,448
He's the sign doctor at Toa Hospital

447
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:07,452
Conversely, the doctor below

448
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,955
No matter what you do, it will become a achievement for Kono.

449
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,958
That's why people in that position are always

450
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,295
I'm waiting for the top to fall

451
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,132
I see, that's true

452
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,769
If there's the only way out there

453
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:29,441
It's the doctor right below Kono.

454
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:32,277
Under Kono...

455
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,279
Boar hunting

456
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,653
Ah, wait, let's go pink

457
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,822
Pink Heheheh I understand

458
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,990
Yes, don't cut too much

459
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,660
Yes, good

460
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,662
(knock)

461
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,833
Yotogotoko-kun?

462
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,502
Todoroki? It's been a while

463
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,171
How are you feeling? It's okay because I'm still hospitalized

464
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,341
What's wrong all of a sudden? No no, it's a visit

465
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,677
Yes this

466
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:09,180
Todoroki-kun is a gift...

467
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,182
But thank you yeah

468
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,184
Today is? Uzaki-kun and the others?

469
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,154
Ah, they're just stumping

470
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,657
It's like two people who don't get along with other people have subordinates

471
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,993
It's really emotional

472
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,162
It's still tough

473
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:29,000
Ah, aren't they both doing power harassment?

474
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,671
If you say to young people today in the past, it's just one hit.

475
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,673
Come on, that face!

476
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,676
Children today can't push the heat against them

477
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,179
Right, huh huh huh

478
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,181
Tongshi

479
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,650
Just a moment

480
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,159
How's Aya?

481
00:29:55,827 --> 00:30:00,498
The size of my cerebral aneurysm is getting bigger, and it's dangerous to have surgery

482
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,502
I see...

483
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,008
Did you come to hear that?

484
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,010
no

485
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,815
The trial begins

486
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,152
I know how you feel

487
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:25,156
Honestly, should I stop them too?

488
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,493
I was confused

489
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,163
Have you been confused?

490
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,999
Tongshi

491
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,170
Can you leave Aya to us about it?

492
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,172
Huh?

493
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,509
Aya will definitely help

494
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,513
I'm going to go in place of that

495
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:53,017
I want you to move with me

496
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:16,007
I'll give you a straightforward question, Sumin-san said that Takashi passed away →

497
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,343
What do you think is the cause?

498
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,678
now

499
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,514
I think it was a mistake in the surgery

500
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:27,018
When you say "now" it's different in the past?

501
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:30,154
Initially, from the hospital

502
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,992
He was explained that the surgery was a success.

503
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:38,997
However, two days later, Takashi passed away from subarachnoid hemorrhage.

504
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,499
What explanation did you receive from the hospital?

505
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,502
The surgery was successful

506
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:50,008
Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred after surgery, far from the treatment site.

507
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:55,013
(Takaido) How did the hospital explain the cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage?

508
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,181
It happened by accident

509
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:01,653
Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred only two days after catheter surgery

510
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,823
Still, the only explanation was that it was accidental?

511
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,160
We are amateurs

512
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,996
I have no choice but to believe what my doctor told me...

513
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,667
If this is caused by an error during the surgery:

514
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:20,004
As a family member, what do you think of Takashi's death?

515
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,674
My father is

516
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,510
Why did you have to die?

517
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,680
Thinking about my mother's feelings left behind

518
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,015
I can't forgive

519
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,820
That's all from the plaintiff's agent

520
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,491
The deceased Sumi Takashi was holding it

521
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,328
For large middle cerebral aneurysms

522
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:47,165
Usually, surgery is performed by opening a part of the skull

523
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:50,001
It's considered to be a better surgical method, right? yes

524
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:54,339
However, you chose catheter surgery this time.

525
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,509
Isn't that because they tried to increase their own techniques?

526
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:03,181
No, because I saw the person's aneurysm and thought the method was appropriate.

527
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:08,486
So why do you think subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred?

528
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,490
The accidental subarachnoid hemorrhage after surgery was unexpected

529
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,494
It was unrelated to the surgery and the surgery itself was a success.

530
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:21,833
I see. The subarachnoid hemorrhage that occurred just two days after the surgery

531
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:26,004
It was a contingent and it was a success.

532
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,006
yes

533
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,008
Now, I'll change the question

534
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,011
In the process of passing the catheter into the artery

535
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,347
Have you ever injured your blood vessels?

536
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:41,152
There is no such fact, but the medical records do not include such information.

537
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:45,656
That's right, nothing is written in the medical record.

538
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:50,828
But is that really proof that nothing happened?

539
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:54,665
What if you didn't intentionally write that fact?

540
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:58,336
Objection! The judge's agent has no evidence

541
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,671
He repeatedly claims selfish speculation

542
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,674
It's not a selfish speculation

543
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,676
This is Uzaki, the plaintiff's agent.

544
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:10,014
The judge will play the audio data that he will submit soon.

545
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:13,818
This was in charge of Takashi's surgery along with Dr. Kono.

546
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,020
It was owned by Dr. Igari.

547
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,824
(Igari) Professor Kono actually came to me, Sumin's lawyer.

548
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,160
(Kono) Lawyer? You haven't said anything, right?

549
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,162
(Igari) Yes, but is it okay?

550
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,497
(Kono) What? (Igari) After all, that time

551
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,167
Did the catheter forcefully move it into the catheter and cause vascular dissection?

552
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:33,004
(Kono) Only us, doctors, know that.

553
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,674
He also deleted the fact that he complained of a headache after the surgery from his nursing records.

554
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,177
The surgery was a success, you know?

555
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:44,015
Both symptoms of blood vessel damage and headache are not found in the medical records, but

556
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,317
What does this mean?

557
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,319
Why that guy...

558
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:53,658
Kono-san, be careful of night roads and ambitious subordinates.

559
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,828
{Sorry}

560
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,336
"No, but Igari is a breakthrough, so it's a card that betrays the current hospital."

561
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,506
{It's not here} {Don't worry about that}

562
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,676
《Huh? 》 《That Igari is a doctor》

563
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:15,813
"We've accepted it, you're good at your skill, right? 》

564
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,816
《Who are you at home? " "Ou"

565
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,319
"It's this hospital with me"

566
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,821
"Director of Beijing Hospital..."

567
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,324
"What, old man, what is the director? ?》 {Yes, old man is the director}

568
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,326
"Who's the old man? 》 《No, huh! 》

569
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:32,497
"Well, I spoke at the academic conference where I met you."

570
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,999
{Huh} {What's with us now}

571
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,835
{Cerebrovascular surgery is the same, but one more thing}

572
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:41,672
"I was thinking about creating a department specialized for brain catheter treatment."

573
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,674
"Is it true? 》

574
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:47,845
"Igari-san, you're a really good brain surgeon."

575
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,817
"Nevertheless, within this East Asia Hospital"

576
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:57,155
"It's hidden behind the sign doctor and Dr. Kono being lifted up."

577
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,323
"What do you mean? 》

578
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:03,995
{Would it be about time for Igari to be in the spotlight, too? 》

579
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:10,501
Igari suffers from the sense of guilt of pretending not to see this cover-up.

580
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,839
He provided us with data recorded from his conversation with Dr. Kono.

581
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,675
This is a fabrication!

582
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,344
On March 10th, the surgery was performed

583
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,814
In the afternoon, there was a large neurosurgery conference in Fukuoka, right?

584
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:27,318
You were about to make an important announcement there.

585
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,320
《How many more minutes do you have? 》

586
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,489
{25 minutes left}

587
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,830
In fact, during the procedure of proceeding with the catheter during surgery

588
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,167
You probably felt like you had injured your blood vessels.

589
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,670
You are anxious about time and disregard it

590
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,506
The surgery was completed without any follow-up observation.

591
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:52,343
You received a report that Takashi complained of a headache after surgery

592
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,179
Have you actually gone to the hospital room?

593
00:36:56,514 --> 00:37:00,318
That's... I checked with a patient in the same hospital room.

594
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,487
It seems he never came

595
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,824
I guess the post-operative nursing records were just checked on my smartphone.

596
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,327
There were no actual test instructions

597
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:13,164
However, the family managed to get the surgery.

598
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:18,336
He explained that subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred far from the area he had been treated.

599
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,505
If you say that, there's no way an amateur would understand

600
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:25,843
But if you're a doctor like you

601
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:31,015
It was expected that subarachnoid hemorrhage would occur from the slightest wound.

602
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:36,654
You will have many highly difficult catheter surgeries.

603
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,991
It has also been called Hope in the medical world.

604
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,994
But I'll just prioritize my own honor

605
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:47,164
The most important thing, the life of a patient

606
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,167
Wasn't he left behind?

607
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,839
If you take measures and responses that you would normally be able to do

608
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,508
Sumi Takashi is

609
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:00,845
He was living a healthy life today too.

610
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,654
Kono-san

611
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,323
If you have any objections please

612
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:25,169
It is also used to hospitals that normally manage doctors.

613
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,005
No one would criticize the acts of the sign doctor.

614
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,508
No fair internal investigations were conducted.

615
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:35,346
This management system also seems to have had a great responsibility.

616
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,015
That's all from the plaintiff's agent

617
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:43,821
Well, this is the end of the interrogation

618
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,992
Based on the previous hearings, the court will be

619
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,162
I'd like to try to reconcile the two.

620
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:58,169
If you have a proposal from the court as a deputy

621
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,839
What do you think of the plaintiff's agent?

622
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,815
As a family, there are substantial compensation.

623
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:16,654
If this is based on the assumption that the hospital will apologize for this medical malpractice

624
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,657
There is room for consideration for settlement

625
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,164
Good job

626
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:31,001
Old man! Ah, no Funaki-san

627
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,838
You're going to do it surprisingly

628
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,340
Hehe... well, I'm a lawyer anyway

629
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:42,513
Big, I'm worried about the world of doctors right now

630
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,649
All of you threw at me

631
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:51,822
"We doctors are desperately trying to achieve results and fame."

632
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:58,162
"Is it not an era where we should once again question the ethics of doctors?"

633
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:03,501
Well, Funaki-san

634
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,670
You know the example

635
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,340
Leave the surgery to me

636
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,677
thank you

637
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,990
It's okay, it's over safely

638
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,492
Ah, that's good...

639
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,495
Good thank you

640
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,835
thank you

641
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,181
Sorry

642
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,653
Are you sleeping? Yeah

643
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,988
I'll be able to be discharged next week

644
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,326
Uzaki's friend is amazing

645
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:08,165
He brings in a famous doctor who has been waiting for several months and lets him get surgery right away.

646
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:11,669
After all, are the friends you should have?

647
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,171
Lawyers don't benefit

648
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,674
(Takaido) Do you say that yourself? say

649
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,344
I've protected both of the rights

650
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,181
yes

651
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,820
oh

652
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,659
Uzaki

653
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,661
Is it a bit nice?

654
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,334
I heard it from Todoroki

655
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:47,004
You've searched for a doctor

656
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,007
I'm glad the surgery was successful

657
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,349
Sorry

658
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,486
I was wrong

659
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:08,158
I did something wrong as a lawyer

660
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,995
Just about Aya... No

661
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,666
I was only thinking about myself

662
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,506
No, I'm jealous

663
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,508
Huh?

664
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:29,813
That's how it means Kiriishi-san loves Aya-san, right?

665
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:34,184
Ah, I want to find someone like that too ha ha ha

666
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,989
Thank you for the meal

667
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:50,834
(Asami) It's finally time for everyone to gather, right?

668
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:54,838
Ah, the incident at Toa Hospital that Uzaki and others did.

669
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:58,175
I was able to get closer to the main castle

670
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,511
I'll summarize the incident again

671
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,180
A bus accident occurred in Minato City 5 years ago

672
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,183
The driver is taking medicine on the surface

673
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:10,988
This side effect was caused by an incorrect driving operation.

674
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:14,158
But on that bus

675
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,493
A company called GI Technologies

676
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,996
It was equipped with an autonomous driving system

677
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,666
While driving, the system caused some error.

678
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,002
The bus suddenly ran out of control

679
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:28,172
GI Technologies then got government backing

680
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:32,509
In autonomous driving technology, it has grown into one of the leading companies in Japan.

681
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,845
And the major shareholders there

682
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,348
It was a company where Ishikura's wife was the representative.

683
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,651
Huh? Uzaki and I questioned the hospital director.

684
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:43,320
As expected, the GI Technologies system

685
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,990
What was introduced in the hospital

686
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,992
It was Ishikura's request

687
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,661
I fought a reconciliation and made me spew out all sorts of things.

688
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,497
Apparently GI Technologies is aiming to go public soon

689
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:57,167
In other words, the more highly regarded the company, the more

690
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:00,004
Huge profits flow to Ishikura, the shareholder

691
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,674
That's why Ishikura has been in his time as Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.

692
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,176
Give a large subsidy to that company

693
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,812
I rushed to develop the system

694
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,815
That's when that accident happened

695
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,485
To prevent your own intentions from becoming a par

696
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,154
Ishikura was originally a junior of a faction.

697
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,823
I handed over the mayor of Minato City's Otobe City.

698
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,660
So, how did you put your hands on the police?

699
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,995
That's what I'm following now

700
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,665
