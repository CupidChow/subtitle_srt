17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 22=

18
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,100
(Serenity and Elegance)

19
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,580
(Wedding)

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,120
(Why are Empress Lv's personal effects)

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
(in Prince Wuyin's secret chamber?)

22
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,520
(Did they)

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,360
(have a secret relationship?)

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,200
(But Qingtai wasn't here.)

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,040
(Where could she be?)

26
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,940
(Meng Residence)

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,400
Huaijin,

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,480
I have left all those conflicts behind.

29
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,480
I am doing well now.

30
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,340
(In loving memory of beloved brother,
Meng Huaijin)

31
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,350
(Meng Zhenzhen,
Meng Clan's Legitimate Daughter)

32
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,080
What about you?

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,720
How are you doing?

34
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,600
Miss.

35
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,840
Miss, I have bad news.

36
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,940
Do not raise your voice
in Huaijin's memorial hall.

37
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,720
Forgive me, Master Meng.

38
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,200
This is about you.

39
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,520
I must inform you at once so...

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,760
It's about Huaijin?

41
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,280
(Yuetao, Meng Zhenzhen's Personal Maid)

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,720
Master is adopting Meng Huairui

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
as his heir apparent.

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,520
He is but our distant family.

45
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,320
What would Father pick him?

46
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,200
I was told

47
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,640
that he submitted an essay
to the imperial court.

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,120
His Majesty loved it so much

49
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,880
and even chastised your father,

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,400
saying someone like him
should've worked for the nation earlier.

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,120
After that,

52
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,000
your father decided he'd be
the heir apparent.

53
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,040
Huairui?

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Even a fool knows

55
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,640
he was merely stealing
someone else's credit.

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,480
I don't know about that,

57
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,440
but the date of the ceremony
has been fixed.

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,360
It's in two days.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,680
Also,

60
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,720
he will replace your brother

61
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,520
in the marital arrangement with the Li's.

62
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,000
After the adoption ceremony,

63
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,920
he shall pick another date
for the betrothal.

64
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,440
He doesn't deserve Yue at all.

65
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,880
He's a sanctimonious man

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
with the heart of a crook.

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,720
He's going to destroy my family.

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,440
Miss,

69
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,720
what do we do now?

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,480
Father,

71
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,040
Hanyue is the sole daughter
of Deputy Minister Li.

72
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,600
We grew up together,
and admire each other a lot.

73
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,720
I seek your approval for our marriage.

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,400
Deputy Minister Li passed away
many years ago.

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,680
(Meng Zhongyan, Meng Clan's Head)

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
What can we benefit from this marriage?

77
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,040
(Meng Huaijin,
Meng Zhongyan's Legitimate Son)

78
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,720
(Meng Huaijin)
The way I see it,

79
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,760
(Meng Zhongyan's Legitimate Son)
that woman is using you

80
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,720
to get rich.

81
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,000
Father,

82
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,840
Yue is a woman
of impeccable comportment.

83
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
Her love towards Huaijin is genuine,

84
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
and I can vouch for that.

85
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,240
Huaijin has knelt here for three days.

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,160
Please indulge in his wishes.

87
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,520
Three days?

88
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,040
Only if

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,960
that woman proves her determination

90
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,360
by waiting three years for you.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,280
I hope you'll keep your promise.

92
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,400
Hanyue is the only woman
I will ever marry.

93
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,000
Huaijin,

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,560
you knelt for three days

95
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,760
before Father allowed you

96
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,440
to marry Yue.

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,640
How is this fair for you?

98
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,720
(Zhenzhen,)

99
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,440
(it's your birthday today.)

100
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,680
(I will make a gift for you.)

101
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
(Once Hanyue moves in,)

102
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,600
(you won't be the only woman
in this residence.)

103
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,480
(When that happens,)

104
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,720
(you two)

105
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,480
(can hang out together.)

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,320
(My biggest wish)

107
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,640
(is to see the smile)

108
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,320
(on your faces.)

109
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,360
(Huaijin,)

110
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,480
(you sacrificed your life for us.)

111
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,480
(Not only did they take it for granted,)

112
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,920
(they even took the childhood friend)

113
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,440
(you swore to marry away.)

114
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
(I won't let them have their way.)

115
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,920
Miss Meng,

116
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,320
it's cold outside, and you
have a weak constitution.

117
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,000
You should retire to your chamber.

118
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,160
Staying in my chamber
bores me to no end.

119
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,640
Besides, I am His Highness's
future spouse.

120
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,760
Am I

121
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,160
not allowed to roam

122
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,880
in my residence?

123
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,240
You misunderstood.

124
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm merely worried that this
might bring health complications.

125
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,720
(That outfit...)

126
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,240
(A Beiyuan woman.)

127
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,480
Where are you going, Miss?

128
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,720
Like I said, I want to take a stroll.

129
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,920
You're heading to the kitchen.

130
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,240
Only servants go there.

131
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,880
I wouldn't want them
to offend your eyes.

132
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,320
I don't mind.

133
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,100
Besides, I want to know
what I'll eat today.

134
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,440
Miss,

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,040
since you're this eager,

136
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,680
I shall inform His Highness.

137
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,280
I'm tired. I'll head back.

138
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,120
(Serenity and Elegance)

139
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,480
Miss Meng, the meal is ready.

140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,440
Where's Qingfeng?

141
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
He left for an errand,

142
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,000
and instructed me to deliver the meal.

143
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,200
What is this?

144
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,680
I have never seen this before.

145
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,710
It's local
seasonal Manchurian wild rice.

146
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,760
It invigorates your lungs

147
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,200
and is nutritious for your body.

148
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,800
I am from Beiyuan.

149
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
I never eat this.

150
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,200
Ask them

151
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,040
to cook something else for me.

152
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,680
Sauteed bean sprouts

153
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,920
with a whole lot of ginger.

154
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,080
Why?

155
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,900
Do they have a problem with my surname?
[*Ginger is "jiang" in pinyin]

156
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,920
Give me a moment.

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,560
I'll ask them to cook again.

158
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,960
Pork rib soup with goji berries,
braised duck feet,

159
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,600
coriander with walnuts.

160
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,480
What's wrong, Miss?

161
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
What did you tell the chefs?

162
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,040
Nothing.

163
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
Why are they mocking me then?

164
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,760
Commanding.

165
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,760
Condescending.

166
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,160
Overbearing.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,520
Domineering.

168
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,080
What does that mean?

169
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,600
They are saying you're bossy.

170
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,200
I'll ask them to cook again.

171
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,840
Wait.

172
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,760
Whether you're watching them or not,

173
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,760
they are clearly angry with me.

174
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,440
I'm not sure

175
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
if I can eat their food anymore.

176
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,360
I feel bad for you.

177
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,560
You're dragged into this suddenly,

178
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,080
and this happens.

179
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,400
I'm sure Qingfeng won't be mad at you.

180
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,560
How can we reassure you?

181
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,240
I want to watch them cook.

182
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,600
Okay.

183
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,000
Come with me.

184
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,000
I want to have Chinese dipping noodles.

185
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,480
Do you know how to make it?

186
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,200
No.

187
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,480
What kind of dipping sauce do you want?

188
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,400
You are...?

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
Miss,

190
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
I am Xia Lian.

191
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,160
Let me know what you'd like to eat.

192
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,400
I was told there was no woman
in this residence.

193
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
His Highness had her cooking
in an eatery

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,920
and loved it so much.

195
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
He then engaged her to work here.

196
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,440
You can make Beiyuan dishes.

197
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,360
Miss,

198
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,760
my late husband
was a traveling merchant.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,460
We once stayed in Beiyuan for a few
years to conduct business.

200
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,360
I learned how to prepare
Beiyuan cuisine then.

201
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,720
I see.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,680
Several days ago, His Highness asked

203
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,440
if I was accustomed to living here.

204
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,080
And days later, he hired you.

205
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,400
How wonderful.

206
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,680
I can now

207
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,200
have Beiyuan dishes every day.

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,360
I appreciate your compliment, Miss.

209
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,840
As long as I'm here,

210
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,120
your craving will be satisfied.

211
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,960
But

212
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,280
I too cook in the annex sometimes.

213
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,880
Enough talking.

214
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,880
Prepare the dipping noodles now.

215
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:26,760
Right.

216
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,720
Bring me the noodles.

217
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,760
(Prince Wuyin never mentioned
the annex.)

218
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,280
(Perhaps Qingtai is held captive there.)

219
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,020
(Meng Residence)

220
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,640
(Humility)

221
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,840
Do you swear to be pious

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200
to your parents, and respectful

223
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,480
to your ancestors?

224
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,720
Yes, I swear.

225
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,840
Do you swear to care

226
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,640
for the family elders, and to expand

227
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
the family?

228
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,880
Yes, I swear.

229
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,680
To be adopted into the main family

230
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,680
is to be committed to the ancestors

231
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,280
and our progeny.

232
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,480
If you break your oath

233
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
and renege on your promise,

234
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,240
you'll be branded as a traitor.
Do you take this oath still?

235
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,240
Yes, I do.

236
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,040
With the family elders as my witnesses,

237
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,360
the adoptee will sign
to enshrine his oath.

238
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,020
(Adoptee: Meng Huairui)

239
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,960
The family head will now sign
and retain it for safekeeping.

240
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,440
Halt!

241
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,920
This is the adoption ceremony

242
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,280
for the Meng family.

243
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,280
A wedded daughter like you
has no right to interrupt.

244
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,800
Father,

245
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,760
I must inform you of something.

246
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,200
Ever since

247
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,680
Shen Zaiye and you separated,

248
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,120
you stopped talking to us.

249
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,840
I just want another son

250
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,280
to make our family
presentable once more.

251
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,880
Why must you come now

252
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,240
to stop me?

253
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,520
Father,

254
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,880
do you truly believe that Meng Huairui

255
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
penned that essay?

256
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,160
His Majesty has read it

257
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,280
and reproached me

258
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,200
for not recommending

259
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,360
my homegrown talent.

260
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,920
And

261
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,920
among our family members,

262
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,480
only he has earned His Majesty's favor.

263
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,280
Who else can I pick

264
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
other than him?

265
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,200
Tell me.

266
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,040
If only you

267
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,120
were like what you used to be
when you were little.

268
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,090
I could appoint my son-in-law
as my heir apparent.

269
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,200
That will give me more options.

270
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:42,800
Oh, right.

271
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,800
You

272
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,400
have severed ties with us.

273
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
What's the point of bringing this up?

274
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,200
I apologize

275
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,040
for my mistake.

276
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,760
From now on,

277
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,920
I shall turn over a new leaf

278
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,160
and live or die with my family.

279
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,880
Let me be of service to you.

280
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,080
Do you know what that means,

281
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,640
to live or die with your family?

282
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,160
I can do what Huaijin

283
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,600
did.

284
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,000
Do elaborate.

285
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,240
Prince Wugou has fallen from grace.

286
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,240
His Majesty still has three other sons.

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,680
One of them will become the new emperor.

288
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,000
Father,

289
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
if it was you, who would you choose

290
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,480
to support?

291
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,840
What do you think?

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Prince Wuyin.

293
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,760
Why so?

294
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,320
If Prince Wuxia becomes the next emperor,

295
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,080
he will introduce reforms
to the whole system.

296
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,120
He will promote scholars
into the imperial court,

297
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,280
thus reducing the influence
of noble families like us.

298
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,240
In fact, his final goal might be

299
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,400
to remove all noble families
from the imperial court.

300
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
We cannot support him.

301
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,920
And the second biggest noble family,
the Qins,

302
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,600
is very close to Prince Wuhen.

303
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,120
Huaijin often attacked the Qins

304
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,760
to protect Prince Wugou.

305
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
They view Huaijin

306
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,800
or even our family as nemesis.

307
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,360
We are mortal enemies.

308
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,520
If we support them,

309
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,400
no matter how well we perform,

310
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,720
they might steal credits for our work.

311
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,040
And if we perform poorly,

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
the Qins will settle
both new and old scores

313
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,400
and destroy us.

314
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,040
Continue.

315
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,800
I have been thinking about
Prince Wugou's downfall.

316
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,800
At first, I wanted to drag
Jiang Taohua with me.

317
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,400
To my surprise,

318
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,520
Prince Wuyin came to her rescue.

319
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,280
Prince Wuyin might look
like he's not interested

320
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,200
in politics.

321
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,120
But deep down,

322
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,520
I see hesitation.

323
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,920
He's unsure if he should fight
for the throne or not.

324
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,080
And because of this hesitation,

325
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,960
we can side with him.

326
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,800
A wonderful analysis.

327
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,000
But you have always been hesitant too

328
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,480
to help the family.

329
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,800
I have doubts about your fealty.

330
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,480
Father,

331
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,440
please give me another chance.

332
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
My heart

333
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,920
now belongs to my family.

334
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,760
You can say all you want.

335
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,040
How am I supposed to trust you?

336
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,440
I...

337
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,120
Master,

338
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,160
the family elders
are waiting impatiently.

339
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,580
They are asking you to make haste
and complete the ceremony.

340
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,280
Zhen,

341
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,360
you're a woman.

342
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,280
And a woman was born to be motherly.

343
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,880
To support a future emperor,

344
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,120
we need cruelty.

345
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,840
We need to be able to kill.

346
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Can you do that?

347
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,160
Since they are waiting,

348
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,080
then let's...

349
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,360
Do not underestimate me, Father.

350
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,640
For my hands too

351
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,560
have been tainted with blood once.

352
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,560
From now on,

353
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,520
whoever gets in our way

354
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,840
shall meet his end

355
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,200
and die.

356
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,960
No mercy will be spared.

357
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,720
Great.

358
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,680
We'll follow your plan.

359
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,960
Tell the other family elders

360
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,280
that the adoption ceremony
is pending reconsideration.

361
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,600
They may

362
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,120
return home for now.

363
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,720
Master, this is...

364
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,600
Did you not hear my daughter?

365
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,480
Do not dally.

366
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,386
Yes.

367
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,280
Come.

368
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't worry.

369
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,600
I shall begin finding

370
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,160
my future son-in-law.

371
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,760
I shall find us wings

372
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,480
to help us soar to the sky.

373
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,480
As you wish, Father.

374
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,280
I

375
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,840
can do anything

376
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,560
for my family.

377
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,560
Liu Bao.

378
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,920
Yes.

379
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,720
He

380
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,960
is the assassin I keep in secret.

381
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,480
(Liu Bao, Meng Clan's Loyal Assassin)

382
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
He is skilled

383
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,880
and intelligent.

384
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,480
You may command him as you wish.

385
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,480
Greetings to Ms. Meng.

386
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,200
Ms. Meng.

387
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,240
Just

388
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,320
call me Master.

389
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,880
Noted.

390
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
You have left our family.

391
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,640
Why did you come back to ruin my plan?

392
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,360
What do you want?

393
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,720
Zhenzhen.

394
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,560
Huaijin and I

395
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,240
are deeply in love.

396
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,880
In his will,

397
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,920
his sincere words

398
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,360
urged me to find another husband.

399
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,120
But I don't care anymore

400
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,440
if I have to marry that Meng Huairui.

401
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,680
I will kill myself and join Huaijin.

402
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,160
Yue,

403
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,600
don't worry.

404
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,400
For you, and for Huaijin,

405
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,440
I won't let you marry Meng Huairui.

406
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,920
From now onwards,

407
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,280
stay away from the Li family.

408
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,320
Did I make myself clear?

409
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,920
I am single, and so is she.

410
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,640
An unwed maiden is highly sought after.

411
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,880
You don't have a say.

412
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,320
If you ever court her,

413
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,400
I will get rid of you.

414
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,360
Additionally,

415
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,690
you'd better confess
about your plagiarism

416
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,680
as soon as possible.

417
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,920
Otherwise,

418
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,920
I will...

419
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,800
You...

420
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,320
What will you do?

421
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,440
Remove your head.

422
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,480
I would have never wanted to marry

423
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,920
that poor woman

424
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,440
had your father not come and begged me.

425
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,400
(Shen Residence)

426
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,080
Chancellor,

427
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,960
I have gleaned through all
medical documents in the palace

428
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,920
and found someone

429
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,360
who seems to have contacted
a similar ailment.

430
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,280
However, he is mentally impaired

431
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
and is never cured.

432
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,160
It is

433
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,680
a very rare ailment.

434
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,120
Is it truly incurable then?

435
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,720
Chancellor,

436
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,000
why don't I

437
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,360
visit your spouse in person

438
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,440
before I make my diagnosis?

439
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,880
She

440
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,440
is not home.

441
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,080
But why?

442
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,160
A patient of this affliction

443
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,840
absolutely needs
to stay in familiar environs

444
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,000
so that they can regain their memory.

445
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,080
Thank you for the advice,
Imperial Physician Bai.

446
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,920
By your leave.

447
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,120
Chancellor,

448
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,520
the physician said

449
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,880
that Her Highness must return home.

450
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,360
I have kept Zhengchun Boudoir for her.

451
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,440
When I was tidying it,

452
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,360
I never threw her belongings away.

453
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,540
Perhaps when she sees them,
she will recall everything.

454
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,880
Zengtu hasn't brought back the antidote.

455
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,400
Jiang Taohua took risks several times,

456
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,880
and almost lost her life.

457
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,760
I cannot gamble with her life anymore.

458
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,240
So

459
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,040
you'll let her
forget you just like that?

460
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
As long

461
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,880
as she is safe.

462
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
(I wonder where the annex is.)

463
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,200
(Qingtai.)

464
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,920
(You must wait for me.)

465
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,880
I will deliver the herbal pill
to His Majesty personally.

466
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,240
Thank you, Eunuch Chen.

467
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,020
(Serenity and Elegance)

468
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,940
(Qinfang Tea House)

469
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,640
I thought something happened
to the Right Chancellor

470
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,920
when someone
from the Mengs was looking for me.

471
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,840
Ms. Meng,

472
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,240
what can I help?

473
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,920
Rest easy, Your Highness.

474
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,000
For I will now be the face of my family.

475
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,400
I suppose

476
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,920
you're filling your brother's role?

477
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,360
I sense misgivings
from Your Highness still.

478
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,320
Why not

479
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,200
have a game of weiqi?

480
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,280
You came prepared, Ms. Meng.

481
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,400
Not many know I'm good at weiqi.

482
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,840
Your Highness.

483
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:00,960
You first.

484
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,640
Me first?

485
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
If you lose,

486
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,800
you can't say
I'm taking advantage of your naivete.

487
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,320
Worry not.

488
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,200
But if I win,

489
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,360
I'd like Your Highness

490
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,200
to lend me your ears for a moment.

491
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,320
We'll see that after you win.

492
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,920
Those imbecile advisors
are impeaching the Left Chancellor?

493
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,880
Even hit the Beiyuan delegation?

494
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,320
Those Beiyuan spies

495
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
are everywhere in Yujing.

496
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,920
Why not impeach them instead?

497
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,680
To have established
Lan Boutique under my nose...

498
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,440
Do they think me gullible?

499
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,080
How dare they!

500
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,920
Calm down, Your Majesty.

501
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,040
What's taking Xiaochenzi so long?

502
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,560
Your Majesty, the pill is here.

503
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,400
Bring it here at once.

504
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,240
My mind needs relief.

505
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,120
Your Majesty.

506
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,360
Wuyin's pill works wonders.

507
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,000
Xiaochenzi.

508
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,400
Did you tell him

509
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,920
to make me more pills?

510
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:54,920
Your Majesty,

511
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,480
His Highness was unfortunately away.

512
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,560
However, his servants told me

513
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,240
that he had already prepared the pills.

514
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,760
They will be sent
to Your Majesty tonight.

515
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,480
See? What did I tell you?

516
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,520
Wuyin is the most pious son of them all.

517
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,160
Alas, he hasn't found a wife.

518
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,240
And that troubles me a lot.

519
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,840
For your information, Your Majesty,

520
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,000
I caught a glimpse of a woman

521
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,880
in his residence just now.

522
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,040
Did you take a good look

523
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,320
at the woman?

524
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,240
Your Majesty, I merely took a glance.

525
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,960
She looks quite like

526
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,200
Princess Chengping,

527
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,040
a lady who stands out from the rest.

528
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,080
She is a good match to His Highness.

529
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,480
Wuyin is hiding a lady?

530
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,040
Xiaochenzi,

531
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,000
tell them I want the woman

532
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,320
to be here.

533
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,480
I want to take a look at her.

534
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

535
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,340
(Qinfang Tea House)

536
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,440
Ms. Meng.

537
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,840
Good game.

538
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,800
Good game, Your Highness.

539
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,180
As expected from the daughter

540
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,200
of the Meng family.

541
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,080
Your Highness,

542
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,600
now that I have won,

543
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,680
you must deliver on your promise.

544
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,440
Recently...

545
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,280
Your Highness, something happened.

546
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,840
Something requires my attention.

547
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,880
Enjoy yourself, Ms. Meng.

548
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,400
I was so close.

549
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,120
Guards!

550
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,600
Yes.

551
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,280
Find out

552
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,320
what requires

553
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,760
Prince Wuyin's attendance.

554
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,720
Noted.

555
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,600
They merely sent a messenger.

556
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,200
And you let her go just like that?

557
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,800
Why didn't you wait for me to come back?

558
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,600
His Majesty sent his messenger
to take her away.

559
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,400
I can't possibly stop them.

560
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,600
However,

561
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,480
I told the coachman

562
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,880
to take a detour.

563
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,320
They haven't reached the palace yet
at the moment.

564
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,600
In that case,

565
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
find someone

566
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,600
who looks like her

567
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,480
to take her place

568
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,760
before she arrives.

569
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,880
Understood.

570
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,480
May I know

571
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,920
where we are going?

572
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,920
Be patient, Ms. Meng.

573
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,400
You will find out when you're there.

574
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,200
(Why is the carriage)

575
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,680
(walking around in circles)

576
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,320
(inside the city?)

577
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,800
Master,

578
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,040
His Majesty asked to see the woman
in the Prince Wuyin's residence.

579
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,280
They are on their way.

580
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,800
His Highness is never known
to have a female visitor.

581
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,760
According to the source from the palace,

582
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
that woman

583
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,480
looks like Princess Chengping.

584
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,880
Jiang Taohua?

585
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,480
Isn't she dead?

586
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,680
His Highness doesn't seem to want
His Majesty to see that woman.

587
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,720
He had a doppelganger chase

588
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,880
after the carriage right now.

589
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,220
He wants to replace that woman
before His Majesty sees her.

590
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,800
I also discovered

591
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,240
that many days ago,

592
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,720
Chancellor Shen visited Prince Wuyin.

593
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,760
He asked to see the woman

594
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,840
who looks like Princess Chengping.

595
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,600
(Did Jiang Taohua fake her death?)

596
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,120
(Regardless,)

597
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,040
(there's only one way to find out.)

598
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,640
(Shen Residence)

599
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,480
Chancellor, I was told
that Princess Chengping

600
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,600
was heading to the palace.

601
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,560
Her carriage went in circles in the city

602
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,720
before being taken

603
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
to Chengnan Cremation Parlor
by a group of people.

604
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,280
Mister,

605
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
did I ever cross you?

606
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,480
You're about to be dead.

607
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
No need to ask questions.

608
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,160
I want to know why I die.

609
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,320
(Cremation Parlor)

610
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,040
There are

611
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,320
more and more unclaimed bodies
in Chengnan recently.

612
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,400
And it's not even the coldest day
of the winter yet.

613
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,000
Right?

614
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,600
Careful.

615
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,360
Giddy up!

616
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,360
Giddy up!

617
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,840
Giddy up!

618
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,820

619
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
