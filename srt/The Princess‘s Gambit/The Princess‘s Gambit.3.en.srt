(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 3=

18
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,620
(Zhengchun Boudoir)

19
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,200
These people are cruel.

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,840
Calm down.

21
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,800
The needle marks are barely visible now.

22
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,880
Where are you even applying
the ointment?

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,840
I don't care. I'm applying it anyway.

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Unbelievable.

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,800
Who sticks needles into someone's knees?

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,240
If you happened to kneel that long,

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,320
your knees would be ruined.

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,080
We've both been
in the Cold Palace for years.

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,600
We're used to witnessing

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,000
such filthy tricks before.

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,680
But I still ache for Your Highness.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,200
We just escaped one danger,

33
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
only to walk into another one.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,320
Still, this place is far better
than Beiyuan's palace.

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,240
At least here,

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,240
I can escape,

37
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,280
hide,

38
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,800
and maybe even fight back.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800
Back then, I had to endure everything

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,560
in front of Empress Lu

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,880
for the sake of Changjue.

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,400
We should report this
to Chancellor Shen.

43
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,360
Let him discipline his people.

44
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,360
Him?

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,640
He might be the one

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,920
who planted the needles.

47
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,440
Of course,

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
it could also be Madam Meng.

49
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,240
We don't rule out

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
Lady Duan and Lady Qin too.

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,880
Why would he do that?

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,040
To test me to see how far he can push,

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
what I'm capable of,

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,360
and what I'm really after.

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
If he hadn't given silent approval

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,280
for today's ceremony,

57
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,160
we wouldn't have had such trouble
at the gate today.

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Everyone watches his lead.

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,560
If he turns a blind eye,
others feel free to trample us.

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,720
We're surrounded on all sides.

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,640
What do we do now?

62
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,080
Against the Chancellor,

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,480
we must appear humble

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,600
to lower his guard.

65
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,000
With others,

66
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,920
we must hold our ground
and fight for every inch.

67
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,680
If we act too meek,

68
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
he'll know something is off.

69
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,320
In any case,

70
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,120
we should be on good terms
with the Chancellor.

71
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,320
Then it won't be hard
to gain a foothold here.

72
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,240
(Hai hour. Wu hour. You hour)

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,720
Your Highness,

74
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
it's nearly time for the nuptial rites.

75
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,840
Why hasn't the Chancellor arrived yet?

76
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,720
The first obstacle
was Lady Qin receiving us at the gate.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,480
The second was serving tea to Madam Meng.

78
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,080
Now,

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,960
he's the third obstacle.

80
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,200
Chancellor,

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,080
the entire household is watching.

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,680
Are you really not completing
the nuptial rites tonight?

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,520
What?

84
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,360
Do you want to go?

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
We've already confirmed
she had nothing to do

86
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,560
with what happened that night.

87
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,880
A delicate princess,

88
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,760
full of virtue,

89
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,400
traveled all this way to Qi

90
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,320
only to fall into this viper's nest.

91
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,840
So helpless.

92
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,960
Exactly.

93
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,960
Makes her even more suspicious.

94
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,680
What if

95
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,120
she is hiding something far bigger?

96
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,160
Chancellor, Lady Jiang's maid, Qingtai,
asks for an audience.

97
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,040
Her Highness says

98
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,720
you're busy with state affairs.

99
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
So she won't disturb you.

100
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,280
As for tonight's nuptial rites,

101
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,560
the wedding matron will proceed

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,520
as if the groom is absent.

103
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,600
Wedding matron?

104
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,480
Her Highness isn't familiar
with Qi customs

105
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,360
and fears making a mistake.

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,160
So she requested His Majesty

107
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,760
to send
a Court Ritualist of Rites and Music

108
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
to stand in as wedding matron.

109
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
All matters tonight in Zhengchun Boudoir

110
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,240
will follow the matron's instructions.

111
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,640
(So this was her plan.)

112
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,920
Open the window.

113
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
Let those spying
from outside get a clear view.

114
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,320
Enough sighing.

115
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,560
Don't worry.

116
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,160
With the ritualist involved,

117
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,320
he will come.

118
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,320
I'm not afraid he won't.

119
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,800
He's so wild and unpredictable.

120
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm more afraid
he'll do something indecent.

121
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,120
He's more wary of me than anything.

122
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,640
Even if he comes,
it'll just be for show.

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,840
Greetings, Chancellor.

124
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,580
(Shen Residence)

125
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm from the Xue family.

126
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,640
Please inform Chancellor Shen.

127
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Xue family?

128
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,480
Yes.

129
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,480
Never heard of it.

130
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,480
Just tell him

131
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,920
someone surnamed Xue is here
to fulfill a promise.

132
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,120
He'll see me.

133
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,480
I'll take you to the side hall first.

134
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,520
Thank you very much.

135
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,960
Greetings, Chancellor.

136
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,080
You may leave us.

137
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,440
I'm truly honored

138
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
that you came.

139
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,960
What?

140
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,720
Didn't you go to all that trouble

141
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,760
just to get me here?

142
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,960
You're rather impatient.

143
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,320
The fan

144
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
is only meant to be lifted

145
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
after the groom recites
the wedding verse.

146
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,400
You love putting on an act.

147
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,280
Aren't you afraid
you'll trap yourself in your own act?

148
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,680
My feelings for you are sincere.

149
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,840
Heaven and Earth can bear witness.

150
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,800
How is this an act?

151
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,720
Ritualist Song has arrived.

152
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,760
Chancellor, please restrain yourself.

153
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,040
While being affectionate is all good,

154
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,760
you must not neglect proper rites.

155
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,320
Or else it is the Qi State
that loses face.

156
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,160
Ritualist Song,

157
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,040
I grew up in the North

158
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,400
and have always been a bit unruly.

159
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,920
The Chancellor is busy
with state affairs.

160
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,240
Yet, he still found time to come.

161
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
I'm already more than grateful.

162
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,280
Why not skip the formalities

163
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,920
and just share the nuptial wine?

164
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,280
With the ritualist as witness,
of course.

165
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,960
You humble me, Your Highness.

166
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,920
What could be

167
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,480
more important than you?

168
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,040
Ritualist Song,

169
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,640
please proceed with the rites.

170
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,920
Why did Her Highness bring
over a plate of pork?

171
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,960
I hear it's part
of their northern wedding customs.

172
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,200
But doesn't the Chancellor avoid pork?

173
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,880
Pork is a good symbol

174
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,960
of abundance,

175
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
fortune, and long life.

176
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,400
Now,

177
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,520
pick up your chopsticks.

178
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,120
You've surprised me many times today.

179
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,480
I have nothing worthy to return.

180
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,080
So I've chosen
the biggest piece of "good fortune"

181
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,000
for you.

182
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,280
Such a thoughtful new bride.

183
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,480
Come on, Chancellor. Have a bite.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
Lady Jiang, how considerate of you.

185
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,960
Proceed with the nuptial rites.

186
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,960
(Something is off)

187
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,200
(with this nuptial wine.)

188
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,160
(Since you've got ill intentions,)

189
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,280
(don't blame me for fighting back.)

190
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,160
I don't hold my wine well.

191
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,560
So I'll drink just a little.

192
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
I hope you won't mind.

193
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
Your Highness,
don't you always say I come first?

194
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,000
Or

195
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,520
are you actually unwilling
to go through with this marriage?

196
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,760
Since it's a nuptial wine.

197
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,680
I would naturally share it with you.

198
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,840
The Chancellor has an imposing manner.

199
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,360
Lady Jiang is gentle and attentive.

200
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,080
A perfect match, truly.

201
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,240
The nuptial rites are completed.

202
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,320
It's time for the wedding chamber.

203
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,200
This can't be right!

204
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,600
I must tell Madam at once.

205
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,160
I should report back to mine too.

206
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,400
We've already informed the Chancellor.

207
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,080
The Chancellor will be delayed
due to his new bride.

208
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,680
He'll be here shortly.

209
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,840
Have some tea while you wait.

210
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,840
I think

211
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll come again tomorrow.

212
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,040
Get rid of him.

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,640
Be discreet.

214
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,040
Don't let anyone see.

215
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,080
Yes, Madam.

216
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,640
Why not have Meng Ping send

217
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,600
a message to your brother while at it?

218
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,240
Let them worry a bit

219
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,680
so they'll learn

220
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,960
that a daughter is still useful.

221
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,600
Help me change.

222
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Didn't the matron
at Beiyuan's palace teach you

223
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,040
how to serve your husband?

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,080
She did

225
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,280
but...

226
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,760
You went to great lengths to marry me.

227
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,680
Now that we're here,

228
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
why the hesitation?

229
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,760
I'm not hesitating.

230
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
This is all just for show.

231
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,160
I never intended
to consummate the marriage.

232
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,800
You did something to the wine.

233
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,000
Just a little something from Nanyue

234
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,160
that makes people dazed

235
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,720
and unable to lie.

236
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Since

237
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
you don't trust me,

238
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,240
just ask whatever you want.

239
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,360
Tell me.

240
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,080
Why insist on marrying me?

241
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,800
I was never favored as a princess

242
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,880
and was sent here
for a political marriage.

243
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,960
I thought I'd spend
the rest of my life in misery.

244
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,440
But that night at Zuimeng Pavilion

245
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,480
gave me hope.

246
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,640
Chancellor Shen,
you are strikingly handsome

247
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,560
and command a great presence

248
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,200
in court.

249
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,400
I fell for you

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
at first sight.

251
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,000
They say I'm scheming

252
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,520
and dangerous.

253
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Aren't you afraid?

254
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,720
I am.

255
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,840
But a Chancellor

256
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,760
without ruthless means

257
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,800
is to invite ruin upon himself.

258
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,120
I'd rather you be even more cruel.

259
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,400
It's better

260
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,360
than seeing you crushed by others.

261
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,240
Slippery tongue you have.

262
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,600
So you married me

263
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,680
with no other agenda?

264
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,920
I swear.

265
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,440
I married you just to survive.

266
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,320
But if I must live,

267
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
I'd rather live by your side.

268
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,040
You'd better not be hiding anything.

269
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,480
Or else...

270
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,080
Your Highness,

271
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,960
are you all right?

272
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,840
I'm fine.

273
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,000
That scheming Chancellor drugged you.

274
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,160
None of them are decent.

275
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,680
Bad things may bring good things.

276
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,720
Empress Lu may have done me a favor.

277
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,480
The Jiangtao Pill might be too strong

278
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,720
that it suppresses other poisons.

279
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
I did feel off at first.

280
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
But I got over it quickly.

281
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,760
Since Heaven handed me this opportunity,

282
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,240
I might as well play along.

283
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,080
Could it be that something is wrong

284
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,320
with the Truth-Spilling Gu from Nanyue?

285
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,480
Chancellor.

286
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:06,800
What's the matter?

287
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,200
Xue Ran is dead.

288
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,520
When we found him,

289
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,920
his body had already been dumped
at the mass grave.

290
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,720
Did you find the painting?

291
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:19,880
No.

292
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,560
We searched him and the area nearby.

293
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,560
Chancellor,

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,480
the fatal wound was a shallow cut
to the neck.

295
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,800
The cut is not deep.

296
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,360
So it's clearly not dealt with by force.

297
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,440
There were also

298
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,920
no signs of struggle.

299
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,080
I suspect

300
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,560
he was made to lose consciousness

301
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,440
before the killing.

302
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
(This black soil...)

303
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,160
(I once paid a high price)

304
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,120
(to import black soil from the North)

305
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,800
(for my flowers.)

306
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
(So, how did it get)

307
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,200
(under Xue Ran's shoe?)

308
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,200
(Could it be...)

309
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,320
Zhan Lu,

310
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,600
seal off the residence.

311
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,720
No one enters or leaves.

312
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,760
Kill those

313
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,680
who disobey.

314
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,080
Yes, My Lord.

315
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,840
By order of the Chancellor,

316
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,800
the residence is sealed!

317
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,920
(But Chancellor,)

318
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,080
(what do we do next?)

319
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,760
(The enemy hides in the dark
while we're in the open.)

320
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,800
(What should I do?)

321
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
(The stage is all prepared,)

322
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,160
(and the actors
will show up eventually.)

323
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,600
(All we need is a little extra bait.)

324
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,000
(Spread the word
that I have the painting.)

325
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,000
(Yes, My Lord.)

326
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,360
Chancellor,

327
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,360
do you really think
they'd take the risk

328
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,480
if they knew you had it?

329
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,080
If they show up, the problem is solved.

330
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,520
If they don't,

331
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,680
I can only think of one person
in this household

332
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,760
who could remain so calm under pressure.

333
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,120
Meng Ping reports

334
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,120
that the Chancellor
has Xue Ran's painting.

335
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,720
What if Xue Ran left another clue?

336
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,720
Or what if the one he carried

337
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,880
was a fake?

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,160
Then we're...

339
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,560
The one the Chancellor has
could be a fake too.

340
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,120
Meng Ping checked near the study.

341
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,200
The guards have increased heavily.

342
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,040
There is no way to get close.

343
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,320
The Chancellor is clearly setting a trap

344
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,200
to lure someone out.

345
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,600
Let's turn this in our favor

346
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,440
and stir the waters.

347
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
See what the Chancellor is really up to.

348
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,760
The study.

349
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,000
The flower hall.

350
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,240
The Chancellor's personal quarters.

351
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,120
This is where Madam Meng
and Lady Qin stay.

352
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,000
That side hall houses the maids

353
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,520
and male servants.

354
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,600
Now we've stumbled
right into the painting.

355
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,640
It looks like you married into
the right household.

356
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,720
But

357
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,000
where would he hide

358
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,480
something this important?

359
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,680
If I had to guess,
either the study or his bedroom.

360
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,960
Shall we check both?

361
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,480
No.

362
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,800
It's too conspicuous.

363
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,440
We'll choose just one place.

364
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,960
Where does Zhan Lu usually guard?

365
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,680
The study.

366
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,440
The Chancellor asks
to see you at the study.

367
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,480
Did he say

368
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,440
what for?

369
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,080
He wouldn't tell me that.

370
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,680
Very well.

371
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,520
Wait outside.

372
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,560
I'll freshen up and be right there.

373
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,680
Yes, Lady Jiang.

374
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,120
Your Highness,

375
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,880
we were about to sneak into the study
to find the painting.

376
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,160
Now, the opportunity comes knocking.

377
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,360
How can there be such a coincidence?

378
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,800
Even you think it's suspicious.

379
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,240
That means it's no small matter.

380
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,640
Come on, Your Highness.

381
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,120
You and I alone

382
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,600
would never make it near the study.

383
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,600
We might as well follow their lead

384
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,640
and play along

385
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,000
with the mastermind's plan

386
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,160
to probe deeper.

387
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Since someone wants

388
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,600
to make me their scapegoat,

389
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,840
who's to say

390
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,120
it won't become my shield instead?

391
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,800
That's the study ahead.

392
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,960
The Chancellor says

393
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,240
to let you

394
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,480
wait inside.

395
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,920
He'll join you shortly.

396
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
It's still a bit of a walk.

397
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,400
Aren't you going to escort me?

398
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,440
The study holds sensitive documents.

399
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,920
Only Officer Zhan Lu is permitted entry.

400
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,640
I

401
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,800
dare not go any closer.

402
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,600
You may leave then.

403
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,640
Yes, Lady Jiang.

404
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,800
Jiang Taohua went to the study?

405
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
When Xue Ran died,

406
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,880
Jiang Taohua and her maid were
in Zhengchun Boudoir.

407
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,120
So they couldn't have done it.

408
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,360
The killer deliberately lured her there

409
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
to test whether the trap was real.

410
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,400
Who brought her there?

411
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,160
We only saw Lady Jiang walking alone
along the side path.

412
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,760
She clearly knew the route.

413
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,160
She came prepared.

414
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,640
(So many paintings...)

415
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,040
(Which one is
"Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks"?)

416
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,600
(Every painting
has a different brushwork.)

417
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,440
(They were copied by different people.)

418
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,920
(Xue Ran)
(But the seal on every piece)

419
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,480
(says Xue Ran.)

420
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,360
(Never mind.)

421
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,560
(I'll memorize them all for now.)

422
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,920
(I'll study them closely)

423
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
(after I copy them when I get back.)

424
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,920
(A secret compartment?)

425
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,560
Chancellor.

426
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,920
I don't have time for your games.

427
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,480
Tell me

428
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
who sent you here.

429
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,200
Just a regular male servant.

430
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,680
I've only been here a day.

431
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,080
I wouldn't know his name.

432
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,280
Then surely you remember his face.

433
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,360
If you can point him out,

434
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,760
I will believe

435
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,400
that you were tricked into coming here.

436
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,680
If I point him out,

437
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,520
I'll make another enemy.

438
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,280
If you want me to do that,

439
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,320
at least give me a reason.

440
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,560
(Someone opened the hidden compartment.)

441
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,840
Besides,

442
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,360
this study

443
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,680
is only filled with paintings.

444
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,720
Why make such a fuss?

445
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,640
So, it means

446
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,840
you went through everything

447
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,040
in this study.

448
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,280
I've stood right here the entire time.

449
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,320
I haven't moved around.

450
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,880
Good.

451
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,080
Your Highness,

452
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,440
Ah, my mistake.

453
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,120
It's Lady Jiang now.

454
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,240
You can stop trying to fish for answers.

455
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Don't even think

456
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,120
you can use this incident
to gain leverage over me.

457
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,400
Even if you don't tell me,

458
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,360
I'll still find out who it was.

459
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,200
It will just take

460
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,520
a little longer.

461
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,440
But by then,

462
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,800
you'll never be able

463
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,520
to wash away the suspicion.

464
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,400
Lady Jiang, believe it when I say this.

465
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,240
Even if you were

466
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,960
to die suddenly one day,

467
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,320
I would still

468
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,840
be the Chancellor.

469
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,640
Whatever schemes

470
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,200
you're playing

471
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,960
won't matter in the slightest.

472
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,880
All the servants
on duty tonight are here.

473
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,680
Whether you can identify him

474
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
depends on your ability.

475
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,040
You've walked back and forth
several times.

476
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,160
Did you find him?

477
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,920
Are you deliberately covering
for someone?

478
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,880
Or this person never existed at all?

479
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
I'll give you another half an hour.

480
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,000
Everyone,

481
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
lift your right foot.

482
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,520
It's him.

483
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,080
Lady Jiang,
how can you falsely accuse me?

484
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
I wasn't on duty tonight

485
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,400
so I went to bed early.

486
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,720
When have I ever sought you?

487
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,880
Chancellor, please seek justice for me.

488
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,000
The residence is sealed.

489
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,080
Guards are stationed everywhere.

490
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,960
Did anyone see me leave after dark?

491
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,360
I don't know how you disguised yourself.

492
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,600
But it was definitely you.

493
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,920
My mother once told me

494
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,960
people can change everything

495
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,440
but the way they walk.

496
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,880
Your left shoe is worn
along the outer edge.

497
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,400
What's odd is

498
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
that your right foot applies force
on the inside.

499
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,360
Hence the heavy wear on the inside
of your right shoe.

500
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
If I'm not mistaken,

501
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,400
you've injured the outside

502
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,960
of your right ankle before.

503
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,360
That's incredible.

504
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,680
He twisted that ankle a few days ago.

505
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,520
I was the one who tended to him.

506
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,560
Fine.

507
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,280
I admit I was injured.

508
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:58,880
But

509
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,640
it's also possible

510
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,600
that Lady Jiang saw my worn shoe

511
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,240
and framed me on purpose.

512
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,280
It rained a few days ago.

513
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,120
The path you led me down

514
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,120
was still muddy.

515
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,960
Chancellor, you can go check.

516
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,200
The footprints might still be there.

517
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,400
Compare them,
and you'll find out the truth.

518
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,720
Take him.

519
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,240
I'll interrogate him myself.

520
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:38,840
Chancellor,

521
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,040
he's dead.

522
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You knew about the footprints.

523
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,440
Why didn't you say so earlier?

524
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,360
I was tricking him.

525
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,520
If he were truly innocent,

526
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,600
he wouldn't have panicked.

527
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,000
Chancellor,

528
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,800
he has taken his own life out of guilt.

529
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,000
Can it prove

530
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that I'm innocent?

531
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,640
Perhaps.

532
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,080
But Lady Jiang, tell me this.

533
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,680
If you suspected him,

534
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,480
quietly observed his manner of walking,

535
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,160
and knew the study was off-limits,

536
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,800
why go with him
and enter the study anyway?

537
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,400
I was so excited
to receive your summons.

538
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,960
So I lost my senses

539
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,400
for a moment.

540
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,040
Thank you, Chancellor.

541
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
The Chancellor is unpredictable
by nature.

542
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,560
And that painting is crucial.

543
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,160
He threatened you

544
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,600
because he was furious
that you entered the study.

545
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,760
Ever since Mother passed,

546
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,320
I've seen too many with ill intent.

547
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,760
Some want to harm me,

548
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,800
torment me,

549
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,400
and some even want me dead.

550
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,520
Yesterday in the study,

551
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,440
I think he noticed I had discovered
the secret compartment.

552
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
We can't let our guard down

553
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,200
around Shen Zaiye.

554
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,680
Should I prepare anything in advance?

555
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
The truth has not come to light.

556
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,680
Worrying now

557
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,920
will only make things worse.

558
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,000
Just be cautious these next few days.

559
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,120
Understood, Your Highness.

560
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,360
I'll do as you say.

561
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,120
What brings you to my place

562
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
at this early hour?

563
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,440
I heard you keep fine tea.

564
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,880
So I came for a cup.

565
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,920
Did you sleep well

566
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,800
last night?

567
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,120
The weather was nice.

568
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,640
So I had a peaceful sleep.

569
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,520
Strange. The entire residence
was in an uproar all night.

570
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,320
And yet you managed

571
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,160
to sleep through it all.

572
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,280
How enviable.

573
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,600
What happened

574
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,040
last night?

575
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,200
A bold servant disguised himself

576
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,760
and lured Lady Jiang into the study.

577
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,680
We still don't know why.

578
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,640
His name was Meng Ping.

579
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,520
He worked at the gatehouse.

580
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,400
Do you recall him?

581
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,760
He had always been timid, quiet,

582
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,160
and dutiful.

583
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,720
Why would he do something like that?

584
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,600
He was likely acting under orders.

585
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,400
Zhan Lu is investigating.

586
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,000
If this person is caught,

587
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,960
what punishment do you suggest?

588
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,000
You've truly put me on the spot.

589
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,280
I may run the household.

590
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,280
But I've no experience in such matters.

591
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,440
I know.

592
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,080
Those with divided loyalties

593
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,400
must be punished without mercy.

594
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,920
After all these years,

595
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,120
you still only drink

596
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,840
the Laojunshan gifted
by the Right Chancellor.

597
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,400
Madam.

598
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,760
Yuetao,

599
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,600
the Chancellor is starting
to suspect me.

600
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,480
We need to send

601
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
that painting out fast.

602
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,680
If we wait, things could change.

603
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,160
Yes, Madam.

604
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,080
Keep a close eye on Meng Zhenzhen.

605
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,400
I want reports

606
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,560
on her every move.

607
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,400
What about Jiang Taohua?

608
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,120
Your Highness,

609
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,600
braised lamb ribs, shredded chicken,

610
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,920
sesame oil eggs,

611
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,600
pan-fried milk curd,
peach blossom pastries,

612
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,800
and stir-fried pork.

613
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,600
Your Highness, let's eat.

614
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,080
Bring a silver needle.

615
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,280
No need to go that far.

616
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,560
You were frightened

617
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
by what happened in the study
a few days ago.

618
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,160
As compensation,

619
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,760
I specially prepared dishes
from Beiyuan

620
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,400
to ease

621
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,760
your homesickness.

622
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,720
Your great favor leaves me

623
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
overwhelmed.

624
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,440
If you fear poison,

625
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,560
then why did you not consider

626
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,040
that I had taken the antidote
before coming?

627
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,280
If you truly wanted me dead,

628
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,480
you have plenty of ways to do it.

629
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,000
Why risk poisoning yourself?

630
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,680
At the very least, you know your place.

631
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,440
Still, I'm curious.

632
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,840
Noble ladies from the capital

633
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,240
are usually pampered and sheltered.

634
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,200
You're a legitimate princess of Beiyuan.

635
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,600
How is it that you turned out
so cautious and meticulous?

636
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,320
It is precisely
because I'm the legitimate princess

637
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,600
that my every word and action
is scrutinized.

638
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,680
That's why I've learned

639
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,360
to notice the smallest details.

640
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,840
What do you think?

641
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,560
But now that you're part
of this household,

642
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,960
you need not tread so carefully

643
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,920
after this.

644
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,760
These dishes are your reward

645
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,520
for recognizing Meng Ping.

646
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,720
Tomorrow, the prince is hosting
a banquet at the deer park.

647
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,920
You'll accompany me.

648
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,680
By custom,

649
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,760
shouldn't Madam Meng

650
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,480
accompany you to the banquet?

651
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,160
Didn't you just say,

652
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,440
as a princess,

653
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
you're more thoughtful
with your conduct?

654
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,480
So you're naturally more composed
than others.

655
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,880
Besides,

656
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,840
you have a keen eye.

657
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,240
I trust you more.

658
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,600
No more discussion.

659
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,600
Just be ready.

660
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,800
Your Highness,

661
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,560
that scoundrel almost sounded

662
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,920
like a decent man today.

663
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,320
His words were practically pleasant.

664
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,560
When something feels off,
something is off.

665
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,920
We must be careful

666
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,360
at tomorrow's banquet.

667
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,780
(Xie)

668
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,860
(Xie)

669
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,900
(Xie)

670
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,720
Is everything ready for tomorrow?

671
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,640
Yes, Chancellor.

672
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,760
Preparations are complete.

673
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,120
But

674
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,920
Lady Jiang is still a Beiyuan princess.

675
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,240
She's only been here a few days.

676
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,840
If anything happens to her,

677
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,600
how will we explain it to His Majesty?

678
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,120
If the prince made the move,

679
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,360
why do I need to explain anything?

680
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,800
