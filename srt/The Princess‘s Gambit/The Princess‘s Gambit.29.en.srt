=Episode 29=

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,560
(Luocheng)
Chancellor, this is the place.

19
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,760
Luocheng, the exile ground of Beiyuan.

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,280
I'll go in first.

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,880
Take five men
and infiltrate as commoners.

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,360
Have the rest wait outside the city.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,600
Shall we get you a change of clothes?

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,560
No.

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,520
If anyone in the city recognizes me,

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,120
whether they are friend or foe,

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
they are the ones I need.

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
(whatever sacrifice must be made,)

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,440
(I swear I will never)

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,000

Princess!

49
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,640
Princess, what are you doing here?

50
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,540
(Qi)

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,860
(Dong Lang, Commander
of the Qi's border garrison at Dingyuan)

52
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,520
Welcome, Prince Wuxia.

53
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,520
General Dong, please rise.

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
You've held the border,

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,760
keeping Qi and the people safe.

56
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,800
It's commendable.

57
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,640
I should not receive such gesture.

58
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,760
Your Highness flatters me.

59
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,080
I have prepared a banquet

60
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,240
to welcome you.

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,280
This way, please.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,760
I wish to discuss the bandit crisis
with you immediately.

63
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,720
As for the banquet,

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,040
let it reward the soldiers.

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,040
What do you think?

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,600
You take care of the people

67
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,680
and state affairs.

68
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,920
I admire that.

69
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,360
Please head inside.

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,680
Let us discuss it in the tent.

71
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,960
General Dong.

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,040
I received a report on my way here

73
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
saying the bandits
have fled toward Beiyuan.

74
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,240
What's the current situation?

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,720
Your Highness,

76
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,800
the bandits

77
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,800
have now crossed into Beiyuan territory.

78
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,240
If I send troops to pursue them now,

79
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,800
it could provoke a war.

80
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
What I can do is defend the border.

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,080
If the bandits dare strike again,

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,920
they will never make it back alive.

83
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,080
What about the Qi citizens
taken to Beiyuan?

84
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,720
I will send men at once

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,280
to deliver aid
and comfort to their families.

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,600
As the sages say,

87
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,520
love your people

88
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,800
as you love your children.

89
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,800
If your own children were taken,

90
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,720
would this be your decision too?

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,920
Your Highness.

92
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,040
Only a few dozen citizens were taken.

93
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,400
If I recklessly send troops

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,360
and start a war between nations,

95
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,040
the ones who will suffer most

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,800
will be tens of thousands of innocents.

97
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,200
Please consider the big picture

98
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,960
and avoid unnecessary conflict,

99
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,920
so as not to let down
His Majesty's trust in you.

100
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,480
I understand what you mean, General.

101
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,840
But there is always another way.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,360
All I want is to rescue those people.

103
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,360
And all you need to do is
send a team of soldiers

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
disguised as civilians.

105
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,880
Without the uniform,

106
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,480
they are just common folks.

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,720
I'm just a soldier,

108
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,680
not one for tricks and schemes.

109
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,680
You should really learn
from the Left Chancellor

110
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,840
about being flexible and pragmatic.

111
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,720
Your Highness,

112
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,880
guarding the border is a serious duty.

113
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,320
I can't just abandon my post.

114
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,120
Besides, you lack military training.

115
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,960
I can't obey this order.

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,720
Mu Wuxia,

117
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,840
I always thought

118
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,480
you disapproved of my brother's ways.

119
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,280
But after the exam incident,

120
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,360
you've really changed.

121
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
I'm not a rigid person.

122
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,320
I can learn from others' strengths.

123
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,840
But the people

124
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,160
are in trouble,

125
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,880
I'm obliged to act.

126
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,280
Look,

127
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,520
we'll slip away

128
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,520
and sneak into Beiyuan.

129
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,320
Play it by ear.

130
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,880
Your Highness, your safety matters most.

131
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,720
This is reckless.

132
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,040
Can't you see His Majesty's intention?

133
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,400
He sent you here

134
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,800
not just to deal with bandits,

135
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,640
but to earn military merit.

136
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,280
He's paving your path forward.

137
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,440
Of course I can sense it.

138
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,320
But compared to people's lives,

139
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,120
what does my future matter?

140
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,320
But,

141
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,680
what if those people are already dead?

142
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,920
I'll still have a clear conscience.

143
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,880
Enough.

144
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,480
My mind's made up.

145
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
Mu Wuxia, I support you.

146
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
I'll go with you.

147
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,640
(This journey is dangerous.)

148
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,880
(Qingying,)

149
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,840
(are you sure you want to come?)

150
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,960
(If we can save those people,)

151
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
(I'm not afraid.)

152
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,440
(If we're of one heart,)

153
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,920
(we can accomplish anything.)

154
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,540
(Luocheng)

155
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,200
Your Highness,
we've arrived at Luocheng.

156
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,360
Commander Cui reports that

157
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,000
Jiang Taohua and Shen Zaiye
have entered the city.

158
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,200
What about Mu Wuxia?

159
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,880
Commander Cui asks
Your Highness to go to the tower

160
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,800
and see for yourself.

161
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,120
Your Highness,

162
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,560
the fish are gathering.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,360
To catch fish,

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,360
you need bait.

165
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,620
Make sure to capture Jiang Changjue.

166
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,960
Before nightfall,

167
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,200
no one here

168
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,480
is allowed to leave.

169
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,860
(Luocheng Inn)

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,640
Qingtai,

171
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,240
since you last saw Changjue,

172
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
have you seen him again?

173
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,560
I've gone to
the quarry daily since then,

174
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,320
but I've never seen
Prince Changjue again.

175
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,920
According to Prince Wuyin,

176
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,000
Changjue was to be executed

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,160
under military law here.

178
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,840
Do you know

179
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
where the prison is?

180
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,200
I've looked for it before,

181
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,520
but no sign of Prince Changjue.

182
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,880
I even searched

183
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,200
Commander Deng's residence,

184
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,400
no sign of him either.

185
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,840
Could it be

186
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,840
he isn't in Luocheng at all?

187
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,060
What Prince Wuyin said
about a military trial

188
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,760
could just be

189
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,520
a scheme to lure Shen Zaiye and me here.

190
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,280
Your Highness, I don't think so.

191
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,160
This city is tightly guarded
and hard to get out.

192
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,600
Prince Changjue was always under watch.

193
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,240
Escaping would be difficult.

194
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,520
Maybe he's hiding somewhere nearby.

195
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
He is lying low for now.

196
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,160
You said

197
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,480
he often helped others
while in Luocheng.

198
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,080
Someone might be sheltering him.

199
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,200
That's possible too.

200
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,280
Let's go ask around.

201
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,680
Maybe we'll learn

202
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,000
where he usually went.

203
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,280
Better than stumbling around

204
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,160
with no clue.

205
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,440
Right.

206
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,960
Let's go.

207
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,160
By the way,

208
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
when did you meet Zhan Lu?

209
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,440
Six days ago.

210
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,880
That means

211
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,360
after Shen Zaiye heard
I sent you to find Changjue,

212
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,240
he sent Zhan Lu to help.

213
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,680
Even after all the harsh things I said,

214
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,160
and how I pushed him away,

215
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,080
he still came to Luocheng.

216
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,840
Your Highness.

217
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,680
Do you not want the Chancellor to come?

218
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,760
Isn't it good that he's here to help?

219
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,360
No. This is a trap.

220
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,920
I don't know what Empress Lv

221
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,080
and Prince Wuyin are planning.

222
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,000
But for Changjue,

223
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,000
I had to come,

224
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,440
even if it's walking into a trap.

225
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,800
But it's different for him.

226
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
I don't want him

227
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,320
risking his life with me.

228
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,120
Princess,

229
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
if you care for each other,
why be so stubborn?

230
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,400
Since this place is so dangerous,

231
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,880
let's find Prince Changjue quickly

232
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and get out of here.

233
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
(Zhan Lu's mark.)

234
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,160
Chancellor.

235
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,840
Oh, it's you, Miss.

236
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,160
Mrs. Liu, has Censor Liu returned?

237
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,760
He should be back soon.

238
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,680
Mrs. Liu,

239
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,880
may we wait inside for him?

240
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,040
Please, come in.

241
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,920
Mother, we have guests.

242
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,640
Guests?

243
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,080
Your Highness!

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,040
Please rise, Madam Liu.

245
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,920
Your Highness!

246
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,400
Do you still remember me?

247
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,840
How could I dare forget?

248
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,800
Empress Helan always
looked after the Liu family.

249
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
And here in Luocheng,

250
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Prince Changjue
has helped us many times.

251
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,040
But...

252
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
I heard rumors

253
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,040
that you fell to your death in Qi.

254
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,960
How...

255
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,640
It's a long story.

256
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,080
I came today

257
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
to ask about Changjue.

258
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,160
Prince Changjue?

259
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,600
My husband mentioned a few days ago

260
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,880
that he's gone missing.

261
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,280
But he didn't say much.

262
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,760
My husband and father are back.

263
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,840
I'll go greet them.

264
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,360
Greetings, Your Highness.

265
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,480
Please rise, Censor Liu.

266
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,400
Your Highness, I never thought

267
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,920
I'd live to see you again.

268
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,760
Word spread that
you'd fallen off a cliff and died.

269
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,360
But how could I believe such nonsense?

270
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Later, Prince Changjue told me

271
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,240
you were still alive.

272
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,320
Only then did I feel at ease.

273
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,200
Your wife just said
she didn't know I was alive,

274
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,780
but you've seen
Prince Changjue recently?

275
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,040
He told you I was alive, didn't he?

276
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,480
Well...

277
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,920
Didn't he?

278
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,440
Dear.

279
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,360
Just tell her what you know.

280
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,840
She's his sister.

281
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,920
You can't lie to her.

282
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,880
Truth be told,

283
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,800
after Prince Changjue escaped,

284
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,840
I was the one who hid him.

285
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,720
Your Highness,
please wait here a moment.

286
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,440
I'll bring Prince Changjue here.

287
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,080
Yes!

288
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,880
So,

289
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,880
you don't know where Taohua went?

290
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,440
Is she safe?

291
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
Don't worry.

292
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,000
She's with Qingtai.

293
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,360
But after seeing Qingtai,

294
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,880
she didn't speak to me at all.

295
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,360
They went back to their room,

296
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,480
and I left on my own.

297
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,040
You didn't eavesdrop?

298
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,600
Strange.

299
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,080
Since I entered the city,

300
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,640
nothing has happened.

301
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,080
Isn't that a good thing?

302
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,240
If Empress Lv really wanted Taohua dead,

303
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,560
cutting off the antidote
would be the fastest.

304
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,240
But instead, she used Changjue as bait

305
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,800
to lure Taohua here.

306
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,000
I must be the real target.

307
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,400
But just now,

308
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,280
I wandered the city alone for ages,

309
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,000
and no one tried to kill me.

310
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,800
Did you see Changjue?

311
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,960
Qingtai said Prince Changjue vanished.

312
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,760
She's searched the city, too.

313
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,720
To Empress Lv,

314
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,960
a living Jiang Changjue

315
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,600
is more useful as bait

316
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,920
than a dead one.

317
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,840
If he is missing,

318
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,880
then he is likely still alive.

319
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,640
Zhan Lu, let's split up
and find Taohua and Changjue.

320
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,560
We must keep them
from falling into her hands.

321
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,480
Yes, sir.

322
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,480
Commander,

323
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,240
we spotted Prince Changjue.

324
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,520
He's heading to Censor Liu's home.

325
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,080
Jiang Taohua is there too.

326
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,840
The fish took the bait.

327
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,480
Take more men.

328
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,640
Bring them all in.

329
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,240
Yes, sir.

330
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,120
Your Highness,

331
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,280
would you like to rest inside?

332
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,280
Taohua?

333
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,640
Taohua!

334
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,600
Changjue!

335
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,680
Taohua!

336
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,920
Stay alive!

337
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,960
Taohua...

338
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,840
You've grown.

339
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,520
And tanned too.

340
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,720
Taohua...

341
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,480
You actually

342
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,240
haven't changed much.

343
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,320
Changjue...

344
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,360
I missed you so much.

345
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,760
Taohua...

346
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,400
I missed you too.

347
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,360
Watch out!

348
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,680
Everyone, surrender now

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
or die!

350
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,880
Get inside!

351
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,440
Changjue!

352
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
It's not safe here!

353
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,400
Taohua!

354
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,200
Shen Zaiye!

355
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,440
Get down!

356
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,040
Watch out!

357
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,880
(This won't do.)

358
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,240
(Shen Zaiye and Changjue)

359
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,520
(can't hold out forever.)

360
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,480
Qingtai, cover me!

361
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,000
Shen Zaiye!

362
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,920
Qingtai, cover the Chancellor!

363
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,480
Go! Fall back!

364
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,800
Thank you.

365
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,840
Shen Zaiye...

366
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,680
(You came anyway.)

367
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,880
Do you know Empress Lv lured you here

368
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,040
just to kill you?

369
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,280
I know.

370
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,440
Now that Changjue is safe,

371
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,080
we need to leave now.

372
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,240
Yes.

373
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,240
Useless fools.

374
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,440
You let them get away
and blew our cover.

375
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,480
What should I tell Her Highness?

376
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,640
Commander Cui,

377
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,520
we were driven back by Shen Zaiye,

378
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,600
but it's confirmed

379
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,560
the Jiang siblings have joined him.

380
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,680
What now?

381
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,000
Keep an eye on them.

382
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,360
If they try to leave the city,

383
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,280
report immediately.

384
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,800
Get everything ready.

385
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,600
Tonight,

386
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,040
we'll put on a show for Her Highness.

387
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,840
Yes, sir.

388
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,960
Commander Cui said

389
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,720
these things must be handled carefully.

390
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,760
Take that side, I'll take this one.

391
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,320
Got it.

392
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,640
In Luocheng,
night soil haulers work by day.

393
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,480
But collection is done at midnight.

394
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,040
It's bitumen and saltpeter.

395
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,520
With sulfur and sawdust in saltpeter,

396
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,400
it's highly volatile.

397
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,800
This man must be
one of Empress Lv's assassins.

398
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,840
Which means

399
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,480
there could be more in the city.

400
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,160
Could it be

401
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,920
Empress Lv plans to trap us here

402
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,680
and blow us up?

403
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,960
There are still so many civilians here.

404
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,440
How can she be so ruthless?

405
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,880
People that cruel

406
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,800
don't think like the rest of us.

407
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,000
We'd better stay alert.

408
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,880
I've treated you well.

409
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,520
So why...

410
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,800
There is nothing

411
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
in this world

412
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,280
that is more satisfying

413
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,640
than watching your enemy suffer.

414
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,760
If that's the case,

415
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,000
knowing Empress Lv,

416
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,760
she'll want to oversee it herself.

417
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,520
She must already be in Luocheng.

418
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,920
Your Highness,

419
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,160
everything is ready and in place.

420
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,040
On your command,

421
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,840
we'll blow them to pieces.

422
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,840
Soon,

423
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,680
no one will stand in the way

424
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,960
of Your Highness's grand ambition.

425
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,120
Excellent.

426
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,440
Let them taste

427
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,600
what it means to be reduced to ashes.

428
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,000
Chancellor, the carriage is ready.

429
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,520
Chancellor,

430
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,040
you must leave now.

431
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,800
The people of Beiyuan are in danger.

432
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
The royal family of Beiyuan
must answer for this.

433
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,120
Don't risk your life.

434
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,520
Zhanlu, Wu Jiang,

435
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,960
change of plans.

436
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,690
Gather the hidden guards
outside the city.

437
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,440
Be ready to assist.

438
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,520
I'll stay in the city

439
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,000
and find a way to break through.

440
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,200
We must help the people
of Luocheng survive this.

441
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,520
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.

442
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,040
This is Beiyuan soil.

443
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,560
You are Qi's Left Chancellor.

444
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,400
You shouldn't

445
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,840
and mustn't do this.

446
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,720
Whether for the people or myself,

447
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,120
this is what I must do.

448
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,320
Chancellor Shen, you're noble.

449
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,720
I'll inform Commandant Deng.

450
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,720
With his order,

451
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,320
we'll have more help.

452
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,720
Good. Let's split up.

453
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,100
(Luocheng Commandant's Residence)

454
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,880
Commandant Deng!

455
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,920
Prince Changjue?

456
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,280
I've been searching for you,

457
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,040
and here you walk right in. Guards!

458
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,040
Aren't you curious why I came?

459
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,280
Luocheng will be

460
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
struck with a calamity.

461
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,800
Do you realize that right now,

462
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,360
Luocheng is filled
with bitumen and saltpeter?

463
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,160
What a joke.

464
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,600
Half of Beiyuan's

465
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,000
bitumen and saltpeter
come from Luocheng.

466
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,600
It'd be strange if the city

467
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,440
didn't have them everywhere.

468
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,880
But what if someone

469
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,960
deliberately planted them
in hidden spots throughout the city...

470
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
And even mixed

471
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,440
sulfur and charcoal into the saltpeter?

472
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,040
Commandant Deng,

473
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,600
evacuate the citizens immediately.

474
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,040
Why should I believe you?

475
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,240
If nothing happens

476
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,880
and I evacuate the city over rumors,

477
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,840
that chaos,

478
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,640
will let the exiles escape.

479
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,320
Are you just trying to
drag me down with you?

480
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
Lanterns!
They're lighting the sky lanterns!

481
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,080
Lanterns are going up!

482
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,120
Look, lanterns!

483
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,920
Beiyuan's Lantern Festival

484
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,040
was meant to bless us with peace.

485
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,680
But Empress Lv

486
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,920
has twisted it for evil.

487
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,320
We must find out
when the explosives will be detonated.

488
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,180
We can't let this night
turn into a tragedy.

489
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:01,920
This way.

490
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,720
Chancellor.

491
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,560
Do you notice
anything off about this place?

492
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,840
If Empress Lv plans to use gunpowder,

493
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,080
she would have hidden the saltpeter

494
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,240
in some remote location first.

495
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,920
There is saltpeter here too.

496
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:51,720
Talk.

497
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,360
When do you plan to strike?

498
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,960
What's the signal?

499
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,640
An assassin.

500
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,160
Search the next place.

501
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,560
Chancellor.

502
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Let me bandage that wound for you.

503
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,640
It's nothing. Just a scratch.

504
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,520
We have a crisis.

505
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,520
Let's move.

506
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,600
Let's split up and search for clues.

507
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,920
Would you like some, sir?

508
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,280
Sir,

509
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,360
one for me.

510
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,200
You got it.

511
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,120
Freshly sliced.

512
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,520
Here you go. Enjoy.

513
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,800
Sir...

514
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,520
Have you seen anyone strange

515
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,960
in the city lately?

516
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,680
Anyone strange?

517
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,080
Can't say I have.

518
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,120
But folks like you and the young lady

519
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,480
are common here.

520
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,360
Who's there?

521
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,840
Hua?

522
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,960
Leave us.

523
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

524
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,320
Hua...

525
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,080
What brings you here?

526
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,000
I came to the city

527
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,840
to spend the festival

528
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,880
with you.

529
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,400
Hua,

530
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,080
aren't you

531
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,880
happy to see me?

532
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,000
Happy?

533
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,520
I can't afford

534
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,720
to let anyone see you here.

535
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,560
I won't allow my plan to fail.

536
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,960
Hua,

537
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,760
tell me.

538
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,000
Did you miss me even just a little?

539
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,400
Even just the tiniest bit?

540
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,880
Didn't we just see each other last year?

541
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,040
But that was last year.

542
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,200
Every day I spent without you

543
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,520
only made me miss you more.

544
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,360
You only distract me.

545
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,600
Go back to Qi now.

546
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,440
What's the hurry?

547
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,200
We must put the bigger picture first.

548
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,640
Yujing needs you right now.

549
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,480
As for us,

550
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,600
we'll have time.

551
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,440
Why is it always
about the bigger picture?

552
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,400
Always about some plan?

553
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,520
Do I even matter to you at all?

554
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,600
You're all grown up.

555
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,360
Stop throwing tantrums.

556
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,120
We've planned this for so long.

557
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,160
Isn't it all for a moment of victory?

558
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
So we can finally live the life we want?

559
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
I came all this way

560
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,520
just to spend
the Sky Lantern Festival with you.

561
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,400
And you think a few words

562
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,320
are enough to send me away?

563
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,320
Father's been addicted to elixirs.

564
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,560
His dosage keeps going up.

565
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
In less than six months,

566
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,200
his body won't hold up.

567
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,120
No cure will help him then.

568
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,400
Hua.

569
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,880
Don't worry.

570
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,560
Yujing

571
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,960
has Meng Zhongyan on watch.

572
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,720
Shen Zaiye and Mu Wuxia are both away.

573
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,760
Nothing's going to happen.

574
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,200
I'm just worried
things might change suddenly.

575
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,200
In that case,

576
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,680
let's go.

577
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,120
Time's running out.

578
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,800
Go where?

579
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,760
To help you with your "greater good".

580
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,240
Aren't you waiting

581
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,880
for the last signal?

582
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,240
Hua...

583
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Sir, Miss,

584
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,040
how about a lantern?

585
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,000
Mine are guaranteed to work!

586
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Guaranteed?

587
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,560
It's our tradition in Beiyuan.

588
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,720
Write down your wish,

589
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,680
stick it on the lantern,

590
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,840
and the higher it flies,

591
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,600
the more likely it is to come true.

592
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Alright, I'll take one.

593
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,320
Great!

594
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,480
Wishing you both
everything your hearts desire!

595
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,680
So many wishes...

596
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,400
Which should I write?

597
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,400
Would writing them all be too much?

598
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,480
Mu Wuxia, what are you wishing for?

599
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,600
I hope we find the bandits soon

600
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,640
and rescue the people.

601
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,200
And I also hope

602
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,360
that Qi

603
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,880
will flourish for generations.

604
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,200
Lame. Not even one thought about me?

605
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,880
I'll write mine.

606
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,080
Don't peek!

607
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,960
Turn around!

608
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,040
Alright.

609
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,160
(I wish to find the bandits soon,)

610
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,160
(and save the people.)

611
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,600
(I wish for a long and prosperous Qi.)

612
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,320
(I wish for my brother
and the Princess to stay together.)

613
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,200
(And also...)

614
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,280
(Wish for a lifetime
of joy with Mu Wuxia.)

615
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Let the lanterns fly!

616
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,240
Time to light the lanterns!

617
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,320
Let's release the lanterns!

618
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,800
Wait for me!

619
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,080
- Hurry, light the lanterns!
- Let's go, it's lantern time!

620
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,120
Count me in too!

621
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,000
Let's go!

622
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,360
I'll go. Stay here and wait for me.

623
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,880
Be careful.

624
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,760
Let's move to the next spot.

625
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,520
Did you notice?

626
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,440
That person kept looking up at the sky.

627
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,440
He might be waiting for a signal to act.

628
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,960
A signal in the sky?

629
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,720
In the dark of night,

630
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,680
arrows won't be visible.

631
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,600
- The lanterns.
