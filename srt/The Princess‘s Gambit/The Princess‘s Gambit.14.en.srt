(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 14=

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
Madam, I heard Lady Jiang has woken up.

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,720
Should we go visit her?

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,440
Lady Jiang is smart.

21
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,200
I stopped her that day.

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,360
She should be suspecting me.

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,760
Best not to cause trouble for ourselves.

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,640
Lest I can't explain myself when asked.

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,520
Chancellor has been staying
in Lady Jiang's tent for the past few days.

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,160
Chancellor only left

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,520
when she woke up.

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,840
What's so good about Lady Jiang?

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,160
Chancellor...

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,990
He has fallen for her.

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,960
Heartless people aren't scary.

32
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,700
What's scary
is when someone heartless falls in love.

33
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,880
Lady Jiang was assassinated this time.

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,120
Shen Zaiye will never let it go easily.

35
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,600
It's going to blow up.

36
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,040
Keep your voice down.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,560
Prince Wugou's men must still be around.

38
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,320
Your Highness.

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,480
I found the traces of the escaped miner.

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,160
Is that true?

41
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

42
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,160
Good job, Shen Zaiye.

43
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,680
You almost got away

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,480
right under my nose.

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,240
Prepare the troops.

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,400
I want these people to disappear

47
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,240
without anyone noticing.

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,280
Yes.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,720
Shall we inform Mr. Meng?

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,280
Calculating the time,

51
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,390
Right Chancellor should have
just received the letter.

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,560
Will this operation...

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,960
Mr. Meng?

54
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,600
Discussing everything with Mr. Meng

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,400
will be too late.

56
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,840
Why don't you get prepared?

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes.

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,320
Shen Zaiye.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm the heir.

60
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,160
You can't beat me.

61
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,240
Alright.

62
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,320
Xuanzheng.

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,320
Let's do as we agreed this time.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
Don't worry, Right Chancellor.

65
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,800
The rainy season is approaching.

66
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,360
The dam repairs
can't be delayed any longer.

67
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,160
The Wang and Meng families
have been close for generations.

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,040
We stand and fall as one.

69
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,790
Right Chancellor,
I have something to report.

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,240
Excuse me.

71
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,880
There are some minor issues at home.

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,360
I will take my leave now.

73
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,080
Please do as you please.

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Sorry for bothering you.

75
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,200
Take care.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,400
Return to the capital immediately.

77
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:03,960
Yes.

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,720
Search it.

79
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,640
Oh no.

80
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,000
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,440
Don't move.

82
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,360
Aren't you
Prince Wugou's guard commander?

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,560
You don't really think

84
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,480
staying silent will buy you enough time

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,840
for Prince Wugou to save you, do you?

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,590
There's solid evidence
of privately operating a silver mine.

87
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,480
He even silenced witnesses
right under His Majesty's nose.

88
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,600
Prince Wugou
can't even save himself this time.

89
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,560
How can he help you?

90
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,280
Even if you won't come clean,

91
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,640
the miners will.

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,080
It's better to confess earlier.

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,000
At least you might
still protect your wife and children.

94
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,160
Think about it carefully.

95
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,760
Send the signal.

96
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,040
Check in that direction.

97
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,080
See who it is and what it is.

98
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,360
Yes.

99
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,200
Why did you come so late at night?

100
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,640
Come and have a drink.

101
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,880
Sit.

102
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,880
Here.

103
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,040
Here.

104
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,680
Come on.

105
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,560
Huaijin.

106
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,560
What's the matter?

107
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,120
Did you send someone
to assassinate the miners?

108
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,400
Didn't you also say that Father
had no intention of abolishing the heir?

109
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,720
Keeping those miners
would be a nuisance.

110
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,280
As long as it's done cleanly,

111
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,760
nothing would happen

112
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,640
even if Father noticed.

113
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,920
Nothing would happen?

114
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,280
All the men you sent
have been captured by Shen Zaiye.

115
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,480
The fireworks just now were the signal.

116
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,640
It's why I came to you.

117
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,360
I didn't expect
you were celebrating in advance.

118
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,640
Huaijin.

119
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,560
Are you joking?

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,840
I never joke about court affairs!

121
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,800
I told you to stay put before.

122
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,600
You...

123
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,000
Forget it.

124
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,440
At this point,

125
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,820
it's pointless to say more.

126
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,200
It has a point.

127
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,840
It has a point.

128
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,680
Huaijin, teach me.

129
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,640
When Father asks me later,

130
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
how should I answer?

131
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,040
All my previous judgments

132
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,560
were based on His Majesty's desire
to balance the court forces

133
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,620
and the tacit understanding
with the noble families.

134
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,600
But if someone
makes it known to everyone

135
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,920
and remove this fig leaf,

136
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,000
His Majesty has to give an explanation
to the officials and the people,

137
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,600
even if His Majesty doesn't want to.

138
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,160
If my guess is correct,

139
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,640
the fireworks just now

140
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,560
have startled the entire hunting ground.

141
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,880
Shen Zaiye is targeting you.

142
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,200
There's nothing I can do about this.

143
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
No.

144
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,040
No.

145
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,080
Father

146
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,040
won't abolish me.

147
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,000
No.

148
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,680
This is just like
the gambling house incident.

149
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,720
As long as my men insist

150
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,660
that I didn't order it,

151
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,920
it won't matter.

152
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,760
Where's Uncle?

153
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,400
What are his instructions?

154
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,860
His Majesty has ordered to temporarily
detain Prince Wugou in the tent!

155
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,150
He isn't allowed to leave
without His Majesty's order.

156
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,760
I want to see Father.

157
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,640
You sycophants.

158
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,080
You'll be in trouble when I get out!

159
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,760
I'm still the heir.

160
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,120
I want to see Father!

161
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,160
Huaijin.

162
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,440
Say something.

163
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
Are we just going to wait here?

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,560
Who knows what false charges

165
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,560
Shen Zaiye is accusing me of out there?

166
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,280
Your Highness.

167
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,480
Does Shen Zaiye have to accuse you
for this crime?

168
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,240
Privately operating a silver mine
is the biggest crime.

169
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,990
What deep hatred
does Shen Zaiye have against me

170
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,000
to do everything possible

171
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,880
to put me to death?

172
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
Sir, our madam is the chancellor's wife.

173
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,360
Before she leaves,

174
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,960
she wishes to send some hot food

175
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,400
to warm Prince Wugou and Lord Meng.

176
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,890
I'm the chancellor's wife, but I'm also
the Meng family's legitimate daughter.

177
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,560
I hope you'll make an exception.

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,990
Madam, please forgive us.

179
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,520
His Majesty has issued the decree.

180
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,990
Before the trial in the capital,

181
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,800
no one is allowed
to approach the accused.

182
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,400
Please forgive us.

183
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,920
I dare not disobey.

184
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,520
Sir, you're heartless.

185
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,560
Zhenzhen.

186
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,720
Go back.

187
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,990
Don't make it difficult for them.

188
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,640
Yuetao.

189
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,240
Come back.

190
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,990
Since His Majesty has issued the decree,
let's not leave room for gossip

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,410
or bring more trouble upon Huaijin.

192
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,720
Zhan Lu.

193
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,520
Your Highness,
it's time to take your medicine.

194
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,720
Good medicine never taste good.

195
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,520
Hurry and drink it.

196
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,310
Before Lady Jiang's injury heals,

197
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,360
ask the kitchen
to prepare special meals for her.

198
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,640
No spicy or greasy food.

199
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,840
Spare ginger, garlic and the like
as much as possible.

200
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,480
Give her a light diet,

201
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,720
but she can't have only porridge
for all meals.

202
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,580
The body needs nourishing tonics
to replenish energy and blood.

203
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,180
Head to the storeroom
for any herbs that are lacking.

204
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,200
If we don't have any,

205
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,040
give me a list.

206
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,760
Yes.

207
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,960
Don't you want to go in and take a look?

208
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,480
No, it's time to go to court.

209
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,240
His Majesty has arrived!

210
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,600
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

211
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,280
You may rise.

212
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,490
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

213
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,120
Bring him here.

214
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,680
Let me go.

215
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,840
I can walk on my own.

216
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,680
Let me go. I can walk on my own.

217
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,760
Father, I'm innocent.

218
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,280
No.

219
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,760
I was momentarily foolish
that I made a mistake.

220
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,040
Since I've been obedient

221
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,400
all these years,

222
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,000
forgive me, Father.

223
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,440
Chancellor Shen.

224
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,000
Yes.

225
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Alright.

226
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,320
I really underestimated you.

227
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,840
Privately operating a silver mine.

228
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,200
Bullying and exploiting the people.

229
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,840
Each case has solid evidence.

230
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,790
Are you still going
to plead your innocence?

231
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,240
Father, I admit my mistake.

232
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,120
I admit my mistake!

233
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,240
I really admit my mistake.

234
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,120
Please give me another chance.

235
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,680
Father, I admit my mistake.

236
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,120
I...

237
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
I will never do it again.

238
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
I admit my mistake.

239
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,280
I admit my mistake.

240
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,760
I really admit my mistake.

241
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,680
Father.

242
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,080
Draft the edict.

243
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,520
Prince Wugou lacks virtue,

244
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,920
disregards the law,

245
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,880
illegally operates a silver mine,

246
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,960
and bullies the people.

247
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,840
Even a prince
is no exception to the law.

248
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,390
Today, Prince Wugou
is deposed from his position as heir.

249
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,760
He will be imprisoned in the palace.
Announce it

250
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,200
so that everyone knows.

251
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,280
Shen Zaiye.

252
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,760
If you hadn't plotted against me,

253
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,990
would I have ended up like this?

254
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,360
You put me in this situation!

255
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,280
You're gravely mistaken.

256
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,840
If you hadn't made a mistake,

257
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,880
I

258
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,320
wouldn't have found so much evidence.

259
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,320
You...

260
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,520
Drag this disgrace out!

261
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,280
Father.

262
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,400
Father!

263
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,520
Father, I admit my mistake!

264
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,600
I admit my mistake!

265
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,240
I really admit my mistake!

266
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,680
This matter ends here.

267
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,400
Your Majesty.

268
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,200
Prince Wugou's crime

269
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,090
were largely assisted
by the Meng family.

270
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,520
I have all the records here.

271
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,880
May I ask Your Majesty what punishment

272
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,180
does the Meng family deserve?

273
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,080
Do you want to make decisions
for His Majesty?

274
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
I have no such intention.

275
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,530
It's just that His Highness's fault

276
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,840
is also the Meng family's fault.

277
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,790
Should Your Majesty
show leniency this time,

278
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,990
how shall Your Majesty
uphold Qi's moral integrity?

279
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,280
And how shall Qi uphold
Your Majesty's honor?

280
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,240
Everything I've done

281
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,320
is for the country and for Your Majesty.

282
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,400
I ask that Your Majesty
judge with clarity.

283
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,080
Chancellor Shen worked hard for Qi.

284
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,240
How

285
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
could I misunderstand you?

286
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,880
Don't talk nonsense.

287
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
The Meng family

288
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,720
instigated Prince Wugou
to commit such a heinous crime.

289
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,520
They should be severely punished,

290
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,360
but

291
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,000
this is a serious matter.

292
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,600
Let me think about it.

293
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,730
Right Chancellor.

294
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,990
- Right Chancellor.
- Right Chancellor.

295
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,120
You traveled all the way here,

296
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,600
but it seems
that you're still a step too late.

297
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,240
In the past, all these people

298
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,000
flattered you.

299
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,160
But today, they're trying to avoid you.

300
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,400
I really feel sorry for you.

301
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,200
There's no need for pretenses

302
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,160
between us.

303
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,520
The outcome on the battlefield

304
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,620
has never been decided by the loss
or gain of a city or stronghold.

305
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,520
The same goes for court.

306
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,960
The east wind may prevail for now,

307
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,440
but who's to know

308
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,800
whether

309
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,280
the west wind
won't turn the tide one day?

310
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,600
I'll just wait

311
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,760
for your downfall.

312
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,640
Likewise.

313
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,120
Father.

314
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,640
You've suffered.

315
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,680
Even imprisoned,

316
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,560
you didn't lament or resent.

317
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,440
You're indeed
a descendant of the Meng family.

318
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,640
I failed you.

319
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,840
I failed to protect Prince Wugou.

320
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,640
You did nothing wrong.

321
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,760
The mistake was

322
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,840
the Meng family's misfortune

323
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,560
to have such an incompetent

324
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,840
and self-willed fool like your cousin.

325
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,680
Incapable of success, yet more
than capable of causing failure.

326
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,000
All the Meng family's

327
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,800
years of effort

328
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
is ruined overnight.

329
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,640
Prince Wugou has been deposed?

330
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,880
That's right.

331
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,840
I rushed back to Yujing,

332
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
but it's all settled

333
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,560
and irreversible.

334
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,400
If I had known,

335
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,880
I'd have risked my life

336
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,400
to stop Prince Wugou
from acting recklessly.

337
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
Even if this didn't happen,

338
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,200
there would be other things.

339
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,280
Prince Wugou
is unworthy of great duties.

340
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,640
But Huaijin,

341
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,280
because of Prince Wugou,

342
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,090
the Meng family can be said to be

343
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,280
surrounded by a pack of wolves.

344
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,320
We're hanging by a thread.

345
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,520
Everyone's waiting

346
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,480
to pounce

347
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,360
at our mistake

348
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,960
and shatter the Meng family.

349
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,380
We mustn't be the ones

350
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,080
to cause the Meng family's downfall.

351
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,680
That's why

352
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,320
we need to settle this
as soon as possible

353
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,680
so that the Meng family
can distance ourselves from this

354
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,800
and await the right moment.

355
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Do you understand?

356
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,120
Having enjoyed the Meng family's
care and honor since childhood,

357
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,680
it's only right that I repay them

358
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,640
in their time of crisis.

359
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,960
I understand.

360
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,400
But Father,

361
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,200
I only have one request.

362
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,880
Go ahead.

363
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,320
Zhenzhen is in a difficult situation
at Chancellor Residence.

364
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
As her older brother,

365
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,800
I haven't been able
to take care of her much.

366
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
After this,

367
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,520
let her live a easier life.

368
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,760
Don't worry.

369
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,520
No matter what,

370
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,480
Zhenzhen is still
the Meng family's legitimate daughter.

371
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,960
I won't let others

372
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
bully her.

373
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,120
Father.

374
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,480
I'm unfilial

375
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,880
for not being able
to take care of you anymore.

376
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,320
Get up.

377
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,720
Huaijin.

378
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,640
The Meng family is proud of you.

379
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,000
The moon

380
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,560
is beautiful.

381
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,140
(Shen Residence)

382
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
(Zhenzhen.)

383
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,600
(When you see this letter,)

384
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,320
(I should be gone.)

385
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,800
(God's will is uncertain.)

386
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,480
(The world is ever drifting)

387
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,080
(and unpredictable.)

388
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,360
(Fame and career are empty in the end.)

389
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,240
(Fortunately,
my parents are still alive.)

390
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,990
(And I have my wife and younger sister.)

391
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,720
(If I can save my clan with my life,)

392
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,000
(I'll rest)

393
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,520
(in peace.)

394
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,320
(However,)

395
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,960
(thinking of your situation
in Chancellor Residence,)

396
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,920
(I'm afraid I won't have the chance
to take care of you again.)

397
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,440
(Don't go to extremes.)

398
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,360
(Chancellor Shen isn't the kind
to drive others to ruin.)

399
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,800
(Father also promised me)

400
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,360
(to take good care of you.)

401
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,240
(This way,)

402
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
(I have no regrets.)

403
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,520
(Meng Huaijin's Final Letter)

404
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,240
Madam.

405
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,960
Let me put the letter away for you.

406
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,120
If I had known that day
was the last time we would meet,

407
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,480
I would have disobeyed orders to see him.

408
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,160
It's a pity that Huaijin

409
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,480
didn't get to drink that bowl of soup.

410
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,960
Madam.

411
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,640
At least you bid goodbye

412
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,520
to Mr. Meng with a smile.

413
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
I didn't expect

414
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,640
Father to sacrifice

415
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,240
even his own son

416
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,960
just to save the family.

417
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,520
Huaijin seems to be
the son of a noble family,

418
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,480
but he's just a pawn
to pave the way for the family.

419
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,920
I'm the same.

420
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,480
All the Meng family members
are the same.

421
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,720
Even Father isn't immune.

422
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,960
Being a father

423
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,580
is less important than the patriarch
of the Meng family and Right Chancellor.

424
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,800
The will of the noble family
determines Father's actions.

425
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,720
One day,

426
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,120
I will also be sacrificed
in the same way.

427
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,560
Madam.

428
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,520
Life is short.

429
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,720
Why worry

430
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,320
about something that hasn't happened?

431
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,720
Mr. Meng wants you to live well.

432
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,160
You're right.

433
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,440
I want to live well.

434
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,960
Someone, come!

435
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,560
Mr. Meng committed suicide!

436
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,860
(Confession Letter)

437
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,800
The Meng family

438
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,800
has been loyal for generations.

439
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,120
I never thought

440
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,240
my son to make such a big mistake.

441
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,990
A child's lack of discipline

442
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
is the father's fault.

443
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,520
I'm

444
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,600
ashamed to face Your Majesty.

445
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,720
I'm ashamed to face my ancestors.

446
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,760
I no longer have the face
to serve Your Majesty.

447
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,600
I hope Your Majesty

448
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,120
can show mercy and compassion.

449
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,360
Allow me

450
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,520
to beg for my son's remains

451
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,640
so that we can

452
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,640
to retire to the countryside together.

453
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,800
Right Chancellor.

454
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,000
No.

455
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,360
The court is in need of capable people.

456
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,120
How can you choose your household
over the country?

457
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,200
If we follow your logic,

458
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,520
Prince Wugou's sin

459
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,880
is all because

460
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,520
of my failure as a father.

461
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,720
Do you

462
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,360
want me to issue
a decree of guilt against myself?

463
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,840
I have no such intention.

464
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,440
It's just

465
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,280
that

466
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,560
I'm old and weak.

467
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,840
I also have no ambition.

468
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,600
If I remain in court,

469
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,400
I fear others
will accuse me of being power-hungry.

470
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,160
My reputation is nothing.

471
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,600
If this matter

472
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,240
implicates Your Majesty

473
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,720
another charge

474
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,640
of misjudgment,

475
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,360
I

476
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,880
will be guilty of a serious crime.

477
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,280
No need to say more.

478
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,840
Your petition

479
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,640
to resign

480
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,920
is

481
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,480
hereby denied.

482
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,280
Right Chancellor.

483
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,680
The Meng family

484
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,640
has thrived for a century.

485
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,490
You're deeply rooted and flourishing.

486
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,440
Even if you have some rotten apples,

487
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,280
just remove them.

488
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,240
Why destroy the whole clan

489
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,520
because of one person's fault?

490
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,520
My dear chancellor.

491
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,200
The court is hectic.

492
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,000
I still need you

493
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,880
to share some of the burden for me.

494
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,240
I'm

495
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,520
willing to lay down my life
for Your Majesty

496
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,320
without hesitation.

497
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,920
My dear chancellor.

498
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,200
My condolences.

499
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,120
Chancellor,
we've put so much effort into this.

500
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,080
You even put yourself
at the heart of the scheme,

501
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,850
but we still
can't overthrow the Meng family.

502
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,540
Why did His Majesty
handle it in this way?

503
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,840
His Majesty is reminding me

504
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,040
I'm just a blade he forged.

505
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,200
I can only cut

506
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,680
as much as he allows.

507
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
What's next then?

508
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,090
It doesn't matter.

509
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Even a centipede moves after death.

510
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,600
Not to mention the top noble family.

511
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,200
Now that they lost
Prince Wugou and Meng Huaijin,

512
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,600
the Meng family
has suffered a severe blow.

513
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,200
I have plenty of time to play with them.

514
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,480
We're a newly opened pastry shop.

515
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,760
Authentic Beiyuan specialties.

516
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,040
They're all delicious.
Limited quantity daily.

517
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,880
- I want some.
- I want some.

518
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,400
Come here.

519
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,360
Line up.

520
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,340
Everyone line up. If you don't line up,
I'm not selling any to you.

521
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,480
Line up.

522
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,860
Your Highness,
it's time to take your medicine.

523
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,600
Leave it there first.

524
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,640
Your Highness.

525
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,560
I heard that Madam Meng's brother

526
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,120
committed suicide in prison.

527
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,800
In that case,

528
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,080
Chancellor's plan succeeded.

529
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,480
Qing must have heard about

530
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,680
the news of Prince Wugou's deposition

531
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,040
and Meng Huaijin's suicide in prison.

532
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,720
Right now,

533
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,200
she must be angry at me

534
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
for not delivering the news sooner.

535
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,300
Deliver this letter to Yang Wanqing
as soon as possible.

536
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,560
Don't worry.

537
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,990
Recently, getting in and out
has gotten a lot easier for me.

538
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,280
So long as I claim
that you want some pastries or snacks,

539
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,480
they'll let me out.

540
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,160
He's not completely heartless.

541
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,280
Don't let your guard down.

542
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,160
I got involved defenseless.

543
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,000
One wrong move,

544
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,640
and the consequences will be disastrous.

545
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,600
Go now.

546
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,480
Alright.

547
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,560
Chancellor.

548
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,960
Do you want me to tell Her Highness
that you're here?

549
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,680
No need. I'm leaving.

550
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,510
We bought some pastries

551
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,160
for her Highness on our way back.

552
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,680
By the way,

553
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,120
His Majesty will hold

554
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,990
a modest tea banquet in the palace
in ten days.

555
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,480
If Her Highness is bored,

556
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,000
tell Zhan Lu.

557
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,500
He will arrange it.

558
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,640
Your Highness.

559
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,640
The treacherous chancellor said...

560
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,680
I heard everything.

561
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,990
There's going to be
a tea banquet in the palace.

562
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,640
This is a chance.

563
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,860
When that happens,

564
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,680
I'll find an excuse
to go to Lan Boutique

565
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
and meet Qing in person.

566
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,680
But

567
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,120
you have to stay by his side that day.

568
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,480
What if there's no chance?

569
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,880
I'll find another chance then.

570
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,560
I'm a spy.

571
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,920
I should take the risk.

572
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,790
Have a piece of pastry
to wash out the bitterness.

573
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,520
They are Beiyuan's cake.

574
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,200
You have to wait in line

575
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,680
a long time to get

576
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,640
their pastries.

577
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,860
Guess he's not that heartless.

578
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,440
Lady Jiang
has been recovering well recently.

579
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,400
Don't worry.

580
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,280
Don't call her Lady Jiang anymore.

581
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,640
What should I call her?

582
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,640
She's the princess of Beiyuan.

583
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,640
You should call her "Your Highness"

584
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,040
like Qingtai.

585
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,520
