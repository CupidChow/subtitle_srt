=Episode 17=

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,000
Your Highness.

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,240
You only took half the antidote.

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,720
Why don't I handle things today instead?

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,360
The Chancellor won't suspect us.

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,720
Yang Wanqing's the type

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,640
who jumps at any chance to pounce

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,000
if I slip up.

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,120
If I send you alone,

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,080
they will say
I didn't take it seriously.

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Still...

28
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,080
Don't worry.

29
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,200
I already have someone in mind.

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,280
Someone who can get us out of here

31
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,400
without raising
the Chancellor's suspicions.

32
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,080
Mu Wuxia actually had
the nerve to snub me?

33
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,120
Take this!

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,040
You look terribly upset.

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,160
Was it Prince Wuxia?

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,800
No.

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,200
Why would I be mad

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
at him?

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,800
But I just heard you say
he brushed you off.

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,600
Don't tell me our sweet little Qingying

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,760
has fallen for Prince Wuxia.

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,720
You're too sharp.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,080
How do you know everything?

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,680
Fine.

45
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,360
Mu Wuxia turned me down.

46
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,200
You're always glued to my brother.

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,280
It's just annoying.

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,400
Aren't you curious

49
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,760
why your brother and I
are so deeply in love?

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,640
I could teach you the way.

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,840
He turned me down.

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,200
Why would I like him at all?

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,160
Prince Wuxia isn't
the only man out there.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,960
You might meet someone else
down the road.

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
The skill could come in handy.

56
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,480
I've been looking everywhere for you.

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,920
What's going on?

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,680
I...

59
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,120
That's a secret between us girls.

60
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,840
Not telling you.

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,120
Let's go.

62
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,000
Chancellor.

63
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,840
Chancellor.

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Per your orders,

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,680
we pulled our men back.

66
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,440
We told Wang Xi to keep things normal

67
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,560
at Prince Wuxia's residence.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,640
The assassins lost patience.

69
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,120
They showed up outside his gate.

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,720
Let's go.

71
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,580
(Lip Rouge Shop)

72
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,720
Will this really work?

73
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,440
"A gentle lady makes a worthy match".

74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,640
Sometimes, we girls

75
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,080
need a little extra help

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,400
just to catch a man's eye.

77
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,960
Who is that ghoul in the mirror?

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,560
What's with that hideous makeup?

79
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,080
Sorry, Qingying.

80
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,560
I've never actually put on rouge
for anyone before.

81
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,040
My bad.

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,760
Here.

83
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,680
Hurry, hurry!

84
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
Could you fix it up for her?

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,520
If I ruin your business,

86
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll never live it down.

87
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,120
Of course.

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,080
Don't worry, Miss.

89
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,480
I'll fix you right up.

(Imperial Library)

91
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,620
(Wuliu Residence)

92
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,360
A touch of our rouge,

93
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,280
and any man will be mesmerized
by your beauty.

94
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,240
Jiang Taohua!

95
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,760
How do I look now?

96
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,680
Jiang Taohua?

97
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,680
She ditched me again!

98
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,000
But she wasn't wrong...

99
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,880
There are plenty of men in the world.

100
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,920
I'll find someone even better.

101
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,000
Go away!

102
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,120
You reek of sweat.

103
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
Handing out visiting cards like that?

104
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,200
Don't come back, or I'll crush you!

105
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,320
Tell your master this.

106
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,240
The day I rise to fame,

107
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,920
he'll regret how he treated me today.

108
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,040
Keep dreaming, brat.

109
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,240
Scram.

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,280
Here, your book.

111
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,040
And you are?

112
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,680
Just someone who couldn't
stand by and watch.

113
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,040
Is someone giving you a hard time?

114
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
I'll handle it for you.

115
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,800
Forget it.

116
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,240
It's just a piece I wrote.

117
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,560
It didn't catch that owner's eye.

118
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,960
I'll try my luck elsewhere.

119
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,240
Most people would keep it quiet

120
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,280
if their articles

121
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
got rejected.

122
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,320
But look at you,
not a care in the world.

123
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,920
My writing wasn't chosen,

124
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,600
that doesn't mean I lack talent.

125
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,640
It just means the person judging it

126
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,320
had no eye for brilliance.

127
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,560
It's easy to find gold,
but hard to find a kindred spirit.

128
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,000
If no one truly gets me,

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,720
I'll keep my work

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,560
to myself.

131
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,000
That temperament

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,480
feels oddly similar to mine.

133
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,680
Over eight feet tall,

134
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,240
with a handsome face.

135
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,400
Just a little on the skinny side.

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,240
No matter. I can feed him well.

137
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,520
There really are
so many better options.

138
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,380
I just met one as soon
as I stepped outside.

139
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,000
Hold up.

140
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,400
What's your name?

141
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,240
Li Jiaohan, at your service.

142
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,680
Mr. Li.

143
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,320
Fate must have brought us together
in the great city

144
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,360
of Yujing.

145
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,560
The weather's lovely today.

146
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,320
What say you and I
take a stroll around Lake Tai?

147
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,280
Fresh melons!

148
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,600
Fresh melons!

149
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
Sweet and juicy!

150
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,480
Come have a look!

151
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,440
Fresh melons!

152
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Where have you been?

153
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,960
Did you finish the master's task?

154
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,960
Tough one, isn't he?

155
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,040
Chancellor.

156
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,000
We got the poison pouch.

157
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,200
Anyone living in Yujing

158
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,440
must have heard about me.

159
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,440
Tell me what you know.

160
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,920
I'll make it quick for you.

161
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,440
Otherwise...

162
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,760
You're sharp, Chancellor Shen.

163
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,880
But guess what?

164
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,960
One set on dying

165
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,160
can always find a way.

166
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,640
He's biting his tongue!

167
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,600
Take him away.

168
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,520
Get something out of him.

169
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,040
Yes, sir.

170
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,160
(Strange...)

171
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,680
(Assassins always prioritize the target)

172
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,160
(and kill with one strike.)

173
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,520
(But why are these assassins)

174
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,760
(hiding in the marketplace?)

175
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,720
(Are they decoy?)

176
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,120
Zhan Lu, where's Prince Wuxia?

177
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,080
Wuliu Residence.

178
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's go to Wuliu Residence.

179
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,020
(Wuliu Residence)

180
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
To borrow a book,

181
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,160
please register here.

182
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,180
(Mu Wuxia, Wuliu Residence)

183
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,440
(So, Wuliu Residence is
Prince Wuxia's study.)

184
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,720
(Oh no!)

185
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,160
Wait!

186
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,720
Out of the way!

187
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,080
Move aside!

188
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,120
Clear the way!

189
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,000
Make way!

190
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,320
Mu Wuxia.

191
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,680
Heading to the Library?

192
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,480
Yes.

193
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,640
You just came out?

194
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:23,960
Indeed.

195
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,760
Whose book is this?

196
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,920
What are you reading? Is it any good?

197
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,400
"Chronicle of Unusual Spirits."

198
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,600
Give it a try.

199
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,720
Alright.

200
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
(A scholar is with Miss Qingying...)

201
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,120
(Who is he?)

202
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,520
Miss Qingying!

203
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,200
Hyah!

204
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,040
Hyah!

205
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,040
Whoa...

206
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,420
(Imperial Library)

207
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,900
(Wuliu Residence)

208
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,760
Why are you

209
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,360
here?

210
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,360
I thought

211
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,240
I'd surprise Qingying and Prince Wuxia.

212
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,640
I didn't expect you to catch me first.

213
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,440
Please don't tell anyone, alright?

214
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,240
What surprise?

215
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,760
Qingying has feelings for Prince Wuxia.

216
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,840
He clearly feels the same way about her.

217
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,000
I knew he'd come here today,

218
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,440
so I thought I'd hide

219
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
this red string ahead of time.

220
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,760
I'd tell him Qingying

221
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,920
made it specially for him.

222
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,880
Give them a nudge.

223
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,280
So, did you actually see Prince Wuxia?

224
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,000
No.

225
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:27,920
Oh right.

226
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,800
What brings you here?

227
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,800
Zhan Lu and I were tracking
a spy we've been investigating.

228
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,040
The trail led us here.

229
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,040
I've been here for a while,

230
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,240
I haven't seen any spies around.

231
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,600
Maybe they slipped away.

232
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,840
Where is Qingying?

233
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,240
She should be nearby.

234
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,280
I'll find her.

235
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,720
The city hasn't been safe.

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,760
Be careful.

237
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,400
You take care too, Chancellor.

238
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,880
Chancellor.

239
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,880
Did you find him?

240
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,640
Yes.

241
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,760
Prince Wuxia and Miss Qingying
are out together.

242
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,840
What about her?

243
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,640
Who?

244
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,440
The Princess just left.

245
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,440
She was heading toward the street.

246
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,520
Do you think...

247
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,440
Search the Library thoroughly.

248
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,600
See if anything's off.

249
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,040
Yes, sir.

250
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,120
What is the gentleman's name?

251
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,960
His surname's Zhu.

252
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,520
A pig at the gate, and a mutt's friends.

253
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,320
Shameless and petty.

254
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:16,960
Basically

255
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,840
a clueless, insufferable oaf.

256
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,320
That's not true.

257
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,280
Are you saying you understand women?

258
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,360
No, I mean...

259
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,760
I meant those insults you said

260
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,600
are not the same as the surname Zhu.

261
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,280
My surname is Mu.

262
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,400
I'm Li Jiaohan.

263
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,400
Mr. Mu, we've never met.

264
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,640
Yet, you insisted on joining us.

265
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,280
Are you perhaps acquainted
with Miss Qingying?

266
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,360
I...

267
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,880
I was just mesmerized

268
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,840
by the wonderful scenery.

269
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,760
I simply wanted to enjoy the view.

270
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,440
You insisted on sitting with us.

271
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Now, you killed the mood.

272
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,760
Why are you glaring at Mr. Li?

273
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,200
No one asked you to come.

274
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,680
I didn't...

275
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,280
Don't deny it.

276
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,960
I saw everything.

277
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,680
You've been glaring at him.

278
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
If you hate to be here,

279
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,480
just leave.

280
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,640
I'm not leaving.

281
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,120
Watch out.

282
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,760
I'm not leaving.

283
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,520
If I go, we all go.

284
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,240
Just go!

285
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,680
A watcher becomes part of the play.

286
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,040
Who'd have thought
he'd fall into the trap himself?

287
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,040
What nonsense is that?

288
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,120
Don't be ridiculous.

289
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,920
(Chronicle of Unusual Spirits)

290
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,560
Mr. Li,

291
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,080
have you been reading
Chronicle of Unusual Spirits lately?

292
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,400
A brilliant book.

293
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,320
A masterpiece.

294
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,680
Have you read it, Mr. Mu?

295
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,400
You absolutely must give it a try.

296
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,020
(Chronicle of Unusual Spirits)

297
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,760
You really think it's a masterpiece?

298
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,840
But the comment board at the Library

299
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,840
is filled with harsh criticism.

300
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,480
Most people don't think much of it.

301
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,080
They all say

302
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,960
the book is just
Mr. Nobody escaping reality.

303
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,400
It's a naïve, idealistic work.

304
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,960
But I think

305
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,760
what they said is total crap.

306
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,880
If policy is sound,

307
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,600
then the Peach Blossom Spring

308
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,120
that Jiang Kun longs for,

309
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,500
where people are safe and live
as equals, will become true.

310
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,520
Short-sighted people

311
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,480
will never understand
Mr. Nobody's message.

312
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,960
He was giving us hope.

313
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,920
You really believe

314
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,000
this book gives you hope?

315
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,880
Of course.

316
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,040
If you don't carry hope,

317
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,640
what's the point of life?

318
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,080
Right.

319
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,960
I feel the same way.

320
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
Sure, Jiang Kun's paradise

321
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,320
may seem out of reach,

322
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,360
but if even writers

323
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,600
start censoring themselves,

324
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
how's that any different
from the real world?

325
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,640
Great minds think alike.

326
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,760
We should drink to that.

327
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,120
Finding a kindred spirit

328
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,800
is worth celebrating with drinks!

329
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,360
Yes!

330
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,560
Come on.

331
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,720
Mr. Mu.

332
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,160
Mr. Li.

333
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,680
Li Jiaohan!

334
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,600
I asked you out first!

335
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,080
Why are you all happy with him?

336
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,480
A romance is pleasant,
but a kindred spirit is rarer.

337
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,200
Mr. Mu and I hit it off at first sight.

338
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,080
Of course I'm happy.

339
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,680
How joyful to wander the gardens,

340
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,160
endless wonders all around.

341
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,800
A hundred flowers in bloom,

342
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,200
terraces rise lofty and grand.

343
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,160
Woods interlace in wild harmony,

344
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,880
carps frolic in deep pools.

345
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,960
Pellets strike birds mid-flight,

346
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
lines cast to catch great fish.

347
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,800
I don't know this part.

348
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,320
Praises resound among the guests,

349
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,800
in harmony despite different voices.

350
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,480
Linchuan...

351
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,640
Linchuan offers fine wine,

352
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,240
songs rise with gleaming smiles.

353
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,160
Yes! Yes!

354
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,200
Elegant hands sweep across silk strings,

355
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,720
melodies drifting with the breeze.

356
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,520
Such a meeting is an utter delight.

357
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,400
If only Master Dongye
were here to see it!

358
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,560
Drinking in memory of the quiet soul,

359
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,200
who kept his heart steady to the end.

360
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,720
Enough poems!
Your pal fell into the lake!

361
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,160
Mr. Li!

362
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,200
I'm fine! I'm alright, Mr. Mu!

363
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,640
Mr. Li!

364
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,280
Let the seven strings speak,

365
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,480
and carry my thoughts to a kindred soul.

366
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,400
Why are you here?

367
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,960
I thought

368
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,040
I'd surprise Qingying and Prince Wuxia.

369
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,440
I didn't expect you to catch me first.

370
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,000
Please don't tell anyone.

371
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,280
(I hope it's a coincidence.)

372
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,800
(Maybe I'm overthinking it.)

373
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,360
Chancellor.

374
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,040
No trouble in the Library.

375
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,040
But earlier this evening,

376
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,990
at Wuliu Residence,
where Prince Wuxia frequents,

377
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,280
we found a dead rat.

378
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,640
There were no visible wounds.

379
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,320
It looked more like poisoning.

380
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,360
But what's odd is that

381
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,840
the Library hasn't used
any rat poison recently.

382
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,480
When you entered Wuliu Residence,

383
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,760
did you notice a faint,
strange fragrance?

384
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,440
Yes.

385
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,800
There was a trace
of powdery perfume in the air,

386
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,440
mixed with something else...

387
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
The scent of soap pods.

388
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,960
Very distinct.

389
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,520
I've never smelled it before.

390
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,360
Follow that lead.

391
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,840
Understood.

392
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,160
By the way, Chancellor.

393
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,800
The assassin talked.

394
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,160
He was acting under orders

395
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
from Lan Boutique.

396
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,440
Lan Boutique...

397
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,320
Yes.

398
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,240
If I remember correctly,

399
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,160
all of the Princess's clothes
are custom-made there.

400
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,840
That shopkeeper said

401
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,200
the outfit Taohua wore

402
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
was the most popular style

403
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,280
among noble ladies in Yujing right now.

404
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,760
(There was a trace
of powdery perfume in the air,)

405
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,720
(mixed with the scent of soap pods.)

406
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,240
I want a full list

407
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,040
of all coming
in and out of Lan Boutique.

408
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,880
Find out whether Jiang Taohua
has any ties to them.

409
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,440
I want every detail
of their past interactions.

410
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,360
Understood.

411
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,020
(Zhengchun Boudoir)

412
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,720
Your Highness?

413
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,320
Your Highness...

414
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,880
Your Highness?

415
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,040
Should I go fetch a physician?

416
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,480
It's no use.

417
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,440
This poison

418
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,920
can only be mitigated
with Yang Wanqing's antidote.

419
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,400
She only gave me

420
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,560
half a dose.

421
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,200
She did it to make me suffer.

422
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,280
To punish me.

423
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,080
I have to go back to Lan Boutique.

424
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,560
But,

425
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
we failed her last order

426
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,280
about lighting the incense.

427
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,240
Would she give us the antidote again?

428
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,600
As long as they still
need me as their pawn,

429
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,760
they won't let me die.

430
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,440
If I die...

431
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,720
Who would do their dirty work?

432
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,720
At worst,

433
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,120
they'll humiliate me more

434
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,840
and make fun of me.

435
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,760
It's nothing I can't endure.

436
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,680
Fetch a clean change of clothes for me.

437
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,080
Yes.

438
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,600
Qingtai.

439
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,120
What is this?

440
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,400
Her Highness wants to change.

441
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,680
I'm bringing her some fresh clothes.

442
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,760
Perfect timing.
I was just going to see her.

443
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,160
I'll take it.

444
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,920
Bring the clothes over.

445
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,200
Thank you, Chancellor.

446
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,200
Change your clothes this time?

447
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,760
Are you going out?

448
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,680
Yes.

449
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,280
I want some fresh air

450
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,840
and to see if there are
any new styles in fashion.

451
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,280
Didn't you just add
a whole new wardrobe?

452
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,080
But Chancellor,

453
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,880
a girl can never

454
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,640
have enough clothes.

455
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,120
We'll always miss

456
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,080
a shade of rouge.

457
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,800
Now that you say it,

458
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,200
I suppose I was being inconsiderate.

459
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,720
My bad.

460
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,720
What is this?

461
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,520
It's the newest trend in Yujing.
It's called Peach Blossom makeup.

462
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,280
Peach Blossom makeup?

463
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,560
You women are a real mystery.

464
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,640
You'd paint a lovely design

465
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,520
on your arm instead.

466
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,520
Best if you stop trying to guess
how women think, Chancellor.

467
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,280
Fair enough.

468
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,360
I really don't know much
about women's makeup.

469
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,960
At first glance,

470
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,240
I thought it was a tattoo of a spy.

471
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,240
You jest, Chancellor.

472
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,440
Why would there

473
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,400
be spies?

474
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,400
Why not?

475
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,400
Just the other day,

476
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,520
Zhan Lu caught a few spies

477
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,600
from enemy states stirring up trouble.

478
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,480
Your Highness,

479
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,400
it's best not to leave the manor.

480
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,760
There are things

481
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,120
that can wait a little while longer.

482
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,160
Right?

483
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,360
I'm your wife.

484
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,600
Who would dare

485
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,120
lay a hand on me in broad daylight?

486
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,760
"A wise one avoids danger."

487
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,720
Or does Your Highness
have plans today that require you

488
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,200
to go out?

489
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,760
Your Highness

490
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,520
should stay home for now.

491
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,200
Once things settle down,

492
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,920
I'll take you

493
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,840
wherever you want to go.

494
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,240
We can browse around

495
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,520
for things you like.

496
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,120
And if I say

497
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,520
I must go out regardless?

498
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,000
What, then?

499
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,440
If Your Highness insists
on going out today...

500
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,840
I'm afraid those clueless men
under Zhan Lu's command

501
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,100
might mistake you for an enemy
and hurt you by accident.

502
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,280
That'd be regretful.

503
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,840
Your Highness.

504
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,160
Don't you agree?

505
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,920
I'll do as you say, Chancellor.

506
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,720
I'll go out another day.

507
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,960
Your Highness...

508
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,960
That was a warning.

509
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,280
What happened at the Library that day

510
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,400
must have compromised me.

511
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,600
Then...

512
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,640
Are we still leaving today?

513
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,240
Yes.

514
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,760
You are right.

515
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,960
She left Zhengchun Boudoir

516
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
and went to the back gate.

517
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,100
(Lan Boutique)

518
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,780
(Lan Boutique)

519
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,800
It's all Jiang Taohua's fault.

520
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,480
She always ruins the plan.

521
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,000
She's never completed

522
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,320
a task Her Highness assigned.

523
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,160
This attempt failed again. I'm afraid

524
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,720
it's alerted Shen Zaiye.

525
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,120
It will be harder to act from now on.

526
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,400
Who's there?

527
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,800
It's me.

528
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,120
(Someone is inside.)

529
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,840
(Could it be Prince Wuyin?)

530
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,640
Does Your Highness
not know that the Chancellor

531
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,040
is scouring the city
for suspicious persons?

532
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,880
Showing up unannounced

533
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,440
could bring us trouble

534
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,760
and compromise my hideout.

535
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,720
Don't be upset, Qing.

536
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,640
I had no choice but to come.

537
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,320
If I'm not mistaken,

538
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,680
Her Highness's target

539
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,360
is Prince Wuxia,

540
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,280
who studies in the Imperial Library.

541
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,280
So?

542
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,360
Don't tell me you've gone soft

543
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,400
and want to plead for Mu Wuxia?

544
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Qing, you misunderstood.

545
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,520
I came here today

546
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,960
to ask you for
the other half of the antidote.

547
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,800
You haven't achieved a thing.

548
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,560
What makes you think you deserve it?

549
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,800
If you all had trusted me,

550
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,000
instead of

551
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,760
those clumsy assassins,

552
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,640
I wouldn't have been dragged down.

553
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,640
Mu Wuxia is as good as dead now.

554
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
It's just that our first attempt failed,

555
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,360
and even if there is a second chance,

556
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,920
my body won't hold out.

557
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,960
I have a foolproof plan.

558
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,440
If all goes well,

559
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,000
he will die in one strike.

560
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,560
But only if Qing gives me the antidote.

561
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,360
Otherwise,

562
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,040
I'm afraid my body

563
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,680
will ruin Her Highness's plans.

564
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,360
I've agreed to give you the antidote.

565
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
But if anything goes wrong again,

566
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,120
you'll answer for it.

567
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:45,920
Understood.

568
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,920
Why did you agree to her terms?

569
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,080
Jiang Taohua is not
to be underestimated.

570
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,480
If she came all this way
to ask in person,

571
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,000
what harm is there in saying yes?

572
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,760
It's not like

573
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,840
I actually believe her.

574
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,800
If we want this mission to succeed,

575
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,040
we'll need to give her a push.

576
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,120
By the way...

577
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Any word

578
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,360
from Beiyuan?

579
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,120
After the last mission failed,

580
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,280
we sent a letter.

581
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,240
Her Highness hasn't
given any new orders since.

582
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,840
I was wondering

583
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,280
if she is angry that we botched the job?

584
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,840
Then, we wait.

585
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,560
She might just be held up

586
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,840
with something else.

587
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,020
(Shen Residence)

588
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,040
You may go.

589
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:23,960
Yes.

590
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,400
Where were you?

591
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,760
Lan Boutique.

592
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,760
Why?

593
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,040
Haven't you already figured it out?

594
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,960
Why bother asking?

595
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,120
Jiang Taohua...

596
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,320
I gave you a chance.

597
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
But you cast it away.

598
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,600
I suppose I should thank you.

599
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,200
You gave me the chance
to confess the truth.

600
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,960
You once told me

601
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,560
Prince Wuxia was like a brother to you.

602
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,840
Is everyone expendable

603
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,360
as long as you stand

604
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,600
to gain the most?

605
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,080
I already promised you

606
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,720
I would never do anything to harm Qi.

607
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,160
That promise

608
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,600
includes Prince Wuxia of Qi.

609
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,360
(I will never do anything to harm you)

610
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,080
(or the State of Qi.)

611
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
If I break that oath,

612
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,920
may I never see my family again.

613
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,160
If I break that oath,

614
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,680
may I never see my family again.

Your Highness.

00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,600
What did that treacherous Chancellor
say to you?

631
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,720
He said he trusts me.

632
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,040
And Your Highness told him everything?

633
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,040
Can he really be trusted?

634
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,920
If I didn't tell him,
he'd still find out sooner or later.

635
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,680
Since that day at the Imperial Library,

636
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,560
Zhengchun Boudoir

637
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,600
has probably been under surveillance.

638
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,120
And about Yang Wanqing?

639
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,840
Has Your Highness made a decision?

640
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,680
I had to talk circles around her today

641
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,360
just to get half an antidote pill.

642
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,360
If we don't act this time,

643
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,600
we might never get another one.

644
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,280
Are we really going to
lay a hand on Prince Wuxia?

645
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,760
Never.

646
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,160
We know how the Chancellor and Qingying,

647
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,400
treat Prince Wuxia.

648
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,560
Besides,

649
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,840
when the Chancellor came after me,

650
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,760
he still chose to protect

651
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,460
a diplomatic princess
no one cared about.

652
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,720
He was even willing
to turn on powerful ministers

653
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,400
to save me.

654
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,360
How could I

655
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,480
betray such a kind soul?

656
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,720
So, what's the plan now?

657
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,400
Yang Wanqing is keeping
a close eye on me.

658
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,880
Here's the plan.

659
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,560
Leave the residence.

660
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,520
Pretend to be looking
into Prince Wuxia's whereabouts.

661
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,920
Draw Yang Wanqing's attention away.

662
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,960
Make her think

663
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,000
we are going after Prince Wuxia.

664
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,840
That will buy us some time

665
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,240
so I can figure out a foolproof plan.

666
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,080
Got it.

667
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,320
Your Highness.

668
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,680
Princess Chengping invited you
to go out for a walk.

669
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,680
Your carriage is waiting outside.

670
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,600
Right now?

671
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,320
Yes.

672
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,800
(Zhengchun Boudoir)

673
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,760
Your Highness, bad news!

674
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,200
Yang Wanqing invited Prince Wuxia out
using your name!

675
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
I knew something was off,

676
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,920
so I rushed back to report it.

677
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,600
Oh no.

678
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,840
They didn't trust me,

679
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,760
and made a move.

680
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,360
Where is Prince Wuxia now?

681
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,680
I saw him.

682
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,760
He was headed toward Qinfang Teahouse.

683
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,280
Inform the Chancellor!

684
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,100
(Qinfang Teahouse)

685
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,040

686
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,240
