(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,820
=Episode 6=

18
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,600
A double-layer box.

19
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,240
The painting is inside the luncheon box.

20
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:26,960
Let's go.

21
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,840
You are our Left Chancellor.

22
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,480
Surely, you won't spare indulgence

23
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,000
on your criminal sister?

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,040
For a man of your position,

25
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,320
she may be spared from imprisonment.

26
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,800
But should your work keep you so busy

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,880
that you have no time
to discipline your own sister,

28
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,040
I can take her in.

29
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
My madams will tutor her personally.

30
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,600
If she proves obedient,

31
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,760
I

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,720
will return her in one piece.

33
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,640
And if

34
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,600
I don't want to burden Your Highness

35
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,120
with such a task?

36
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,240
You do not have the freedom of choice.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,520
Grab her!

38
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,520
Chancellor Shen.

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,840
Eunuch Wen.

40
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,000
His Majesty heard that you're
organizing another betrothal ceremony.

41
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,120
He asked me to select a few

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,320
valuable gifts from the palace.

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,480
His Majesty's generosity

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
knows no bounds.

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,880
But perhaps all this jewelry

46
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,640
are more suited for an unwed lady.

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,000
The golden hairpin is for your sister.

48
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,760
When she came to visit previously,

49
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,880
she obtained Consort Lan's favor.

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,960
Her Highness believes she has

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,520
an amicable wittiness

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,280
that is rare in the palace.

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,560
I see.

54
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,880
But His Highness...

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,560
I also

56
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,560
find Miss Qingying

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,920
affable.

58
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,040
That's why

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
I want to give her some gifts.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,960
In that case,

61
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,760
allow me to thank you

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,680
on her behalf, Your Highness.

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,080
To have brought Eunuch Wen here,

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,000
you sure are

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
quick on your feet.

66
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,600
It's just a coincidence.

67
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,920
I shall take my leave.

68
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,640
The Chancellor

69
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,380
said that no one
could leave the residence.

70
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,560
I'm not leaving.

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,720
His Highness enjoys the meal so much

72
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,480
that he wants the chefs
to pack some extra

73
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,390
to bring back with him.

74
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,120
Show me.

75
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,440
I watched the chefs prepare the food.

76
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,000
If someone else touches it

77
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,040
and something bad happens
to His Highness,

78
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,280
I will surely mention you two.

79
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,920
I'll ask His Highness's guards to do it.

80
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,360
Halt.

81
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,000
His Highness is not in his seat.

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,440
Which dish did he request?

83
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,720
Lady Jiang, you must have had
one too many drinks to hear it.

84
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,240
Before His Highness left his seat,

85
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,600
he asked Madam Meng for this favor.

86
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
Allow me to inspect it.

87
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120
If something happens, I'll assume

88
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,440
full responsibility.

89
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,880
If I can't earn your trust,

90
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,400
I shall return and ask Madam Meng

91
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,560
to speak with you.

92
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,000
Suspicious.

93
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,360
There's something wrong.

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Give me the luncheon box.

95
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,000
Give it back.

96
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,840
Give it back.

97
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,960
(This is)

98
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,760
(Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks)

99
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,880
Give me back the painting.

100
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,920
Do not touch Her Highness.

101
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,600
This belongs to His Highness.
Give it to me.

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,120
Give it to me.

103
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,520
Stop it. Give it to me.

104
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,180
Stop tearing it.

105
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:32,800
Let go.

106
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,120
- Stop tearing it.
- Give it back.

107
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,600
Let go.

108
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,440
Give it back.

109
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,520
Let go.

110
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,880
Give me the painting back.

111
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,920
Do not touch Her Highness.

112
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,160
Let go.

113
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,640
Let go.

114
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,920
Move away!

115
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,760
Like you said, Chancellor Shen,

116
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,080
the winner only reveals himself
at the very end.

117
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,160
I quite agree with that.

118
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,880
And this time, the revelation

119
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,280
came surprisingly fast.

120
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,720
What

121
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,640
a joyful betrothal ceremony.

122
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,600
Thank you so much,

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,760
Princess Chengping.

124
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,400
So this is what you mean
by working together?

125
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,760
I saw it with my own eyes

126
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,160
that you threw

127
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,600
the painting into the fire.

128
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,400
My life

129
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,160
is dependent on you.

130
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,120
Who would I help Prince Changjue?

131
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,400
Also,

132
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,200
I only let go because I was startled

133
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
by the coachman.

134
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,280
Jiang Taohua,

135
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,120
I see all this pretense

136
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,440
has made you lose your mind.

137
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,720
You dare lie to me?

138
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,320
You think I can't tell

139
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,440
the truth of your action?

140
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,440
If I die,

141
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
you will never

142
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,280
recover that painting.

143
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,280
I almost forgot

144
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,040
that you fear death the most.

145
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,600
What have you up your sleeve this time?

146
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,440
The painting is burnt,

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,760
but I boast

148
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,800
an impeccable memory.

149
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,800
Only I

150
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,640
can

151
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,600
replicate the painting

152
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,360
with absolute precision.

153
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,840
Trust me, or not.

154
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Just put me to the test.

155
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,720
This is your plan?

156
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,640
Prove it.

157
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,600
Fulfill my three demands,

158
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,640
and I shall replicate

159
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,160
the painting in three stages.

160
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,920
So this is your plan.

161
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,880
You feigned complicity.

162
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,960
In reality, you stoke the flames

163
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,840
to profit from it.

164
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,440
My ulterior motive

165
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,200
no longer matters.

166
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,200
You won't believe

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,280
what I say anyway.

168
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,520
Consider yourself lucky

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,160
that I saw the painting

170
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,160
and I'm still willing to
negotiate with you.

171
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,040
Speak.

172
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,200
One,

173
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,560
we will investigate

174
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,960
the cases involving Prince Changjue.

175
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,380
How did you know
that His Highness was involved?

176
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,780
The Mengs would rather sacrifice
Meng Zhenzhen

177
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,560
to bring the painting to His Highness.

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,960
That means

179
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,280
the painting must contain
something crucial.

180
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,600
You can use it

181
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,040
to leverage against Prince Changjue.

182
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,960
What does it
have anything to do with you?

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,880
His Highness knew exactly
where to find us

184
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,960
in Zuimeng Pavilion.

185
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,200
I knew then

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,280
that he most probably

187
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,960
had set everything up.

188
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,440
It's too uncanny.

189
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,400
There are many ways

190
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,720
to carry out political sabotage,

191
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,960
but he elected the most

192
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,400
despicable one.

193
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
He treated women
as if they were worthless.

194
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,440
He disrespected my nation.

195
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,520
I have the right

196
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,200
to seek revenge.

197
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,000
And two?

198
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,720
Remove the personnel

199
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,360
you assigned

200
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
to Zhengchun Boudoir.

201
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,960
Only Qingtai can enter

202
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,680
or leave.

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,400
Three,

204
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,920
from now on,

205
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,440
whenever

206
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,640
I leave

207
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,640
to visit anyone,

208
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,640
you cannot say no.

209
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,640
You know no one here.

210
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,600
Who could you possibly

211
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
want to visit?

212
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,360
I know no one now.

213
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
If I don't venture out,
I will never know anyone.

214
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,240
I was confined

215
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,080
to my Beiyuan palace for 18 years.

216
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,880
I am not about to spend the rest
of my life in another prison.

217
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,760
You are a man.

218
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,680
You will never understand this.

219
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,200
One painting,

220
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,920
three demands.

221
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,640
We're both at each other's mercy.

222
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
Unless you love

223
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,840
the feeling of helplessness.

224
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,560
Three demands.

225
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,320
I get it.

226
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,560
You came to Qi

227
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,880
with a big ambition.

228
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,280
But what if

229
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,960
I refuse to comply?

230
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,680
Powerful as you may be,

231
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,800
you cannot crack open my head

232
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
to retrieve the painting.

233
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,160
Do you truly think

234
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,120
that you can threaten me

235
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,920
with a painting?

236
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,760
Like you said,

237
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,640
there are many ways

238
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,720
to carry out political sabotage.

239
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,600
I can forego this case

240
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,640
and find another incriminating evidence.

241
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,800
You use the painting

242
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
as your lifeline.

243
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,640
Have you wondered

244
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,840
what would happen after I tell

245
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,960
Prince Changjue about

246
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,800
your impeccable memory?

247
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,200
Think about Xue Ran in the mass grave.

248
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,200
His killer

249
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,600
still roams this place.

250
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,400
You have achieved your goal.

251
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,520
You may drink now.

252
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,560
I have been

253
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,120
reflecting upon myself.

254
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,760
I lack the moral acuity

255
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,640
to be worthy of you.

256
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,640
I'd like to ask

257
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,560
for a repudiation.

258
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,760
Repudiation?

259
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,080
Is your father aware of this?

260
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,480
We both know

261
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,960
what you did.

262
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,200
I understand
that your family pressured you

263
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,640
into doing it.

264
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,560
From now on,

265
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,320
you will be sick and will stay home

266
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,200
for convalescence.

267
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,440
You won't leave the residence,
see anyone,

268
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
or manage residential matters.

269
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,760
Madam.

270
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,280
What are you carrying?

271
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,000
Your brother sent this over

272
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,840
for you.

273
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,160
Everyone knows today is the day

274
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,940
of the betrothal ceremony between
Chancellor Shen and that Princess.

275
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Only my brother remembers

276
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,840
it's my birthday too.

277
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,080
Your Highness...

278
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,000
You again?

279
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,600
Do you not know nicefulness?

280
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,640
Miss Qingying,

281
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
nicefulness is not a word.

282
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,040
Another bookworm.

283
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,880
You're the sister of a chancellor.

284
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,440
Why are you hiding here

285
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,800
and eating leftovers?

286
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,640
I have nothing to hide.

287
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,960
The chefs went to sleep.

288
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,160
If I ask for food,

289
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,400
they will have to wake up.

290
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,320
So why bother?

291
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm not all high and mighty

292
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,200
like you.

293
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,480
I bet you haven't had

294
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,920
leftovers before.

295
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,920
I have, in fact.

296
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,920
I even had someone buy me

297
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,280
common congee once.

298
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:23,960
You did?

299
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,720
My tutor once quoted,
"My elderly mother resided in the east.

300
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,640
She could not buy rice without laboring.

301
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,100
So how could I have the heart
to enjoy the meal alone?"

302
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,120
I wanted to know

303
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,640
what commoners eat.

304
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,480
So what do you

305
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,040
think of its taste?

306
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,880
The congee was watery
and the grain was too tough.

307
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,440
I used to think
the white rice in the palace

308
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,000
is what the people eat.

309
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,480
But compared to the congee I ate,

310
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,600
white rice tastes divine.

311
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,240
It's much better.

312
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,560
Miss Qingying.

313
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,440
Miss Qingying.

314
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,600
Where are you?

315
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,160
Oh, no.

316
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,440
Lucky you.

317
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,720
Congratulations, Your Highness.

318
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,880
You foiled

319
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,080
Shen Zaiye's plan.

320
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,160
That serves him right.

321
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,240
I might have failed
to retrieve the painting,

322
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,320
but so did he.

323
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,440
I won this round.

324
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,160
Xiaodongzi.

325
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,040
Yes, Your Highness.

326
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,000
Award everyone.

327
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

328
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,840
Have them distribute

329
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,000
all the monies
that haven't been released

330
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,600
from the treasury.

331
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,760
All?

332
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,640
It's a sensitive period now.

333
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,240
If you get rid of the money,

334
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,640
Chancellor Shen might suspect something.

335
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,320
I have no regard for the risk,

336
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,800
as it will only bring down
small foes like Shen Zaiye.

337
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,840
I shall show him

338
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,440
who runs

339
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,120
this nation.

340
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,520
Winning a game of weiqi against you

341
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,840
does not bring me
any satisfaction at all.

342
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,000
Let Chancellor Shen have it.

343
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,560
He came here so early.

344
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
He mustn't have his breakfast yet.

345
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

346
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,000
Chancellor Shen,

347
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,240
do you know the current price
for millet?

348
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,040
It's 300 qian

349
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,200
for one shi of millet.

350
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,640
I apologize for my incompetence.

351
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,880
300 qian?

352
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,640
I fear ever a common household

353
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,000
cannot afford this bowl of congee.

354
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,000
You have been investigating

355
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,780
the counterfeit money case
for a few months.

356
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,680
Yet the price of grains only increases.

357
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,920
The inflation

358
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,120
has made our people suffer.

359
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,800
Compile all your documents

360
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,320
and let the heir apparent handle them.

361
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,640
Your Majesty,

362
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,240
I just found a new lead.

363
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Please give me the chance

364
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,920
to redeem myself.

365
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,440
The price of commodities

366
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,160
dictates the wellness of our society.

367
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,480
It's not a task for you to trifle with.

368
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,200
I never underestimate

369
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,840
the bane of counterfeit money.

370
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,120
One month.

371
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,600
I just need one month

372
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,560
to identify the source
of the counterfeit money.

373
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,800
Two weeks.

374
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
I'll give you two weeks.

375
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,040
If you can't find out the truth,

376
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,680
hand over the documents
to the heir apparent

377
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,720
and serve your punishment.

378
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,200
Noted, Your Majesty.

379
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,320
Your Highness,

380
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,880
this is

381
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,760
the seal on the painting?

382
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,960
If you remember everything,

383
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,520
why not replicate the painting

384
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,680
and trade it with the evil chancellor
for your freedom?

385
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,800
Or you can trade it with Yang Wanqing
for the antidote.

386
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,920
The deadline is upon us once more.

387
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,320
It is an important painting,

388
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,840
and only I know

389
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,840
what it is like.

390
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,760
It is my leverage,

391
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,920
and also my undoing.

392
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,040
If I hand it to Chancellor Shen,

393
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,320
he might try to silence me later.

394
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,600
If I hand it to Yang Wanqing

395
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,040
and Chancellor Shen

396
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,600
becomes aware of it,

397
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,240
I will die too.

398
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,880
So

399
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,520
if we manage to decipher

400
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,600
the painting,

401
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,600
we can negotiate with them.

402
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,040
Qingtai,

403
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,640
can you find an excuse to head out?

404
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,080
Visit all calligraphy stores

405
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,600
to find out where this seal comes from.

406
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,560
Come back before the hour of You.

407
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,040
Be careful.

408
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,200
Go now.

409
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,320
(Shen Residence)

410
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,000
Now that the painting is destroyed,
the heir apparent grows brazen.

411
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,600
Even street vendors
use counterfeit money.

412
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,480
If we try tracking down the confusing
flow of the counterfeit money,

413
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,800
I fear two weeks...

414
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
Upon releasing a huge volume
of counterfeit money,

415
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,840
merchants have no choice
but to reconcile the accounts.

416
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,440
They can't invent

417
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,760
goods.

418
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,440
They can only transfer them.

419
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,280
Pursue this lead.

420
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,120
Pay attention

421
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,280
to gambling dens or taverns
with high liquidity flow.

422
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,720
This approach is feasible,

423
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,360
but time-consuming.

424
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,720
If we want the truth,

425
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,520
we need the painting.

426
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,820
Otherwise, I'll have to agree
to Jiang Taohua's demands.

427
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,960
She is cunning.

428
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,760
I can't rely solely on her.

429
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,400
Sir,

430
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,320
one more thing.

431
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,000
Our eyes on Zhengchun Boudoir reported

432
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,920
that Qingtai had been visiting

433
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,600
gambling dens since yesterday morning.

434
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,720
She seems to be investigating something

435
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,840
and was last seen

436
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
in Jinyin Gambling House.

437
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,800
I knew she couldn't stay put.

438
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,440
Keep following her.

439
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,120
Noted.

440
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,360
(Jinyin Gambling House?)

441
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,120
(I might have to pay it a visit.)

442
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,840
Chancellor Shen, I seek an audience.

443
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,680
You violated your curfew
and barged into the study room

444
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,800
just to tell me

445
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,880
that you leaked confidential
information of this case to Qingtai.

446
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,880
You then asked her
to investigate further.

447
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,800
And now,

448
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,040
she's gone?

449
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,240
She must be in danger.

450
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,520
And that means

451
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,280
wherever she is is our clue.

452
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,800
Find Qingtai and you'll find the key
to decipher the painting.

453
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,680
Does that mean

454
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,360
I owe it all to you two now?

455
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,200
I apologize for not disclosing the sign

456
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,560
to you right away.

457
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
But if you can rescue Qingtai,

458
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,120
I will replicate the painting

459
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,880
and give it

460
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,800
to you.

461
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,520
What about the three demands?

462
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,240
If you can locate Qingtai,

463
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,200
I'll withdraw all my demands.

464
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,720
I like that.

465
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,360
If you had told me yesterday,

466
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,840
I would have said yes.

467
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,000
Unfortunately,

468
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,040
you're too greedy with your bidding.

469
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,440
That painting

470
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,280
is no longer relevant.

471
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,400
I don't need it anymore.

472
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,680
Zhan Lu,

473
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,920
see her off.

474
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,280
This way, Lady Jiang.

475
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,000
(I'll have)

476
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
(to figure out another way.)

477
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,600
Qingying,

478
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,600
you sure are a well-traveled

479
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,880
woman of culture,

480
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,280
unlike a sheltered lady like me.

481
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,400
You got the right person.

482
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,160
I am the only high society lady

483
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,440
who recognizes this.

484
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,240
It is

485
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,200
the sign of Jinyin Gambling House.

486
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,240
Do you know it?

487
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,560
Please enlighten me.

488
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
My brother... No.

489
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,600
My friend told me that it was a place

490
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,000
where you could bet on anything.

491
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,280
From the most common accessories,

492
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,720
to land and property,

493
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,000
or even one's job position
or first night,

494
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,960
if it can be offered

495
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
and there are buyers,
people will wager on it.

496
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,760
I've lived in Yujing
for quite some time.

497
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,440
How come no one mentioned this

498
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,400
to me before?

499
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,080
Qingying,

500
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,920
could this just be

501
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,520
a rumor?

502
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,240
Impossible.

503
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,240
They say a bigwig

504
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,840
funds that gambling den.

505
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That place is by invitation only.

506
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,720
You have to pay first

507
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,160
before they let you gamble.

508
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,720
Commoners like me can't get in at all.

509
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,280
Can you

510
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,040
show me the place?

511
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:19,600
Sure.

512
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:19,960
Let's go.

513
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:22,680
Wait.

514
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,040
If you want to go there,

515
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,760
why not ask Zaiye to help you?

516
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,360
Why me this late at night?

517
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,600
This is suspicious.

518
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,840
You are suspicious.

519
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,880
I knew I couldn't fool
your observant eyes.

520
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,800
I made a wager with Qingtai.

521
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,040
I said she could never
find out what was inside.

522
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,240
Therefore,

523
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,560
she snuck out

524
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,840
to look for the sign.

525
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,960
And now, she hasn't come back.

526
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,760
I want to look for her,

527
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,760
but am too afraid
to tell Chancellor Shen.

528
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,680
What if he knows

529
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,560
and punishes Qingtai for it?

530
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,080
Yet, I'm just a powerless woman.

531
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
I can't even leave this place,

532
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,120
let alone visit Jinyin Gambling House.

533
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,640
If you have a way
to enter the gambling house,

534
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,760
I'll bring you with me.

535
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,520
Deal.

536
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,920
How exactly are you going to get inside?

537
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
I have a plan.

538
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,120
It's not my first time pretending
to be an attendant.

539
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,360
We will sneak in.

540
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,600
Why so tall?

541
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,360
Come. Climb.

542
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,720
Give me a hand.

543
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,000
See? We're out now.

544
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,920
Aren't I amazing?

545
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,520
As expected of Heroine Xiang.

546
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,640
You act all noble and whatnot,

547
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,320
but when it's outside,
you have to rely on me.

548
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,560
Right.

549
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,040
Halt.

550
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,160
Heroine Xiang, where are you taking

551
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,120
my wife?

552
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,200
Save Qingtai.

553
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,280
Go now. I'll buy you time.

554
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,200
Go!

555
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
You dim-wit.

556
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,600
Anyone can deceive you easily.

557
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,600
You see, Zaiye.

558
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,720
This is our tactic.

559
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,560
Tactic, you hear me?

560
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,960
Sir, do I give chase?

561
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,720
Let her be.

562
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,000
She can't get in anyway.

563
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Stay here and go nowhere.

564
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,720
This way, Miss.

565
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,400
Win one more round
and I'll recover my losses!

566
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,200
(Stacks of Gold)

567
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,880
You lost. All in.

568
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,320
Fine.

569
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,280
I count on you.

570
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,960
We all won.

571
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,720
Open it.

572
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,320
- Quick.
- Open it.

573
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,600
It's all mine.

574
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,360
You're my lucky charm.

575
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,600
- Get up.
- Move!

576
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,000
Again.

577
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,240
Again. Again.

578
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,160
(Qingying said)

579
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,360
(that the first floor
was the common gambling)

580
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,520
(and performance area.)

581
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,920
(Performers can be traded.)

582
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,720
(The rich will spend a fortune)

583
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,320
(to buy a night with the belles.)

584
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,720
(The second floor)

585
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,280
(is where the powerful gambles.)

586
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,880
(Only the well-dressed gather)

587
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
(by the gambling tables.)

588
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,440
(And the third floor)

589
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
(is the most mysterious.)

590
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,480
(No guests can enter or leave.)

591
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,460
(It is the forbidden area
of the gambling house.)

592
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,760
(Qingtai must be held captive
on the third floor.)

593
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
(I must find a way)

594
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,920
(to get there.)

595
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,880
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go!

596
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,400
You there.

597
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,800
Fill my cup.

598
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:54,960
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go!

599
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,560
(Fowl)
Fowl, eight!

600
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,280
(He smells familiar.)

601
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,510
(I have caught his scent before
in Shen Zaiye's study.)

602
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,760
(Boshan incense.)

603
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,760
(It must be Chancellor Shen.)

604
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,760
(He sure moves quick.)

605
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,340
(Fowl)

606
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,880
Color, four.

607
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,160
The pawn overtakes.

608
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,840
The winner is him.

609
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:09,880
Fine.

610
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,800
Let's play something simpler.

611
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,920
The bigger number will win.

612
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:13,920
Sure.

613
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,880
Please place your bet.

614
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,840
Small.

615
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,200
All in.

616
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,800
It's now or never.

617
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,040
I will

618
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,040
reveal the dice now.

619
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,240
- Small! Small!
- Small! Small!

620
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,650
- Small! Small!
- Small! Small!

621
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,360
- Small! Small!
- Small! Small!

622
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,557
- Small!
- Big!

623
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,280
Small!

624
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,000
Big!

625
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,600
Small!

626
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,200
Big!

627
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,080
Small!

628
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,080
Small!

629
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,280
Small!

630
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,360
Open it.

631
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,720
Big!

632
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,400
The winner is him.

633
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,080
I'm done!

634
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,480
Fortune smiles upon you today, sir.

635
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,000
What should we play next?

636
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,200
I'm quitting.

637
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,560
If I keep winning,

638
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,120
you might run out of money.

639
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,320
You can have this.

640
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,360
Redeem these for me.

641
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,800
Thanks, sir.

642
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,680
I bought chips with gold.

643
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,840
How come it's silver now?

644
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,720
Sir, this must be your first time here.

645
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,800
We have a rule here.

646
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,080
You can use whatever to buy chips.

647
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,240
But you will only get silver in return.

648
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,240
Silver and winner rhyme, after all.

649
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,840
There's something off

650
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,440
about your silver.

651
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,640
It is different from minted silver.

652
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,640
Minted silver weighs one liang, while
ours weighs one liang and three li.

653
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,160
In fact, you've made a profit.

654
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
(I see it now.)

655
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,580
(This gambling house is indeed
the source of counterfeit money.)

656
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,000
(They use gamblers to distribute
counterfeit money.)

657
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,800
(And minted silver all goes back
to the heir apparent.)

658
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,080
(5,000 Silver)

659
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,200
(This place)

660
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,640
(must house a lot of counterfeit money.)

661
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,160
(There's no one on the third floor.)

662
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,800
(I must find a way to get in.)

663
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,360
(Attendants of this establishment)

664
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,280
(rotates their shift on the third floor
every time the joss stick burns out.)

665
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,040
(I can only sneak in)

666
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,040
(when they rotate.)

667
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
(What tight security.)

668
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,240
(Qingtai might be imprisoned here.)

669
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,360
Who says you can go there?

670
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,920
Someone lost his money in a game

671
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
and is very angry.

672
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,320
I...

673
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,680
I'm too afraid to approach him.

674
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,600
This isn't a place you can hide.

675
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,720
Leave.

676
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,480
Okay.

677
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,920
(I knew it.)

678
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,520
(This secret room)

679
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,880
(is where they stash
the counterfeit money.)

680
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,880
Quick.

681
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,520
Have you moved the silver
like you were told to do?

682
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,520
I'm almost done.

683
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,656
Close the door.

684
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,560
(The jade pendant is needed)

685
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,200
(to enter the treasury.)

686
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,520
(Shen Zaiye?)

687
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,520
(He's still here.)

688
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,080
It seems like

689
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,040
your night is as fruitless

690
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,200
as mine.

691
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,920
