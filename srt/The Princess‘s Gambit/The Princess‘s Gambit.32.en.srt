(Qi State Report)

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,200
Outrageous.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Floods in the south,
droughts in the northwest.

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,120
Yet Wuyin turns a blind eye,

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,280
scheming with Empress Lv for power.

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
At this rate,

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,160
Qi will end up just like Beiyuan.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,960
Your Highness.

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
Is this today's court bulletin?

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,400
Yes, it just arrived from the palace.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,840
(Qi State Report)
Something is odd about this.

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,440
Why would His Majesty suddenly
go into seclusion for meditation?

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,400
Summon Wang Xi.

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,400
Now.

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,280
Yes, Your Highness.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,680
Mu Wuxia, what happened?

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,600
Father is being relocated
to Qingxiu Temple

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
at the hour of Si today.

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,520
Is His Majesty retreating
to seek immortality?

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
Father may dabble in alchemy.

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,480
But he never believes
in Daoist nonsense.

39
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
Let alone abandon
the court affair like this.

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,240
I don't believe he went willingly.

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,600
I need to find a way

42
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,480
to see him fast.

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,600
Your Highness,

44
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,520
there will surely
be guards watching him.

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,960
If we barge in recklessly,

46
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
we'll walk straight into a trap.

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,760
Then what do we do?

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,200
Well,

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,280
I've been to Qingxiu Temple before.

50
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,520
There's a hole in the wall
by the corner,

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,640
big enough for a person
to crawl through.

52
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Li Dian can just say

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,880
it's a dog hole.

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,280
Why say it's a hole in the wall?

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,520
Let's go.

56
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,120
Your Majesty, please rest a while.

57
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,320
Over here.

58
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,360
Easy.

59
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Prince Wuyin.

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,840
Father.

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,920
Prince Wuyin, where's the medicine?

62
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,880
Consort Lan, be patient.

63
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,360
Father,

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,360
look at you.

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,560
Do you still look like the ruler?

66
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,680
If you abdicate

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,320
and live out your days here in seclusion

68
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,960
without meddling in the court affairs,

69
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,720
you'll have more medicine
than you could ever use.

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,360
Medicine...

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,520
Medicine...

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,680
If you write the abdication decree,

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,880
I'll give it to you right away.

74
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,960
Father, think this through.

75
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,760
In

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
your dreams!

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,560
Then think on it longer.

78
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,280
I have more pressing matters.

79
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,280
I'll visit another day.

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,280
Don't go. Don't go.

81
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,360
Stay!

82
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,880
Your Majesty.

83
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,760
Fine.

84
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,920
I will abdicate.

85
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,920
Give me the medicine.

86
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,560
You better keep your word.

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,320
I will.

88
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,520
Your Majesty.

89
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,400
Father, now focus on your meditation.

90
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
- Let's go.
- All right.

91
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,280
We'll go in from the back.

92
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,400
Go.

93
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,120
Here.

94
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,200
Come.

95
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,440
Who's there?

96
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,760
It's Prince Wuxia.

97
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,000
Wuxia?

98
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,520
Wuxia, come quickly.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,680
Father.

100
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,760
Wuxia.

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,320
Father.

102
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,320
Wuxia,

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,840
sit down.

104
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,680
Father,

105
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,320
it's my fault

106
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,200
you've suffered.

107
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm sorry I'm late.

108
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,600
How could Wuyin do this?

109
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't mention that scoundrel.

110
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,360
Listen to me, Wuxia.

111
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,360
Mu Wuyin tried to poison me.

112
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,360
You must get me out of here.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,840
Father, don't worry.

114
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,440
I'll get you out.

115
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,480
Once we're back in the palace,
the imperial physicians

116
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,000
will help you recover.

117
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,400
All right.

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,560
Father,

119
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,320
do you trust me?

120
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,240
I

121
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,600
trust you.

122
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,920
Then I need a decree.

123
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,840
You want one too?

124
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,360
I am not after the throne.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,480
I want to use it
to call for reinforcements

126
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,040
from the capital garrison.

127
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,660
(Shunjing Residence)

128
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,420
(Happiness)

129
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,360
Hua,

130
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,960
I brought you a wedding gift.

131
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,840
The abdication decree.

132
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,620
(Imperial Edict)

133
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,640
(Now, in my old age,)

134
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,620
(I pass the throne to Mu Wuyin
by ancient rites.)

135
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,360
Tomorrow,

136
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,280
I'll proclaim this before the court

137
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,040
and the world

138
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,080
to declare you my empress.

139
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,920
Wuyin,

140
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,160
you've finally grown into a man

141
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,360
I can rely on.

142
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,200
Hua,

143
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,080
I'm doing all of this for you.

144
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,040
If you offer the empire
as your betrothal gift,

145
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,080
then I'll offer you my life.

146
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,960
Truly?

147
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,840
Wuyin,

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,280
I wouldn't lie to you.

149
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,800
Hua, then I'll take you to the palace
to begin our wedding preparations.

150
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:36,260
(Happiness)

151
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,800
Zaiye, Jiang Taohua.

152
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,840
Qingying, Prince Wuxia.

153
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,240
I said we don't know
if we'll ever meet again.

154
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,640
Here we are once again,
meeting just a few days later.

155
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,480
How did you get back into the city?

156
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,280
They are searching for you everywhere.

157
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,200
The Palace Guard only oversees
the court.

158
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,640
Their authority doesn't extend
to the city gates.

159
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,360
You had us worried for days for nothing.

160
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,400
Oh,

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,120
what happened

162
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,600
after Mu Wuyin returned?

163
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,600
He used medicine to control Father.

164
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,640
And Meng Zhongyan now
commands the Palace Guard.

165
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,400
The two of them are in cahoots.

166
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,080
And Wuyin is marrying
Meng Zhenzhen tomorrow.

167
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,480
Why would he marry her?

168
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,880
He locked Father away in Qingxiu Temple,

169
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,880
using meditation as an excuse.

170
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,760
Then he forced Father

171
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,480
to write an abdication decree.

172
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Have you met His Majesty?

173
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,680
Father gave me this military decree.

174
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,180
(Deployment Edict)

175
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,600
But there's no imperial seal.

176
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,720
Since you've returned,

177
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,280
have you heard anything
about Empress Lv?

178
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
Only that she
and Mu Wuyin arrived in Qi.

179
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,160
She wouldn't abandon
her power in Beiyuan

180
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,240
just to help Mu Wuyin seize the throne.

181
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,520
There's only one possibility.

182
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,600
She was forced to come.

183
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,080
In that case,

184
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
her hiding place may be right

185
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,320
under our noses.

186
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,900
(Shunjing Residence)

187
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,080
(Mu Wuyin knows he failed to kill me.)

188
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,000
(Now with the abdication decree
in hand,)

189
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,040
(he could announce it at any moment.)

190
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,240
(Happiness)
(We search his residence for her)

191
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,440
(and use her to hold Mu Wuyin at bay.)

192
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,320
You've been here before.

193
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,440
Did you ever see shackles?

194
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,480
Not once.

195
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,200
It looks like Empress Lv

196
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,960
was forced to come by Mu Wuyin.

197
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,280
But where could she be now?

198
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,960
It's a marriage contract.

199
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,000
So Mu Wuyin is marrying...

200
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,760
Empress Lv?

201
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,960
The wedding is tomorrow.

202
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,760
That means she must be
in the palace right now.

203
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,440
He actually wants to marry
the Empress of Beiyuan in grand fashion?

204
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,520
He has completely lost his mind.

205
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,400
Qingying, if you don't know,

206
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,360
Mu Wuyin has always been obsessed
with Empress Lv.

207
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
He will grant her every request.

208
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,080
Don't tell me he's going

209
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,400
to hand over Qi to her?

210
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,680
It's very likely.

211
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,720
The moment he announces the abdication,

212
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,800
he'll also crown her as the empress.

213
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,640
When the court gathers

214
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,600
for the wedding,

215
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,240
that will be our best chance
to expose him.

216
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,720
But breaking into the main hall

217
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,120
with just a few of us

218
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,800
and the shadow guards,

219
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,240
it won't be enough.

220
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,400
Then we leave at once.

221
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,880
We'll call in help from the garrison
with the deployment edict.

222
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,720
Zaiye, the capital garrison is far.

223
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,000
Can we really make it in time?

224
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
The round trip will take
more than twenty hours.

225
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,920
There's no time to lose.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,920
Let's go.

227
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,160
Chancellor,

228
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,480
maybe I can buy you some time.

229
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,960
If Meng Zhenzhen finds out

230
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,040
Mu Wuyin isn't marrying her,

231
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,120
what do you think she'll do?

232
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,520
Are you planning to see her?

233
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,800
But what if she doesn't believe you?

234
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,120
You would be walking into a trap.

235
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,840
Taohua,

236
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,840
don't worry.

237
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,080
I will come back
with reinforcements in time.

238
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:06,920
All right.

239
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,320
I'll wait for you.

240
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,640
Hyah!

241
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,600
Go!

242
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,720
(Mu Wuyin has some influence)

243
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,800
(in the capital garrison.)

244
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,560
(We'll need to go in disguised)

245
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,480
(to avoid alerting anyone.)

246
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,160
(General Zhou Chonghu commands
the garrison.)

247
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,400
(He is shrewd)

248
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,240
(and opportunistic.)

249
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,040
(With how things stand,
even if he hasn't sided with Mu Wuyin,)

250
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,160
(he's probably waiting to see
who comes out on top.)

251
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,000
(So in this mission,)

252
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,300
(Capital Garrison, Outskirts)
(we must persuade him)

253
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,780
(to take our side.)

254
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,160
Sir, wait.

255
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,680
I'm Prince Wuyin's envoy.

256
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,040
Take me to see General Zhou.

257
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,560
Very well.

258
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,120
(Besides Zhou Chonghu,)

259
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
(we also need the support
of his senior officers.)

260
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,760
(Only they can command
the troops directly.)

261
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,080
(If we can awaken their loyalty)

262
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,400
(to defend the throne,)

263
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,320
(we can mobilize
the entire capital garrison.)

264
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,320
It is Prince Wuyin's wedding tomorrow.

265
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,520
We've been sent
to discuss rotation arrangements.

266
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,400
I'll speak to General Zhou.

267
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,800
I want you to gather

268
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,640
all officers ranked lieutenant
and above here.

269
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:14,920
Yes.

270
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,760
(Prince Wuxia,)

271
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,640
(you will talk to General Zhou.)

272
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,320
(I'll speak to the lower officers.
They once served under me.)

273
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,720
(So leave them to me.)

274
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,800
Officers present!

275
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,760
- Greetings, Chancellor.
- Greetings, Chancellor.

276
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,040
It's been a while.

277
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
What ranks are you two holding now?

278
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,800
(Yao Jing. Right Guard General,
Capital Garrison)

279
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,440
General Yao Jing, the Right Guard General.

280
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,400
(Yuan Qin. Infantry Commandant,
Capital Garrison)

281
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,520
General Yuan Qin, the Infantry Commandant.

282
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,840
If I remember correctly,

283
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,240
I promoted you from a foot soldier
to commandant three years ago.

284
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,880
Now three years have passed,

285
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,640
you're still in that same position
and covered in scars.

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,920
Forgive me, Chancellor.

287
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,320
I've disappointed you.

288
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,120
I, Zhou Chonghu, greet Your Highness.

289
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,920
(Zhou Chonghu, Garrison Commander)

290
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,820
Prince Wuxia,
what brings you here today?

291
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,960
General Zhou,

292
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,000
Wuyin sent someone here already,
didn't he?

293
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,600
Your Highness sees clearly.

294
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,800
But Prince Wuyin is the crown prince.

295
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,200
Overseeing national security

296
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,520
is his duty.

297
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
General Zhou, no need to explain.

298
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,760
I know you.

299
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,240
You've never played factions
or politics.

300
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,240
You only follow Father's orders.

301
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,000
His Majesty gave me my position.

302
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,800
I'll stay loyal to him to the death.

303
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,640
Good.

304
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,080
Then take a look at this.

305
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,720
Your Highness,

306
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,920
forgive me.

307
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,640
But I can't tell
whose handwriting this is.

308
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
General Zhou,

309
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,240
are you not acknowledging
Father's decree?

310
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,440
I dare not.

311
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,600
But I'm just a rough man.

312
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,120
I barely read.

313
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,840
Let alone recognize handwriting.

314
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,240
I've always obeyed the seal.

315
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,440
In our military system,

316
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,640
our soldier recruits only come
from three groups.

317
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,560
The commoners, refugees,
and military households.

318
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,480
You've all fought
your way up to command.

319
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
But I know you haven't forgotten
your roots.

320
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,440
- We dare not, Chancellor!
- We dare not, Chancellor!

321
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,760
It's not that you wouldn't dare
to forget.

322
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,840
You can't forget.

323
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,640
As you climbed your way up,

324
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,840
how many times

325
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,040
have you faced death?

326
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,600
How many fallen comrades
have you buried?

327
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,120
And those who survived,
aren't they all covered in scars?

328
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,200
But the noble families

329
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,920
who were born into privilege
have never experienced it.

330
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,520
So they will never care.

331
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,520
General Zhou,

332
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,000
you say you're a rough

333
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,680
and uneducated man.

334
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,240
Then let me help you analyze

335
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,840
the risks and the gains.

336
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,920
Mu Wuyin has imprisoned Father,

337
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,120
seized control of the Palace Guard,
and has the throne in his hands.

338
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,040
You have three choices.

339
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,240
First,

340
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,720
if you're thinking of staying neutral,

341
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,600
then whether you're blind to reality

342
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,360
or just looking out for yourself,
you'll end up with nothing in the end.

343
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,800
Second,

344
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,120
you could turn me in
and pledge loyalty to him.

345
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,760
But you have missed out
on the perfect timing.

346
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,080
The Meng family

347
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,320
and General Qi of the Palace Guard sided
with him early.

348
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,200
That's what we call timely support.

349
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,960
Now that he's on the verge
of seizing power,

350
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,320
knowing what he's like,

351
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,160
he'll have no use

352
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,080
for your empty gestures.

353
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,600
Your third option,
if you join me in protecting the throne,

354
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,120
this battle

355
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,400
will make you a hero.

356
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,640
Prince Wuyin is deeply tied

357
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,320
to the noble families.

358
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,000
If he takes the throne,
your children will still have

359
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,960
to risk their lives just

360
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,880
to climb the ranks.

361
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,440
You've all clawed your way
through hardships.

362
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,160
Do you really want to settle for that?

363
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,200
Comrades,

364
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,560
fight with me today
to defend the rightful ruler

365
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,880
and bring justice to the land!

366
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,720
Will you fight with me?

367
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,880
- We will!
- We will!

368
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,760
- We will!
- We will!

369
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,960
- We will!
- We will!

370
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,120
- We will!
- We will!

371
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,760
Your Highness, I'll be honest.

372
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,800
I may command the troops.

373
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,560
But I don't have the authority
to deploy them.

374
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,400
Even if I wanted to help you,

375
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,360
the men might not follow.

376
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,640
General Zhou,

377
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,400
why don't you come with me
to the training grounds?

378
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,680
Yes, Your Highness.

379
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,080
Seeing really is believing.

380
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,600
Chancellor Shen managed
to rally every lower-ranked officer

381
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,880
to rise in defense of the throne.

382
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,720
Impressive.

383
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,640
But I still have one concern.

384
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,040
Please, speak freely, General Zhou.

385
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,920
The troops have been marching all day.

386
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,040
They're tired

387
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,880
and low on morale.

388
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,840
If His Majesty could appear in person,

389
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,680
it would boost their spirits enough

390
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
to storm the palace.

391
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,440
So what you're saying is,
you won't lead your men into the palace

392
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,200
if His Majesty doesn't show up?

393
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,600
I need a fallback plan.

394
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,680
I hope you understand, Chancellor.

395
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,680
Very well. As you wish.

396
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,200
Set out to Yujing

397
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,440
to defend the Emperor!

398
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:50,160
- Protect His Majesty!
- To the Emperor!

399
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,980
(Yujing)

400
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,840
What a grand bridal procession.

401
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,320
Which noble family is it this time?

402
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,480
They say it's the Meng family.

403
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,560
Yes, it's the Meng family.

404
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,200
Your Highness, look.

405
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,200
They're heading to the Meng residence
to pick up the bride.

406
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,000
If Meng Zhenzhen enters the palace,

407
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,320
we might lose our chance
to speak to her.

408
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,920
Let's wait a bit for the Chancellor.

409
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,200
Hua,

410
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,400
you're the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

411
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,640
Your Highness,
the ceremony's about to begin.

412
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,820
(Qingxiu Temple)

413
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,720
Medicine...

414
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,040
I need medicine.

415
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,200
Your Majesty.

416
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,440
Your Majesty.

417
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,200
Do you want this?

418
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,720
Your Majesty.

419
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,000
- Medicine...
- Your Majesty.

420
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:56,800
Medicine...

421
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,600
Look at you now.

422
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,640
Never thought
I'd see you brought this low.

423
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,400
Right Chancellor Meng,

424
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,520
His Majesty has always been good
to your family.

425
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,400
Is this how you repay him?

426
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,280
You have no shame!

427
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,960
Without the Meng family,

428
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,080
how would the Mu Clan have come
to rule over Qi back then?

429
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,320
Do you think I don't know

430
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,880
you've long grown tired
of the noble families?

431
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,960
You elevated Shen Zaiye

432
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,040
as your tool

433
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,640
just to cut us down!

434
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,040
Give me the medicine!

435
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,360
Your Majesty...

436
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,480
You, traitor.

437
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,200
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

438
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,800
Once Prince Wuyin takes the throne

439
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,120
in two hours,

440
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,640
you'll have all the medicine you want.

441
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,800
There he is.

442
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,320
Let's go.

443
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,600
Easy.

444
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,480
How did it go?

445
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,600
The army is here.

446
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,880
But the generals won't march
on the palace

447
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,360
unless they see His Majesty in person.

448
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,200
The Chancellor took a detour
to Qingxiu Temple

449
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,080
to rescue His Majesty.

450
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
We're almost out of time.

451
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,720
(I must buy time for him.)

452
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,280
Protect the Emperor!

453
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,560
Stop the traitors! Attack!

454
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,200
Shen Zaiye,

455
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,280
just surrender!

456
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,760
We were family once.

457
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,200
I might even spare your life!

458
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,720
Intruders!

459
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,040
Kill them!

460
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,000
Everyone, stop!

461
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,720
Father.

462
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,600
Father.

463
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,360
Father,

464
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,960
are you all right?

465
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,640
Wuxia.

466
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,600
Father, the capital garrison
is just outside the city.

467
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,720
They're waiting for your command
to storm the palace.

468
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,280
Really?

469
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,960
Yes.

470
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,280
Father, get up.

471
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,480
Father, you and Wang Xi go ahead first.

472
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,920
Chancellor Shen is still out there.

473
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,720
I need to help him.

474
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,480
All right.

475
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,480
Please be careful.

476
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,360
Your Majesty, this way.

477
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,200
All right.

478
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,800
Father, go.

479
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,280
Consort Lan, go now.

480
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,800
Slowly now.

481
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,120
Meng Zhongyan, it's over.

482
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,480
You're too late.

483
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,600
Prince Wuyin already has
the abdication decree.

484
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,680
Once he's crowned,

485
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,000
he'll be the rightful ruler of Qi.

486
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,600
The rites were observed.

487
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,320
So his succession is legitimate.

488
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,480
Even His Majesty himself

489
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,400
can't undo it.

490
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,320
Take him away.

491
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,520
- Move it.
- Go.

492
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,640
Let him go.

493
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,040
Let him go first.

494
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,200
If you dare lay a finger
on Prince Wuxia,

495
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,920
I swear you won't even have
a place to rot.

496
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,520
If I can't protect my master,

497
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,720
so what if I die?

498
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,760
Liu Bao,

499
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,960
I know you're loyal.

500
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,240
But Meng Zhongyan has committed treason.

501
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,400
Is this really worth it?

502
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,840
One more step, I swear I'll kill him!

503
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,920
Let him go.

504
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,920
Take me instead.

505
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,440
You?

506
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,000
You're just

507
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,720
a lowborn Chancellor.

508
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,720
Do you think
you're worth the same as a prince?

509
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,400
I'm Prince Wuxia's cousin, Xie Jing'an.

510
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,080
Take me hostage

511
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,680
and you'll still have leverage.

512
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,200
Remember

513
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,960
this handkerchief?

514
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,940
(Xie)

515
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,760
Wuxia,

516
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,040
how is your hand?

517
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,640
Jing'an.

518
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,240
Let me go with you.

519
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,800
No, it's too dangerous.

520
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,640
I can't guarantee your safety.

521
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,200
I'll be fine.

522
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,640
Wuxia,

523
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,560
His Majesty needs you.

524
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,840
The rest, come with me!

525
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,340
(Meng Residence)

526
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,880
I'm not here to hurt you.

527
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,120
I have something important to tell you.

528
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,680
It concerns your life.

529
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,560
If you promise not to scream,

530
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,800
nod.

531
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,720
Jiang Taohua,

532
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,040
you should be hiding right now.

533
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,000
It's foolish

534
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,520
to walk right into your death.

535
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,720
Ever heard the phrase "times change"?

536
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,360
The one about to die isn't me.

537
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,240
I came here

538
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,720
to save you.

539
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,200
You're just trying to scare me.

540
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,520
Do you know

541
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,400
another woman is being prepared

542
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,520
for the wedding

543
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,760
at this moment?

544
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,800
So what?

545
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,840
The Meng family only cares
about the title of empress.

546
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,560
What does the rest of the harem

547
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,040
have to do with me?

548
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,920
That position will go to her.

549
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,520
Prince Wuyin wants the throne.

550
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,080
Why would he sabotage his own plans?

551
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,280
Maybe you're underestimating

552
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,760
how far a man in love can go.

553
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,200
If you enter the palace today,

554
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,160
Mu Wuyin will kill you
to cover his tracks.

555
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,040
He'll swap you out
like nothing ever happened.

556
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,200
Impossible.

557
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,560
Why would he turn on the Meng family?

558
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,800
This marriage contract.

559
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,800
I found it in Mu Wuyin's secret chamber.

560
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,920
The name of the bride

561
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,760
is written on this contract.

562
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,400
Her name is Hua.

563
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,200
(Hua)
She was his personal maid servant.

564
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,600
After his older sister died,

565
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,520
he clung to her like family.

566
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
You're free to verify

567
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,600
everything I've said.

568
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,080
But Hua has another identity.

569
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,320
She's Empress Lv of Beiyuan.

570
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,560
If I'm right,

571
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,840
this alliance with your family

572
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,000
was never what he wanted.

573
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,000
To him,

574
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,600
the Meng family isn't a stepping stone.

575
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,280
It's an obstacle he plans to remove.

576
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,120
I don't believe you.

577
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,440
Why are you telling me all this?

578
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,640
Wouldn't it suit you better

579
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,160
to let us tear each other apart?

580
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,240
How about this?

581
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,640
We make a bet.

582
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Let us into the palace.

583
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,360
If Mu Wuyin really makes a move,

584
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,880
Qingtai will protect you.

585
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,560
If none of what I said happens,

586
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,080
then both our lives

587
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,080
are yours to take.

588
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,500
(Hua)

589
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,280
Why is Prince Wuyin's
wedding being held in the palace?

590
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,080
Only the ruler has the right to do that.

591
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,080
His Majesty hasn't shown himself
in a while.

592
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,520
Prince Wuyin holds all the power now.

593
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,280
Isn't he practically

594
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,160
the ruler already?

595
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,680
Mr. Li,

596
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,800
be careful what you say.

597
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,920
Out of the way!

598
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,240
Make way!

599
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,160
Move aside!

600
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,200
This...

601
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,800
Something feels off here.

602
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,760
Today, a noble man blessed

603
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,480
with imperial favor joined in marriage

604
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,440
with a virtuous lady

605
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,400
from a good family.

606
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,760
May their union last a lifetime

607
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,080
and bring lasting harmony.

608
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,760
- Greetings, Prince Wuyin.
- Greetings, Prince Wuyin.

609
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
Hear the imperial decree!

610
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,520
"By Heaven's will,

611
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,160
I now issue this decree.

612
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,240
My son, Mu Wuyin,

613
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,520
is wise,

614
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,960
known for his virtue,

615
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,440
and loved by the people.

616
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,840
I am old

617
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,280
and no longer have the energy

618
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,760
to carry out the responsibilities
of the throne.

619
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,440
In keeping with ancient custom,

620
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,360
I will step down

621
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,720
and pass the throne to Mu Wuyin.

622
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,480
From today,

623
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,680
I will retire

624
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,040
as Emperor Emeritus.

625
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,760
This decree is issued

626
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,360
for all officials to witness.

627
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,920
Heaven, Earth,

628
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,080
and the gods bear witness."

629
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,440
By imperial order.

630
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,640
Now, do you believe
what I've been telling you?

631
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
Thank you for saving me.

632
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,520
I owe you my life.

633
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,240
The capital garrison is already

634
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,840
at the gates of Yujing.

635
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,800
Mu Wuyin's dream

636
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,080
won't last much longer.

637
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,600
Will you join forces with us?

638
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,160
It's not too late to make things right.

639
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,760
Wasn't this supposed to be a wedding?

640
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,080
Why did it turn
into an abdication ceremony?

641
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,400
Why would His Majesty
suddenly give up the throne?

642
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,360
This doesn't make sense.

643
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,400
(Qi Jian, Commander of the Palace Guard)
Silence! Any more outbursts

644
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,080
(Qi Jian, Commander of the Palace Guard)
will be treated as treason!

645
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,800
Begin the coronation.

646
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,520
All officials, kneel!

647
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,200
His Majesty should be
the one reading the edict.

648
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,880
If we kneel,
we're accepting him as the ruler.

649
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,920
That's right.

650
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,320
His Majesty hasn't even shown up!

651
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,320
You're right about that.

652
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,400
Why hasn't His Majesty appeared?

653
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,720
Kneel!

654
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,000
On your knees!

655
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,360
Begin the coronation ceremony!

656
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,440
Wait!

657
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,920
I, Princess Chengping of Beiyuan,

658
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,800
came to congratulate Prince Wuyin
on his succession.

659
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,600
Why does the Qi State greet me
with swords?

660
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,200
Anyone has the right to drive away

661
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,440
a rude guest

662
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,240
who came uninvited.

663
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,880
Prince Wuyin, calm down.

664
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,560
I'm simply confused by something.

665
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,080
If you can explain it,

666
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,160
I'll leave.

667
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,640
After ascending the throne,

668
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,280
are you making this woman your empress?

669
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,840
That's not the daughter
of the Meng family.

670
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,240
Who is she?

671
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,280
Please explain yourself, Prince Wuyin.

672
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,920
