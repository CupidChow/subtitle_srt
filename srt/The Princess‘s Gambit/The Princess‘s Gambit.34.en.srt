18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,520
Here's the confession letter you want

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,520
(Confession Letter)
and

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,320
the petition Xie Guanyu wrote back then.

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,640
Father said

22
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,440
it was hidden behind the plaque
in his study.

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,600
I hope you will keep your word

24
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
and spare the women and children
of the Meng family.

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,920
I may do what it takes
to get what I want.

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,040
But I won't go back on my word
like your father did.

(Petition)

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,680
I will present this petition

31
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
to His Majesty.

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,640
He will see the truth

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,760
and clear my name.

34
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,140
(Respectfully, Xie Guanyu)

35
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,320
(Father,)

36
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,640
(I will restore our family's honor.)

37
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,980
(Shen Residence)

38
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,960
Today, not only did
Meng Zhongyan confess,

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,400
but I also found the petition
my father wrote back then.

40
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,560
Taohua,

41
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,280
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,280
I...

43
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,800
You don't need to apologize to me.

44
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,160
If you had not stood with Prince Wuxia

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,680
to fight for your family for my sake,

46
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,000
I wouldn't have fallen for you.

47
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,880
You knew?

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,440
Don't worry.

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
I already sent Zhan Lu ahead
with the shadow guards

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,320
to Beiyuan to search for the antidote.

51
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,560
Once I've finished this,

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,880
I'll ride

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,240
to Beiyuan with you.

54
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,360
Chancellor,

55
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,160
just focus on clearing
your father's name.

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,600
Don't worry about me.

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,320
I'll head off with Zhan Lu tomorrow.

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,000
But how can I not worry

59
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,840
when you go back alone?

60
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,080
I have Zhan Lu, Qingtai,
and the shadow guards with me.

61
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,840
I won't be alone.

62
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,600
Besides, Changjue sent a letter today.

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,560
He said he has already gathered support

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,200
from many officials

65
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,120
in Hao City.

66
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Even Qian Mochen?

67
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,680
Changjue did try reaching out.

68
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,360
But Qian Mochen turned him away.

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,520
Luckily, we had warned Changjue.

70
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,720
So he stayed cautious.

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,640
So Qian Mochen doesn't know where he is.

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,840
Good.

73
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,320
So

74
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
don't worry.

75
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,080
Once I reach Hao City,

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,040
Changjue will help me look
for the antidote.

77
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,000
What worries me is

78
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,000
that you always protect Changjue

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,200
and don't let him worry about you.

80
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,120
He's my brother.

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,120
Now that I need his help,

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,360
I'll tell him everything.

83
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,440
So don't worry.

84
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,160
Then promise me
to take care of yourself.

85
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,120
When this is over,

86
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,960
I'll come and find you right away.

87
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,560
I promise.

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,920
Do you have confidence

89
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,400
in tomorrow's court session?

90
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,640
Don't worry.

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,360
Everything's in place.

92
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,240
Court is in session!

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
His Majesty arrives!

94
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,720
You may all leave.

95
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,280
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Father.

96
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,560
Rise.

97
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,680
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

98
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,880
I'm feeling unwell today.

99
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,640
Present only urgent matters.

100
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,960
Your Majesty,
I have an important matter to report.

101
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,280
Proceed.

102
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
Your Majesty,
over several days of questioning,

103
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,000
I've learned that in addition
to treason,

104
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,680
Meng Zhongyan committed
another crime 18 years ago.

105
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,760
He has written a full confession.

106
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,280
I ask Your Majesty to allow me
to present the details.

107
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm not well.

108
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,440
We'll discuss it another day.

109
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,680
Summon the imperial physician.

110
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,120
Father,

111
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,280
the physician will be here shortly.

112
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,320
Please rest.

113
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,120
Allow me to hear the report
on your behalf.

114
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,760
Chancellor Shen,
please proceed with Meng's confession.

115
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,440
According to Meng Zhongyan's confession,
he orchestrated the witchcraft case

116
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,360
eighteen years ago.

117
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,920
He planted cursed objects
to frame Consort Shu

118
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,720
and hid the petition written

119
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
by her brother, Xie Guanyu,
the head of the Xie family.

120
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,960
He then falsely claimed resistance

121
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,720
and ordered the slaughter
of the entire Xie family.

122
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,080
Why?

123
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,520
Because Xie Guanyu had proposed
an imperial exam reform

124
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,280
that threatened the interests
of powerful noble families like his.

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,200
I found

126
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,040
both Xie Guanyu's petition
and Meng Zhongyan's confession

127
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,880
at the Meng residence.

128
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,680
I shall present both to Your Majesty.

129
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,720
Father,

130
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,480
Meng Zhongyan deceived the throne,

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,040
formed private factions,

132
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,280
and murdered loyal subjects.

133
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,880
His crimes cry out for justice.

134
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,640
Please order a retrial of the case.

135
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,280
- Please order a retrial, Your Majesty.
- Please order a retrial, Your Majesty.

136
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,400
Are you trying to drive me to my grave?

137
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,240
What difference is there

138
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,440
between this and the treason
of Mu Wuyin and Meng Zhongyan?

139
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
Meng Zhongyan's crimes

140
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,240
are unforgivable.

141
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,720
All we ask

142
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,680
is to right what was wrong.

143
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,840
How is that the same?

144
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,480
Mu Wuxia,

145
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,240
it looks like
I truly underestimated you.

146
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,920
You're better at winning hearts

147
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,080
than your three brothers ever were.

148
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,440
Even Left Chancellor
now speaks up for you.

149
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,680
Fine.

150
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,680
Why don't I just hand my throne

151
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,440
to you now?

152
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,440
So you can decide
which case for retrials!

153
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,920
Father, please wait.

154
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,320
What now? Do you want to rebel too?

155
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,280
I dare not.

156
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,080
I only speak

157
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,960
from reason.

158
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,680
The witchcraft charges have failed
to convince the public.

159
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,600
Fine.

160
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,240
You

161
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
and you!

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
Stay!

163
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,320
Everyone else is dismissed!

164
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,840
You want to reopen the case

165
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,960
for your mother.

166
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
And you,

167
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,280
Left Chancellor.

168
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,160
What's your reason?

169
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,880
I am

170
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,200
Xie Guanyu's son,

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,040
Xie Jing'an.

172
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,680
Xie Jing'an?

173
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,440
You're still alive?

174
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,680
Your entire clan

175
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,400
was executed.

176
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,080
Yet

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,040
you've hidden at my side
for over a decade.

178
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,080
What's your motive?

179
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,080
By law,

180
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,360
I should have you executed
for deceiving your ruler!

181
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,520
Father,

182
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,880
Jing'an must have suffered greatly

183
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,600
to survive.

184
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,240
He has served

185
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,320
the court loyally for ten years.

186
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,640
He deserves recognition
for both his service and his effort.

187
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,440
Silence!

188
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,680
So long as I live,

189
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,520
that witchcraft case

190
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,480
will never be overturned!

191
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,120
When Meng Zhongyan lied to you,
you did nothing.

192
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,160
When noble clans schemed for power,

193
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,240
you looked the other way.

194
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,520
I have suffered a grave injustice.

195
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,600
All I ask now is
to clear my clan's name.

196
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,520
Is it that Your Majesty
can't tell right from wrong,

197
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,560
or that you simply refuse to admit

198
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,240
that Meng Zhongyan was only the blade
that killed my family,

199
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
and you were the one

200
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,120
who wielded it?

201
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,440
You dare speak to me like that?

202
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,000
Your Majesty.

203
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,640
I've served you loyally

204
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,360
for ten years.

205
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,600
I rooted out traitors

206
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,200
and went against noble families.

207
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
But I am not my father.

208
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,320
I won't let myself become
your pawn in a political game.

209
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,840
The truth

210
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,920
of the witchcraft case is already known.

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,240
History won't lie for your sake.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,120
A hundred years from now,

213
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,200
do you want to be remembered
as a stubborn tyrant

214
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,000
who destroyed the loyal

215
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,880
or

216
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,640
a wise ruler
who could admit his mistakes

217
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
and cherish his loyal ministers?

218
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,800
Father,

219
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,760
Mr. Li Dian is currently drafting

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,920
your royal chronicle.

221
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,520
What?

222
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,600
Are you threatening me now?

223
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
Aren't you afraid I'll execute you both?

224
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,320
Your Majesty,

225
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,200
what I've said today

226
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,880
may be bold.

227
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,640
But this will be

228
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,640
my final counsel to the throne.

229
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,880
What are you up to now?

230
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,040
I will resign my post

231
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,960
as Left Chancellor
to live among the common people.

232
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,760
As I take my leave,

233
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,600
I beg Your Majesty

234
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
to retry the witchcraft case

235
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
and clear the Xie family

236
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
and Consort Shu,

237
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,920
the mother
of the future Crown Prince Wuxia's

238
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,520
name.

239
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,340
(Xie Residence)

240
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,520
(Imperial Edict)

241
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,920
(A nation's strength lies)

242
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,600
(in the clarity of its laws.)

243
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,360
(When justice is clouded,)

244
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,040
(evil thrives,)

245
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,800
(and the loyal suffer.)

246
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,360
(Now that the truth is revealed,)

247
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,200
(I hereby decree.)

248
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
(Xie Guanyu and his kin)

249
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,280
(were indeed wrongfully accused)

250
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,160
(and framed.)

251
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,880
(Xie Guanyu's former ranks
and titles are restored.)

252
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,160
(Consort Shu
shall be posthumously titled "Yi",)

253
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,760
(to honor her virtue.)

254
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,800
(Xie Residence)

255
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,880
(Let this be proclaimed)

256
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,240
(across the land.)

257
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,720
(Father. Mother.)

258
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,760
(I have cleared our family's name.)

259
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,800
(May your spirits)

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
(finally rest in peace.)

261
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,420
(Xie Residence)

262
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,480
Have you paid your respects?

263
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,080
I think Uncle's spirit

264
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,720
can rest in peace now.

265
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,840
Zaiye, are you really leaving?

266
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,320
I don't want you to go.

267
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,360
Wuxia doesn't want you to go either.

268
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,600
Right?

269
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,600
Say something, you block of wood.

270
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,080
Qingying, don't make a scene.

271
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,520
Taohua has already gone to Beiyuan.

272
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,880
She's waiting for me.

273
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,760
Then promise you'll come visit often.

274
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Or better yet, we'll come visit you.

275
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,080
Mu Wuxia, will you go with me?

276
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,680
Wuxia's going

277
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,480
to be the Crown Prince soon.

278
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,880
He can't just enter
another state like that.

279
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,440
As for you, Qingying,

280
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,160
you need to grow up.

281
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,800
You're about to become
the Crown Princess.

282
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,160
Then you need to settle down too.

283
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,680
You're about to be a Prince Consort.

284
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,360
Wuxia, Qingying lost her father
at a young age, and I've spoiled her.

285
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,760
You'll need to keep her in check.

286
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,200
There's no need to hold back.

287
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,640
I understand, Jing'an.

288
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,920
You wouldn't dare.

289
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,720
Jing'an, there will always be a place
for you in Qi.

290
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,640
I've lived under a false name
and endured humiliation all these years

291
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,400
for two reasons.

292
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,800
First, to clear the Xie family's name

293
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,840
from the witchcraft case,

294
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,640
and to help you grow strong enough

295
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,480
to rule.

296
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,120
For ten years,

297
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,640
I gave everything

298
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,400
as a subject,

299
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,080
a son,

300
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
and an elder brother.

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,760
I have no regrets.

302
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,080
Now that justice has been done,

303
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,360
and

304
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,400
you are soon to become Crown Prince,

305
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,240
my only wish

306
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
is to keep Taohua safe,

307
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,800
find a quiet place away from the world,
and grow old with her.

308
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,800
Then

309
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,720
I hope you and Taohua will take care

310
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,840
and live the life you deserve.

311
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,280
The road ahead is long.

312
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,480
Qi will depend on you now.

313
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,380
(Beiyuan Palace)

314
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,240
Cui Wei,

315
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,240
your efforts were key

316
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,360
to my safe return.

317
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,680
You're too kind, Your Highness.

318
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,200
After Your Highness met
with Mu Wuyin that day,

319
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
we lost all trace of you

320
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
in Luocheng.

321
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,680
So I sent riders

322
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,480
to Qi State to search for you.

323
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,400
Thankfully,

324
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,720
they succeeded

325
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,920
and found you.

326
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Everyone thought
I perished in that fire.

327
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,400
But there was a hidden passage
beneath my chamber.

328
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
That's how I escaped

329
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,440
the capital of Qi State back then
without anyone noticing.

330
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,080
And now,

331
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,760
that same passage saved my life again.

332
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,080
Your Highness is blessed by the heavens.

333
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,760
Naturally, no danger can harm you.

334
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,680
While I've been away,

335
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,560
what has happened in Hao City?

336
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,960
Your Highness,

337
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Jiang Changjue has arrived in the city.

338
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,080
Our spies found

339
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,240
he has been in secret contact
with the State Preceptor

340
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,680
and Deputy Chief Yue.

341
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,680
They plan to install a new ruler

342
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,440
at tomorrow's court session.

343
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,320
Jiang Changjue

344
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,840
is staying at a residence arranged

345
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,400
by Deputy Chief Yue.

346
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,560
Take men and eliminate
Jiang Changjue immediately.

347
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,960
Bring me his head.

348
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,040
Yes, Your Highness.

349
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
The news from Qi says

350
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Empress Lv and Mu Wuyin

351
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,640
both perished in the fire.

352
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,600
I've already requested Deputy Chief Yue
to summon the officials who support us.

353
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,480
We'll change the tides of this state
at tomorrow's court session.

354
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,080
Your Highness,
there's a group of strangers outside.

355
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,680
The one leading them looks like Cui Wei.

356
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Your Highness,
this place is no longer safe.

357
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,560
We'll leave through the back.

358
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,360
Quick.

359
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,520
Commander Cui, they've escaped.

360
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,080
Here's what we'll do.
You all go hide in the secret chamber.

361
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,760
I'll head out to alert Deputy Chief Yue.

362
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,880
Your Highness, let me come with you.

363
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,280
You're attending court tomorrow.

364
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,960
We can't risk anything happening to you.

365
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,280
All right, that works.

366
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,400
The rest of you, follow me!

367
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:45,840
Let's go.

368
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,240
Why did you betray me?

369
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,280
Men die for wealth,
just as birds die for food.

370
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,760
Hurry! Don't let him get away!

371
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,840
Commander Cui, the spy we planted

372
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,280
with Jiang Changjue, is dead.

373
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,840
Useless fool.

374
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Commander Cui,
he seems to have gone that way.

375
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,320
After him.

376
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,600
If we lose him, how am I supposed to
explain to Her Highness?

377
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,960
Send some men to stake out
Deputy Chief Yue's residence.

378
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,440
If Jiang Changjue shows up,

379
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,640
seize him immediately.

380
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,760
Split up and go after him.

381
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,040
(Empress Lv is still alive?)

382
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,640
Her Highness arrives!

383
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,560
- Peace and blessings, Your Highness.
- Peace and blessings, Your Highness.

384
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,680
I'm here to attend to His Majesty.

385
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,160
You may leave.

386
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,960
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

387
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,560
Stay.

388
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,760
I'm ordering you to stay.

389
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,120
Stay...

390
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
You were once

391
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,080
a charismatic, charming,

392
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,960
and commanding ruler.

393
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,680
Now look at how you have fallen
to such a disgrace,

394
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,080
it's hard to even bear the sight.

395
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:46,840
I...

396
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,540
(Emperor of Beiyuan)
I have treated you well.

397
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,000
Don't forget

398
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,800
that

399
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,800
you were just a dancer
from Liufang Court.

400
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,120
You're right, Your Majesty.

401
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,320
You did treat me well.

402
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,120
I came from humble origins.

403
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,840
I was humiliated in Qi.

404
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,760
Then I fled to Beiyuan,
where I ended up as a dancer.

405
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,840
I twisted my ankle
and couldn't perform one night.

406
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,360
A distinguished guest ordered me

407
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,240
to stand barefoot on ice to heal.

408
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,920
From that night on,

409
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,520
I could never dance again

410
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,800
and lost my livelihood.

411
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
My body was ruined by the cold,

412
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,240
and I could never bear children.

413
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,440
Even my last hope of marrying into

414
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,240
a decent family was shattered
by the cruelty of Beiyuan.

415
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,480
I searched far and wide

416
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,080
and finally discovered
that distinguished guest that night

417
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,680
was you,

418
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,960
Your Majesty.

419
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,680
I

420
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,520
don't remember.

421
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,400
Medicine...

422
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,760
Medicine.

423
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,760
Your Majesty,

424
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,840
savor this despair.

425
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,680
It's what I felt back then.

426
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,640
Are...

427
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,400
Are you out of your mind?

428
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,240
To get revenge,

429
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,120
I got close to you.

430
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,840
I flattered and schemed without shame

431
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,840
until you gave me status.

432
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,840
Wasn't

433
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,560
that enough?

434
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,800
How is that enough?

435
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,840
Then I took hold of court affairs

436
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,200
and ruled from behind the curtain.

437
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,600
I never thought
it would bring me the joy

438
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,400
I had never known before.

439
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,680
Life and death hang on

440
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,600
the stroke of a brush.

441
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,120
I, Lv Yuanhua,

442
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,880
no longer had to be trampled on.

443
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,200
They dread me and fear me.

444
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,720
For nearly a decade, I've held power.

445
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,040
This throne

446
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,600
should have been mine long ago.

447
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,760
You...

448
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,960
You vile woman.

449
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,480
Someone...

450
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,640
Help...

451
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,360
Someone...

452
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,960
Save me.

453
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,080
Once I take the throne,

454
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,120
I'll wipe out

455
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,080
every last one of your Jiang clan.

456
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,960
Not a single one shall remain.

457
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,380
(Hao City, Beiyuan Capital City)

458
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,180
(Hao City)

459
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,480
Miss, come and take a look.

460
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,320
Let's go.

461
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,240
Zhan Lu, look.

462
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,600
That's our famous Hao City wine.

463
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,840
And over there.

464
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,200
I said, look.

465
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,560
(Hao City's streets and alleys)

466
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,360
(- look just as I remembered.)
- That's it.

467
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,840
Push him.

468
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,360
(Empress Lv,)

469
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,680
(this was the freedom I dreamt of)

470
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,080
(when you locked me up back then.)

471
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,960
(But now,)

472
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,840
(your ambition and cruelty)

473
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,440
(have all been burned to ashes.)

474
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,760
(This time,)

475
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,160
(nothing will stop Changjue and me)

476
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,080
(from reclaiming what's ours.)

477
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,820
(Postal Inn)

478
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,680
Her Highness has arrived!

479
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,520
My dear ministers, it's been a while.

480
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:07,112
How have you all been?

481
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,400
- Peace and blessings, Your Highness.
- Peace and blessings, Your Highness.

482
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,200
I have returned safe and sound.

483
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,080
What's with

484
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,000
the long faces?

485
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,320
Don't tell me

486
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,340
(Yue Xingming, Deputy Chief Censor)
you're disappointed.

487
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,120
I heard that when Jiang Changjue
first arrived in Hao City,

488
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,320
the first person he approached
was you, State Preceptor.

489
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,360
(Qian Mochen, Beiyuan State Preceptor)
The messenger he sent was beaten out

490
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,260
of my residence

491
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,200
by my orders.

492
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,040
At that time,
Commander Cui happened to be present.

493
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
He can vouch for me.

494
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,880
Since today's assembly is
to determine the new ruler,

495
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,760
who would like to speak first?

496
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,440
Your Highness.

497
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,320
Since no one else steps forward,
allow me.

498
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,080
Commander Cui, please speak.

499
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,120
Your Highness.

500
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,320
For over a decade,
His Majesty had been gravely ill.

501
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,400
The affairs of state have rested
on your shoulders.

502
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,560
Now, for the stability of the court
and the will of the people,

503
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,080
you should follow the will
of heaven and the people

504
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,440
and take the reins.

505
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,360
This is outrageous.

506
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
It's usurping the throne!

507
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,200
Your Highness, not once in history

508
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,480
has a woman taken the throne.

509
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,120
His Majesty would never give
the throne to you.

510
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,960
I request to see His Majesty.

511
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,240
- I request to see His Majesty.
- I request to see His Majesty.

512
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,840
Oh, did I forget to mention?

513
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,640
His Majesty passed away last night.

514
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,440
What?

515
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,640
The Crown Prince, Jiang Changjue,
died in unfortunate circumstances.

516
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,920
Your Highness,
without an official decree of succession,

517
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,080
we will never recognize you as ruler.

518
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,520
Commander Cui,

519
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,320
I've grown tired
of Deputy Chief Yue's endless prattle.

520
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,600
He's annoyingly loud.

521
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,240
Deputy Chief Yue has insulted
Her Highness.

522
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,440
Take him away and have him executed!

523
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,280
This...

524
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,400
If my death can uphold justice,

525
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,800
then let it be so!

526
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,840
You evil empress,
you will not die a good death!

527
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,560
As for the rest of you,

528
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,240
any more objections?

529
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,560
- Please show mercy, Your Highness!
- Please show mercy, Your Highness!

530
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,600
I suggest you all know your place.

531
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,240
Do not play with fire,
or your future will suffer.

532
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,000
You're all dismissed.

533
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,200
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

534
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,280
State Preceptor, stay.

535
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,680
Step forward.

536
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,600
Yes, Your Highness.

537
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,920
If I recall correctly,

538
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,840
your poison is about to flare up.

539
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,400
So I trust you know time is short.

540
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,160
Choose an auspicious date
for my coronation immediately.

541
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,080
Yes, I'll do all I can.

542
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,800
(Postal Inn)

543
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,240
Word just came from the palace.

544
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,640
They say the Emperor of Beiyuan
passed away last night.

545
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,040
What do we do now?

546
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,760
The Emperor is now dead,

547
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,240
and the Crown Prince is also missing.

548
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,920
Beiyuan has truly descended into chaos.

549
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,160
Zhan Lu,

550
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,920
have they verified it?

551
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,240
Could there have been a mistake?

552
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,240
No, there's no mistake.

553
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,040
We were all fooled
by Empress Lv's decoy.

554
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,520
No one knows

555
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,760
how she made it back to Beiyuan.

556
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,680
How am I supposed to break this
to the Princess?

557
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,360
Your Highness...

558
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,120
Your Highness.

559
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,640
I've heard everything.

560
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,680
Right now,

561
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,360
the priority is to locate Changjue.

562
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,160
Let's go and speak to Qian Mochen.

563
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,840
We've located Qian Mochen's whereabouts.

564
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,200
So we're here to report it to you.

565
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,320
All right. You can leave now.

566
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,080
Yes, Your Highness.

567
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,920
Greetings, Your Highness.

568
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,920
Thanks to you, State Preceptor,

569
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,920
I was cast out of my homeland
and forced into a political marriage.

570
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,520
I'm hardly worthy
of the title "Princess" anymore.

571
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,040
Did you return home

572
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,000
just to condemn your master's betrayal?

573
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,960
If you want to eat, you should pay up.

574
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,360
You should be grateful

575
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,400
I even bothered
to take this lousy silver lock.

576
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,760
Hand it over!

577
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,280
Mother gave this lock to Taohua!

578
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Let go!

579
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,480
Give it to me, brat!

580
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,640
Changjue,

581
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,120
are you all right?

582
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,480
Taohua,

583
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,720
why isn't Father protecting us?

584
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,680
What did we do wrong?

585
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,120
I'll be good, I promise.

586
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,480
I got your longevity lock back.

587
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,840
It's yours again.

588
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,560
Who are you?

589
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,720
I'm Qian

590
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,760
Mochen.

591
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,280
I'm just a wanderer

592
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,800
who once received Empress Helan's favor.

593
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,120
Now I return to repay her.

594
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,600
My mother...

595
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,520
She's gone.

596
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,040
Then let me stay by your side

597
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,840
until you're strong enough

598
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,400
to protect yourselves.

599
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,200
But this is the palace.

600
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,280
It won't be easy for you to get back in.

601
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,880
Though my knowledge of the scriptures
and ancient astronomy is limited,

602
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,680
I've been appointed State Preceptor.

603
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,040
Then may we take you as our teacher?

604
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,880
Just what I had in mind.

605
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,760
I came to find you for Changjue.

606
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,880
I've searched the city for days,
but he's nowhere to be found.

607
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,880
Does this have anything to do with you?

608
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,680
Do you know

609
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,960
Empress Lv is still alive?

610
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,760
She intends to take the throne.

611
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,440
Then that makes it all the more urgent
to find Changjue.

612
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,400
Tell me where he is.

613
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,120
I don't know.

614
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,560
But

615
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
I've already sent people out
to search for him.

616
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,840
Didn't know you had such a good heart.

617
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,920
Have you heard about His Majesty?

618
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,920
I know he has passed.

619
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,080
Since you already know,

620
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,160
there's something important

621
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,040
I must give you.

622
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:52,840
What is it?

623
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,000
The late Emperor's edict
to pass the throne to Changjue

624
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,400
is in my residence.
