I'm not the one you're after.

23
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,360
You got the wrong person.

24
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,750

39
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,920
Master, I have news.

40
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,570
After we got to the cremation ground,

41
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,510
Shen Zaiye rushed in and took her away.

42
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,240
That confirms it.

43
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,310
The woman must be Jiang Taohua.

44
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,510
But if she's still alive,

45
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,040
why has she been staying
with Prince Wuyin?

46
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,000
Unless...

47
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,260
there's bad blood between
Prince Wuyin and Shen Zaiye?

48
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,720
Should I look into it?

49
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,560
No.

50
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,270
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

51
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,720
Let's just sit back and watch the show.

52
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,680
That man might be one of my enemies.

53
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,720
I'll get to the bottom of it.

54
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,190
No.

55
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,240
I'll just treat it as a false alarm.

56
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,190
Chancellor Shen,
how did you know I was in trouble?

57
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,510
His Majesty's attendant

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,690
said he saw you
at Prince Wuyin's Residence.

59
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,720
His Majesty wanted to summon you

60
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,430
and see you.

61
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,240
Luckily,

62
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,430
Prince Wuyin arranged for another woman

63
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,190
to take your place.

64
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,390
You really do have
eyes and ears everywhere.

65
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,360
Nothing seems to escape you.

66
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,190
I just happen to care about someone.

67
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,830
The physician said

68
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,120
you should go somewhere familiar.

69
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,410
It might help restore your memory.

70
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,720
I must stay at Prince Wuyin's
residence to find Qingtai.

71
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,600
I understand.

72
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,920
(Shen Zaiye.)

73
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,630
(Thank you for saving me.)

74
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,480
(Wedding)
(But no matter what we once had,)

75
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,040
(I have to go back and figure out)

76
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,270
(the link between)

77
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,040
(Empress Lv and Prince Wuyin.)

78
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,360
(Empress Lv really is something else.)

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,950
(Did she even manage to
bring Prince Wuyin over to her side?)

80
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,160
It's Jiangtao poison.

81
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Quick, get Eunuch Ren.

82
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,070
He's already dead.

83
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,000
The only antidote is probably
in Prince Wuyin's residence.

84
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,750
Zhan Lu, hurry!

85
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,360
Yes, sir!

86
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,560
Hyah!

87
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,140
(Shunjing Residence)

88
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,510
I'll walk on my own.

89
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,410
I don't feel safe letting you go.

90
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,950
Prince Wuyin's been lying to you.

91
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,870
Going back is like walking into a trap.

92
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,630
If he's still lying to me,

93
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,750
it means one thing.

94
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm still useful to him.

95
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,200
But if I leave with you now,

96
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,630
then to him,

97
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm nothing but a discarded piece.

98
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,750
Take care.

99
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,870
(Jiang Taohua.)

100
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,390
(I swear I'll find a cure for you,)

101
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,360
(and help you save Changjue,)

102
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,270
(so you won't have to live in fear)

103
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,080
(and terror,)

104
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,120
(or always bracing yourself
for the worst.)

105
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,870
(I promise.)

106
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,720
Meng, hang in there.

107
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,150
The physician will be here soon.

108
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
It won't help.

109
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,390
I've had this ailment
since I was a child.

110
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,120
Only the special medicine from Beiyuan

111
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,750
can treat it.

112
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,790
Otherwise,

113
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,070
not even a miracle doctor
could save me.

114
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,030
I only ask one thing of Your Highness.

115
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,390
Go ahead.

116
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,840
After I die...

117
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,000
Your Highness,

118
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,480
please do not tell anyone.

119
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,320
Why not?

120
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,150
My younger brother, Changjue,

121
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,270
is at the Beiyuan military camp.

122
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,270
I want him

123
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,870
to always believe

124
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,480
that I am living well

125
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,600
here in Qi.

126
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,670
So the bond between you two

127
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,030
runs deep.

128
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,200
Yes.

129
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,510
For Changjue,

130
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,240
I am willing to do anything.

131
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,720
Take it.

132
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
(So Prince Wuyin
really has the antidote.)

133
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,120
(He and Empress Lv)

134
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,000
(really are working together.)

135
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,440
Your Highness,

136
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,720
how do you have
the antidote to Jiangtao pill?

137
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,670
I am the real master
behind Lan Boutique.

138
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
(Lan Boutique?)

139
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,380
(Lan Boutique)

140
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,870
(Lv)
(Whatever happened between us,)

141
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,670
(is not something a eunuch
should be poking into.)

142
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,030
(It was him.)

143
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,270
From now on, your life

144
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,480
and your brother's life

145
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,550
are both in your hands.

146
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,720
Yes, Your Highness.

147
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,480
I will do as you say.

148
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,670
In the future,

149
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,240
when Lan Boutique is rebuilt,

150
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,240
you will be very useful.

151
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,740
(Shen Residence)

152
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,020
(Chancellor, we did everything we could
to get the three ingredients.)

153
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,560
(We were ambushed in Beiyuan.
To avoid exposing ourselves,)

154
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,060
(I had to send a message by pigeon.)

155
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,300
(Final words from Zengtu.)

156
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,150
Chancellor,

157
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,480
our men were attacked by

158
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,380
Empress Lv's soldier while retreating.

159
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,630
To avoid getting compromised,

160
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,510
they took their own lives.

161
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,240
The families of our fallen brothers

162
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,080
will be supported by us.

163
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,600
Yes, sir.

164
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,080
Chancellor,

165
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,510
we do not have the antidote.

166
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,270
What about the Princess?

167
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,270
I will not approach her for now.

168
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,600
It might put her in danger.

169
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,080
(Jiang Taohua, don't worry.)

170
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,440
(Once I handle all of this,)

171
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,270
(I'll bring you home.)

172
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,860
(Serenity and Elegance)

173
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,030
As long as I'm here,

174
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,510
your meals will always be just right.

175
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,960
But...

176
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,120
I do sometimes cook
at His Highness's annex.

177
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,750
Enough chatter.

178
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,790
(I lost a day yesterday.)

179
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,030
(I must find Qingtai today.)

180
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,480
(But the question is,)

181
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,030
(how do I get to that annex?)

182
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,510
Miss Meng, time to eat.

183
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,750
(Got it.)

184
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,390
I am not eating.

185
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
We're going out.

186
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,120
Go out?

187
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,550
Where are we going?

188
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,200
I dreamed of a giant snake
falling from the sky last night.

189
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,270
I heard as a child

190
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,360
that it is a sign of unrest at home.

191
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,030
I want to visit a nearby temple

192
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,720
and pray for a protective charm
for Prince Wuyin

193
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,480
to keep his household safe.

194
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,200
But Lord Qingfeng said

195
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,510
you are not allowed to leave.

196
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,320
Who has more authority?

197
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,750
Lord Qingfeng

198
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,870
or Prince Wuyin?

199
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,200
Prince Wuyin does.

200
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,270
And you know full well

201
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,150
that Prince Wuyin believes
in karma and fate.

202
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,600
Heaven sent me a dream,

203
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,000
and you're trying to stop me.

204
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,030
Then, I'll go to Prince Wuyin

205
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,080
and tell him myself.

206
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,200
If this ruins everything

207
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
he has worked so hard to build,

208
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,910
then the consequences

209
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,870
will be too great
for either of us to bear.

210
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,480
Please, Miss Meng.

211
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,200
If you wish to pray at the temple,

212
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,480
I will go with you.

213
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,480
After you.

214
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,320
Sturdy bamboo baskets!

215
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,630
Built to last!

216
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,840
Traditional medicinal wine,

217
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,320
good for whatever ails you!

218
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,440
You two really have an eye for quality.

219
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,270
These are all new fabrics I just got in.

220
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,390
(Yunshang Fabric Store)

221
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,720
(A fabric store.)

222
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,670
(This is the place.)

223
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,870
Miss Meng?

224
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,440
Miss Meng?

225
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,250
Weren't we going to the temple?

226
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,480
Why stop by a fabric store?

227
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,960
You silly boy.

228
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,510
You really don't understand women.

229
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,960
What woman goes out without
picking up some rouge or powder,

230
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,630
or getting a new dress made?

231
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,620
(Yunshang Fabric Store)

232
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,630
Whose daughter is this?

233
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,670
You're absolutely radiant.

234
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,080
You light up my humble little shop.

235
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,200
Take your time, miss.

236
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,870
See if anything catches your eye.

237
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,600
Listen to me rambling...

238
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,840
With that fair skin and noble air,

239
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,720
you wouldn't settle
for anything ordinary.

240
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,910
Right this way.

241
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,510
This is Wuling brocade.

242
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,440
Take a look.

243
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:01,910
This is it.

244
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:02,840
Sure.

245
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,840
Miss, please come inside.

246
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,910
I need her measurements
for a new dress.

247
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,670
Why are you following her in?

248
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,000
I...

249
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,550
You have no sense at all.

250
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,600
Wait outside.

251
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,910
Miss.

252
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Shopkeeper, do you have any tea here?

253
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,270
I have the finest Longjing.

254
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,310
Just give me a moment,
I'll bring some right over.

255
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,030
Miss, here's the tea I just brewed.

256
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,790
Miss?

257
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,720
Where did she go?

258
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,240
I don't know!

259
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,470
I'm from Prince Wuyin's residence.

260
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,670
If I don't find her today,

261
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,600
you're dead to me.

262
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,480
(He didn't go home.)

263
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,640
(He must've gone to the annex
for Prince Wuyin.)

264
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,640
Chancellor, a report came in.

265
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,920
The Princess left with a servant.

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,750
But later,

267
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,720
she ditched the servant

268
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,310
and headed for the outskirts.

269
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,790
Prince Wuyin has never let
Jiang Taohua leave alone.

270
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,920
Zhan Lu, come with me.

271
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,000
I lost track of Miss Meng.

272
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,070
Please punish me.

273
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,350
You're a disappointment and a failure.

274
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,510
Scram!

275
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,480
Monster! Go ahead and kill me!

276
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,240
(Qingtai!)

277
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,110
I can insult you all I want!

278
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,070
If I weren't tied up,

279
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,240
I'd kill you myself.

280
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,160
Slap her.

281
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,590
(Empress Lv.)

282
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,590
(What is she doing here in Qi?)

283
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,960
(And Prince Wuyin is with her.)

284
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,000
(They really are in it together.)

285
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,790
Sharp tongue, yet no manners.

286
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,400
You should've been sent
to the underworld ages ago.

287
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,590
You'll die the worst death!

288
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,750
Keep going.

289
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,790
(If this keeps up,)

290
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,480
(Qingtai will be beaten to death.)

291
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,960
(No.)

292
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,880
(I need to think of something fast.)

293
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,680
Oh no, there's a fire!

294
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,720
Someone help!

295
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Help!

296
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,590
It's bad. The fire's too strong!

297
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,750
Report to the master!

298
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,030
Your Highness,
the courtyard is on fire!

299
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,590
The guards say

300
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,480
it's too intense.

301
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,480
It won't be put out anytime soon.

302
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,070
This is unusual.

303
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,510
It might expose us.

304
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,590
Kill her.

305
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,480
Yes.

306
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,160
Tell everyone to evacuate.

307
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,790
Make sure there's no trace.

308
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,400
(Qingtai!)

309
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,120
Jiang Taohua...

310
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,590
I prayed for you.

311
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,640
You will not die.

312
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,960
You cannot die.

313
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,400
Jiang Taohua, wake up.

314
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,070
Wake up.

315
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,590
You wicked scoundrel!

316
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,480
I'm from Beiyuan.

317
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
I follow who I marry.

318
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,510
I live with who I marry.

319
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,030
(So what if I'm just a concubine?)

320
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,880
(I don't feel wronged.)

321
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,160
(But in the Chancellor's garden,)

322
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,110
(I'm just another flower.)

323
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,590
(If I could stay here forever,)

324
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,830
(far from all the court's chaos,)

325
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,790
(how wonderful that'd be.)

326
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,480
(It was you.)

327
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,240
(You hurt me,)

328
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,640
(set me up,)

329
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,960
(and tried to kill me.)

330
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,680
(But it was also you)

331
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,790
(who protected me,)

332
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,240
(saved me, and worried about me.)

333
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,070
(Shen Zaiye...)

334
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,200
(I never imagined that you and I)

335
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,640
(had such a complicated past.)

336
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,030
Jiang Taohua!

337
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,110
Qingtai?

338
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,480
Where is Qingtai?

339
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,240
Zhan Lu is looking after her.

340
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,680
Qingtai, hang in there.

341
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,160
Qingtai!

342
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,680
Qingtai!

343
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,680
Qingtai!

344
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,510
Qingtai, stay with me!

345
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,270
You have to survive!

346
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,510
Qingtai!

347
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:07,830
Qingtai!

348
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,440
Qingtai!

349
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,200
Princess...

350
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:10,790
Qingtai!

351
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,640
It hurts...

352
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,480
I know, I know.

353
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,350
Don't worry.

354
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,070
I swear I'll make Empress Lv pay.

355
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,400
I'll kill her!

356
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,200
No.

357
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,960
She must have the plan flawless.

358
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,640
If anything happens to her,

359
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,030
you,

360
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,510
His Highness Changjue,

361
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,350
and many others will all die.

362
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,590
Promise me.

363
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,160
Don't go.

364
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,200
Yes.

365
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,400
I promise.

366
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,240
Don't go.

367
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,440
Qingtai, hang in there, please.

368
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,440
You're going to be fine.

369
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,790
You'll be alright.

370
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,590
Chancellor.

371
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,690
Everyone in the courtyard has escaped.

372
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,070
Help the wounded.

373
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,480
I'll ready the carriage.

374
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,400
Qingtai.

375
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,270
Don't fall asleep, Qingtai.

376
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,200
Qingtai!

377
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,920
Qingtai!

378
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,060
(Shen Residence)

379
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,000
Please be a little gentler, physician.

380
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,550
Qingtai...

381
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,720
Could you please be gentler?

382
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,310
Just a bit gentler.

383
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,480
This is a piercing wound.

384
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,540
I need to stitch her internal organs.

385
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,990
How am I supposed to treat her gently?

386
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,400
Please calm down.

387
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,920
I'll assist you.

388
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,350
Just let me know what you need.

389
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,830
Another basin of hot water.

390
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,680
Sir, will she make it?

391
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,480
The blade did pierce a vital organ.

392
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,070
But luckily, you found her in time.

393
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,440
I'll stitch up her organs first.

394
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,720
She lost a lot of blood,

395
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,270
so we'll have to use medicine

396
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,790
to keep her in a dormant state for now.

397
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,880
She'll need rest and recovery in time.

398
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,440
But she should survive.

399
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,110
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

400
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,790
You'll be alright, Qingtai.

401
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,350
Zhan Lu.

402
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,720
Could you look after Qingtai for now?

403
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,550
Chancellor Shen.

404
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,160
Thank you for saving my life.

405
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,480
No need to thank me.

406
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,960
I have no status or power.

407
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,680
The only thing I can offer is gratitude.

408
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,070
I wonder how we can catch Empress Lv

409
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,070
without endangering you or your brother?

410
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,440
Changjue's life and mine

411
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,030
are in her hands.

412
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,170
If there isn't a perfect plan,

413
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,200
I hope you can hold back for now.

414
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,160
Even now,

415
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,480
you still don't believe
what we once had?

416
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,780
If it were you, Chancellor Shen,

417
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,200
would you trust someone that easily?

418
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,880
I told you I was saving a life,

419
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,200
but you locked me
in the interrogation room.

420
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,640
(Is that what you call trust?)

421
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,920
(I never truly trusted you at all...)

422
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,590
They came after Qingtai.

423
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,930
If you go back to Prince Wuyin,

424
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,400
how will you explain this to him?

425
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,270
The longer I'm gone,

426
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,720
the harder it is to explain.

427
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,640
If Qingtai wakes up,

428
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,790
please find a way to let me know.

429
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,110
Farewell.

430
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,270
(If he finds out my memory is back,)

431
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,200
(he will surely try to keep me.)

432
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,720
(Then, it'll be impossible)

433
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,720
(to get close to Prince Wuyin again.)

434
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,750
(Shen Zaiye,)

435
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,750
(it's better if you and I)

436
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,960
(never knew each other.)

437
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,550
(Shunjing Residence)

438
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,790
Gone all night...

439
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,400
And looking a mess.

440
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,400
Your Highness, I...

441
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,880
Don't say anything you do not mean.

442
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,270
I don't want to hear it.

443
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,070
You need to remember

444
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,920
that your life and your brother's

445
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,750
are both in my hands.

446
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,400
Ms. Meng...

447
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,790
Everyone makes one or two mistakes.

448
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,310
But never more than that.

449
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,310
Do you understand?

450
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,160
I will remember that.

451
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,920
We hereby summon

452
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,310
Chancellor Shen
and Prince Wuxia to the court.

453
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,720
I have finished
reading your policy paper.

454
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,400
You two always claim
to be well-read and wise.

455
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,920
Then tell me,

456
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,790
what do you think of this essay?

457
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,480
Father.

458
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,720
These nine proposals are indeed
solid strategies for national peace.

459
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,750
But it feels like something is missing.

460
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,590
And the writing style...

461
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,720
He is clearly
holding something back from me

462
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,920
to get a promotion.

463
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
That part feels like
the Left Chancellor.

464
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,240
Left Chancellor, what do you think?

465
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,070
It is an excellent essay.

466
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,240
And as Prince Wuxia said,

467
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,240
it does seem to be missing something.

468
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,960
However...

469
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,110
Your calligraphy

470
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,920
needs serious improvement.

471
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,500
Thank you for the advice, Chancellor.

472
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,750
I will work hard to improve.

473
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,240
Did you really write this yourself?

474
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,590
I'm but an unworthy scholar
with arrogant ideas.

475
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,750
I hope Your Highness will forgive me.

476
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,750
From where I sit...

477
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,550
Meng Huairui.

478
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,960
His Majesty is a wise ruler

479
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,510
who won't overlook talent.

480
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,310
If your essay is incomplete,

481
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,240
revise it and submit it again.

482
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,400
We will discuss your placement then.

483
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,720
What do you think, Your Majesty?

484
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,640
Well said, Left Chancellor.

485
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,480
Revise and organize it,
then show me again.

486
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,610
I look forward to your completed work.

487
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

488
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,440
I will give it my utmost effort

489
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,440
and polish it well.

490
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,510
You may rise.

491
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,490
Thank you, Your Majesty.

492
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,680
Wuxia.

493
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,070
Consort Lan is hosting
a family feast today.

494
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,200
Stay.

495
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,550
I take my leave.

496
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,640
(Meng Residence)

497
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,270
Uncle.

498
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,550
I here for a visit.

499
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,590
I thought the family head
needed something from me.

500
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,400
How bold of you

501
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,690
to sit at the head of the table?

502
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,510
Why should I not sit there?

503
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,790
My uncle let you
take charge temporarily,

504
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,350
but I heard things didn't go well.

505
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,920
Prince Wuyin left halfway
through your conversation.

506
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,110
You sure have your sources.

507
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,510
I told my uncle so.

508
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,000
What can a woman ever accomplish?

509
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,030
I still don't get it.

510
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,790
How did he fall for your tricks?

511
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,680
Whether a woman can succeed
depends on the long game.

512
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,960
Let me ask you this.

513
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,680
Did you present someone else's
essay to His Majesty again?

514
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,030
What do you mean someone else's?

515
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,000
I wrote every single word myself.

516
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,200
But Li Jiaohan is very close
to Prince Wuyin.

517
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,440
Do you think Prince Wuyin would let you

518
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,750
get away with tricks like that?

519
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,400
I did make some edits while copying it.

520
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,400
Prince Wuyin...

521
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,480
The style reveals character.

522
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,310
Do you think a fake would fool him?

523
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
When the heir was alive,

524
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,830
the Meng family was the top
noble house in the court.

525
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,400
Now that we have lost that support,

526
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,440
if anything goes wrong,

527
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,160
the other families will
jump at the chance to finish us.

528
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,920
And the consequences

529
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,680
is too great for one like you!

530
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,200
You have two options now.

531
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,400
One, the Meng family turns you in
to clear our name,

532
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,240
and you agree to be exiled
3,000 li away.

533
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,640
My lady.

534
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,510
My lady, please don't!

535
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,830
I won't survive that punishment!

536
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:00,830
My lady.

537
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,480
I still have aging parents to care for.

538
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,750
Then, clean up this mess.

539
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,510
But let me be clear.

540
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,400
If anything goes wrong,

541
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,230
the Meng family will be the first
to denounce you.

542
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,760
It's a death sentence.

543
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,230
I will handle it myself.

544
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,880
From now on, you do or say

545
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,880
according to my orders.

546
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,510
Can you do that?

547
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,670
From this day forward,
I am at your command.

548
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,260
(Shen Residence)

549
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,710
(There was something odd
about today's essay.)

550
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,510
(It seemed very similar)

551
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,280
(to the one Prince Wuyin
once showed to the ministers.)

552
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,710
(Though the content
slightly differed between the two,)

553
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,190
(the style clearly came
from the same hand.)

554
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,630
(Could it be)

555
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,670
(that Meng Huairui
plagiarized Li Jiaohan?)

556
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,150
Did you really write this yourself?

557
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,070
Zhan Lu, prepare a horse.

558
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,230
Li Jiaohan?

559
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,320
Li Jiaohan?

560
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,190
Chancellor, there are signs
of struggle on the wrist,

561
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,110
flesh under the nails,

562
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,280
and a fine mark beneath
the strangulation bruise.

563
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,510
Li Jiaohan.

564
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,590
You had a brilliant mind.

565
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,190
He held no official rank or title,

566
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,630
yet his talent even surpassed mine.

567
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,150
If someone like him is wasted,

568
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,280
how can our nation
ever rise to greater heights?

569
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,110
Are you questioning
the Nine-Rank System?

570
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,710
That system had its place back then.

571
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,480
It suited the times.

572
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,070
But times have changed.

573
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,710
Our nation now values
both civil and military excellence.

574
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,510
We are strong in arms,

575
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,920
but our civil strength
suffers under this system.

576
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,320
(Young Meng Zhongyan)
It undermined the careers

577
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,280
(Young Meng Zhongyan)
of poor but talented scholars.

578
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,820
(Young Meng Zhongyan)

579
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,760
If this keeps up,

580
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:32,100
(Minister of Personnel Xie Guanyu)
those scholars may flee to Beiyuan,

581
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,070
and we will be guilty
of aiding our enemies.

582
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,230
So what are you proposing?

583
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,960
Ignore the divide between classes?

584
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,760
Start with subject-based nominations,

585
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,590
then promote by merit?

586
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,960
So we can win the hearts
of scholars across the land?

587
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,030
But if commoners
can easily enter officialdom,

588
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,900
(Young Prince Qi)
the entire nation will see chaos!

589
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,860
(Young Prince Qi)
What is

590
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,440
your true agenda?

591
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,280
Why you...

592
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,400
Your Majesty.

593
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,280
My loyalty is as clear
as the sun and moon.

594
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,670
I am doing this
for the people of the realm.

595
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,190
For the everlasting prosperity of Qi.

596
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,840
Minister Xie...

597
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,230
No need to get worked up.

598
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,030
This is a serious matter.

599
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,360
It is indeed just as Minister Meng said.

600
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,550
It concerns the very foundation.

601
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,110
We need to think it through carefully.

602
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,760
Allow me some time to consider it.

603
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,950
I will give you my answer.

604
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,510
Your Majesty!

605
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,400
You may leave for now.

606
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,110
Yes.

607
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:35,840
Father.

608
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,630
An?

609
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,110
Why are you here?

610
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,440
Father, are you all right just now?

611
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,880
Well...

612
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,030
Father.

613
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,030
Are you thinking of giving up?

614
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,710
No.

615
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,000
I will never stop

616
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,440
fighting for the imperial examination.

617
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,230
I must find a way out

618
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,710
for scholars from poor families.

619
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,510
I will never let the noble clans
dominate the court forever.

620
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,840
Chancellor.

621
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,190
Chancellor.

622
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,110
This clearly looks like
someone staged a suicide.

623
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,590
I'll inform the Yujing Magistrate

624
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,500
and have them investigate it.

625
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,000
No.

626
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,030
Tell the coroner

627
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,800
to confirm it as a suicide.

628
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,360
But...

629
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,590
Mr. Li.

630
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,710
I know who did this to you.

631
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,480
I assure you

632
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,000
I'll make sure justice is served.

633
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,320
However,

634
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,150
we still need to wait a bit longer.

635
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,960
Chancellor, what are you...

636
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,670
Using his death to reinstate

637
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,000
the imperial exam.

638
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,320
Zhan Lu.

639
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,110
Take my letter

640
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,400
to the Yujing coroner.

641
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,150
He will know what to do.

642
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,820
(Examination Hall)

643
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,400
This was murder, right?

644
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,440
How can you tell?

645
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,710
That archway is so tall.

646
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,990
It's hard to tie a rope up there.

647
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,190
I bet it's exhausting to die this way.

648
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,400
Hey, move back.

649
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,320
Alright.

650
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,280
The coroner will sort it out anyway.

651
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,280
Get him down.

652
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:54,760
Get him down.

653
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,070
Sir, please have a look.

654
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,320
Upon examination,

655
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,360
this man had no signs
of struggle or restraint.

656
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,920
It seems he tied a brick to a rope,

657
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,400
threw it over the archway,

658
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,280
then used the rope

659
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
to hang himself.

660
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,440
Such a complicated way to hang oneself.

661
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,320
Wouldn't any old crooked tree

662
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
be a lot easier?

663
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,400
According to this letter,

664
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,840
his name was Li Jiaohan.

665
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,320
A commoner and scholar,

666
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,480
who only wished to serve the court.

667
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:41,670
But because noble clans
blocked his path,

668
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,030
he died in despair.

669
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,320
His dying wish was that one day,

670
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,280
the imperial exam would be reinstated.

671
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,230
He died for the people!

672
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
He sacrificed for us!

673
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,000
He acted for the greater good!

674
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,590
The poor are treated like dirt.

675
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,030
He was killed by the noble families.

676
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,230
Reinstate the exam!

677
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,550
Or we will end up like him!

678
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:08,230
- Reinstate the exam!
- Reinstate the exam!

679
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:27,230
- No more nobles! Reinstate the exam!
- No more nobles! Reinstate the exam!

680
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,510
(Li...)

681
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,800
(Did you see this?)

682
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,920
(It's the future of poor scholars.)

683
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,590
(Learning and Virtue)

684
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,710
(You made it possible.)

685
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:50,840
- No more nobles! Reinstate the exam!
