(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 21=

18
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,740
(Serene and Tasteful)

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,680
A bunch of useless fools!

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,880
Can't even handle something this simple!

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,680
Get out of my sight!

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,760
(What has Prince Wuyin so enraged?)

23
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,880
(Did something happen?)

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,560
What's all

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
this noise for?

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,880
Do you not know His Highness is inside?

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,560
Qingfeng.

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,960
A cart of ripe fruit just arrived
from the manor.

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,720
We thought to present it
to His Highness for a taste.

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,600
The Beiyuan delegation had only
just entered the city

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,320
when they were stopped
by that treacherous chancellor.

32
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,800
His Highness is in a fury over it.

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,320
(Why did Shen Zaiye stop
the Beiyuan delegation?)

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,440
(Is he still trying
to entangle himself with me?)

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,600
(Prince Wuyin already resents
this entire affair.)

36
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,000
(If this leads him to send me
back to Beiyuan,)

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,720
(what am I to do?)

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,440
You'll get nothing

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,640
out of going in now.

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,280
Be gone.

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,640
Understood.

42
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,940
(Envoy Lodging)

43
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,200
You are

44
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,960
the Left Chancellor of Qi,

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,320
Shen Zaiye?

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,520
All of you have

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:19,920
traveled far.

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,480
Shen Zaiye!

49
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,680
What is the meaning of this?

50
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,360
If you can't give us an explanation,

51
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,480
Beiyuan will not let this matter rest!

52
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,760
Wang Yuanqi, Vice Minister of Rites.

53
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,000
Empress Lv's trusted aide.

54
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:43,960
Take him away.

55
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,280
You…

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,680
Shen Zaiye,

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,320
I'm the head of the Beiyuan delegation!

58
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,640
How dare you!

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,920
How dare you!

60
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,000
- I'll make you pay for this!
- What is going on?

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,560
Does he intend to kill us all?

62
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,560
We've asked you here today

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,440
to discuss matters
concerning Princess Chengping.

64
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,760
You were all once acquainted with her

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,480
in the royal palace of Beiyuan.

66
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,360
It was rumored

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,240
that Princess Chengping
was executed in Qi as a spy.

68
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,960
Executed?

69
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,240
Are they trying to root out
her alleged accomplices?

70
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,240
Chancellor, please judge wisely.

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,040
None of us ever treated her kindly.

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,640
That's right.

73
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,440
She had a sharp tongue.

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,840
I once deprived her of food

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,320
for three days to temper her spirit.

76
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,400
I left only a bowl of chili water
in her room.

77
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,800
Forced her to survive on chili water?

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,520
That's certainly creative.

79
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,720
And I as well.

80
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,440
That wretched girl could never
keep her legs from wandering.

81
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,760
I beat the soles of her feet

82
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,120
with a cane until they bled.

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,960
Even locked in her room,
she'd keep screaming

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,040
about rats and snakes.

85
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,520
Once I got fed up,

86
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,280
I threw in
a few centipedes and scorpions.

87
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,680
That shut her up.

88
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,040
I've slapped her, docked her allowance,

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
and never once gave her medicine.

90
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,040
One winter,
she appeared before Empress Lv,

91
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,840
slouching

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,360
and complaining about the cold.

93
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,920
I had her kneel on ice

94
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
until it all melted away.

95
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,800
Girls of noble birth in Yujing
are mostly spoiled.

96
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,560
To be merely unruly is already a mercy.

97
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
You're a legitimate princess of Beiyuan.

98
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,880
How did you end up
so calculating and careful?

99
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,520
Being a legitimate princess meant

100
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,680
every word and action of mine
was closely watched.

101
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,720
That is why I learned

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,480
to see the subtle signs in all things.

103
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,960
Good.

104
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,920
Very good.

105
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,440
Zhan Lu.

106
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,000
Detain them.

107
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,120
Take them away.

108
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,160
Chancellor!

109
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,520
- Mercy, Chancellor!
- Please spare me!

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,320
- Chancellor!
- Mercy, Chancellor!

111
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,560
- Mercy, Chancellor!
- Chancellor!

112
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Did you hear?

113
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
Chancellor Shen is interrogating
the Beiyuan people.

114
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,560
I heard those were the ones

115
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
who mistreated Princess Chengping.

116
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,840
Sounds like he's using torture, too.

117
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,080
Get in there.

118
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,680
Quickly!

119
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
Hurry up!

120
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,200
Get down and stop squirming.

121
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,200
Move, and I'll strike you.

122
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:11,880
Sir.

123
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,240
Word's already out.

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,160
Crowds are forming outside to watch.

125
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,960
Who exactly are we leaking
all this information for?

126
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,640
Why do you care?

127
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,280
Talk less, do more.

128
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,800
Yes, sir.

129
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,640
Princess Chengping is here.
She's at the entrance.

130
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,160
I think I heard screaming just now.

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,560
Serves them right for offending

132
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,920
the treacherous chancellor.

133
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,720
Open the side entrance.

134
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,120
Yes, sir.

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,600
That's right.

136
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,880
They were apprehended
as soon as they entered the city.

137
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,280
(Her Highness caught on swiftly.)

138
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,480
Chancellor.

139
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,480
You'd better remember this favor.

140
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,720
Speak.

141
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,640
What do you wish to know?

142
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,560
The more detail, the better.

143
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,320
Princess Chengping was sweet

144
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,040
and well-behaved from a young age,

145
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,760
always dearly loved.

146
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,760
Sweet and well-behaved?

147
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,600
Dearly loved?

148
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,520
Take her away.

149
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,720
Mercy, Chancellor!

150
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,640
(That treacherous chancellor
is digging into my past.)

151
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,880
Mercy, Chancellor!

152
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,280
(Ling.)

153
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,640
(Lan.)

154
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,440
(Xiaoxizi.)

155
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,520
(What exactly
is Shen Zaiye trying to do?)

156
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,440
And the three of you?

157
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,920
It's said

158
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,480
that ever since the late empress passed,

159
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Princess Chengping's status plummeted.

160
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,000
She and her younger brother

161
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,520
could hardly survive in the palace.

162
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,720
I remember.

163
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,320
When the late empress died,

164
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,960
the princess was only seven.

165
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,240
She held the hand
of the four-year-old Prince Changjue,

166
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,240
both of them crying so hard

167
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,280
it broke my heart.

168
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,600
Go on.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,280
Just as you know,

170
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,280
while the late empress was alive,

171
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,880
His Majesty did favor Her Highness.

172
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,960
But after her passing,

173
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Princess Chengping and Prince Changjue

174
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
were sent to the Cold Palace.

175
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,560
I can testify.

176
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,360
Within the palace,
treatment follows status.

177
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,560
To curry favor with Empress Lv,

178
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,640
they denied them food,
clothing, and all basic needs.

179
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,640
Especially those
who were just taken away.

180
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,960
They were the worst.

181
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
I remember

182
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,720
one bitter winter

183
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,760
Prince Changjue fell seriously ill.

184
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,760
He was freezing cold to the bone.

185
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,960
The princess begged for medicine.

186
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,680
But Empress Lv's attendants forced her
to kneel in supplication.

187
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,480
Even then,

188
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,280
she was refused.

189
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,480
She cried all the way
back to the Cold Palace.

190
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,800
I couldn't stand to watch it.

191
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,040
I secretly brought her
charcoal and medicine.

192
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,120
She tried to thank me,

193
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,040
but she had nothing to offer.

194
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,920
In that cold and desolate place,

195
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,440
she didn't have even
a single decent thing to give.

196
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
She and Prince Changjue were barely fed.

197
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
Their meals were cut short

198
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,400
on purpose.

199
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,600
They were often harassed
and mocked for the amusement.

200
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,280
Come and get it!

201
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,080
Give it to me!

202
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,320
Give it back!

203
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,800
Stop!

204
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,880
Beg for it.

205
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,240
Beg, and I'll give it to you.

206
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Come on! Beg us for it!

207
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Who would've thought a princess

208
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,240
would fight so desperately
over a single flatbread?

209
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,520
Fine, have it then.

210
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,400
Go pick it up, little beggar.

211
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,040
Little beggar.

212
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,240
Oh, little beggar.

213
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,600
Your Highness!

214
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,600
Your Highness, don't eat that.

215
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
This is clean.

216
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,880
Eat this.

217
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,120
Since that day,

218
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,560
I've had no further dealings
with Her Highness.

219
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,360
As for what she did afterward,

220
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,200
I…

221
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,720
I truly do not know.

222
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,600
Chancellor Shen.

223
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,520
- Mercy, Chancellor Shen!
- Mercy, Chancellor Shen!

224
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,400
Chancellor Shen.

225
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,920
We know Her Highness
was guilty of some offense,

226
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,680
but we only pitied the innocent child.

227
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,720
Please judge fairly, Chancellor Shen.

228
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,080
You did nothing wrong.

229
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,280
What crime is there in that?

230
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,680
Nothing wrong?

231
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,000
If not for you,

232
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,320
how could Her Highness have survived

233
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,880
that man-eating harem?

234
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,080
The Chancellor summoned you here
to Qi for one reason.

235
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,120
To thank you in person.

236
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,360
The Chancellor offers you a reward.

237
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,840
These gold ingots

238
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,520
are yours.

239
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,560
Why the tears?

240
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm happy

241
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,280
for the princess.

242
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,080
She's finally found someone

243
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,680
who truly cares for her.

244
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,080
(Someone who cares for me?)

245
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,400
(Shen Zaiye…)

246
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,440
Men.

247
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,200
See them out.

248
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,840
Chancellor.

249
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,600
Her Highness came by earlier.

250
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:25,010
♪I'm lost for words when you turn away♪

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,456
♪The closer our fluttering hearts draw near,
the more they try to hide♪

252
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:40,061
♪The deeper my thoughts grow for you
at night♪

253
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,432
♪The more afraid I am of losing you♪

254
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,482
♪Those simple, ordinary days♪

255
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:52,514
♪Feel like a dream of mine♪

256
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,280
(You still refuse)

257
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,720
(to see me…)

258
00:12:57,608 --> 00:13:00,520
♪Far away from worldly concerns♪

259
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:05,101
♪Those memories become clear over time♪

260
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:08,237
♪The long night passes in a flash♪

261
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:11,789
♪Two hearts slowly connect♪

262
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:15,810
♪They dance joyfully♪

263
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,680
Miss Meng.

264
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,120
What are you doing here?

265
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,680
I meant to seek out His Highness,

266
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,040
but I somehow

267
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,960
lost my way in the residence.

268
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,200
If that is the case,

269
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,920
I shall take you to him.

270
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,160
Thank you.

271
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,520
Miss Meng.

272
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,920
His Highness will be here shortly.

273
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,520
What's wrong with you?

274
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,920
Clumsy ox!

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,160
(Coins?)

276
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
What brings you here?

277
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,840
Your Highness.

278
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,680
Since I awoke,

279
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,200
my mind has been muddled.

280
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
But I just remembered.

281
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,720
By etiquette,

282
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,240
I should

283
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
greet you daily.

284
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,960
That is why I braved the rain
to come here.

285
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,000
I hope you will not take offense.

286
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,800
I've never cared for empty formalities.

287
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,360
You need not come again
for such trivial matters.

288
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,720
Yes, Your Highness.

289
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,640
Then I shall take my leave.

290
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,440
Hua.

291
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,600
Has Jiang Taohua

292
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
truly forgotten everything?

293
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,280
Her mind's in turmoil.

294
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,560
Right now,

295
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,560
she obeys my every word.

296
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,800
She's far more cunning than she seems.

297
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,280
You mustn't let your guard down.

298
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,080
I always do as you say.

299
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,720
I shall be extremely careful.

300
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,120
Present your memorial if you have one.

301
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,520
If not, then court is adjourned.

302
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,080
This weather's been

303
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,240
as unpredictable

304
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
as His Majesty's moods.

305
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,680
Mr. Liu,

306
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,200
mind your words.

307
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,920
Vice Minister Qin.

308
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,000
Please take a look at this.

309
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,120
Deputy Minister Wang.

310
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,160
This is a policy essay.

311
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,040
I still have matters to attend to.

312
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,280
Ministers.

313
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
I have a policy essay right here.

314
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,320
Could you…

315
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,520
My apologies, Prince Wuxia.

316
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
We have other matters to deal with.

317
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,440
Your Highness, what troubles you?

318
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,880
You're busy with state affairs.

319
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,520
I won't trouble you

320
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,520
with my personal matters.

321
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,080
Let me see it.

322
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,480
This is an excellent piece of writing.

323
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,680
(Li Jiaohan)
Though, it may not be to your liking.

324
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
What is Li Jiaohan's background

325
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
and rank?

326
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,360
No official post.

327
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,720
Born into a farming household.

328
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,800
A pity there's no one at court today

329
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,760
with the eye to recognize such talent.

330
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,440
You've wasted your effort.

331
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,280
"No one at court today with the eye

332
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,000
to recognize talent?"

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,920
Such keen insight!

334
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,800
Such noble spirit!

335
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,960
Such a masterful treatise!

336
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,600
You have a discerning eye, Mr. Gao.

337
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,120
If Li Jiaohan were appointed to court,

338
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,440
he could usher in a new sight for Qi.

339
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,840
(Gao Yuan, Vice Minister of Personnel)
Huairui, bring tea.

340
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
(Gao Yuan, Vice Minister of Personnel)

341
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,640
Mr. Gao.

342
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,120
If this man is given a post,

343
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,600
he may become a pillar of our state.

344
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,840
It is as Your Highness says.

345
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,920
Do we know

346
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,120
anything

347
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,920
of Li Jiaohan's

348
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,840
official record,

349
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,680
conduct,

350
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,000
and reputation?

351
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,920
He

352
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,160
is merely a farmer's son.

353
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,920
He once offended a local magistrate

354
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
due to his blunt temperament,

355
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,800
which is why he has no rank.

356
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,000
The entry point into service
is the ninth rank.

357
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,600
But he has none.

358
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,720
Shall I submit

359
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,920
his name directly to my father

360
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,400
so…

361
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,280
That will not do.

362
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,800
The court is dominated by noble clans.

363
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,200
His Majesty only appointed
the Left Chancellor outside tradition

364
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,080
to balance all factions.

365
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
And even that

366
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,080
has required great effort.

367
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,280
There are many factors at play.

368
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,480
If you raise the matter at court now,

369
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,320
it may stir controversy.

370
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,440
We might lose this talent entirely.

371
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,440
But such talent is truly rare.

372
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,480
Your Highness, please rest assured.

373
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,560
I'll do everything in my power

374
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,880
to recommend Li Jiaohan.

375
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,520
I'll begin

376
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,840
by arranging his preliminary rank,

377
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,000
then promote him step by step.

378
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:21,960
Is that agreeable?

379
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,760
That does sound more prudent.

380
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,880
Rest assured, Your Highness.

381
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
I shall give my utmost

382
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,320
to ensure Li Jiaohan enters officialdom.

383
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,280
Though, there will still be much

384
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,680
to handle behind the scenes.

385
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,700
(Meng Huairui, Gao Yuan's Disciple)

386
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Where is Qingtai?

387
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,000
Your Highness.

388
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,080
Aside from bringing meals
to Jiang Taohua,

389
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,680
she's kept herself to her quarters.

390
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,800
Send her out of the residence
and place her under guard.

391
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,320
Your Highness,

392
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,640
what did she do wrong?

393
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,920
Hua is here now.

394
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,280
All the more reason to tread carefully.

395
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,400
Safer to separate Jiang Taohua

396
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,360
from Qingtai.

397
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,080
Should we just…

398
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,920
Not for now.

399
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,320
Jiang Taohua is fond of that maid.

400
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,880
She may

401
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,800
prove useful down the line.

402
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,320
Yes, Your Highness.

403
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,240
Miss Meng.

404
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,120
It's time for your meal.

405
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,320
Where's Qingtai?

406
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,440
His Highness has
other arrangements for her.

407
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
From now on,
I'll be the one to deliver your meals.

408
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,400
Forgive me

409
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,880
if there is any inconvenience.

410
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,520
Qingfeng.

411
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,200
I'm entirely dependent
on Prince Wuyin now.

412
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,080
In this residence,
I hold no standing whatsoever.

413
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,920
And now I'm not even allowed

414
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,440
to keep a maid by my side?

415
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,400
Your Highness jests.

416
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,600
His Highness holds you in high regard.

417
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,320
You're the only lady

418
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,120
ever permitted

419
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,680
to reside here.

420
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,720
Then you had best consider

421
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,800
the consequences

422
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,080
of offending me.

423
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,760
I may have neither power nor rank,

424
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,360
but if His Highness insisted
on keeping me here,

425
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,800
it means I serve a purpose for him.

426
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,920
It would be all too easy for me

427
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,400
to whisper in his ear

428
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,680
and cause you trouble.

429
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,720
Miss Meng,

430
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,120
may I ask

431
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,320
what I did to offend you?

432
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,520
Answer me.

433
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,520
Is Qingtai dead or alive?

434
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,360
Where is she?

435
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,680
Miss Meng,

436
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,320
I can only tell you this.

437
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,520
Miss Qingtai is alive and well.

438
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,320
I simply can't tell you

439
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,720
anything more

440
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,680
than that.

441
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,600
You're dismissed.

442
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,040
(Judging by his expression,
he isn't lying.)

443
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,600
(But Qingtai is still missing.)

444
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,600
(I must find a way to locate her.)

445
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,240
Are you Jiaohan?

446
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,960
My name is Meng Huairui.

447
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,400
I study under Vice Minister Gao.

448
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,120
Mr. Meng.

449
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
What brings you to me at this hour?

450
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,840
Please be seated.

451
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,040
Jiaohan.

452
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,760
First, allow me to wish you
great success in your future career.

453
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,600
What are you saying?

454
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,760
I'm merely

455
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
a humble commoner.

456
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,080
Jiaohan.

457
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,080
I just told you.

458
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,440
I study under Vice Minister Gao.

459
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,840
Do you not understand the implication?

460
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,680
Vice Minister Gao's an upright official,
eager to cultivate talent,

461
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,080
and well-respected for his integrity.

462
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,920
He has a discerning eye for talent.

463
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,080
And you are gifted.

464
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,040
He has already read your work

465
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,160
and was deeply impressed.

466
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,600
That is why he sent me to meet you.

467
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,120
Mr. Mu did…

468
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,520
Prince Wuxia is indeed true to his word.

469
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,320
This matter must still pass
through Mr. Gao's hands.

470
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,680
However…

471
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,640
However what?

472
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,360
The scope of your writing is too broad.

473
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,960
It touches heavily
on noble families and matters of state.

474
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,920
His Majesty may find it difficult
to act on such proposals all at once.

475
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,600
Why not start with something smaller?

476
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,160
Smaller?

477
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,720
Perhaps a concise,

478
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,240
sharp political essay.

479
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,320
That way,
when Mr. Gao presents it to His Majesty,

480
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,080
it will demonstrate

481
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,800
your skill

482
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,840
and avoid

483
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,520
offending any noble clans.

484
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,120
That's no trouble at all.

485
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,320
I can write such a piece on the spot.

486
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,320
If only I had brush

487
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,080
and ink…

488
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,520
Jiaohan, observe.

489
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,120
I've prepared everything for you.

490
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:21,840
Please.

491
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,680
Thank you.

492
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,960
Wait to hear good news from me.

493
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,920
Thank you, Huairui.

494
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,520
Ugh, I already told him to cut down

495
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,040
on all the rambling.

496
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,200
I'm going to be exhausted from all this.

497
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,960
I still have to handwrite
the whole thing before I can use it.

498
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,080
But once I've got it all copied,

499
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,920
then…

500
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,400
(Did she overhear my interrogation)

501
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,440
(of the Beiyuan delegation that day?)

502
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,520
(If she did,)

503
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,960
(what must she think?)

504
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,400
Chancellor,

505
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,920
the men we stationed to watch

506
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,120
report that Prince Wuyin has left
the residence in a carriage.

507
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,520
Her Highness was not with him.

508
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,880
Seems you're not quite as docile

509
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,840
in this residence as you pretended to be

510
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,240
when I last visited.

511
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,080
Why are you

512
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,760
in that attire?

513
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,000
I've come with questions for you.

514
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,960
Miss Meng,
you're still awake at this hour.

515
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,080
Is something troubling you?

516
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,920
I'm fine.

517
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,800
I was just admiring the moon outside.

518
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,200
I shall retire now.

519
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,440
You may go.

520
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,280
Chancellor Shen.

521
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,000
How much more trouble
do you plan to bring me?

522
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:03,880
From now on,

523
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
I'll only solve your troubles.

524
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,720
Do you genuinely believe
that intimidating and rewarding

525
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,520
the Beiyuan delegation

526
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,920
will rid me of my problems?

527
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,320
Jiang Taohua,

528
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,240
this is only the beginning.

529
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,680
Every wrong done to you,

530
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,800
every humiliation and threat,

531
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,400
I'll see that justice is served
for each and every one.

532
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,400
Until the poison
of the Jiangtao pill is removed.

533
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,520
Until Changjue is safe and sound.

534
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,520
How did you know?

535
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,360
I only regret learning too late

536
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,040
and letting you suffer so much.

537
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,240
What is the true nature
of our relationship?

538
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,440
When I first arrived in Yujing,

539
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,760
did we truly share such intimacy?

540
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,240
Do you truly not remember anything?

541
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,880
The entire court was shaken.

542
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,080
Petitions impeaching me flooded in.

543
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,440
You failed to marry Prince Wuxia,

544
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,880
and so were sent to my residence.

545
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,520
Impossible!

546
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,880
Even if I'm here only
for the sake of a political marriage,

547
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,600
I'm still the rightful
Princess Chengping of Beiyuan.

548
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,080
When I first arrived in Yujing,

549
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
I was placed
in Prince Wuyin's residence.

550
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,280
I was promised to him.

551
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,680
Promised to Prince Wuyin?

552
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,200
Is that what he told you?

553
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,040
That's what I remember.

554
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,680
Though much of what happened
after I arrived in Qi

555
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,360
remains unclear to me.

556
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,640
What else do you remember?

557
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,120
Tell me everything in detail.

558
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,320
I remember

559
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,680
Prince Wuyin playing the guqin for me
on a tall platform.

560
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,960
I remember his smiling face.

561
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,400
I remember…

562
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,600
And do I appear

563
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,320
in those memories?

564
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,480
(Since you arrived in Yujing,
you've consorted with another man.)

565
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,520
(Trust no one.)

566
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,280
Leave.

567
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,080
Leave here at once.

568
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,800
Where is Qingtai?

569
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,600
I was just out looking for her.

570
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,600
Is she still in the residence?

571
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,040
I'm not sure.

572
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,960
She told me

573
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,680
she was helping in the alchemy room.

574
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,080
Wait here.

575
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:41,800
I'll go find her.

576
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,520
I'm coming with you.

577
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,560
All right.

578
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,000
Once we find her,

579
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,640
the truth will come to light.

580
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,640
Jiang Taohua,

581
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,600
I know you're scared.

582
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,240
Just remember,

583
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,040
no matter what,

584
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,960
you can always trust me.

585
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,640
She's not here either.

586
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,000
She wasn't in the alchemy room
or the furnace room.

587
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,680
There's no trace of her anywhere.

588
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,720
Is she maybe
not in the residence at all?

589
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,560
Let's search elsewhere.

590
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,160
Who goes there?

591
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,600
(Boshan incense?)

592
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
(I've smelled this scent before.)

593
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,760
(On someone I know very well.)

594
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,400
Maybe you were mistaken.

595
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,120
Come on. Let's go. There's no one here.

596
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,080
There's one place in the residence
we haven't searched.

597
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,280
Follow me.

598
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,920
This is Prince Wuyin's bedchamber.

599
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,080
Is there a place

600
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,520
to hide someone in here?

601
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
I've been here before

602
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,000
and noticed nothing unusual.

603
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,280
Many nobles build hidden rooms

604
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,080
within their bedchambers.

605
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,320
Did you notice anything odd

606
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,800
during your previous visit?

607
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,040
Coins.

608
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,240
A prince like Prince Wuyin

609
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,640
should have no need for them.

610
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,120
Yet he keeps many here

611
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,320
and stores them with great care.

612
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,560
Where are they?

613
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,200
Follow me.

614
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:10,880
Who's there?

615
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,160
Who goes there?

616
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,160
I'll distract them.

617
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,600
Keep yourself safe

618
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
until we find Qingtai.

619
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:28,960
Stop!

620
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,760
Stop right there!

621
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,520
(It's that stabbing pain again.)

622
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,800
(Why do I feel so sad every time)

623
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,880
(I see his back?)

624
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,640
(Pull yourself together,)

625
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,520
(Jiang Taohua!)

626
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,640
He went that way!

627
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,000
Stop, thief!

628
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,520
This must be the mechanism

629
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
that opens the hidden chamber.

630
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,280
This pattern…

631
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,280
Is this the Bagua formation?

632
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,720
The Bagua formation
is divided into eight gates.

633
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,960
(Xiu, Sheng, Shang,)

634
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,480
(Du, Jing, Si, and Kai.)

635
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,160
(Enter through
the Sheng gate from the east)

636
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,240
(and strike from the Kai gate
in the north,)

637
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,640
(then the door will open.)

638
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,000
(Strange.)

639
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
(Nothing is happening.)

640
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,360
(What if I reverse the order?)

641
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,920
(I'll try starting from the Si gate.)

642
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,960
(The Si gate.)

643
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,800
(Its palace position is Kun.)

644
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,200
(It symbolizes the feminine.)

645
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,720
(Word is, Prince Wuyin and his sister
have always depended on each other.)

646
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,600
(Could the key to this puzzle lie)

647
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,600
(in the Kun palace?)

648
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,080
(It worked!)

649
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,880
(Strange.)

650
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
(This is clearly a hidden chamber,)

651
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,080
(yet it's decorated so lavishly.)

652
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,120
(Happiness)

653
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,480
(It looks more like a bridal chamber.)

654
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,120
(Wait.)

655
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,680
(That's…)

656
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,040
(This bracelet…)

657
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,600
(Where have I seen it before?)

658
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
(The bracelet belongs to Empress Lv.)

659
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,640
Hua,

660
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,280
all that you see

661
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,680
