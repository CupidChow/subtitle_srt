00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:31,239
THE PLACES, CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,130
<i>Hey, guys. It's me.</i>

3
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,966
<i>Did you see the woman
who stabbed Kim Gukho?</i>

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,134
<i>Wow.</i>

5
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,011
<i>She stabbed him in the side.</i>

6
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,554
<i>Then in the chest!</i>

7
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:55,930
<i>This is it. Fuck!</i>

8
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,849
<i>I'm finally getting my money's worth.</i>

9
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,893
<i>The poison arrows and bomb were too much.</i>

10
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,562
<i>Kim Gukho's in a coma now.</i>

11
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,355
<i>If he dies,</i>

12
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,317
<i>will the 20 billion won go to her?</i>

13
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,321
<i>Will Kim Gukho die...</i>

14
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,573
<i>or live?</i>

15
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,284
{\an8}13 YEARS AGO

16
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,788
Minjin?

17
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,415
Let's go. You have work tomorrow.

18
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,547
Hey.

19
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,049
Hey.

20
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,097
Fuck, I'm screwed.

21
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,128
Did you hurt yourself?

22
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,422
What do you mean?

23
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,383
Your clothes are ripped.

24
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,052
The sleeve.

25
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,972
It must've gotten caught on something.

26
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,974
Don't talk to me. I'm tired.

27
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,753
DONGHA TAEKWONDO

28
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,811
Dongha, are you excited to go to the zoo?

29
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,406
Dongha,

30
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,451
there's a real tiger over there.

31
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,744
Let's go see it.

32
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,708
Let's go see the tiger.

33
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,488
Mr. Kim Gukho?

34
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,950
You're under arrest for the murder
of Lee Minjin.

35
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,702
Don't move.

36
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,787
Stay still.

37
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,415
Let's go.

38
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,294
You bitch!

39
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,466
How dare you sell your husband out?
You bitch.

40
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,844
Dongha.

41
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,597
Dongha!

42
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,142
It's okay. Mommy's right here.

00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,569
THE 35TH VIENNA INTERNATIONAL

44
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,782
First prize

45
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,785
goes to Seo Dongha.

46
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,080
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

47
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,626
Congratulations on winning
the first prize.

48
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,420
Let's give him a round of applause.

49
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,212
{\an8}NO WAY OUT: THE ROULETTE

50
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,089
20 BILLION WON FOR NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL

51
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,507
MASKED MAN'S TARGET, KIM GUKHO

52
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,092
WHO'S THE MASKED MAN BEHIND THE HIT?

53
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,764
I heard you
first picked up the violin

54
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,183
at a local cultural center at a late age.

55
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,478
Why do you think
you were able to progress so quickly?

56
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,063
Well...

57
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,815
{\an8}I was lucky enough
to meet a great teacher.

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,569
{\an8}I think that helped me progress faster.

59
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,530
{\an8}You're getting offers
from top music schools around the world,

60
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,617
{\an8}including the University of Music
and Performing Arts Vienna.

61
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,535
{\an8}What are your plans for the future?

62
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,414
{\an8}I'm so grateful.
I want to go to all of these schools.

63
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,126
{\an8}I'm going to decide
after discussing it with my teacher.

64
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,131
{\an8}Things have been noisy
since Kim Gukho's release from prison.

65
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,258
{\an8}How does it make you feel?

66
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,552
{\an8}We will only take music-related questions.

67
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,262
{\an8}Do you plan on apologizing

68
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,347
{\an8}to the victims?

69
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,516
Why do I have to apologize?

70
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,937
That's the end of the interview.

71
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,605
Let's go.

72
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
Goodbye.

73
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,702
You didn't have to come here.

74
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,079
I missed you.

75
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,457
{\an8}Great job.

76
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,376
You did well.

77
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,627
He only got two notes wrong.

78
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,631
I'll make you <i>omurice</i> for dinner.

79
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,800
You should come too.

80
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,176
Sounds good.

81
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,594
- Hey.
- What?

82
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,679
Isn't that him?

83
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,389
Kim Gukho's son.

84
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,392
You're right. The genius violinist.

85
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,769
I don't believe it. It's him.

86
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,271
Disgusting.

87
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,398
That asshole is probably a pervert too.

88
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,317
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

89
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,279
- So freaking creepy.
- Why is he here?

90
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,784
Hey.

91
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,911
- What did you just say?
- What's it to you, lady?

92
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,874
Why would you compare my son
to that bastard? Why?

93
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,333
Let go of me!

94
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,210
- What the hell?
- Hey.

95
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,004
My son is different!

96
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,633
He's different from him!
And he's different from the likes of you!

97
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,850
Dongha...

98
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,367
KIM GUKHO'S THE DEVIL
SEND HIM TO HELL

99
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,452
WIPE OUT SEX OFFENDERS

100
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,412
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

101
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,704
Mirroring Seo Dongha's
musical performance.

102
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,086
I don't need a new television.
I need a new boiler. Damn it.

103
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,295
It'll be here tomorrow.

104
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,048
There's only one boiler place
in this neighborhood.

105
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,132
It's so fucking cold.

106
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,468
It's the busiest time for them.

107
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,636
Here you go.

108
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,138
Your body will heat up in no time.

109
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,567
I promise...

110
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,902
to bring your son to you.

111
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,028
Of course.

112
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,864
He was mine to begin with.

113
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,547
Thank you!

114
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,699
Daeun, wait for me!

115
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,409
We're late. Hurry up!

116
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,827
Be punctual!

117
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,915
Hey, he's here.

118
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,585
What time is it?
He's fashionably late.

119
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,545
He doesn't even care that he's late.

120
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,173
Why the hell
does he always look so gloomy?

121
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,176
Would you be
smiling if you were him? Think about it.

122
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,345
He put his headphones back on.

123
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,596
He must have heard us.

124
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,560
Hey, look at your texts.

125
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,858
GROUP CHAT

126
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,902
TAEHUN: DID YOU HEAR ABOUT HIS DAD?

127
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,945
NAMGYEONG: YEAH, EVERYONE'S AFTER HIM!

128
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,495
Hey,
where's Seo Dongha, that bastard?

129
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,163
Well?

130
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,708
Where's Seo Dongha?

131
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,670
Move out of the way.

132
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,754
Come on.

133
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,100
Your dad's fucking awesome.

134
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,977
He's worth 20 billion won! Fuck.

135
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,729
Must be nice.

136
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,106
You're rich.

137
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,901
I was curious about something.

138
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,113
Why is your last name "Seo"?

139
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,407
Shouldn't it be "Kim"?

140
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,617
Did you change your identity or something?

141
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,995
What the hell?

142
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,748
Where do you think you're going?

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,001
Get lost.

144
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,963
You dirty little fucker!

145
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,341
You asshole!

146
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,844
Have you lost your mind?

147
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,346
That's enough!

148
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,056
What wrong did Dongha do?

149
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,978
You fucking bitch, are you crazy?

150
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,062
You punks!

151
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,275
- Don't move!
- Let go!

152
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,943
What should we write
on her face?

153
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,528
Who's good at drawing?

154
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,238
Grab her tight!

155
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,531
She's so strong.

156
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,408
Hey, write "bitch" for me.

157
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,619
- What's he doing?
- What?

158
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,621
What is that?

159
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,083
What are you doing?

160
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,293
Fuck, is this gasoline?

161
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,179
Asshole.

162
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,600
What?

163
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,935
What the fuck are you doing?

164
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,896
Let's all die here.

165
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,647
Stop bluffing, you bastard.

166
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,232
What?

167
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,110
You don't think I'll do it?

168
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,031
Hey, it's fire! Run! Get out of here!

169
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,825
- He's crazy.
- Hey, wait for me! Hey!

170
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,467
Thanks.

171
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,097
From now on,

172
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,184
don't act like you know me.

173
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,904
This is the place

174
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,697
where Kim Gukho's son lives.

175
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,333
RAPE GENES

176
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,335
GET LOST, SON OF A MURDERER

177
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,599
Stop it.

178
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,269
I have to erase this.

179
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,189
Erasing it won't change anything.

180
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,983
People will see it.

181
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,697
I'm okay, Mom. You can stop.

182
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,074
Let go of me. I have to erase this.

183
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,203
I'm fine.

184
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,665
Let's go home.

185
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,709
Okay?

186
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:04,945
KIM GUKHO

187
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,490
20 BILLION WON

188
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,120
KILL

189
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,543
<i>Guys, I'm about to be pissed.</i>

190
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,879
<i>Do you think this is right? Do you?</i>

191
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,714
<i>I told you to kill Kim Gukho.</i>

192
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,508
<i>Did I tell you to set off a bomb
where people were gathered?</i>

193
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,593
<i>Is this a war?</i>

194
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,054
<i>Someone will fire missiles at this rate.</i>

195
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,847
<i>Starting now,</i>

196
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,560
<i>any injuries to civilians
will be considered a foul, got it?</i>

197
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,437
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

198
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,522
<i>I'm not asking you for much, am I?</i>

199
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,035
<i>Let's keep it clean and straightforward.</i>

200
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,247
Lieutenant Baek, you need to see this.

201
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,874
What is it? I'm busy right now.

202
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,213
Now, the Masked Man

203
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,758
has broadcast five times,
and each person was mentioned here before.

204
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,885
That goes for Yoon Changjae too.

205
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,888
Among the petitions submitted

206
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,390
to <i>Open Newspaper</i>,

207
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,684
they're criminals
who weren't properly punished.

208
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,936
Do you know who the last person is?

209
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,188
It's Kim Gukho.

210
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,779
Wait.

211
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,205
I did this, but it gets cut off here.

212
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,290
What's wrong with this?

213
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,671
Like that?

214
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,228
Mi... Church?

215
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,107
It looks like Midian Church.

216
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,526
- Midian Church?
- Yeah.

217
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,445
This church is really famous.

218
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,496
Thank you so much.

219
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,211
This is Professor Rebecca.

220
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,381
The String Department dean at the
University Royal Conservatoire of Music.

221
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,799
- I see.
- Say hello.

222
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,427
It's so nice
to meet you, Dongha.

223
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,596
The concours was amazing.

224
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,932
Your gorgeous and dynamic music
always inspires me.

225
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,352
I hope you can find your dreams fulfilled
in our school.

226
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,396
I can provide all that you need.

227
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,690
Thank you, but...

228
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,985
I need some time to think about it.

229
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,655
Oh, what are your concerns? I can help.

230
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,324
What are you saying?

231
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,951
Dongha will go.

232
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,828
Dongha will go.

233
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,538
Tell her that he'll go.

234
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,874
There's no problem here.

235
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:04,958
Let me talk to him.

236
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,043
No problem.

237
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,628
Okay. Good.

238
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,838
Read it.

239
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,632
Mom...

240
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,855
I talked it over with your teacher.

241
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,565
Go abroad.

242
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,358
What about you?

243
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,651
Well...

244
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,570
I need to take care of some things.

245
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,905
I'll be there soon.

246
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,910
I won't go without you.

247
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,580
Dongha,

248
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,249
just go first. I'll be there soon.

249
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,294
You know I can't be persuaded.

250
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,463
Please.

251
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,592
Let's eat.

252
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,554
{\an8}MIDIAN CHURCH

253
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,847
{\an8}<i>Members of the congregation,</i>

254
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,807
during a counseling session yesterday,

255
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,768
a deacon came to me and said,

256
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:48,979
"Pastor."

257
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,231
"I pray every day and every night."

258
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,275
"I even attend early morning prayers."

259
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,237
"So why does my son
play video games instead of studying?"

260
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,573
"It's hard raising a child."

261
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,992
So I asked her this.

262
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,872
"Deacon, did you only study
when you were in school?"

263
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,171
If prayers could send
our children to college,

264
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,756
then our presbyter's children

265
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,467
would've gone to Harvard.

266
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,726
Now, beloved members
of the congregation...

267
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,354
You shouldn't pray alone.

268
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,566
Teach them God's words so they can
take responsibility for their lives.

269
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,652
Let's bet on it

270
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,195
with our lives.

271
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,531
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

272
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,448
Pastor, have some water.

273
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,040
You're spilling again.

274
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,422
MIDIAN CHURCH

275
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,008
Yes?

276
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,469
Ah.

277
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,055
Yes, hello.

278
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,932
Thank you.

279
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,644
Elder,

280
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,022
please give the pastor a meal.

281
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,690
Thank you. I appreciate it.

282
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,657
There's a system where
we can post petitions?

283
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,701
I had no idea.

284
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,958
I know people don't trust the law
these days...

285
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,836
...but wouldn't it be safer to stay

286
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,172
within the boundaries of the law?

287
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,718
That's what God would want.

288
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,636
I'm just curious.

289
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,597
Do you watch YouTV?

290
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,182
Of course, I do.

291
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,809
I love <i>mukbangs.</i>

292
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,394
Ohh. Yes, I see.

293
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,064
This is made at the church. Try it.

294
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,024
Yes, thank you.

295
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,194
So how can we help you, Detective?

296
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,822
No, I just came to check some things.

297
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,035
Okay.

298
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,084
Somi!

299
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,919
Give this to your dad on your way.

300
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,587
I have to go straight to the library.

301
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,507
Your dad hasn't changed
his underwear for days. Look.

302
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,591
That's disgusting.

303
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,884
No, it's not! Here.

304
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,137
Bye!

305
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,675
<i>This stop
is Hosan Police Station.</i>

306
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,261
<i>This stop
is Hosan Police Station.</i>

307
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,596
<i>Hosan Police Station.</i>

308
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,627
Damn it. Where is she?

309
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,301
Hello? Hey.

310
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,428
Did Somi leave?

311
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,015
But I didn't ask you to send me underwear.

312
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,934
That's strange.
She left a while ago.

313
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,436
Okay.

314
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:40,896
Okay.

315
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,253
YEEUN

316
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,214
- Yeah...
<i>- There's...</i>

317
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,632
- Yeeun, what...
<i>- There's...</i>

318
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,716
<i>Wait...</i>

319
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,010
<i>Honey!</i>

320
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,094
Honey?

321
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,096
Yeeun? Yeeun!

322
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,391
Yeeun!

323
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,436
- Honey.
- Yeeun.

324
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,562
Hello, Detective!

325
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,564
- What's this?
- I'm here for my money.

326
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,982
You little...

327
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,485
Honey, go inside.

328
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,362
- I'll...
- Lady, stay right there.

329
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,905
She should hear this too.

330
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,990
Your daughter's life is at stake.

331
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,785
What? Somi's not home?

332
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,328
What? She's not here.

333
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,914
You asshole.

334
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,666
You son of a bitch!

335
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,459
- Where's Somi?
- Let go of me.

336
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,835
Where is she, fucker?

337
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,087
She's very smart.

338
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,089
- You asshole.
- You raised her well.

339
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,174
Motherfucker.

340
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,551
I'll kill you.

341
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,554
So why did you steal
my precious money? Huh?

342
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,138
Look at what happened.

343
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,807
You brought this upon yourself!

344
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,142
- I said I'd return it.
- Do you even have it?

345
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,811
I'll come up with it at all costs!

346
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,563
Fuck, do you think I'm stupid?

347
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,274
I told you I was watching.

348
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,735
Detective, I gave it some thought.

349
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,280
You're protecting Kim Gukho.

350
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,158
I have 20 billion won in front of me.
Why settle for a billion?

351
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,703
Bring Kim Gukho to me.

352
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,998
We can make an exchange.

353
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,584
Him for your daughter.

354
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,877
A clean swap. I swear.

355
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,796
Don't you know

356
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,340
- the police force is there?
- Bring him alive.

357
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,425
Got it?

358
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,927
I have to kill him. That's the rule.

359
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,637
How can I bring him now? Damn it.

360
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,139
That's your problem.

361
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,559
I feel kind of sorry for Somi.

362
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,644
Oh, right.

363
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,147
If the cops come after me first,

364
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,233
- you'll get a can of her fingers.
- You piece of shit!

365
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,485
I'm going to kill you today! Just die!

366
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,698
Can she play the cello

367
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,242
without fingers?

368
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,329
- How will she play?
- If you touch a single hair,

369
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,415
I swear I'll kill you then. Got it?

370
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,499
Yeah.

371
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,418
I'll get going now.

372
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,545
I'll call with her phone.

373
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,467
Don't follow me out.

374
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,888
Honey?

375
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,181
- Honey...
- Honey.

376
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,807
It'll be okay.

377
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,601
Nothing will happen to Somi. I'll...

378
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,769
I'll take care of this.

379
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,687
- What do we do?
- Don't worry. It's fine.

380
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,356
Our Somi...

381
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,024
What about Somi?

382
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,318
Somi. What do we do?

383
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,195
- Somi...
- Honey.

384
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,488
Yeeun, calm down.

385
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,990
It'll be okay.

386
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,872
Oh.

387
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,291
Who are you?

388
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,460
Ah, yes, hello.

389
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,420
I'm Kim Gukho's attorney.

390
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,506
And?

391
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,008
I have something to discuss with you.

392
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,386
Can you open the door for me?

393
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,262
- I have nothing to discuss.
- No, wait.

394
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,639
It'll just take a moment.

395
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,401
Mom?

396
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,990
The documents you left behind.

397
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,785
I looked over them.

398
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,288
An uncontested divorce will be difficult
with these conditions.

399
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,503
The issue regarding custody
is indeed something

400
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,672
that can be negotiated
between both parties,

401
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,551
but a unilateral written statement
of relinquishing custody will have...

402
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,052
no legal effect.

403
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,808
Don't tell that to me.

404
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,768
You can speak with my attorney.

405
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,729
Your son is...

406
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,815
He's a genius violinist.

407
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,153
But lately, it seems
he's more famous as Kim Gukho's son.

408
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,280
If this drags on,

409
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,782
you'll get mixed up with him
over custody issues.

410
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,534
Are you okay with that?

411
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,957
{\an8}<i>HUMAN ANATOMY II</i>

412
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,673
Don't you mess with my son!

413
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,719
I'll kill him and everyone else.

414
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,973
There's something I didn't tell you.

415
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,267
I'm recording this.

416
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,442
Call me if you change your mind.

417
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,611
Your son's innocent.

418
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,414
OFFICER PARK

419
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,460
<i>Yes, Lieutenant Baek.</i>

420
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,587
Hey, Officer Park.

421
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,591
I have a favor to ask.
Track the location of a phone for me.

422
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,009
<i>It's urgent.</i>

423
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,886
Yes, that's not difficult.

424
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,638
<i>Who is it?</i>

425
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,474
Yeah, it's my daughter.

426
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,018
Don't ask anything else.

427
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,895
Can you just do it quickly?

428
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,105
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

429
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,315
<i>Can you text me the number?</i>

430
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,714
TO HOSAN

431
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,842
{\an8}Is that it?

432
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,343
Where did it go next? Find it.

433
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,015
{\an8}- It's Route 59.
- Keep playing it.

434
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,106
{\an8}What's wrong with that?

435
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,901
{\an8}I think the security cameras
here are broken.

436
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,569
There isn't a bypass road here.

437
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,945
Fuck.

438
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,452
Enforce it! Enforce it!

439
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:56,122
Kim Gukho threatens
public safety! Execute him!

440
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,207
Execute him! Execute him!

441
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:02,170
{\an8}We can't live with the anxiety! 
Ensure public safety!

442
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,213
{\an8}Ensure it! Ensure it!

443
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:08,051
{\an8}Castrate sex offender Kim Gukho!

444
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,637
Castrate him! Castrate him!

445
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,349
Give Kim Gukho
the death penalty! Execute him!

446
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,643
Execute him! Execute him!

447
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:21,731
Ban sex offender,
Kim Gukho, from Hosan City!

448
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,983
Ban him! Ban him!

449
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,028
We can't live with the anxiety!

450
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,572
Ban Kim Gukho!

451
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,699
Ban him! Ban him!

452
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,912
Castrate sex offender Kim Gukho!

453
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,872
Castrate him! Castrate him!

454
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,642
You may go in.

455
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,312
Lift your arms, please.

456
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,779
You may come in.

457
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,323
I am...

458
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,492
Kim Gukho's son.

459
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,203
- Excuse me?
- I'm his son.

460
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,206
I'm here to see my dad.

461
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,836
Kim Gukho's son is here.

462
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,630
<i>His son is here? Send him in.</i>

463
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,551
Go inside.

464
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,019
Mr. Kim, your son is here.

465
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,478
<i>My son?</i>

466
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,896
<i>My son is here?</i>

467
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,273
<i>Send him in! Now!</i>

468
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,574
He's going in now.

469
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,372
Kim Gukho, you bastard!

470
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,041
Leave Hosan City right now!

471
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,835
You scumbag!

472
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,919
My son...

473
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,130
You've grown so much.

474
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,841
So much.

475
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,053
Get in here.

476
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,138
Let your dad hug you. Come on.

477
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,020
I'm glad you're here.

478
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,396
I'm so glad you're here.

479
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,153
Let's go inside, okay? This is your house.

480
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,241
Come on in. Come on.

481
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,785
You punk.

482
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,828
You're so frail.

483
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,705
This won't do. Come here.

484
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,624
Let's get you something to eat, okay?

485
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,834
I have a lot of money.

486
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,669
I'll buy you everything you want to eat.

487
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,591
- Alcohol.
- Alcohol?

488
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,675
I want...

489
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,178
to drink with you, Dad.

490
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,139
You want to drink with me?

491
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,224
Really?

492
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,229
Yeah!

493
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,607
You're old enough to drink.
That's right. Yeah!

494
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,401
You should learn how to drink from me!
Wait a second.

495
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,863
Hang on.

496
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,828
Hey, Mr. Lee.

497
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,205
My son's at my house right now. Yeah.

498
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,748
It's not that.

499
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,085
Can you order in a nice whiskey
and dishes for us?

500
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,170
Korean, Chinese, Western, Japanese.

501
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,923
Order every land, sea,
and sky animal there is!

502
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,550
Come if you have time. Okay.

503
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,593
Yeah, okay. Bye.

504
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,642
Dongha, come here.

505
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,564
Look at what I did.

506
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,065
Thinking about you,

507
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,152
I folded each one by hand.

508
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,112
Do you remember?

509
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,989
You loved tigers.

510
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,828
Dad, I...

511
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,912
Yeah? What?

512
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,457
Can I see my room for a second?

513
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,750
Your room?

514
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,838
I didn't clean up.

515
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,841
Yeah, of course.

516
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,134
This is your house.

517
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,510
Go ahead.

518
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,808
Dongha!

519
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,728
I have beer. Do you want some?

520
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,812
Well...

521
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,191
Let's drink when the food gets here.

522
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,901
Okay, go ahead.

523
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,586
Ah.

524
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:41,968
Ah.

525
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,694
Dongha, come out!

526
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,320
The food is here!

527
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,114
I'll be right there!

528
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,902
<i>Mom,</i>

529
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:47,325
<i>it seems we have forgotten
the emotional pain we've been living with</i>

530
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,784
<i>for some time now.</i>

531
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,537
<i>I thought we could live happily</i>

532
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,708
<i>without that jerk in our lives.</i>

533
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,876
Here you go.

534
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,479
<i>But because of this incident...</i>

535
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,796
I'm paying you handsomely.

536
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,090
<i>I realized we'll have to live
with this label</i>

537
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,135
<i>and be in pain for the rest of our lives.</i>

538
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,307
<i>I'm okay with people
pointing their fingers at me...</i>

539
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,643
- Goodbye.
<i>- ...but I can't endure seeing you</i>

540
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,063
<i>in pain any longer.</i>

541
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,566
<i>You've carried the pain for me
all this time,</i>

542
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,777
<i>so now,</i>

543
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,321
<i>I'll bear that pain for you instead.</i>

544
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,033
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

545
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,290
Come here.

546
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,585
Sit down.

547
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,931
This is a fine whiskey.

548
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,934
Son, let me pour you a glass.

549
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,560
Here.

550
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,569
There you go.

551
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,654
There you go.

552
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,116
Are you okay?

553
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,159
Are you?

554
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,954
<i>Mr. Kim, your wife is here.</i>

555
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,085
Yeah.

556
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,796
It's nice to gather like this as a family.

557
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,426
Search her thoroughly, okay?

558
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,223
- Father.
- Yeah?

559
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,560
I'll pour you a glass too.

560
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,644
Yeah, sure.

561
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,188
Here.

562
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,610
I feel great today!

563
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,169
You little punk!

564
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,214
How dare you! You little bastard!

565
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,802
You bastard!

566
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,305
How dare you swing a knife at your father?

567
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,182
Did your mom put you up to this?

568
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,184
Did she put you up to this, you shit?

569
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,533
You little fucker...

570
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,340
Damn it...

571
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,722
Dongha.

572
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,099
Dongha?

573
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,400
Honey...

574
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,775
She's coming out!

575
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,027
Didn't she just go in?

576
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,779
What's that? Is that blood?

577
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,406
- She must be hurt!
- I...

578
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,079
I killed Kim Gukho.

579
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,709
I did it!

580
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,713
I killed Kim Gukho!
