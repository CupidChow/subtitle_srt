You can't even drink water.

18
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,980
You're just a girl who's trying to get into a man's heart.

19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,980
You're just a girl who's trying to get into a man's heart.

You're just a girl who's trying to get into a man's heart.

You're just a girl who's trying to get into a man's heart.

29
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,980
You're not the one who tried to kill Jang Gil Taek.

30
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,980
You even tried to kill the one who failed.

31
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,980
Where are you going?

32
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,980
Get out of the way!

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,980
Master!

34
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
What are you doing?

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,980
How dare you!

36
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,980
You're not helping the poor.

37
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,980
We're the ones who failed.

38
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,980
Get out of here!

39
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,980
If you're the merchants, you should have a merchant's share.

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,980
You're trying to compare the merchants to the merchants.

41
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,980
Are you going to fight with those scoundrels?

42
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,980
What? Scoundrel?

43
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,980
How dare you!

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,980
Stop!

45
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,980
How dare you!

46
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,980
You're still not used to this.

47
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,980
Master!

48
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,980
Master!

49
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,980
Master!

50
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,980
Master!

51
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,980
Are you okay?

52
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,980
Miss!

53
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,980
Are you crazy?

54
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
You're no use to me.

55
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,980
You're just a girl who's trying to get into a man's heart.

56
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,980
Move!

57
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,980
Move!

58
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
There she is!

59
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,980
Keep going!

60
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,980
Keep going!

61
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,980
There she is!

62
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,980
There she is!

63
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,980
There she is!

64
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,980
There she is!

65
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,980
The highest possible answer is 50,000 times 100,000 times.

66
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,980
The next lucky person is you.

Macau

70
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,980
I've been looking for you.

71
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
I'm looking for you.

72
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,980
I'm looking for you.

73
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm looking for you.

74
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
I'm looking for you.

75
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
You're really amazing.

76
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,980
I've never seen such a great sword in Soil Heaven.

77
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,980
It's the work of Yeodo.

78
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Yeodo was the best blacksmith in Korea.

79
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,980
It was high in meditation, so it was hard to get a good sword.

80
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
But Yeodo was able to get it with his own money.

81
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,980
This sword is the last work of Yeodo.

82
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:18,980
No one knows how long I've been hoping for this sword.

83
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Mr. Jang

84
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,980
I don't know how to express my gratitude to you.

85
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,980
It's just a feeling.

86
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,980
I can't just get this precious thing.

87
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,980
I'll help you with everything I can.

88
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Well...

89
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,980
I think I should give you a lecture.

90
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,980
Don't hesitate and tell me.

91
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,980
What do you want?

92
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,980
A new song.

93
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,980
A new song.

94
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,980
Sir!

95
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,980
Sir!

96
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,980
Sir!

97
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,980
Miss!

98
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
Sir!

99
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,980
Sir!

100
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,980
Miss!

101
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Sir!

102
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
I can't believe this.

103
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,980
Sir!

104
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,980
Miss!

105
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Miss!

106
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Why?

107
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Why aren't you eating?

108
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
You eat more.

109
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
I don't have an appetite.

110
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980
Sir!

111
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,980
I'm so sorry for all the people who have been deceived by the failures.

112
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,980
I don't know what to do with this foolish money.

113
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Sir!

114
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,980
May I come in?

115
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
Yes.

116
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,980
Here's your tea.

118
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
Here.

119
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,980
Your arms must be swollen.

120
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,980
May I have a look?

121
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,980
Here you go.

122
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,980
This tea is effective in relieving the discomfort and reducing swelling.

123
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,980
If you keep it, you'll feel less pain.

124
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
Thank you.

125
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,980
I should be the one thanking you.

126
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:49,660
I almost got a big

127
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,980
Then this is...

128
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,980
The money you two tried to buy was fake.

129
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,980
This is the real money.

130
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
Touch it.

131
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
It's the best real money.

132
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,980
If you touch the real money, it will turn yellow.

133
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,980
But the fake money...

134
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,980
There's no change.

135
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,980
Besides, this world is so beautiful.

136
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
There's no change.

137
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:05,980
Besides, the gold price of these three pieces is the same as the gold price of six gold pieces.

138
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,980
It's twice the weight of gold.

139
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,980
That's right.

140
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,980
It's a shame to get that much gold in a few dozen years.

141
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,980
Another thing.

142
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,980
If you want to sell in Hanyang, you must buy things through Shizhen.

143
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
The loser is Nanjian.

144
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,980
You didn't know that it was forbidden to sell when you saw Nanjian.

145
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:40,980
After hearing Nanjian's words, I feel ashamed because I don't know the world and the world.

146
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,980
I didn't mean that.

147
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,980
I'm also losing money because of this.

148
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,980
How can I sell fake money?

149
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,980
Are you still trying to sell?

150
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,980
You said the market is losing money day by day.

151
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,980
Are you here?

152
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,980
It doesn't seem like it will end with 2,500 pieces.

153
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,980
Now it's going to be over 3,000 pieces.

154
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,980
Why are you stubborn without selling it quickly?

155
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
I'm sorry.

156
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
What are you going to do with all this money?

157
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,980
I'm going to blow up the entire Myeonjujeon.

158
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,980
I'm saying this because I'm worried about you.

159
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,980
The big news has arrived.

160
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,980
The big news has arrived.

161
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,980
You bastard!

162
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,980
Get out of the way!

163
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,980
Master!

164
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,980
How can you meet me like this?

165
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,980
How can you recognize me?

166
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
Shut up!

167
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,980
Did you try to sell?

168
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Where are you going?

169
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,980
Master!

170
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,980
Open the door!

171
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,980
Master, please open the door!

172
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,980
I can't open the door!

173
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,980
Master!

174
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,980
Who was that?

175
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,980
He cheated on me and ran away.

176
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,980
I have to meet him.

177
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,980
I don't want to hear it.

178
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,980
Please don't mind.

179
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,980
He is the eldest of the Janggiltaek family.

180
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,980
He is my master.

181
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,980
Does that mean he framed you for stealing?

182
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,980
He must have taken the sword.

183
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,980
He must have used it to trust me.

184
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
Why did he do that?

185
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,980
He is the eldest of the Janggiltaek family.

186
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,980
Why did he come to Gyeongju?

187
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,980
I'll ask him later.

188
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Did you keep your promise?

189
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
You are not like the other two.

190
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
Why are you laughing at him?

191
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,980
I have an idea.

192
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
Let's see.

193
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,980
Wait.

194
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Here.

195
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,980
That's right.

196
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,980
He is the one who did it.

197
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,980
Please lend me 200 sheep.

198
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,980
I will solve the fake war.

199
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,980
I will stop thousands of sheep.

200
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,980
But let me meet the eldest of the Janggiltaek family.

201
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,980
Miss.

202
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,980
Why are you so happy?

203
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Nothing.

204
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,980
Miss, I am worried.

205
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,980
How can you trust him and lend me 200 sheep?

206
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
I'll see.

207
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,980
If I can stop thousands of sheep with 200 sheep,

208
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,980
wouldn't it be worth it?

209
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,980
You are only a country girl.

210
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,980
You are not that talented.

211
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,980
I feel like I'm getting closer to him.

212
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,980
This is the Gyeonbong of the Meipal blood group.

213
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,980
Yes.

214
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,980
What was the matter with your father?

215
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980
I don't know.

216
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,980
Do you want to leave a lot of the old stuff?

217
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
Oh, my.

218
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,980
It's nice to see you again.

219
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,980
It's raining in Hanyang.

220
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
I'm sure.

221
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Isn't it grape or grass?

222
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,980
Do you know how many years I've been living in this sea?

223
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
Don't worry.

224
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,980
This is 50 sheep lost to our Dongpaek.

225
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,980
This is 50 sheep lost to our Dongpaek.

226
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,980
Let's forget the past and start a new trade.

227
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,980
Show me the money first.

228
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,980
Yes.

229
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,980
200 sheep.

230
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
Here, a fake king.

231
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,980
If you sell it in your hometown, you'll have double the profit.

232
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,980
What I'm trying to buy is not a fake king.

233
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,980
I want to buy that technology.

234
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,980
The technology to make a fake king.

235
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,980
And the equipment.

236
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,980
Well, my young master is interested in extreme rice.

237
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,980
You have to know how to farm to harvest every year.

238
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,980
Did you find it?

239
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,980
I got it.

240
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,980
My whole fortune.

241
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,980
I brought you a gift.

242
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
Oh, yes.

243
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,980
Please eat inside.

244
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,980
Thank you.

245
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,980
Thank you, sir.

246
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,980
You did a good job today.

247
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,980
Take care of your legs.

248
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Yes.

249
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,980
Are you there?

250
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,980
Yes.

251
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,860
Call all the big and big

252
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,980
traders in Gapcheon.

253
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,980
Finally, the right to the new high-level military power

254
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,980
has come into our hands.

255
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
Yes.

256
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,980
Brother, you mean we have the right to

257
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,980
the big and big traders in the Samnam region?

258
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Yes.

259
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,980
It's not just the new high-level military power.

260
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,980
With this opportunity, all the white horses

261
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,980
that will come into Hanyang will be under our control.

262
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,980
Then, I don't think we can avoid

263
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,980
the friction with the merchants in Mapo.

264
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
Of course.

265
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,980
The merchants' basis will be

266
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,980
the right to the Han River.

267
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,980
Until now, the merchants have supplied

268
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,980
the goods that were sent by the white horse

269
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,980
with the safety of the Chilpae.

270
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,980
If the power of the merchants and the Chilpae

271
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,980
continues to expand,

272
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,980
it will be a great threat to our business.

273
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,980
It's obvious.

274
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,980
I will not do anything more.

275
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,980
Big brother.

276
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
Yes.

277
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,980
Go and gather the three tradesmen.

278
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,980
We have to make sure that the new high-level

279
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,980
military power is not in vain.

280
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
Yes.

281
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,940
The

282
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,980
father's house is down there.

283
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,980
Is the Daedongmi stock market so suspicious?

284
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,980
The stock market is not the whole country.

285
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
Think about it.

286
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,980
How much rice is there in the 8th of the country

287
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,980
that is covered with tax?

288
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,980
If we want to carry that much rice

289
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
to Hanyang every year,

290
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,980
the large-scale shipping using the waterway

291
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,980
will be even more developed.

292
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,980
Then our superior team will be in charge

293
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,980
of the huge shipping.

294
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,980
Yes.

295
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,980
When the ships that joined the shipping team

296
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
come under our control,

297
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,980
we can control the water that goes into the city

298
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,980
through the Han River.

299
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,980
This will soon be the time

300
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,980
to dominate the Hanyang market.

301
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,980
Then we will be able to control the whole country.

302
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,980
No, no, we can control the whole country.

303
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,980
You are right.

304
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,980
We can't even see one of the ships.

305
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Father, you are right.

306
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,980
You are right.

307
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,980
So,

308
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,980
there is still a question left.

309
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,980
The trade is getting worse.

310
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,980
It will be a big business

311
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,980
if we do it right.

312
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,980
Yes, yes, that's right.

313
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,980
Since the new ship has arrived,

314
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,980
we should take the opportunity

315
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,980
to get rid of the manufacturing law.

316
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,980
1,000 sheep.

317
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,980
Then...

318
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,980
1,500 sheep.

319
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Pardon?

320
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,980
We should pay more than 500 sheep.

321
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,980
It's not like we are a few pieces of fake wool.

322
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,980
We should pay that much to teach them

323
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,980
how to make it.

324
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,980
Isn't that right?

325
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,980
Of course, of course.

326
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,980
You are a great dealer.

327
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,980
1,500 sheep.

328
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,980
1,500 sheep.

329
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
Oh, you are finally done.

330
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,980
Yes, Mother.

331
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,980
You did a great job today.

332
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,980
You must have had a lot of trouble.

333
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,980
My dear officer.

334
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
Father.

335
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
Yes?

336
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,980
I have a question for you.

337
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,980
What is it?

338
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,980
Recently,

339
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,980
there is a fake wool

340
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
in the ship.

341
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,980
Have you heard about it?

342
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,980
Fake wool?

343
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,980
If you say wool,

344
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,980
it's like a medicine from the cow.

345
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,980
I haven't heard of it.

346
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,980
Have you ever heard of it?

347
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,980
Oh, I've heard of it too.

348
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Fake wool?

349
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,980
But why are you asking?

350
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,980
We are investigating in Pocheon.

351
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,980
I think there are people

352
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,980
who know about fake wool

353
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,980
among the people you are dealing with.

354
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,980
I don't know about that.

355
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,980
I don't have anything to do with

356
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,980
those black men.

357
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,980
Of course, of course.

358
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
Your father is not the kind of person

359
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,980
to trade with those people.

360
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,980
Our dealings with Jang Giltaek

361
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,980
will be of great help

362
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,980
to many of our ancestors.

363
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,980
We will be able to carry out

364
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,980
other things

365
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,980
while we are investigating.

366
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,980
In the end,

367
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,980
it will be a good deal.

368
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,980
What do you think?

369
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,980
Of course.

370
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,980
We are looking forward to it.

371
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
For the ancestors who are

372
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,980
participating in the ship,

373
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,980
you just have to trust

374
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,980
our Jang Giltaek.

375
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,980
We will be able to get the information

376
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
about the things that will come

377
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,980
from the ship.

378
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,980
We have to discuss it with you.

379
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,980
But don't worry about the luck.

380
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,980
I will pay you back.

381
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
Please pay me back

382
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,980
for the drinks.

383
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,980
I trust you,

384
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,980
the ancestors here.

385
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,980
I believe that

386
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,980
the ship will be enough.

387
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,980
Today, our great leader

388
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,980
has prepared this place

389
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,980
for the ancestors.

390
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,980
Please enjoy it.

391
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,980
Thank you.

392
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,980
You guys stay out.

393
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,980
I will go and ask for it myself.

394
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,980
Yes, sir.

395
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,980
Do you know who I am?

396
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,980
Yes.

397
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
From now on,

398
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
you will be asked

399
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,980
to find the person

400
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,980
I am asking.

401
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,980
Yes, sir.

402
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
Find the person

403
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
who is asking.

404
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,980
You are the one

405
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,980
who distributed the fake

406
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,980
royal seal, right?

407
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,980
That is...

408
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
Don't think about

409
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,980
going around like a beggar.

410
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,980
Please spare my life.

411
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,980
I will ask you one more thing.

412
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
Is my father

413
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,980
involved in the fake royal seal?

414
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,980
Answer me!

415
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,980
My father

416
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
gave me the money

417
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,980
to make the royal seal.

418
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
From now on,

419
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
do as I say.

420
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Otherwise,

421
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
you will die.

422
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,980
Let's go.

423
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,980
From the first hill

424
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,980
of the mountain,

425
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,980
is it this way?

426
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,980
Sir, are you going to

427
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,980
the fake royal seal factory?

428
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,980
Stay still.

429
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,980
I will tell you everything.

430
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,980
Why didn't he come?

431
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,980
I don't know.

432
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,980
I think this way is right.

433
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,980
Yes, I think it's that way.

434
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,980
This is the factory

435
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,980
that makes the fake royal seal.

436
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,980
Oh, my.

437
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,980
Why are you suddenly coming?

438
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,980
Oh, my.

439
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,980
Go and work.

440
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,980
Yes, sir.

441
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,980
Oh, my.

442
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,980
Oh, my.

443
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:58,800
Didn't' they?

444
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:16,480
Can't say no your majesty.

445
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
It's a signal.

446
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Let's go.

447
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,480
I told you this was the right place.

448
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Why isn't anyone here?

449
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,480
This way!

450
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
Follow them!

451
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Stop!

452
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Master!

453
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
They're all dead!

454
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
What happened?

455
00:31:49,480 --> 00:32:11,940
Why are the

456
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,940
And

457
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,940
Don't ever do this again.

458
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,940
Stop!

459
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,940
Keep going!

460
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:56,940
What is it?

461
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,940
What is it?

462
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,940
Yes, I knew everything.

463
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,940
But don't worry.

464
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,940
I will clean up everything that you ordered.

465
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,940
You are the next lucky child.

466
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,940
Macau New Peking Entertainment City 931 931.com

467
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,940
I will cut off your hands.

468
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,940
I'm embarrassed to see my son.

469
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,940
What should I do?

470
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:06,940
Get out!

471
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,940
Hello, we have anchovies.

472
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,940
Hello, we have anchovies.

473
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,940
We have anchovies.

474
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,940
We are doing well because of your help.

475
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,940
You are welcome.

476
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,940
You will be a disgrace to Myeongtae.

477
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,940
What is going on?

478
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,940
Myeongtae, who was bought by the North Korean police,

479
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,940
is still in the ship.

480
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,940
Why don't you let him go?

481
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,940
Who is this?

482
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,940
Isn't he the leader of the North Korean police?

483
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,940
The leader of the North Korean police,

484
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,940
is he a member of the Mapo Nara?

485
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,940
A member of the Mapo Nara?

486
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,940
I will ask the leader of the North Korean police.

487
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
What?

488
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,940
What are you going to do?

489
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,940
Do you know that the ship is in the upper deck?

490
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,940
There may be ships in the Mapa Nara.

491
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,940
They will all be used as a ship.

492
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,940
Who do you think you are?

493
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,940
Get the water.

494
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,940
Yes, sir.

495
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,940
You can't do that.

496
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,940
Take him away.

497
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:49,940
What are you doing?

498
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,940
From now on,

499
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,940
you can't take a single ship from the upper deck

500
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,940
without permission from the leader of the Mapa Nara.

501
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:04,940
I will exclude you from the ship.

502
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,940
What are you waiting for?

503
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,940
Hit him.

504
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,940
It's just the beginning.

505
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,940
I will take the Mapa Nara

506
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,380
and put the Korean

507
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:46,940
goods in my hands.

508
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,940
What?

509
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,940
What are you talking about?

510
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,940
The security guards were there.

511
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,940
Without the permission of the leader of the Mapa Nara,

512
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,940
we can't take any goods into the ship.

513
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
Then what about the name tag

514
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,940
that Kang Sang-hee brought from the Han Gyeongdae?

515
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,940
The name tag is not important now.

516
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,940
Kang Jin's name tag, Haenam's salt.

517
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Even if I don't explain it,

518
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,940
I will tie them all to Naruto.

519
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,940
If Kang Sang-hee collapses,

520
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,940
wouldn't that mean that

521
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,940
our 7 ships' supply of goods will be cut off?

522
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
There are many ships

523
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,940
in the Mapa Nara.

524
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,940
I didn't know that you were investigating

525
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
the security guards.

526
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
You were trying to find out

527
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,940
where we were going by using fake information.

528
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,940
No.

529
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,940
I'm glad I found out about the situation between us.

530
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,940
We can't punish the innocent.

531
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,940
I told them to bring them here.

532
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,940
Commander Jeong.

533
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,940
The Mapa Nara

534
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,940
Commander!

535
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,940
Commander, are you okay?

536
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,940
I'm fine.

537
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,940
You have severe anxiety.

538
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,940
All the fake gold we have in Jeju

539
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
has been confiscated.

540
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,940
The price of the gold will be stable soon.

541
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,940
Then, are you keeping your promise?

542
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,940
You solved the fake gold case.

543
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,940
You are really good at it.

544
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,940
I'm about to write a new report.

545
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,940
The leader of the Mapa Nara

546
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,940
is going to take you to the underground.

547
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,940
He just came to call.

548
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,940
I'm busy,

549
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,940
so I don't want to bother you.

550
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,940
I heard that you are

551
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,940
the Korean President.

552
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,940
There is a limit to your position.

553
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,940
Don't try too hard.

554
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,940
Be nice.

555
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,940
Choi Gukseon?

556
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,940
What's wrong?

557
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,940
Was his name Choi Gukseon?

558
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,940
Yes.

559
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,940
He was definitely Choi Gukseon.

560
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,940
What's wrong?

561
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,940
I'm sorry.

562
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,940
It's good.

563
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,940
Yes.

564
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,940
The sky has helped us.

565
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,940
We need to be careful.

566
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,940
How can we buy the gold from him?

567
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,940
We can't just sell it.

568
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,940
I will keep that in mind.

569
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,940
What can we do?

570
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,940
We can't buy it.

571
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,940
We can't sell it.

572
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,940
We can't do anything about it.

573
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,940
I'm sorry to bother you.

574
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,940
No.

575
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,940
If we sell it,

576
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,940
we will have to pay a lot of money.

577
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,940
If we do well,

578
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,940
we can make a profit.

579
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,940
Good job.

580
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,940
Father,

581
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,940
I have something to tell you.

582
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,940
Daegwang.

583
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,940
Sit.

584
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,940
What's wrong?

585
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,940
What?

586
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,940
Why did you use me in Gyeongju?

587
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,940
Is that what you want to know?

588
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,940
Do you know what I did

589
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,940
to you?

590
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,940
I believed in your goodwill.

591
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,940
I believed in you for helping me.

592
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,940
But you used my trust

593
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,940
and drove me to the palace.

594
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,940
You believed in people.

595
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,940
What do you mean?

596
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,940
What do you mean?

597
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,940
Did you believe in me

598
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,940
or my money?

599
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,940
Don't say you believed in people.

600
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,940
I paid you back.

601
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,940
I sent you a job.

602
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,940
You believed in my money.

603
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,940
You paid the price.

604
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,940
I paid the price for you.

605
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,940
So you're saying there's nothing wrong

606
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,940
with stealing from someone's home?

607
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,940
Who steals?

608
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,940
I'm a merchant.

609
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,940
I'm a merchant.

610
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,940
Do you think I have anything

611
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,940
that's good for a merchant?

612
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,940
I bought that knife.

613
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,940
I bought it to make you pay

614
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,940
for your unimaginable debt.

615
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,940
If you're wrong,

616
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,940
sell that knife to me

617
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,940
and pay for your home.

618
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,940
What's the use of a merchant

619
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,940
who can't pay for his own goods?

620
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,940
How can you be so confident?

621
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,940
So you paid for everything

622
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,940
with your money.

623
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,940
It doesn't matter if you lose

624
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,940
your trust in people.

625
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,940
What did you do?

626
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,940
Didn't you trick someone

627
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,940
to find out about the fake

628
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,940
royal production?

629
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,940
Didn't you also

630
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,940
trick someone to trust you

631
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,940
with money?

632
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,940
That's the way the world is.

633
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,940
The trust of people.

634
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,940
You have to get rid of

635
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,940
the rumors of the thieves.

636
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,940
If you want to get something,

637
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,940
you have to take the weak side.

638
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,940
Do you know when

639
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,940
a person becomes the weakest?

640
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,940
When he faces his greed.

641
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,940
You and I

642
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,940
also take advantage

643
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,940
of the weakness of greed.

644
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,940
I will show you one day

645
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,940
that there is something

646
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,940
that can't be done

647
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,940
with money.

648
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,940
Wait.

649
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,940
Why don't we

650
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,940
work together?

651
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,940
I'm not interested.

652
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,940
Let's go.

653
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,940
Come.

654
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,940
I'm grateful for the

655
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,940
one promise I made.

656
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:26,940
It's okay.

657
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,940
I'm satisfied

658
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,940
with what you said.

659
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,940
If you say so,

660
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,940
can you tell me

661
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,940
who I am?

662
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,940
My name is Choi Gayeo.

663
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,940
My name is Kuk Sun.

664
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,940
Kuk Sun?

665
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,940
Choi Kuk Sun?

666
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,940
I'm sorry.

667
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,940
I'm sorry.

668
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,940
I'm sorry.

669
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,940
From now on,

670
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,940
I trust you.

671
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,940
I feel like I have to do something.

672
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,940
I feel like I can see the world little by little.

673
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,940
In Hanyang,

674
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,940
you can only do business

675
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,940
through the market,

676
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,940
but what can I do with my 50 sheep?

677
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,940
I feel like

678
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,940
failure is not a good start

679
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,940
for my business.

680
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,940
If you think about the road

681
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,940
after staying in Yeomchon-gil for a few days,

682
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,940
you will see the way.

683
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,940
Don't be sad.

684
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:28,940
Don't be sad.

685
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,940
It's okay to stay like this.

686
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:41,940
It's the path I chose.

687
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,940
If you say so,

688
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,940
can you tell me

689
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:54,940
that you might be a little upset?

690
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:01,940
Just stay like this.

691
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:07,940
So that I can just look at you.

692
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:17,940
I can't stay like this anymore.

693
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,940
The Janggiltak Group

694
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,940
is trying to take away

695
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,940
the Han River rights of our

696
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,940
Gyeonggang merchants

697
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,940
by using the new military rights.

698
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,940
You can never give up

699
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,940
the Mapo Naro.

700
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,940
Our 7 merchants have been

701
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,940
able to supply things

702
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,940
to us thanks to you.

703
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,940
The merchants who are

704
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,940
unable to kill the refugees

705
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,940
are trying to give us

706
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,940
the goods.

707
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,940
You are right.

708
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,940
Our 7 merchants

709
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,940
are one body.

710
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,940
We have to live together

711
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,940
even if we die or live together.

712
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,940
We need a realistic solution.

713
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,940
If we can't get the goods

714
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,940
we will be forced to close the door.

715
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,940
Is there no way?

716
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,940
There is one way.

717
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,940
What is it?

718
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,940
But that is...

719
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,940
What are you talking about?

720
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,940
Tell me.

721
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,940
If we get caught,

722
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,940
we will be punished.

723
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,940
What are you doing there?

724
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,940
Who are you?

725
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,940
What are you doing?

726
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,940
Stop it.

727
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,940
Did the merchants send you

728
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,940
to do this?

729
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,940
No, they didn't.

730
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,940
You are

731
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,940
definitely a stranger.

732
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,940
You...

733
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,940
You are like

734
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,940
a traveler

735
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,940
in the Janggildae family.

736
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,940
That is true,

737
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,940
but I have nothing to do

738
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,940
with the Janggildae family.

739
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,940
I just want to

740
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,940
make a mistake

741
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,940
and kill you.

742
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,940
I just want to do business.

743
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,940
Please believe me.

744
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,940
Tie them up.

745
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,940
We have to take them to Mapo.

746
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,940
Yes, sir.

747
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,940
What are you doing?

748
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,940
It is cold.

749
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,940
Go inside.

750
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,940
You are here.

751
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,940
A man who is not even

752
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,940
physically fit

753
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,940
is suffering in this cold place.

754
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,940
It is just that

755
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,940
our Goksun

756
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,940
is suffering

757
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,940
in this cold place.

758
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,940
I am worried.

759
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,940
Do not worry.

760
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,940
I am sure that child

761
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,940
will come back after studying.

762
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,940
But come back

763
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,940
and I just want you

764
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,940
to be in the same room.

765
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,940
Pandol,

766
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,940
is he eating?

767
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,940
Suseuddeok!

768
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,940
Suseuddeok is the best!

769
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,940
Please try it.

770
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,940
Come here.

771
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,940
Yes, sir.

772
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,940
Suseuddeok!

773
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,940
It is the best of the best.

774
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,940
Please explain.

775
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,940
Suseuddeok is the best

776
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,940
when you go out.

777
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,940
Please give me one more.

778
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,940
Yes, sir.

779
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,940
Thank you.

780
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:46,940
Please enjoy.

781
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,940
Please hurry.

782
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,940
Suseuddeok!

783
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,940
Suseuddeok!

784
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,940
Suseuddeok!

785
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,940
Suseuddeok!

786
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,940
You guys,

787
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,940
go with this ship.

788
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,940
If something happens

789
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,940
to the ship,

790
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,940
even if it is a long journey,

791
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,940
you will not be able to

792
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,940
escape the ship.

793
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,940
Hurry up and go back.

794
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,940
Yes, sir.

795
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,940
Hurry up.

796
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,940
How did you think

797
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,940
that there was a new world

798
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,940
in the seven-point ship?

799
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,940
Can I ask you?

800
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,940
I wanted to start

801
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,940
in this vast Han Yang.

802
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,940
Why have I never thought

803
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,940
about it?

804
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,940
You have to go back to the capital

805
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,940
and release this ship.

806
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,940
Lock the ship.

807
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,940
Miss!

808
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,940
It is a gongbong.

809
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,940
Thanks to you,

810
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,940
I found you easily.

811
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,940
I will save you

812
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,940
no matter what.

813
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,940
Why are you so afraid

814
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,940
of helping me?
