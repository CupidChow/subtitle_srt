1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
?

2
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,180
We are in big trouble!

3
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:22,460
The

4
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,000
besides wonderful

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not talking about the name, I'm talking about the person.

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Come out here.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If you forgive me just once, I will never do that again.

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Your order?

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I will obey the order of God.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This journey will be a long and difficult one.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It is important to be as heavy as the mountain.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It is important to be as light as the feather.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will be loyal to the crisis of the Nuran and protect the temple.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will spend my life with you.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Grandpa! Grandpa!

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Goksan, people are important.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Everyone in this world is important.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I will be loyal to the crisis of the Nuran and protect the temple.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Someone is trying to pay you for your medicine.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Then what about your medicine?

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All things have a foundation and a foundation.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And this is the beginning and the end of it.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You are a soldier.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What is your main duty?

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To protect the temple.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Your own choice is the basis.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I have different thoughts about my foundation.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I told you to leave the temple.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are trying to protect the temple and protect your family?

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Father.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Father.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Prepare the food.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I will be back in a moment.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't waste your time on useless things.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Go to the temple.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Excuse me.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you have a lot of medicine?

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't complain about the business.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I will give you a good price.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Go now.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Look, I brought money.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Please go.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Please take this money.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Just a little.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You are so mean.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You have no money to pay for the medicine.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You can go to the temple.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Or you can give me a little money.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You are so mean.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I am telling you.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You don't have to pay me a little money.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I told you to get the doctor's treatment.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I will go.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The sea is getting bigger.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How many days will it be?

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's get three more.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The sea is getting bigger.

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The sea is getting bigger.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The sea is getting bigger.

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The sea is getting bigger.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I told you to get the doctor's treatment.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I am here.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Go down.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I am here.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I am sorry.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I am sorry.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I am sorry.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What is wrong with you?

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I am sorry.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Did you get drunk?

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why are you so drunk today?

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What are you doing?

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Turn the wheel.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You are the mayor.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Sangbae, why don't you say something?

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I am sorry.

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You can't eat with that red foot.

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I saw you in my dream last night.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think that was a bad idea.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Isn't something wrong with this?

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Something is wrong?

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What?

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why do you eat so much?

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
How would I know?

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's because of the lungs.

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What's wrong with you?

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You are all one pack, right?

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes, we are.

91
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You guys, I won't let you go.

92
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If you don't, you will be in trouble.

93
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You should take the yellow light.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let go of this.

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You are so rude.

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You don't even know that you can't see the yellow light.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let go of me.

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Or you can change your clothes.

99
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You hid money in here.

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, I can't do this.

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What do you mean?

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can't do this.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Stop it.

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How much is the yellow light?

105
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How should I thank you?

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I am Choi Goksun.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I am Jang Siseong.

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Sir, I will pay you back the money you gave to the Japanese.

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't worry about it.

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No, I will pay you back.

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Please let me pay you back.

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I think you are a son of a noble family.

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
How could you enter such a dangerous place?

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I have been desperate for money.

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I have tried to get money from the money-making group.

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But when I get money, I will build a house with dust.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And I will build a house with spider web.

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It is so embarrassing.

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I am ashamed.

120
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There was someone who took me out of the mud.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I am paying back the money I gave to the young man.

122
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Don't worry about the money.

123
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Sir, I will never forget your kindness.

124
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
How is it?

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think we are the ones who found it.

126
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I think so too.

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You should keep an eye on him.

128
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Mother.

129
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You are here.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You should have dinner.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I will be right back.

132
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mother, are you feeling better?

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I am fine.

134
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You don't look well.

135
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why did you go to Myeoncheon?

136
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I went to investigate the events of the Myeoncheon military.

137
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What is the use of our ancestors' actions in this place?

138
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What do you mean?

139
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You are collecting the records of our ancestors.

140
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How can I not know what you mean?

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I am concerned about your health.

142
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't worry about me.

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If you just do as father says,

144
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I will be better.

145
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
They told him to speak.

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You are the legendary General of Cheonjeong gardens.

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What do you mean?

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You don't need to buy a good farm to make a good house.

149
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This book contains thousands of songs.

150
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's the present of the four kingdoms, so you should know it.

151
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Ah, the scholar is the one who shows the division when he is in the palace.

152
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You should think of the north as a mud.

153
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I have a question.

154
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes, go ahead.

155
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Even though your wife is starving, if you read books and do the work of a gardener,

156
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
is that the right thing to do?

157
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you are a daughter of a farmer, you should be happy.

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Even though it's difficult and difficult, you should enjoy the money and be interested in it.

159
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm curious about your thoughts, not your words.

160
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If your wife gets sick, you should get some medicine for her, right?

161
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes, sir.

162
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Madam, the master is here.

163
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sorry to have to see you.

164
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm a guest, so I'll make sure you don't feel uncomfortable.

165
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes, sir.

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Then, you'll have to go a long way, so please solve the problem.

167
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is the record of the eight great masters.

168
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I met the guest in the car that was in a mess when all the stones were left behind.

169
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You met the master.

170
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
His ancestors had a meeting or a meeting.

171
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The records of the great masters and the records of the masters were kept.

172
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's a relief.

173
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Sell this.

174
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Father.

175
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How can you just get this precious record that you've been keeping for hundreds of years?

176
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You have to pay the price.

177
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No, sir.

178
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Isn't that the last remaining money?

179
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't you know that the money is not enough for the masters?

180
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Then, you're saying that the records of the ancestors are good?

181
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why should we sacrifice for this record?

182
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Guk-sun, what kind of behavior is this in front of you?

183
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Lee Seomang, sell this land quickly.

185
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But, you can't take the land money from your father.

186
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Sir, what should I do?

187
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll use it.

188
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Mother will pay for it.

189
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No matter how important the history of the ancestors is,

190
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can't hand it over to that record.

191
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'll use it.

192
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I heard that you're a rich man.

193
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Now that your son is a rich man,

194
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
you're enjoying your life.

195
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I heard that a rich man can fall into a pit even if he's in a pit.

196
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How much will you be able to pay for this?

197
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Hey, bring more food and drinks to the guests.

198
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The masters are here.

199
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes, thank you.

200
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'll go out first.

201
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes, go ahead.

202
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The gold is coming.

203
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I put in a very expensive Chinese medicine.

204
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll give it to you.

205
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll be able to use it.

206
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is Yongbong tea from the Qing Dynasty.

207
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yongbong tea?

208
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's the same tea that was only drunk in the royal palace of the Middle Kingdom.

209
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Try drinking the royal tea today.

210
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Would you like a drink?

211
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Here, here.

212
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Come on, stay here.

213
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Stay here.

214
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The old man who was staying at the restaurant in Dumu Gorge sent this.

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What's the matter?

216
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I sent a letter to an elder I met at the city hall.

217
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I think it was sent as a case.

218
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll go and check.

219
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Here, drink it.

220
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
May I ask why you are so kind to me?

221
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I can't just receive kindness.

222
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm grateful to the elder, but I can't receive it without knowing the reason.

223
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you.

224
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Then, would you like to trade with me?

225
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What?

226
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I haven't seen you since yesterday.

227
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I saw you this morning and I saw you in your room.

228
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I think you sent a letter to me to get rid of the land.

229
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But you didn't take it with you.

230
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
How dare you steal from me?

231
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
There are times when you have to close your eyes when you live.

232
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I can't do that. I'll return my rice paddy to you right now.

233
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:34,900
Master, the master told me to give the rice paddy to the guest who went to the

234
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,900
Why?

235
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Thank you.

236
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,900
Master, please take the rice paddy and fly away.

237
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,900
Master.

238
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,900
Mother.

239
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,900
What happened to Goksun?

240
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
I'm sorry.

241
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,900
It's all my fault.

242
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Now, it's too much of a waste to just look at a simple theft case.

243
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,900
The whole warehouse of Mapo Naro is being robbed.

244
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,900
Are you going to adjust it to the extent that it is a matter of the city's security?

245
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
I'm sorry.

246
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,900
I'm sorry, but the reason why we're making it even more difficult to investigate is...

247
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
Look.

248
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,900
A piece of land was found in the country's capital over the past four months.

249
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Look.

250
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,900
A piece of land was found in the country's capital over the past four months.

251
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,900
We can't even estimate the area of the land.

252
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,900
Didn't the piece of land be found in Hanyang?

253
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
It's still like that.

254
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,900
By any chance, look at the place where the piece of land was found.

255
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,900
There are a lot of places in the country.

256
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,900
Muhan, Masanpo, Gyeong, Gwacheon, Hwangju.

257
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
There is one thing in common.

258
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
It's all a big market place.

259
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Then?

260
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,900
It's a treasure.

261
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,900
It's not easy to store or distribute the large amount of pieces of land that were stolen.

262
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,900
There will be no such thing as a treasure to be sold at this time when the land is scattered all over the country.

263
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,900
I heard that there is a shop on the street where the treasures are stored.

264
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
If you investigate there...

265
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,900
Without any evidence, you're not investigating with such a sense.

266
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,900
Wait.

267
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,900
Hurry up.

268
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Let's go.

269
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
You bastards!

270
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
Take care of these criminals right now!

271
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
You bastards!

272
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
Do you like it?

273
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,900
Do you like this?

274
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
You're really good.

275
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,900
This is a piece of land from Naju.

276
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,900
It's not as expensive as the piece of land that came in from the government.

277
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,900
Come on!

278
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Break them all down!

279
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Yes!

280
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
Stop!

281
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
Stop!

282
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,900
What are you doing?

283
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,900
What kind of behavior is this in other people's land?

284
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Did you see those two bastards?

285
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,900
They almost got a big curse after coming here in blood.

286
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,900
You are the travel agent of that rumor.

287
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
Yes.

288
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,900
You have stopped the secret supply to our seven victims.

289
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Get the person who will eat that curse right now!

290
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,900
I can't.

291
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,900
Do you really want to taste the hot taste?

292
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
Guys!

293
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
Yes!

294
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Yes!

295
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,900
Everyone, step on the ground.

296
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,900
How long will it take for our Sang Gil Taek to be exempted?

297
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Step on the ground!

298
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,900
Everyone, step on the ground!

299
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,900
You bitch!

300
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,900
Take the sword from the things that are stored in the storage of the castle.

301
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,900
If you do that, I will give you another 200.

302
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Even if you run into someone near you, you will not be able to doubt the life you have been taught in the castle.

303
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,900
Do you not know that the country is banning the war?

304
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,900
The act you have failed to do is illegal.

305
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,900
But how can you come to the palace and be exempted from the rightful rights?

306
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
Sir.

307
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,900
I am the king of the palace.

308
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
I am the king of the palace.

309
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
I am the king of the palace.

310
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,900
How can you come to the palace and be exempted from the rightful rights?

311
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
Sir.

312
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,900
May I say something?

313
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,900
I was surprised that the creation was happening.

314
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,900
But as you can see, the things are not damaged and there is no damage.

315
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,900
So, can you just let them go?

316
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,900
Look.

317
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,900
Your actions are legal and you should be punished.

318
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
I will let you go at least once.

319
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,900
But, you should not do this again.

320
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,900
I almost got a big punishment.

321
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,900
I am sorry.

322
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,900
I do not know how to thank you.

323
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,900
I would like to kill you.

324
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
Kill me?

325
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
I am a official.

326
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,900
Of course I would like to do it.

327
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,900
But,

328
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,900
can I ask you a favor?

329
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
I am sorry.

330
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Who are you?

331
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Catch him!

332
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
Keep running!

333
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Keep running!

334
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Keep running!

335
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,900
The scent is really good.

336
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,900
I can't believe I am tasting the tea that I have been drinking.

337
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Would you like another cup?

338
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,900
No, I have to go to the police station again.

339
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,900
I heard that you can only get the tea from the big shop.

340
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:52,900
I am grateful that you let me kill you with this precious tea.

341
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,900
What are you saying?

342
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,900
I should be the one to thank you.

343
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,900
Would you like to taste the tea?

344
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,900
Mother!

345
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,900
I am sorry!

346
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,900
What is wrong with you?

347
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,900
Young Master! Young Master!

348
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,900
What?

349
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,900
Why did you...

350
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,900
Young Master was dragged into the coffin.

351
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
What is it?

352
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,900
Young Master,

353
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,680
the

354
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,900
young master stole a knife.

355
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,900
He went to the police.

356
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,900
I will ask you again.

357
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,900
How did you get the famous sword?

358
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,900
Did you not commit any sin?

359
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,900
I said that I did not commit any sin.

360
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,900
If you are truly innocent, you have no reason to run away.

361
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,900
Please believe me.

362
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,900
It is true that I entered the water valley, but the sword...

363
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
I am lucky that it is you.

00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
I did not even touch the sword.

366
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,900
Then what happened in the water valley?

367
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,900
I am asking you what happened.

368
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:05,900
I was going to not commit any sin,

369
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,900
but if I do not commit any sin,

370
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,900
I will be sentenced to life imprisonment.

371
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,900
The King of Peking

372
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,900
You are so grateful.

373
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,900
I should be thankful to you.

374
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,900
You gave me that precious sword.

375
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,900
What sword?

376
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,900
When I was a student,

377
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,900
a scholar learned how to use the sword to make a wish.

378
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,900
What use is that?

379
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,900
I am using dust in the back of my wish.

380
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,900
If you take it and use it for a good cause,

381
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,900
wouldn't that be better?

382
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,900
What are you going to do with that young man?

383
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,900
After I make a good deal of money,

384
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,900
I will be able to make a wish.

385
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,900
You did the right thing.

386
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:44,900
You will not have to worry about anything.

387
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,900
I understand.

388
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,900
The King of Peking

389
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,900
You have suffered a lot.

390
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,900
Then will the King of Peking find out about the right to the military?

391
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,900
What can I say?

392
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,900
Go.

393
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,900
This tea...

394
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,900
When I drink it,

395
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:44,900
I feel like I have become the emperor of the country.

396
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,900
Then I will become the emperor.

397
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,900
I see.

398
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,900
Why are you laughing alone?

399
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,900
Nothing.

400
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,900
Thank you for giving me a place like this.

401
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,900
You must be very sad about something unexpected.

402
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,900
This is a small sin that everyone has taught their children wrongly.

403
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,900
I have no one to feel sorry for.

404
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,900
This is a very special feeling.

405
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,900
By the way, when you were caught,

406
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,900
did the child have the Yodo's name card?

407
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,900
No, he didn't have the security card.

408
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,900
But after I checked the reason,

409
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,900
the sword disappeared from the safe.

410
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,900
If you didn't have the security card when you were caught,

411
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,900
you wouldn't have any evidence.

412
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,900
Yes, I'd say I would.

413
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,900
But are youははthe problem here now?

414
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Stop.

415
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,900
I am not trying to abuse my own child.

416
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,900
You do not trust your own child?

417
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,900
Sergeant Han,

418
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,100
you's the court affair.

419
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,900
How can you entrust it to me?

420
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:46,900
I am already hurt by the fact that I am involved in this evil business.

421
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,900
Please give me a chance to repent.

422
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Does anyone who knows the law of the country say that?

423
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,900
I do.

424
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Isn't it the right thing to do to prevent the injustice of one person?

425
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,900
I have also been through this with the help of the General.

426
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,900
I can't commit a sin without evidence.

427
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,900
Please trust me and let me go.

428
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,900
I beg you.

429
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Please forgive me.

430
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,900
Please forgive me.

431
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,900
Father.

432
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Father.

433
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,900
How come you don't say anything?

434
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,900
Why don't you even tell me why you are a soldier?

435
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Get out of here!

436
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,900
My sin is deep.

437
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,900
How can you make me, your ancestor, to commit a sin?

438
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,900
I was going to steal it.

439
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,900
I was going to steal it.

440
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Do you understand?

441
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,900
I was going to steal that knife.

442
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Yes.

443
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,900
But I couldn't steal it.

444
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
Because of your thoughts.

445
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,900
I couldn't do that as your ancestor, Choi Guk-sun.

446
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,900
But it is true that I had such a bad heart.

447
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
Do you know why?

448
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,900
I hate poverty.

449
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,900
How can you endure the pain of being a soldier just for the honor of your family?

450
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,900
How can you think that the success of your ancestors is more important than the food you eat?

451
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:21,900
How can you suffer from the hardship of being a soldier every day and be afraid of your mother's weak hand?

452
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,900
As the head of the family, how can you turn away from all this?

453
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,900
Get up!

454
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,900
I can't throw it anymore.

455
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,900
I can't throw it anymore.

456
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
Father,

457
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,900
son,

458
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,900
come back.

459
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,900
I will bring mother back safely.

460
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,900
Please be strong until then.

461
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,900
Young Master!

462
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,900
I will follow you.

463
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,900
Okay, let's go.

464
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,900
What is this?

465
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,900
What is real?

466
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,500
It looks like a

467
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,900
It is difficult to see with your eyes.

468
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,900
This is real and this is fake.

469
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,900
I made this fake dough with dried pork.

470
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,900
It looks like a real dough.

471
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,900
How much is this?

472
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,900
It is twice the weight of a real dough.

473
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,900
This is a very good business.

474
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,900
I will give you money.

475
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,900
I will give you a lot of money.

476
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,900
But,

477
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,900
it is three times seven.

478
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,900
Do you understand?

479
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,900
Write it down.

480
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,900
You are three times three.

481
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,900
Of course.

482
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,900
Thank you.

483
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,900
I will write it down.

484
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,900
Are you not eating?

485
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,900
No, you eat this.

486
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,900
I came to Hanyang,

487
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,900
but I don't know what to do to make money.

488
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,900
I don't have money right now.

489
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,900
Here.

490
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,900
What is this?

491
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,900
No.

492
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,900
My mother gave it to me.

493
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,900
Mother?

494
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,900
Yes, she told the master of Hanyang

495
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:16,900
that she ordered the last waste.

496
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,900
There is fake dough in the market?

497
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,900
Yes.

498
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,900
It is distributed as the center of the failure.

499
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,900
The price of the dough is falling to the bottom.

500
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,900
There is a rumor that there is a fake dough.

501
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,900
The price is decreasing.

502
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,900
How much is the dough we brought?

503
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,900
Hanyang bought it.

504
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,900
It is three times three.

505
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,900
How much loss would it cause if we sold it now?

506
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,900
About 2,500.

507
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,900
If the dough is frozen, it is easy to deteriorate.

508
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:22,900
If it is dry, it is less valuable.

509
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,900
If we don't do something about it, it will be a big disaster.

510
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,900
Please leave the dough to me.

511
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,900
Hanyang, it is not something you can say so hastily.

512
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,900
How could you buy it so hard?

513
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,900
Even if we sell the dough, it is hard to make up for the loss.

514
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,900
I know.

515
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,900
I am telling you based on my information.

516
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,900
Please let me take responsibility for the trade.

517
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,900
First, we will look at the situation.

518
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,900
Then we will discuss it again.

519
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,900
Good bye.

520
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,900
Do you need anything?

521
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,900
No.

522
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,900
Look.

523
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:50,900
I know that the condition is very good.

524
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,900
Can you give me a lot of money?

525
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,900
Do you know Wu-Hwang?

526
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,900
Follow me.

527
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,900
This is Wu-Hwang.

528
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,900
It is a ten thousand bottle of medicine.

529
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,900
If you buy something expensive,

530
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,900
you will have to pay a lot of money.

531
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,900
Is it worth the money?

532
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,900
It is so hard to get it.

533
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:37,900
Actually, my mother passed away two days ago.

534
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,900
I have to get the money and go home.

535
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,900
If I don't do something about it, I will be in trouble.

536
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,900
You have only 50 bottles.

537
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,900
How much do you want?

538
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,900
It is very precious.

539
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,900
It is very expensive.

540
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,900
I will pay you.

541
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,900
Isn't it better to give it to the person who gave it to you?

542
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,900
I think it is important to bring your mother to her last.

543
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,900
I don't have money.

544
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,900
Take it.

545
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,900
I can't afford to pay the money.

546
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:41,900
But this is the medicine.

547
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,900
Don't buy it.

548
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,900
I only have the thick one.

549
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,900
I'm the same as you.

550
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,900
I won't lie to you.

551
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,900
Stop it.

552
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,900
I have the blue one.

553
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,900
What are you doing?

554
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:58,900
Give it to me.

555
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,900
I will buy it.

556
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,900
It is fake.

557
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,900
The medicine is fake.

558
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,900
I will pay you.

559
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,900
I will pay you.

560
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,900
I will solve the fake medicine.

561
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,900
I feel like I'm going to believe it.

562
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,900
Is my father involved in the fake medicine?

563
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,900
Answer me.

564
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,900
How did you meet?

565
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,900
Get out of the way.

566
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,900
Did he tell you to do it?

567
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,900
You have to get rid of the hand that is in the mouth of the thief.

568
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,900
If you want to get something, you have to make a promise.

569
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,900
What do you want?

570
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,900
I will get the hand of the Han River.

571
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,900
I don't want to avoid the anesthesia of the guards.

572
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,900
Of course.

573
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,900
Do as I say.

574
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,900
We are now one body.

575
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,900
You guys go with this boat.

576
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,900
I will go with this boat.
