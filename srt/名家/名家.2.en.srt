1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Doryunji! Doryunji!

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Doryunji!

3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Dany! Run! Hurry!

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Doryunji!

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Doryunji!

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Doryunji!

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Doryunji!

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Doryunji!

9
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Doryunji!

10
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Doryunji!

11
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You have to wake her up before she wakes up.

12
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I know.

13
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
She's got a disability.

14
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She's got a problem with my life.

15
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't worry.

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I know you're not a good person.

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll take good care of her.

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Then, I'll leave you to it.

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay.

20
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's a big problem!

21
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Come out!

22
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's a big problem!

23
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Come out!

24
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a big problem!

25
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's going on?

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Doryunji!

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Doryunji!

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Go up the mountain and look for her.

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, sir!

30
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Doryunji!

31
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Sir, have some water and calm down.

32
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's delicious.

33
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I feel so good these days.

34
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The next lucky child is you.

35
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Aomansingpujing Entertainment Center 931 931.com

36
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, my dear Kuk-sun.

37
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I can't do it.

38
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I have to go find Kuk-sun.

39
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, my!

40
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Where are you going?

41
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What's the point of finding a young master in the city?

42
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You'll find him soon.

43
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, Kuk-sun.

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Oh, my dear Kuk-sun.

45
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're going to give me money and a house in my house?

46
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're a real bastard.

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're not a good person.

48
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You did a good job.

49
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll give you a hand.

50
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How much did you pay me?

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You're going to pay me a day?

52
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's a reward.

53
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a reward for what I did.

54
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Doryunji!

55
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Doryunji!

56
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Doryunji!

57
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Doryunji!

58
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Doryunji!

59
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Doryunji!

60
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Doryunji!

61
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Doryunji!

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Doryunji!

63
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Where are you?

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Where are you?

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Doryunji!

66
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Doryunji!

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Doryunji!

68
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Doryunji!

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But are you serious?

70
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
What will come of women's mistakes?

71
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,220
Oh!

72
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,540
Is that you?

73
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,580
You're smarter than I thought

74
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:45,100
Hm-m, hm-m

75
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,940
Ahhhhh

76
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,240
Oh it's a dead end

77
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,820
Why why

78
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Is it that face

79
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,100
Looking up, looking down

80
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,020
It's the walk down path

81
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,380
From the point you're in

82
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,460
The angle

83
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,140
Oh please

84
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:14,140
You want to leave my property to the Korol?

85
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,140
Master! Master!

86
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,140
Master! Master!

87
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,140
Master!

88
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,140
Master!

89
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,140
What is going on?

90
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Master is here!

91
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
Master!

92
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,140
Master!

93
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Master!

94
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,140
Master!

95
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,140
He tried to harm you, didn't he?

96
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,140
That's why I stopped him!

97
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,140
This is not the time to be like this!

98
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,140
Let's go and kill that master!

99
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,140
Master!

100
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,140
Master!

101
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
Let's go and kill that master!

102
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,140
Master!

103
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,140
If I hadn't done anything wrong, I would have been here!

104
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,140
Master!

105
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,140
I would have killed him!

106
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,140
Master!

107
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,140
Master!

108
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Koksun!

109
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,140
Master!

110
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,140
Master!

111
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,140
Mother!

112
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,140
Yes, yes, yes...

113
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,140
Master!

114
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,140
Welcome!

115
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,140
Where have you been?

116
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,140
Hey, you've been here a lot.

117
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,140
I know.

118
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,140
I didn't buy anything.

119
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:36,260
I even got a big

120
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,140
I'm not going to leave you.

121
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,140
I'm not going to leave you.

122
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
That's a big deal.

123
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,140
You're not going to leave me.

124
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,140
What are you talking about?

125
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,140
It's done.

126
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,140
I'm going to go and get some food.

127
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
Thank you.

128
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,140
Is everything okay in the station?

129
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
Yes.

130
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,140
I didn't know my grandson was in such a big trouble.

131
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,140
It's all my fault.

132
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,140
That's why I came here.

133
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,140
I can't stand this anymore.

134
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,140
If you hadn't saved him,

135
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,140
wouldn't you have saved him?

136
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,140
I couldn't save him either.

137
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,140
I heard that they're going to do it.

138
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,140
They're going to gather in the neighborhood.

139
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,140
Father asked for it.

140
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,140
Why don't we understand that?

141
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,140
But if it's too much, it's a problem.

142
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,140
Even the other people are nervous.

143
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,140
Why don't you open the country like the Supreme Commander?

144
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,140
I'm just saying.

145
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Who knows when those refugees will change?

146
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,140
Do you think we should do that as people?

147
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,140
I heard that the old saying goes,

148
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,140
the old times make the thieves.

149
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,140
We're not beggars. Why do we have to be treated like this?

150
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,140
Why do we have to be treated like this?

151
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
Why do we have to be treated like this?

152
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,140
We can't do business even if we have a job.

153
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,140
Are you worried that they'll take our food?

154
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,140
If we keep talking about this, we'll starve to death.

155
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,140
Why don't we go to the government office and talk about our situation?

156
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
Go to the government office?

157
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Don't say that.

158
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,140
Who is the one who treats us like this?

159
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,140
Did you not see the beggars making a house in the village?

160
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,140
They didn't steal anything, but they framed us and we got beaten up.

161
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,140
It's sad to see blood on the barrel.

162
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm not going to do it.

163
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:45,140
You're rich, but you're always dressed up and dressed up.

164
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:51,140
You always look so good.

165
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,140
Why are you doing this?

166
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,140
The thread is almost gone.

167
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,140
Bandol.

168
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,140
Mother, come here.

169
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,140
Did you bring Dan and go to the market and buy some thread?

170
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,140
You have to know the way, so teach him slowly.

171
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,140
Yes, mother. Let's go.

172
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,140
I want to go with you.

173
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,140
I was in a hurry because I was sick.

174
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
I want to get some fresh air.

175
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,140
Thank you.

176
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,140
Are you going to buy a house?

177
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Here it is.

178
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,140
Have you seen this child?

179
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,140
I saw it.

180
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,140
It's a little scary.

181
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
Have you seen it?

182
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,140
It's full of blood.

183
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,140
I thought it was a dog.

184
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
I'm going to find a person.

185
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
I know.

186
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,140
I'm going to find a person.

187
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
Dan.

188
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Let's go.

189
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
Thank you for that time.

190
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,140
I was safe thanks to you.

191
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,140
No, that's not right.

192
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,140
That's not right.

193
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Let go of me.

194
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,140
It was good when I got rice.

195
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,140
You're going to get hurt.

196
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,140
Now, I'm going to get a lot of rice.

197
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,140
If you don't bring me the rice, I'll get it.

198
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140
What are you doing?

199
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,140
How can you take the money from the poor people?

200
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,140
It's not like that.

201
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,140
Shut up.

202
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,140
I'm young.

203
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,140
I can't even handle this situation.

204
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,140
It's my family's business.

205
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,140
Where do you sell it?

206
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,140
Give the money back to the poor people.

207
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,140
I saved my life before.

208
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
I won't do it again.

209
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,140
I'm sorry.

210
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
If you do this again,

211
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,140
I'll have to stop.

212
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Thank you.

213
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,140
Thank you.

214
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,140
Thank you for what?

215
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,140
Did you save your life?

216
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,140
Isn't that the young master?

217
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,140
He's feeding us.

218
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,140
What are you doing?

219
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,140
Did you say that?

220
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,140
Then it's porridge.

221
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,140
It's porridge.

222
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,140
He's feeding us.

223
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,140
He's doing this to save us.

224
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,140
Do you think we're rich?

225
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,140
Young master.

226
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,140
So you're doing this to save us?

227
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,140
You must have everything you need.

228
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,140
It's not all.

229
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,140
You're not going to feed us until the end of the world.

230
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,140
You're not going to treat us like beggars.

231
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,140
Is that right?

232
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,140
No.

233
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,140
If you don't want to be treated like beggars,

234
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,140
you can take it from us.

235
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
What do you mean?

236
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,140
You're going to take it from us?

237
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,140
You're so strange.

238
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,140
How can you say that?

239
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,140
Where is this girl?

240
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,140
Young master!

241
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,140
She's in trouble.

242
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,140
Makdoong is in trouble.

243
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,140
Makdoong?

244
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,140
What's going on?

245
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,140
Makdoong's father.

246
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Makdoong is in trouble.

247
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
Makdoong is going to die.

248
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,140
Makdoong is going to die.

249
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,140
What are you talking about?

250
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
Makdoong, open your eyes.

251
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,140
I think she's having a stroke.

252
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,140
She's sweating.

253
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,140
Her hands and feet are cold.

254
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,140
She's probably having a stroke.

255
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,140
Is it a disease?

256
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
I've seen it before.

257
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,140
It's a medicine from our family.

258
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,140
You'll hear it.

259
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,140
If you can treat her,

260
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,140
it will help her cool down.

261
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,140
Where did you get the barley?

262
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
I sent it to the house.

263
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,140
Thank you so much.

264
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,140
Thank you.

265
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,140
Young master!

266
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,140
Young master!

267
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Please forget what you said earlier.

268
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,140
We're all human beings.

269
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
How can we not know that?

270
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,140
I just wanted to die for a few days

271
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,140
because I was so tired of living in my hometown.

272
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
People and water are the same.

273
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,140
It's been two days since I've been eating.

274
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,140
I don't think I can pay for the theft.

275
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,140
I'm just a beast.

276
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,140
Please think that I've lost my mind.

277
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,140
I understand.

278
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,140
Young master!

280
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,140
What's going on?

281
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
I...

282
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,140
Young master,

283
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,140
I don't know what's going on.

284
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,140
Dear son,

285
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,140
I was going to be a monk in the palace

286
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
after receiving your teaching,

287
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,140
but you were demoted to the South Korean mountain.

288
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,140
The South Korean mountain is now under the control of the enemy.

289
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Your wife is in danger.

290
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,140
How can an old priest help me?

291
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,140
I'm going to be a monk

292
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,140
and I'm going to go to the South Korean mountain

293
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,140
to save my wife.

294
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,140
Do you have any documents?

295
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
Yes.

296
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,140
I'm going to write a letter.

297
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,140
Please make sure that the old priest

298
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,140
doesn't get upset until the new priest is appointed.

299
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,140
Please.

300
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,140
I don't know if I should ask you

301
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,140
about your sudden visit.

302
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,140
I'm going back to my hometown to prepare the honey.

303
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,140
I should go to the temple where your father is.

304
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
If you're not wrong,

305
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,140
I have a good idea.

306
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,140
Let's test it.

307
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,140
Hello.

308
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,140
What is it?

309
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,140
What is it?

310
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,140
The young priest told me to go to the mountain with him.

311
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,140
Why the mountain?

312
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,140
The young priest was being treated like a mother

313
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,140
and he was trying to get rid of that evil man.

314
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,140
He said he was going to be a monk in the forest.

315
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,140
He said he was going to find him and send him to the temple.

316
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,140
Let's go.

317
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,140
What happened to the kids?

318
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
What happened to the kids?

319
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,140
Is this what you're looking for?

320
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
What is it?

321
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:56,140
This is the real culprit who tried to harm our young priest.

322
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,140
He's not the one who did it.

323
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,140
He's not the one who did it.

324
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,140
How could he do that?

325
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,140
We have to get rid of him.

326
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,140
That's right.

327
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
He's a monk.

328
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,140
We have to get rid of him.

329
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
No! Stop!

330
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Don't cut him!

331
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,140
Father! Father!

332
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,140
Father!

333
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,140
Father!

334
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,140
Stop!

335
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,140
Stop it!

336
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
Stop it, Hanhaedo!

337
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,140
Ok Seon!

338
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,140
Father!

339
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,140
You're so nervous!

340
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,140
How could you do such a cruel thing?

341
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,140
As the family's son, you're going to get rid of the monk.

342
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,140
How could you do such a cruel thing?

343
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,140
It's unfair.

344
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,140
It's a misunderstanding, sir.

345
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,140
How can it be a misunderstanding?

346
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,140
If he's not the real culprit,

347
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,140
why did he have to find something there?

348
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,140
Also,

349
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,140
this coffin is definitely the culprit's.

350
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,140
But you don't have a single coffin.

351
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:47,140
Is all of this a coincidence?

352
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,140
Please kill me, sir.

353
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,140
I'm begging you.

354
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:06,140
It's true that I kidnapped you.

355
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,140
But I had no choice.

356
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,140
I had to get some money for the coffin.

357
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,140
I did help you to get some money.

358
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:31,140
But I fought with my life to get you.

359
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,140
I swear by God,

360
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,140
I saved your life.

361
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,140
Shut up!

362
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,140
I will find your crime in Hanhaedo.

363
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,140
Take him to the temple.

364
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,140
Yes, sir.

365
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,140
I will find your crime in Hanhaedo.

366
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,140
After the war, the south side failed.

367
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,140
The people fled to the southern mountains.

368
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,140
The south side was surrounded by 120,000 soldiers.

369
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,140
To save the king,

370
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:33,140
the soldiers started to fight against each other.

371
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,140
I'm Choi Jin-ri, the commander of the princess.

372
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,140
How did you get here?

373
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,140
I came to see you.

374
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,140
Please sit down.

375
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,140
You came all the way here.

376
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,140
Just go back.

377
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,140
It's not good for the country.

378
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,140
It will be difficult to handle the war.

379
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,140
If I had to go back, I wouldn't have come.

380
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:22,140
I suffered a lot of war because of my young age.

381
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,140
I saw the death of many young people.

382
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:31,140
I'm better than them.

383
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,140
Tae-gang.

384
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Tae-gang.

385
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,140
Mother.

386
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Father.

387
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,140
Mother.

388
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,140
Father.

389
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,140
Mother.

390
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,140
Father.

391
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,140
Please save my father.

392
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,140
I have sinned.

393
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,140
I have only one father.

394
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,140
If I die, I will die for you.

395
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,140
Please save my father.

396
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,140
Please save my father.

397
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:53,140
Your father is still unforgivable.

398
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:03,140
But I thought of you as my comrade, not as my son.

399
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,140
You should be able to grant your comrade a wish for the rest of your life.

400
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,140
Take it.

401
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,140
I will die for you.

402
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,140
Father.

403
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,140
Where are you?

404
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,140
Father.

405
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,140
Let's go, father.

406
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,140
Let's go.

407
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Let's go.

408
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Look.

409
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:37,140
I will make you regret what you did to me today.

410
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,140
I will.

411
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,140
I will.

412
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,140
I will.

413
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,140
I will sell the land.

414
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
What?

415
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,140
Father.

416
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,140
Did you see that?

417
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,140
How could this happen?

418
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,140
I'm sorry to have caused you so much trouble.

419
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,140
But please think of it as a child's play.

420
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:08,140
I don't know if your father's wish to be a doctor will come true.

421
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
I need you to send me a military supply.

422
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,140
Who doesn't know that?

423
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:21,140
But you are selling the land at a price that is not even a grain of rice.

424
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
What kind of a way is this?

425
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:29,140
Father, this land was given to us by the country during the war.

426
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,140
We have been living on it for a long time.

427
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,140
Now we have to return it to the country as you wish.

428
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Return it!

429
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,140
You will face your father after you have killed him.

430
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
Father!

431
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,140
Father!

432
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,140
Father!

433
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,140
Father!

434
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Father!

435
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,140
Welcome.

436
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
Welcome.

437
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,140
I'm looking for a girl who is about 10 years old.

438
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,140
Have you seen her?

439
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,140
She is a slave of a man named Shim Won Gyo.

440
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,140
Shim Won Gyo?

441
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,140
Shim Won Gyo?

442
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,140
Shim Won Gyo?

443
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,140
I've heard of her name before.

444
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:44,140
But why are there so many people looking for a girl who is about 10 years old?

445
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,140
Then, who else was looking for her?

446
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,140
Hey!

447
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,140
Where did she go?

448
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,140
She was just over there.

449
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,140
Oh my.

450
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,140
Oh my.

451
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,140
What is this?

452
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
Why are you looking for her?

453
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,140
I was just looking for her.

454
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:33,140
Tell me everything you know about her.

455
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,140
I don't know anything.

456
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,140
I'm serious.

457
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,140
I won't ask you why you are looking for her.

458
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,140
Father, are you okay?

459
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:04,140
Yes, I'm fine.

460
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
I can't.

461
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,140
The fever is too high.

462
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,140
I'll call the doctor.

463
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,140
No, Father.

464
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,140
No, you can't.

465
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,140
This is what Mother left for me.

466
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,140
Father is more important now.

467
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,140
No, Father!

468
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,140
No, Father!

469
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,140
Miss, stop.

470
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:49,140
I'll take you to the doctor.

471
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
It's dangerous here.

472
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,140
You have to get out of here.

473
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,140
Stop!

474
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,140
Stop!

475
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,140
Who is this woman?

476
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,140
There's something we can't tell you.

477
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,140
We'll leave tonight by boat.

478
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:27,140
Tell your mother that she will never forget you.

479
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
And...

480
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:38,140
Tell Mr. Gukseon that...

481
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,140
Thank you for everything.

482
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Hurry up!

483
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,140
What?

484
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,140
Did I get possessed?

485
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,140
Who is it?

486
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,140
Who is it?

487
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,140
Who are you?

488
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,140
Who are you?

489
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,140
What are you doing here?

490
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,140
What's going on at the house of the thief?

491
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,140
We sent him to the police.

492
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:44,140
I heard that there's a woman named Shim Wonkyo in this house.

493
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,140
Give her away right now.

494
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,140
She's a sinner.

495
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,140
Give her away!

496
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,140
Young Master.

497
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,140
What?

498
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,140
I have something to tell you.

499
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
What?

500
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,140
Dan is...

501
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,140
What about Dan?

502
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,140
What did Dan do?

503
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,140
It's okay.

504
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,140
It's okay.

505
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,140
Hurry up!

506
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,140
Hurry up!

507
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,140
Young Master.

508
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
Please give me a chance.

509
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,140
I'm getting a bad feeling.

510
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,140
Father.

511
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,140
Young Master.

512
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,140
I can't take it anymore.

513
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Please leave me alone.

514
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,140
No!

515
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,140
Father, please hold on a little longer.

516
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,140
Just a little more.

517
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,140
Just a little more.

518
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,140
Just go.

519
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,140
Just a little more.

520
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,140
Just a little more.

521
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,140
Just a little more.

522
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,140
Young Master.

523
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,140
Please.

524
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,140
Young Master.

525
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,140
Please.

526
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,140
Young Master.

527
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,140
I'm sorry.

528
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,140
Please take care of her.

529
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,140
Please leave.

530
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,140
No!

531
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,140
Please leave.

532
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,140
Father, please.

533
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,140
Father!

534
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,140
Father!

535
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,140
Father!

536
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,140
No!

537
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,140
No!

538
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,140
No!

539
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,140
Father!

540
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,140
Father!

541
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,140
Father!

542
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,140
No!

543
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,140
Father!

544
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,140
Father!

545
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,140
Father!

546
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:33,140
Now, you won't be ashamed to go to hell and learn from your father.

547
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:40,140
Lady, you called me father.

548
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,140
I have no regrets even if I die.

549
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:56,140
You were a precious being to me in this world, more than my bloodline.

550
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,140
Father!

551
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,140
Father!

552
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,140
Father!

553
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:38,140
I thought I could see you for a long time.

554
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,140
Dany...

555
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,140
Father!

556
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,140
You woke up early.

557
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,140
You should have slept more.

558
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,140
Today's fight will not be easy.

559
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:31,140
You have to fight against 8,000 soldiers.

560
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:42,140
I will fight with all my might, but you must take care of yourself.

561
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,140
What do you mean?

562
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:55,140
Ok-dong, you must live and go back to your hometown.

563
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,140
Mother!

564
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,140
Father!

565
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:23,140
The 14th year of the Inju dynasty, the 20th year of the Byungja dynasty.

566
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:32,140
In the village 40 miles from the south, the soldiers who went to save the king are fighting with the Cheongdan Army.

567
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,140
It's a trap!

568
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,140
The rear of the ship has collapsed!

569
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,140
The Japanese army's assault force has attacked the rear!

570
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,140
How much longer?

571
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,140
7,000 is a good chance!

572
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,140
Father!

573
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,140
Father!

574
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,140
Are you okay?

575
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,140
I'm fine.

576
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,140
Father!

577
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,140
Are you okay?

578
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,140
Go back!

579
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,140
I can't!

580
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,140
It's an order!

581
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,140
Take the rest of the soldiers and leave the country!

582
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,140
Father!

583
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,140
It's an order!

584
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,140
It's the last order I give you!

585
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,140
Leave the country!

586
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,140
Leave the country!

587
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,140
Leave the country!

588
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,140
I told you to go back!

589
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,140
I told you to go back!

590
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,140
I told you to go back!

591
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,140
You're a liar!

592
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,140
You're a liar!

593
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,140
Father!

594
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,140
Father!

595
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:07,140
In the battle of Heomcheon, Choi Jil-ri, the general's son, fought against the Cheongdan Army.

596
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,140
He was 69 years old.

597
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:18,140
Choi Jil-ri's son, Ok-dong, was with him until the end.

598
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,140
In the end, the battle of Heomcheon was defeated.

599
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:28,140
The king of the South Korean mountains was unable to survive.

600
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,140
Most of the 8,000 Korean soldiers died.

601
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:37,140
The blood of the soldiers was flowing through the mountains.

602
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:41,140
The blood of the soldiers was flowing through the mountains.

603
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,140
The blood of the soldiers was flowing through the mountains.

604
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:56,140
Choi Jil-ri was killed by the enemy.

605
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,140
He was killed by the enemy.

606
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,140
When the soldiers were fighting in Heomcheon,

607
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:06,140
there was no money left in his house.

608
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:31,140
Father, please tell Kuk-sun about this.

609
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:43,140
Tell Kuk-sun when he grows up.

610
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:51,140
When Kuk-sun grows up, tell him.

611
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,140
When you live,

612
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:59,140
you will have to face difficulties and difficulties.

613
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:02,140
Tell him to open the door.

614
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:07,140
Father, why are you doing this now?

615
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:12,140
I don't know what to do tomorrow.

616
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:15,140
I am 69 years old.

617
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,140
I am leaving my hometown and my family.

618
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:22,140
I am leaving my hometown and my family.

619
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:28,140
Until I come back, you take care of it.

620
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:44,140
Father, you went that way without fear, didn't you?

621
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:49,140
I will live like my grandfather.

622
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:54,140
I am the grandson of my grandfather, Kuk-sun.

623
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:19,140
I am the grandson of my grandfather, Kuk-sun.

624
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:24,140
I am the grandson of my grandfather, Kuk-sun.

625
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:29,140
I am the grandson of my grandfather, Kuk-sun.

626
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:34,140
I am the grandson of my grandfather, Kuk-sun.

627
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:39,140
I am the grandson of my grandfather, Kuk-sun.

628
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:44,140
The End

629
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,140
Let go of me!

630
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,140
Master!

631
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,140
Master!

632
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,140
Are you okay?

633
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,140
Master, are you okay?

634
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,140
I should have brought two.

635
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,140
Get up!

636
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,140
Give me some seaweed.

637
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,140
What are you guys doing?

638
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,140
I am crazy to pay for the seaweed you gave me today.

639
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,140
Are you out of your mind?

640
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,140
I am sorry.

641
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,140
How dare you!

642
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,140
Be good.

643
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,140
If you do this again, I will cut you off.

644
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,140
Okay. I am sorry.

645
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,140
If you do this again, I will kill you.

646
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,140
How dare you!

647
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,140
Enough.

648
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:49,140
I can't believe it.

649
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,140
You are not even a day old.

650
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,140
Why are you suffering?

651
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,140
Let's go home.

652
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,140
If you want to go, you go.

653
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,140
What are you doing?

654
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,140
What are you doing?

655
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,140
This is your medicine.

656
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,140
I am sorry.

657
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,140
I can't believe it.

658
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,140
You are not going to get better with just a few shots.

659
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:08,140
You guys are not allowed to do this.

660
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,140
You should have brought the yellow light.

661
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,140
What is this?

662
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,140
Do you want to trade with me?

663
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:21,140
There are times when you have to close your eyes.

664
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,140
Do you not know that the law is not in place in this country?

665
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,140
You are going to own the Korean market.

666
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,140
You are not going to get rid of your sins.

667
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,140
Mother, please come back.

668
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,140
I want to see you.

669
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,140
Give it to me. I will buy it.

670
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,140
That is fake.
