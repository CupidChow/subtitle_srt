00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140
The loss of his family names, the already use of his clothings and the loss of all other people he potential

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,240
are as much of an soak to me as these names!

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,300
He died in a massive three-day lockdown in cranial testing.

him.

8
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,880
I've thought about it deeply.

9
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
Then,

10
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,480
will you return the lifetime deposit rights

11
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,480
that you promised to the farmers

12
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,480
and give half of the land to the country?

13
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,480
Will you destroy the harvest

14
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,480
and get the same amount of deposit rates as the other countries?

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,980
Will you not return the land anymore

16
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,480
and will you not return the land again?

17
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,480
Only this will make you weak.

18
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,980
If you become weak and do this,

19
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,980
I will spare your life.

20
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,460
Offering remuneration

21
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,080
are you planning to

22
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,080
walk out on me right now?

23
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,780
Walk out on you?

24
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,580
I am trying to give authority to the明 getting ready.

25
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,680
A man who bullies populism

26
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,680
and else removes public practices

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,280
I've never seen anything like this.

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,280
There is no place in the world where a person lives more humanly than in a human world.

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,280
What? What is this?

31
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Mother! Mother!

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,280
I promised to let go of all the things you've done so far,

33
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,280
but you said you couldn't do that.

34
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
Yes.

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,280
How can I do that from now on?

36
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,280
You said you would send me to Hanyang.

37
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
What?

38
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,280
My father is dead.

39
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,280
You said you didn't want to save his life.

40
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Yes.

41
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
You're so stupid.

42
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,280
You're the one who's doing this.

43
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Good job.

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
There's no way that Hanyang will come.

45
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
I'll make a plan.

46
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,280
I'll make a plan and make a plan.

47
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,280
I'll make a plan and make a plan.

48
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,280
It's true that he didn't accept the offer.

49
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,280
I told you not to use me.

50
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Choi Guk-sun is over.

51
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,280
He's definitely not on the same page as Myeonghwa.

52
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,280
What more do you need?

53
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:45,280
Of course, it's obvious that the criminal family who built the country is a big deal.

54
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Oh, my God. Where is this law?

55
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,280
It's a good deal to catch a living person.

56
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
I'm not going to let a person like our country...

57
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,280
The next lucky person is you.

58
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Macau New Peking Entertainment City 931 931.com

59
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
What are you doing?

60
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Oh, my God.

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,280
What are you really going to do?

62
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,280
What do you say if you take a breath?

63
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Is there anything that changes if you take a breath?

64
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Oh, my God.

65
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
What are you doing?

66
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
What are you doing?

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Oh, my God.

68
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
What are you doing?

69
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,280
It's not something that we farmers can go together and get rid of.

70
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,280
They're playing tricks on us.

71
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,280
They played tricks on us.

72
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,280
Do you know anyone here who doesn't know that?

73
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Do you know why you're doing this?

74
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Then you have to think of a way to save it.

75
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
How do you save it?

76
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,280
The workers at the Choi family seem to be decisively determined.

77
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
How do we save it?

78
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,280
I'm just so frustrated.

79
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,280
What's the difference between sitting and taking a breath?

80
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Hong Do, don't keep getting angry.

81
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
I'll do it alone.

82
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,280
I'll do it alone.

83
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Oh, my God.

84
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Oh, my God.

85
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Oh, my God.

86
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,280
Oh, my God.

87
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
You...

88
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Are you a fool?

89
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,280
I'll accept your offer.

90
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Don't try to do what others don't do.

91
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Stop being so stubborn.

92
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm here because I'm worried.

93
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,280
What do you think will happen?

94
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,280
What's the good thing about having a false hope in the people?

95
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,280
If the people dream of a false dream, they will resist the world's orders.

96
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Then the country will be in a state of chaos.

97
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
The country will be in a state of chaos.

98
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,280
The world doesn't want you to be like this.

99
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Eventually, you will be defeated.

100
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,280
You will be defeated.

101
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Otherwise, you will die.

102
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,280
I can't do that.

103
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,280
You mean...

104
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,280
You're going to die?

105
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm afraid.

106
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,280
I'm afraid of death, too.

107
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,280
So do as I say.

108
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,280
But there's something more I'm afraid of.

109
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,280
The fact that so many people's dreams are being shattered.

110
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,280
I'm more afraid of death.

111
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Many people who were with me...

112
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,280
I had a dream of living like a human being.

113
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,280
You said it was a false dream.

114
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,280
You worked hard on the ground.

115
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,280
You raised your parents and children.

116
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,280
You can eat a lot of food.

117
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,280
How can you say it's a false dream?

118
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,280
But when I turn around...

119
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,280
When I turn around...

120
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,280
When I turn my back on them...

121
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,280
When I give up my promise with them...

122
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,280
What hope can they see in this world?

123
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm afraid of those who walked the same path with me.

124
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Yes.

125
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,280
I'm really afraid.

126
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,280
I'd rather choose death.

127
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,280
I'm afraid.

128
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Kari!

129
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Kari!

130
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Kari!

131
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,280
Kari!

132
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Kari!

133
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Kari!

134
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Kari!

135
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Kari!

136
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Kari!

137
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Kari!

138
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Kari!

139
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,280
Kari!

140
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Kari!

141
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Kari!

142
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,280
Kari!

143
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Kusuna.

144
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Mother.

145
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Please forgive me.

146
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Don't say that.

147
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,280
You are my great son.

148
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Master.

149
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Wife.

150
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Please take care of mother.

151
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,280
She is suffering.

152
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Let's go.

153
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Let's go.

154
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Let's go.

155
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Let's go.

156
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Let's go.

157
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Let's go.

158
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Let's go.

159
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Let's go.

160
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Let's go.

161
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Let's go.

162
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,280
What is this?

163
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:59,280
How can you not know the law of the nation?

164
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,280
The law of the nation?

165
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,280
The law of the nation punishes the innocent.

166
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,280
It has been eating for a long time.

167
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,280
If you want to kill me,

168
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,280
you have to send me to hell first.

169
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
You!

170
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,280
You want to be unable to do anything?

171
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,280
No, you are the cause.

172
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,280
You are the innocent people.

173
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,280
You shouldn't do this.

174
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Stop!

175
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,280
The dead person is back.

176
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,280
He is back.

177
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,280
The world has changed.

178
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,280
You should take me in.

179
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,280
There is no sin in that prison.

180
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,280
You?

181
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I am Jang Gil Taek.

182
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I am the back of the civil enemy you are looking for.

183
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,280
The dead person is back.

184
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,280
He is the innocent people.

185
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,280
You should take me in.

186
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,280
There is no sin in that prison.

187
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,280
You should take me in.

188
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,280
There is no sin in that prison.

189
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,280
You should take me in.

190
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,280
You should take me in.

191
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,280
My lord, are you awake?

192
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,280
My lord, my lord.

193
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,280
I am going to see my brother.

194
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Where are you going?

195
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,280
I am going.

196
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,280
My lord.

197
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,280
My lord.

198
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Go and see your brother.

199
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Don't worry.

200
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Thank you, my lord.

201
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,280
My lord.

202
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,280
My lord.

203
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,280
My lord.

204
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,280
My lord.

205
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Dan.

206
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,280
My lord.

207
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,280
I never thought I would see you again.

208
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,280
My lord.

209
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,280
I can't do anything to you again.

210
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I can't do anything to you again.

211
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,280
You should have been buried as a human being

212
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,280
since that day.

213
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Why did you say that, father?

214
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Don't shed tears because of me.

215
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Don't shed tears because of me.

216
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Don't be sad.

217
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Don't be sad.

218
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,280
I know you couldn't achieve your dream.

219
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,280
But you have to live your whole life.

220
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,280
It's my destiny to be born as a human being

221
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,280
and die one day.

222
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,280
I can leave now

223
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,280
without any regrets.

224
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,280
But you are the only one

225
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,280
that I care about.

226
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,280
You should live your whole life

227
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,280
without any worries.

228
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,280
I will always

229
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,280
see you again

230
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,280
in that world.

231
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,280
I will do my best, father.

232
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,280
My lord.

233
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Why are you doing

234
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,280
such a dangerous thing?

235
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Don't you know that

236
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,280
you are a criminal who kills people?

237
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,280
I will follow your father

238
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,280
to Hanyang.

239
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,280
I will protect you

240
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,280
until the end.

241
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,280
After that,

242
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,280
I will leave.

243
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Why do you have to do that?

244
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,280
I have one last

245
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,280
thing to tell you.

246
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,280
When I first met you,

247
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,280
you were a very

248
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,280
cheerful boy.

249
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,280
You were not like now.

250
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,280
You were a very good son.

251
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,280
But now,

252
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,280
you have a lot of shadows on your face.

253
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,280
I have never seen you smile.

254
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,280
All the trouble

255
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,280
that is bothering you

256
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,280
is only created in your heart.

257
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,280
I hope you will be free from the darkness

258
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,280
that is deep in your heart.

259
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,280
I will always be waiting for you.

260
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Your majesty.

261
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Your majesty.

262
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Your majesty.

263
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,280
Your majesty.

264
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,280
Your majesty.

265
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Please, take care of yourself.

266
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,280
I have nothing to say

267
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,280
but I'm sorry and thankful to you.

268
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,280
Please tell everyone that I will leave.

269
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,280
Okay.

270
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,280
I will be here for you.

271
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Yes.

272
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Miss.

273
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,280
Okay. I will leave with the ice.

274
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Stay here and let Nari get better.

275
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Yes, miss.

276
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Your majesty.

277
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,280
How is the eldest son?

278
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,280
He has been sent to Hanyang.

279
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,280
He has been sent to Hanyang.

280
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,280
The elder told me to call you.

281
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,280
It's been years since I last saw you.

282
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,280
You have been going the way

283
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,280
that you told me to go.

284
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Many people buy and sell things

285
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,280
and they are living here.

286
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,280
This is hope.

287
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,280
If this is what many people want,

288
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,280
will they be broken?

289
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Didn't the people say

290
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,280
that if you want, the sky will follow you?

291
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Why can't you change the world?

292
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,280
If you have money, you can change the world.

293
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Yes.

294
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,280
I will show you that

295
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,280
money is the only thing that can change the world.

296
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,280
If I wanted to change the world,

297
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,280
you are changing people.

298
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,280
How can people change their minds

299
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,280
so easily with money?

300
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,280
The great traitor Jang Gil-taek

301
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,280
has been accused of being a traitor

302
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,280
and has been accused of being a traitor.

303
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,280
The great traitor

304
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,280
has been accused of being a traitor

305
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,280
and has been accused of being a traitor.

306
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,280
I want to change the world with money.

307
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,280
I want to raise the power

308
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,280
to change the world with money

309
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,280
so that I can't stand this era anymore.

310
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Bang!

311
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Bang!

312
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Even though I can't go any further,

313
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,280
I will walk the path I chose

314
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,280
without regret.

315
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,280
How can there be only one way

316
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,280
to move history and lead the times?

317
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,280
You will always make a new path

318
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,280
with your own way.

319
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,280
My last wish is to have hope

320
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,280
for the world to change.

321
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,280
The path I chose

322
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,280
is the only way

323
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,280
to change the world.

324
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,280
The path I chose

325
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,280
is the only way

326
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,280
to change the world.

327
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,280
The path I chose

328
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,280
is the only way

329
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,280
to change the world.

330
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Don't give up and don't stop.

331
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,280
Keep going.

332
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,280
One step towards a better world.

333
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,280
My last wish is...

334
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,280
My last wish...

335
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,280
is...

336
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Your Highness, do you have

337
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,280
such people?

338
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
Do you have people who would risk everything

339
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,280
for you?

340
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Please wait.

341
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,280
We will protect you if anything happens.

342
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Don't give up and believe in me.

343
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
You can't give up.

344
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,280
Please wait a little longer.

345
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,280
I'm more afraid of

346
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,280
the people's dreams

347
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,280
than death.

348
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
All the trouble that is

349
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
bothering you

350
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,280
is created by your heart.

351
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,280
Please be free from the darkness

352
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
that is in your heart.

353
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,280
So that you can be at ease.

354
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
I will be waiting for you

355
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
even if it is far away.

356
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Your Highness,

357
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
I, Kim Won-il,

358
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
am asking for your death

359
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
for deceiving you

360
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
and the people.

361
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Economy –

362
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Todos –

363
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,660
the Military

364
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,280
This has been hidden films.

365
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
In the new films,

366
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
there are words written

367
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
in our chapter's

368
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,280
essay written by

369
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,280
I will not force you.

370
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,280
But, to reveal the truth with your own hands,

371
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:24,280
and to seek the benefits of those dirty people,

372
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:30,280
which path will bring you regret?

373
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Ask yourself.

374
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,280
Ask yourself.

375
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,280
I want you to decide the answer on your own.

376
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,280
I will award judge Choi Won-young who has hidden his】

377
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,280
skills of Forensics and has sold his right to succeed.

378
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,280
And, he will instances with his father Johnny Kim,

379
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,280
lovers of armies from W English and

380
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:36,280
I was also suspicious of the death of the young chief of the Chugan Daegyo.

381
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Your Majesty, the one who is responsible for all of this is the court judge, Choi Won Young.

382
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Please interrogate him and arrest him immediately.

383
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Your Majesty's case will be exposed to the public.

384
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,280
What are you doing in my house?

385
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,280
The criminal Choi Won Young is ordered to be executed!

386
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
What?

387
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Take the sentence!

388
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,280
Take the death sentence and the death sentence.

389
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Take the death sentence and the death sentence.

390
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Yes, Your Majesty!

391
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,280
No, no, no!

392
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,280
No, no, no!

393
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
No, no, no!

394
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
You bastards!

395
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Do you think I don't know who I am?

396
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
I am Choi Won Young!

397
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
The most exciting P.G. game on the line.

398
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
The mahjong is over.

399
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
The mahjong is over.

400
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
The golden queen.

401
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Search for the gold city.

402
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Summon the talented cat.

403
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
The golden captain.

404
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
The sound of the violence.

405
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
The highest can reach 50,000 times 100,000 times.

406
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
The next lucky one is you.

407
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Macau's new Peking Entertainment City 931 931.com

408
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Choi Won Young, the criminal Choi Won Young.

409
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,280
I have learned the truth through the investigation.

410
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
But I have never been able to kill you.

411
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,280
I am dying, Your Majesty.

412
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
What did you say?

413
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,280
How can you say you are out of your job?

414
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
You are out of your job.

415
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Then how about Won Young?

416
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,280
How about our Won Young?

417
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
If you keep it like this for a while,

418
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
you will become a good slave.

419
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
After about 40 days,

420
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
I think you can start to pull the strings.

421
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Yes, you did well.

422
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,280
You did well, Madam.

423
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,280
Your wife is old.

424
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
No.

425
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Master! Master!

426
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
What is it?

427
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
Oh, my goodness.

428
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,280
I should have told you this from the beginning.

429
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
What's the rush?

430
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Tell me slowly.

431
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,280
So, everything went wrong.

432
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Kim Jaechun gave the high-ranking general of Hanyang

433
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,280
a bribe, raised the fee, and did bad things.

434
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Everything went wrong.

435
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,280
The country also said that all the property was stolen.

436
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,280
And the king, the king's son-in-law,

437
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
is doing a great deal.

438
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
What?

439
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,280
How did you say that?

440
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
It's strange.

441
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Kim Wonil raised the fee

442
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,280
because he committed a crime.

443
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,280
What's going on?

444
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,280
Don't you dare touch me.

445
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Let go of me!

446
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
Let go of me!

447
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
Let go of me!

448
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
Let go of me!

449
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,280
Let go of me!

450
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
Let go of me!

451
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Let go of me!

452
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,280
Let go of me!

453
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,280
You bastard!

454
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
What are you doing?

455
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Don't talk nonsense.

456
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
You're not even human.

457
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
You want to live?

458
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
When I asked you to do that,

459
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,280
did you think I was a sister?

460
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Did you think I was a sister when we were dying?

461
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
I'm sorry.

462
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
I'm sorry.

463
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm sorry.

464
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,280
So, now we look like people to you?

465
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,280
You don't know anything about the sky!

466
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Let go of me!

467
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,280
What are you doing?

468
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
Wife.

469
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,280
I heard that Wonil is leaving Yube.

470
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
I've prepared a slave for him.

471
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,280
I hope he can leave with you.

472
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
And...

473
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,280
I'm sure that there will be no problem

474
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,280
for you two to live in Yube

475
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
and start farming.

476
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
You...

477
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,280
I still have hatred for you in my heart.

478
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,280
Maybe I can't forgive you for the rest of my life.

479
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
But...

480
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
If you weren't there,

481
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,280
I wouldn't be here either.

482
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,280
I'm a man of my own land.

483
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,280
It's hard to have my land

484
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
because of you.

485
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
I'm a man of my own land.

486
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,280
I could feel how miraculous it was

487
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,280
to get a handful of grains from that land.

488
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Thanks to you,

489
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,280
I was able to become stronger.

490
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Now that you've been released

491
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,280
and you've been given back the property,

492
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,280
wouldn't it be better for you to stay in Hanyang?

493
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
No.

494
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,280
What would I do if I lived in the cellar

495
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
as a teacher of the Yangs?

496
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,280
I will live freely.

497
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,280
I want to go to the far-off country.

498
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
So I'm thinking of doing a great deal

499
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
of business with the heaven.

500
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,280
What do you think?

501
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,280
Would you like to do the same with me?

502
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Yes.

503
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,280
I will fulfill your dream

504
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,280
that you couldn't fulfill.

505
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
Let's go.

506
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,280
I will fulfill your dream

507
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,280
that you couldn't fulfill.

508
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,280
I will fulfill your dream.

509
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,280
In the end,

510
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,280
you caught the truth.

511
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,280
As a man of the religion,

512
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,280
you only saved the truth.

513
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,280
However,

514
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,280
it's too late to regret it.

515
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
Don't say that.

516
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,280
You made the most difficult choice.

517
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
There's no way out.

518
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
I'll be going now.

519
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Please

520
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,280
be strong.

521
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
I once did something

522
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,280
that I was not ashamed of

523
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,280
in my life.

524
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
I'm a child now.

525
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Yes.

526
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,280
I have something to say

527
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,280
to all of you.

528
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
How much did you spend

529
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,280
on the collection this year?

530
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,280
About 15,000 stones.

531
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Then,

532
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,280
give them back

533
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,280
to them.

534
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,280
Listen to what I'm saying

535
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:16,280
in a clear and hours從

536
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:33,280
I'm a fee foundation

537
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,280
and do not increase the number of people who live in the house.

538
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,280
And every year, give 2000 sacks of rice

539
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,280
and feed the hungry.

540
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
No matter what happens,

541
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,280
in this house, in the middle of the city,

542
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,280
there should be no people starving to death.

543
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,280
But,

544
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
with small crops,

545
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,280
no more than 10,000 sacks will be walked.

546
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,280
Even if the land of our family

547
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,280
becomes unknowingly wide,

548
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,280
and the harvest reaches hundreds of thousands of sacks,

549
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,280
we are satisfied with 10,000 sacks.

550
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,280
The rest will be returned to the farmers

551
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,280
who have been starving for a long time.

552
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
This is the will

553
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,280
left by my grandfather.

554
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,280
I have been working hard

555
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,280
to fulfill my wish for my whole life.

556
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,280
I will remember this will

557
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,280
and I will remember this will for the rest of my life.

558
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,280
I have been working hard

559
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,280
to live a life

560
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,280
that is full of

561
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,280
and not lacking.

562
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,280
It is the heart of a person

563
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,280
to take one more sacks of rice

564
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,280
and take 100 more sacks of rice.

565
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,280
Such endless greed

566
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,280
will cause the heaven and the earth to be in chaos,

567
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,280
and the kingdom will be ruined

568
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,280
no matter how much fire is put out.

569
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,280
This will cause the whole world

570
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,280
to be in misery.

571
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,280
You should not

572
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,280
build more than 10,000 sacks,

573
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,280
but build more than 10,000 sacks

574
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,280
of human greed

575
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:58,280
that may occur.

576
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,280
You must protect

577
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,280
the Han Dynasty

578
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,280
that we have.

579
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,280
Father, I have brought what you asked for.

580
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,280
If you are going to pay back your money,

581
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,280
you will pay back

582
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,280
even if you do not have

583
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,280
this certificate of self-sufficiency.

584
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,280
If you are not going to pay back,

585
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,280
what use is this certificate?

586
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,280
You will still not be able to pay it back.

587
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,280
I have already told you

588
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280
that you must protect

589
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,280
the Han Dynasty.

590
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,280
And return the land

591
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
and the house documents

592
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,280
that you have taken as collateral.

593
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,280
Pardon?

594
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280
If you take the land

595
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,280
as collateral,

596
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,280
you will not be able to pay back

597
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,280
the money.

598
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,280
How great will the pain be?

599
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,280
It would be better to get new strength

600
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,280
and make it possible to work.

601
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,280
I will do that right away.

602
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,280
I will do that right away.

603
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,280
The destruction, the salvation,

604
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,280
the despair and the hope

605
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,280
are all in this.

606
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,280
The choice is

607
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,280
the human being.

608
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,280
The choice is

609
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,280
the human being.

610
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,280
Who will engrave the footprints

611
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,280
of the human being

612
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,280
on the road that this money

613
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,280
moves the world?

614
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,280
I want you to stay

615
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:47,280
and hug me.

616
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:54,280
Even if you are crying

617
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:01,280
because you are in pain,

618
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,280
you cannot go close

619
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:12,280
and hug me.

620
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:18,280
Forgive me.

621
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,280
The way we did not have.

622
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,280
But the brilliant history

623
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,280
of sharing that already existed

624
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,280
within us.

625
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,280
I hope that the brilliant history

626
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,280
of the great Kim Man-deok

627
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,280
will be engraved in the memory

628
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,280
of the great King.

629
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,280
Thank you for watching.
