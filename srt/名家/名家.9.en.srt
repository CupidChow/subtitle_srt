00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,240
but

2
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,200
Oui, oui.

3
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,940
Madame?

4
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,260
M-ников�bdagred kaальное?

5
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,340
Put your hand over her.

6
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,960
Uh?

7
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
Get out of the way.

8
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Father, father!

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Let me go!

10
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Father is in here!

11
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960
It's dangerous!

12
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Come out!

13
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Come out!

14
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
I'll do it.

15
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Run!

16
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Run!

17
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Run!

18
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Mother!

19
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Let me go!

20
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
Let me go!

21
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Mother!

22
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Father!

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Father!

24
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
This is what it's like.

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Mother!

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
What is this?

27
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Father!

28
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Mother!

29
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Mother!

30
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Mother!

31
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960
Mother!

32
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Mother!

33
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Mother!

34
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Mother!

35
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Cancel all freight crossings.

36
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Cancel all trade bribes in the company!

37
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Hurry up!

38
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,720
Search for the gold city

39
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,840
Summon the rich

40
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,120
Reward the captain

41
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,640
The violence is loud

42
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,960
Up to 50,000 times 100,000 times

43
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
The next lucky child is you

44
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,160
Macao New Peking Entertainment City

46
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,160
Who the hell knows me

47
00:05:42,160 --> 00:06:08,360
Sweet

48
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:38,220
It was twisted by the

49
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,220
Father, forgive me.

50
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,220
The son of a woman should not use this.

51
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,220
Let go of the four.

52
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,220
Let go of the ten.

53
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,220
Let go of the ten.

54
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,220
Let go of the ten.

55
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
You are very good.

56
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,220
A businessman should always keep his eyes and ears open.

57
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,220
As if the world is constantly changing,

58
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,220
he should not take his eyes off the world

59
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,220
because he is moving with the money.

60
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Do you understand?

61
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
Honey,

62
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,220
I will fill this big hole with wealth.

63
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,220
Then China will show the world.

64
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,220
I will show the world how to use wealth to change the world.

65
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,220
I will show that this is how to use wealth.

66
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,220
I will show that this is how to use wealth.

67
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,220
Father,

68
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,220
you said you wanted to change the world.

69
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,220
How can you go so wrongly, father?

70
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,220
Father,

71
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,220
are you sure?

72
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,220
Yes, I heard that the whole of Gategi was in a terrible situation

73
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,220
that it was difficult to get a job.

74
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,220
Really?

75
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,220
Even your father, Jang Gil-taek, was not in a good condition.

76
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,220
Jang Gil-taek's company was completely ruined.

77
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
The lyrics were deleted, and he was caught by the Japanese and

78
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,220
he quit the company.

79
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,220
That's good.

80
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,220
If you are too serious about a job with just one song,

81
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,220
you could also be a suicide.

82
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,220
What power does Jang Gil-taek have to be a businessman?

83
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,220
His company was also closed down.

84
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:47,220
But I will find out the truth about the gold master, Kim Soo-man.

85
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Yes, sir.

86
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,220
You shouldn't give secrets to others.

87
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,220
You should not leave any evidence.

88
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,220
Who are you?

89
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,220
Kim Ja-chun, you bastard!

90
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
You bastard!

91
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,220
How could you do this to me?

92
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,220
You used me to get rid of us.

93
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,220
Why do I have to send you to the hell today?

94
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Do it. Do it!

95
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,220
Do it!

96
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,220
If you call me, I will kill you.

97
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,220
I will kill you once you are born.

98
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,220
If you want to be a murderer forever,

99
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,220
do it!

100
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,220
Mr. Lee!

101
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,220
What should I do?

102
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,220
Everyone, come here!

103
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,220
Come here!

104
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,220
I told you to come here!

105
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,220
If you want to die, do it.

106
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,220
Or else, I will kill you.

107
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
I thought well.

108
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,220
I told you that even if you die, you will have a good life.

109
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,220
But you have no reason to lose your life

110
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:50,220
because of the loyalty of your great master, Yu Jung-ho.

111
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,220
I will become a good person.

112
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,220
I need someone like you.

113
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:18,220
How about you come with me and enjoy the life of Yu Jung-ho?

114
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
Oh, my!

115
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,220
You are so cute!

116
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
How surprised you are!

117
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:39,220
I just realized that I was just feeling wronged.

118
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,220
Do you know how surprised I was when you yelled at us to go away?

119
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,220
I saw it again.

120
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,220
How can you be so angry in front of a man who has a knife in his throat?

121
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
Think about it.

122
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,220
If people come and stab you,

123
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,220
you will be able to cut your eyes off and shake the knife.

124
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,220
Who will listen to you?

125
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,220
I will be the only one who will die!

126
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,220
But how can you handle a man who has a knife in his throat?

127
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:24,220
By the way, not only him, but also Choi Guk-sun should have been involved in this and ended this case.

128
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,220
That's enough.

129
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,220
How can you come to this Hanyang and do something like this?

130
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
Stop it!

131
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,220
How can you be so angry that I am your family member?

132
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220
Okay, okay.

133
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,220
Calm down.

134
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:56,220
Someday, I will make him kneel down on my arm and stab him in the head like I did to him.

135
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,220
This is all your fault.

136
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,220
You are exaggerating.

137
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
No, it's not.

138
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,220
Choi Guk-sun's escape is a premeditated crime.

139
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,220
It's a crime that shakes the country.

140
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:19,220
You have committed a crime of 100 crimes and you are the one who has been accused by the Ministry of Justice.

141
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,220
You are very good.

142
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,220
Shouldn't we arrest Jang Gil-taek's spies?

143
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
What are you talking about?

144
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,220
Jang Gil-taek died a terrible death and even the top of the building collapsed.

145
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:44,220
You shouldn't be so angry with the people because you are so angry with them.

146
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,220
But what happened to Kim Soo-man?

147
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
He has been deported to the country.

148
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,220
Good.

149
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,220
Won-il.

150
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,220
I wanted to meet you.

151
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,220
Help me.

152
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
It's not just Jang Gil-taek's parents.

153
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,220
How can you escape from Saegok?

154
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,220
What's wrong?

155
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,220
What kind of people are you?

156
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,220
How can you escape from Saegok?

157
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,220
What's wrong?

158
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,220
What kind of people are you?

159
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,220
I'm sorry.

160
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,220
Can I give you some advice?

161
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,220
There is nothing good for you to do.

162
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Jang Gil-taek, the main culprit of Saegok, has been deported.

163
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,220
What do you mean by the main culprit?

164
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,220
The chief criminal may be accused unfairly and be in danger.

165
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:34,220
You should cover this up.

166
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,220
You don't know that Saegok is the main culprit of the death of the king.

167
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:45,220
If you take your brother or slave to the police, the anger will be all over Han Haeng-soo.

168
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,220
You think it's your fault.

169
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,220
How will you prove it?

170
00:16:52,220 --> 00:17:00,220
I don't know what kind of decisions the chiefs made in front of the public.

171
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,220
It's not important to me.

172
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:18,220
If Han Haeng-soo is not guilty, then don't make it worse.

173
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,220
Do you know where Han Haeng-soo is?

174
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Can you make him meet you?

175
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,220
How long are you going to stay here?

176
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:11,880
I'll make a

177
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:21,880
I'm sorry.

178
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,880
I'm sorry.

179
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,880
I'm sorry.

180
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
I'm sorry.

181
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,880
What are you going to do with the criminal's child?

182
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Han Haeng-soo is not a criminal.

183
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,880
Just lean on me.

184
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,880
From now on, I'll be by your side.

185
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
Don't you know how I feel?

186
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,880
What are you going to do with me?

187
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Are you going to marry me?

188
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,880
I'm a woman who used to do business with my wife.

189
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,880
I don't fit in with a high-ranking official.

190
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,880
No, I'm just a hindrance to the future of the country.

191
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,880
Is that all?

192
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:47,880
You're not saying you're going to stay with me?

193
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm going to leave again.

194
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,880
I think you're going to leave soon, too.

195
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
I'd better leave before you see the back of it.

196
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,880
I'm going to leave.

197
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,880
I'm going to leave.

198
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,880
I'd better leave before you see the back of it.

199
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,880
I'm going to leave.

200
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I'm going to leave.

201
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Do you know that your sin is a military?

202
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,880
The military has lost the land.

203
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,880
I don't understand that there's a military in your church.

204
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,880
If I'm not mistaken, you can hold many people.

205
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Like that rich pig that holds all living things.

206
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:24,880
The land is the foundation of my life.

207
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,880
I'm going to explore the world and learn more about the foundation of the empire.

208
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Don't be so sad that I'm leaving.

209
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,880
There will be a day when I'll drink again.

210
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,880
I'll miss you, too.

211
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Brother.

212
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Brother.

213
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Brother.

214
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Forgive me.

215
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Forgive me, brother.

216
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Brother.

217
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Brother.

218
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,880
I'm going to live in this world without any regrets.

219
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,880
I'm going to live like a fool.

220
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,880
I'm going to live in this world until I die.

221
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Brother.

222
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,880
I'm going to die.

223
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,880
I erased you from my memory.

224
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Brother.

225
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
Look at me.

226
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Look at me.

227
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Look at me.

228
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,880
What are you going to do from now on?

229
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,880
What can I do? I'm going to be where you are.

230
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
I'm going to be where you are.

231
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Then, can I be where you are?

232
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,880
It's a cold day. Why are you out?

233
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:23,880
How lonely would you be in that cold place on this cold day?

234
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Father.

235
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,880
You saved me from the natural fate and raised me.

236
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:43,880
You saved me from the natural fate and raised me.

237
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
Father.

238
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,880
I have to be with you in that house.

239
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:03,880
I'm going to live in this place where you died.

240
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Don't say that.

241
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
I'm alive.

242
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,880
I'm alive.

243
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I'm alive.

244
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,880
How lucky.

245
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,880
Do you know my heart?

246
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
You fool.

247
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:43,880
Do you think you can see someone precious forever?

248
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:54,880
Do you understand my heart if I say thank you for being in front of me?

249
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:05,880
A precious person should be in front of me now.

250
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,880
I'm lucky to be able to see you in front of me.

251
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
Don't you think so?

252
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
I'm sorry.

253
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,880
I couldn't find you.

254
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,880
I won't do that anymore.

255
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:49,880
When I was young, I looked at you without strength when you left on a boat.

256
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,880
I won't do that anymore.

257
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,880
I won't have money anymore.

258
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,880
I'm going to be a great man soon.

259
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
What should I say to thank you?

260
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,880
I think you should say thank you.

261
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
It's not easy.

262
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
You have to work hard.

263
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Do you understand?

264
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
I understand.

265
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
I understand.

266
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
I understand.

267
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
I understand.

268
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
I understand.

269
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Do you understand?

270
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Don't worry.

271
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
I can get you back.

272
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
What's the point?

273
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
And you know,

274
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,880
You've already been hired.

275
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,880
You'll be in charge of the investment.

276
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,880
I've seen it before.

277
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
I'll see you often.

278
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,880
What is this?

279
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,460
It's a

280
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
What is this?

281
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,880
I'm sure everyone in the office knows that it's not just that.

282
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
But what can I do?

283
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,880
I'm sorry that the times are like this.

284
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:08,880
And it's a shame, but our 7 people decided to be provided with the culture again.

285
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Don't say that.

286
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
You did a good job.

287
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,880
The survivors have to live somehow.

288
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
I've been waiting for you all the time.

289
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
I'm grateful for that.

290
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Let's go.

291
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Wait a minute.

292
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Wait a minute.

293
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Wait a minute.

294
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
I got it right.

295
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Why are you slow?

296
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
I'm going with you.

297
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,880
I heard you're going to Gyeongju.

298
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
What about your family?

299
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
I heard you have a sick father.

300
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Did you believe that?

301
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
I'm fine.

302
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
I've never been married.

303
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
What?

304
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
What kind of person is this?

305
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,880
I knew he was a fraud.

306
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
He's a real fraud.

307
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Fraud?

308
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Fraud is a good word.

309
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Don't call me a fraud.

310
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,880
I'm also a fraud.

311
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
I'm going with you.

312
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
I'm sick of this.

313
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,880
I'm going to start over.

314
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Have you ever been to a farm?

315
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Yes.

316
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Then let's go together.

317
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Let's go.

318
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
Let's go.

319
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
Goodbye.

320
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,880
I'll have a good day.

321
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Let's go.

322
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
You cut the stone into half and cut it in half.

323
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,880
It's not just a stone. It's a stone.

324
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Where are you going?

325
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Are you going to marry me?

326
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,880
The next lucky person is you.

327
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,880
It's been a while since I left.

328
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Where did you go?

329
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
I don't know.

330
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Where did you go?

331
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,880
I went to the village with the young girl.

332
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
Who's a thief?

333
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
I bought that knife.

334
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
You're the only one who knows.

335
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
I know.

336
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
I know.

337
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
I know.

338
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,880
I know.

339
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I know.

340
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
I know.

341
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
I know.

342
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
I know.

343
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
I know.

344
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,880
Why don't you work for our company?

345
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,880
If you want to keep leaving this business, you have to pay a fair price to those who sell us.

346
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Why do you have to live with the low?

347
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
You don't want to get strong?

348
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
I'll get strong.

349
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,880
I'll do anything to get strong.

350
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Sir.

351
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
What are you doing?

352
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
Nothing.

353
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Get out of here.

354
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Did you decide to be with Guk-sun?

355
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,880
How could you abandon me and become Choi Guk-sun?

356
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
How?

357
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,880
Did you abandon me and become Choi Guk-sun?

358
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
How?

359
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Madam!

360
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Madam!

361
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Madam!

362
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Madam, Guk-sun is here!

363
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
Madam!

364
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Madam!

365
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Madam!

366
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
Let go of me!

367
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
Let go of me!

368
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Guk-sun, you're so handsome.

369
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
I miss you.

370
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
You're so handsome.

371
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
You're so handsome.

372
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Thank you.

373
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,880
Father, I'm sorry.

374
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Please forgive me.

375
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
I'm back.

376
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
It's okay.

377
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,880
You must have had a hard time leaving home.

378
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
Rest.

379
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Yes, father.

380
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
I'll be back.

381
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Rest.

382
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
Yes, father.

383
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Why are you wearing the scarf I sent you?

384
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
It's cold.

385
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
What do you mean?

386
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
I'm afraid you'll get cold.

387
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,880
I'll take off your scarf.

388
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
My goodness.

389
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
You're so generous.

390
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
What's wrong with you today?

391
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
I like the sea.

392
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Are you dating Han Yang?

393
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
No.

394
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
I'm not dating Han Yang.

395
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
You're so generous.

396
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Take off your scarf.

397
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,880
I bought Han Yang a gift for you.

398
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
My goodness.

399
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,880
Are we going to live here from now on?

400
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Are we?

401
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
How can we?

402
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,880
We'll have to find out the truth sooner or later.

403
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Sit down.

404
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,880
You're still the same as when you were young.

405
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,880
Are you really Dan?

406
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,880
Mother.

407
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,880
What do you mean?

408
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,880
You've grown up so well.

409
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,880
I can't believe you're so good at this.

410
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,880
I heard about the great power from Gukseon.

411
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
You've suffered a lot.

412
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Until you decide on the future,

413
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
make yourself comfortable.

414
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
Don't worry about anything.

415
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,880
You bastards!

416
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,880
You're trying to get innocent people into the game and get money.

417
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,880
How dare you try to get innocent people into the game?

418
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Take them to the 3rd rank.

419
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
My goodness.

420
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
My goodness.

421
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
I've learned to be a thief.

422
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,880
I have nothing but money.

423
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
I can't die like this.

424
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
I can't.

425
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,880
I have to get out of here.

426
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,880
I remember coming here.

427
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,880
I remember how young Master ran around with his friends.

428
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:13,880
I can't believe we're standing together like this.

429
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,880
I don't know if I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

430
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,880
The reason I want to be with you and the things I want to do together.

431
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,880
There's a reason why I decided to come back to Gyeongju.

432
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,880
I've been thinking about it for many days,

433
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,880
looking at the ashes in the box you left me.

434
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,880
I still don't know what the meaning of the ashes is.

435
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,880
But I think I've got a line of realization from Ban Ki.

436
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,880
The life I have to live on that line is...

437
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,880
I will make a fortune with empty hands.

438
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,880
I mean, on this land.

439
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,880
If there's not enough fish, we need to make more net.

440
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,880
If there's not enough rice, we need to build more land.

441
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,880
I realized this simple position of making a fortune.

442
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,880
It took me a long time to get to the U.S.

443
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,880
I'm going to make a fortune with this soil.

444
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,880
I'm going to make a fortune with this soil.

445
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:58,880
I'm going to stand up again from this soil.

446
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
Oh, my!

447
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,880
Miss Aki!

448
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,880
Are you here to see me?

449
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
Madam!

450
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,880
Mr. Aki from the Jungjin Department is here!

451
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,880
Is everything all right?

452
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,880
Yes, the secretary has sent me the letter.

453
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,880
I'll be back soon.

454
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,880
Oh, my!

455
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,880
I'll be back soon.

456
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,880
Oh, my!

457
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,880
I wonder how much effort you put into this precious soil.

458
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,880
My father put in a lot of soil and soiled the soil.

459
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,880
He uses it as a nightgown.

460
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,880
So he always makes soil at home.

461
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,880
He said he would send more if there was a field.

462
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,880
I think he's worried about his wife's death.

463
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,880
I think he'll be of great help.

464
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,880
Please tell him thank you.

465
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,880
Yes, I'll tell him.

466
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,880
Thank you.

467
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,880
How was it?

468
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,880
What?

469
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,880
Our family is in a bad situation.

470
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,880
I'm sorry.

471
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,880
I'm sorry.

472
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,880
I'm sorry.

473
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,880
I'm sorry.

474
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,880
I'm sorry.

475
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,880
I'm sorry.

476
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,880
What?

477
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,880
I think you're a good professor.

478
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,880
I see.

479
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,880
I thought you were a good person.

480
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,880
You think so too.

481
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,880
I think it's best that you come back and get married.

482
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,880
Yes.

483
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,880
It's time for you to get married too.

484
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,880
You have to be a good person to be a good person.

485
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,880
You should be a good person.

486
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,880
I'm not a good person to your father.

487
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,880
I understand.

488
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,880
That's right.

489
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,880
Where did you get this?

490
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,880
It's a mess.

491
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,880
What did you get?

492
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,880
I just wanted to see if there was anything good.

493
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,880
This is bad.

494
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,880
What did you say?

495
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,880
Get out of here.

496
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,880
I'm going to buy some land.

497
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,880
I don't have any plans yet.

498
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,880
You're old enough to get married.

499
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,880
What's the big deal?

500
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,880
I'm not ready yet.

501
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,880
Please let me go.

502
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,880
Is it because of that girl?

503
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,880
The girl you brought from Hanyang.

504
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,880
She's not going to be able to marry you.

505
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,880
How?

506
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,880
I heard she was a prostitute in Hanyang.

507
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,880
Our family can't get married to a Chinese.

508
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,880
She was a slave to our family.

509
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,880
How could you?

510
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,880
You're just saying that because you're young.

511
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Father,

512
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,880
I can't marry a girl I don't like.

513
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,880
Please think about it.

514
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,880
How long are you going to keep talking nonsense?

515
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,880
You're not even allowed to have a child.

516
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,880
I can't allow it.

517
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,880
I can't follow your father's will.

518
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,880
Mother! Mother!

519
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,880
Mother!

520
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,880
Mother!

521
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
Mother!

522
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
Is this the Japanese?

523
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,880
Why can't I go back to my room?

524
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Master, the Japanese came to Gyeongju.

525
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,880
It's a good thing.

526
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,880
My land is a good one.

527
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,880
Please.

528
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,880
I'm sorry.

529
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,880
Seol-ah!

530
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,880
I can't marry a girl I don't like.

531
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,880
You can't even embrace me?

532
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,880
I'll show you.

533
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,880
I don't know why you came here.
