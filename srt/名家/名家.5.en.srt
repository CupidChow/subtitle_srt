Good job.

35
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you going to do with the businessmen?

36
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Are you going to hand them over to the police?

37
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What would you do?

38
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can't just put all the businessmen in jail.

39
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I will kill them.

40
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What will you do if they don't come?

41
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If they turn their back on you,

42
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
can you call that a crime?

43
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If they do that,

44
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
they will fall apart.

45
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Can I say something?

46
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No.

47
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Where are you going?

48
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If the owner of the store goes

49
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and tells him to get out of jail,

50
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
what will you do?

51
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What about the gang?

52
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
They are so weak that they can't even see a thing.

53
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
They wanted to make a hole in the line of the line.

54
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But they turned our house upside down.

55
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Fortunately, we are not in any serious trouble.

57
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We just have to be careful.

58
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm worried about the old man.

59
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He has a lot of money in the name of the North.

60
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He has a lot of money.

61
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How can he just make money?

62
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But the old man is losing money.

63
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What?

64
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The name is all broken?

65
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
They couldn't even get one out of the boat.

66
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
They said the fight would be over.

67
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But they just killed us.

68
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What?

69
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
They killed us?

70
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You are talking nonsense.

71
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's what I'm saying.

72
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You are a very high-ranking man.

73
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How can you compare yourself to a businessman?

74
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You are different.

75
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I will be more careful from now on.

76
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay.

77
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How much money did we give to the gang?

78
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
About 800.

79
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
800?

80
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm so happy to see you.

81
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How can we go back now?

82
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If he can't even use his strength,

83
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
he is in trouble.

84
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I know.

85
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Tell him that he is a loser.

87
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I did it.

88
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I will be punished.

89
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Please release the prisoners.

90
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I did what I was told.

91
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't release them.

92
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You don't have the right to say that to us.

93
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You are in a hurry to make a living.

94
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
How can you do that?

95
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Do you know what it is?

96
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What do you think?

97
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I have a suggestion for you.

98
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I see.

99
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think I'm too much of a fool.

100
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
No.

101
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I wonder why I never thought about it before.

102
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I was just thinking.

103
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Please forgive me for my mistake.

105
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You were mistaken.

106
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm glad you were able to solve the misunderstanding.

107
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I will never forgive you.

108
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Brother, this is not right.

109
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
How can you hold hands with a loser?

110
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You are trying to make a deal.

111
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What is wrong with you?

112
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You are a young man.

113
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What he said is right.

114
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What is wrong with you?

115
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Please release him.

116
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He is being too judgmental.

117
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Water is a trend.

118
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You don't mean the losers are the losers?

119
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Leave.

120
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Get some water for the loser.

121
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I will be careful for the time being.

122
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I heard you read the world and look ahead.

123
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It is a philosophy that a merchant should always keep his eyes and ears open.

124
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What do you want to say?

125
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I have a small suggestion.

126
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The new world that the merchant should keep his eyes and ears open is in the hands of the loser.

127
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Sang-baek.

128
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes.

129
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Go to the little customer and tell him that there is something I want to go with him.

130
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes.

131
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Go.

132
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What are you thinking about?

133
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What if we bet on the new world?

134
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Then we can bring the new world together.

135
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It would be much better than going to the land alone.

136
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's a good idea.

137
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But you should be serious about something important.

138
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I will go soon.

139
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Madam.

140
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What is it?

141
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Madam.

142
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I have no rice.

143
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I used to use the rice as a fertilizer.

144
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I am embarrassed to put it on the rice.

145
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What can you do?

146
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Give me the prize.

147
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But you...

148
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't want to.

149
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Do you think I don't know you?

150
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Do you think you were the first person to eat rice for the last 10 years?

151
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Let's go!

152
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I thought there was a new world before the July Fights.

153
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Can I ask you something?

154
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I came to Hanyang for a reason.

155
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I came here to make money.

156
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You have seen everything about my family in Gyeongju.

157
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You can guess the story without further ado.

158
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But what could I do in this vast Hanyang?

159
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But I decided to start here.

160
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The loser gave me a dream to start with.

161
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I think all the poor people like me will have the same dream.

162
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Did you know what a war is?

163
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes, I heard that war is not protected by the law.

164
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But look.

165
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Many people buy and sell things.

166
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But look.

167
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Many people buy and sell things.

168
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They are living here.

169
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This is hope.

170
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
If this is what many people want,

171
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
will they be broken?

172
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
If the people want it,

173
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
they will follow the law.

174
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I knew it from the beginning.

175
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But I didn't want to see the cruel flow.

176
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You are right.

177
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The world is a narrow one.

178
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Maybe this place is a new world

179
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
if we walk further than others.

180
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I learned a lot from you.

181
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's a good thing.

182
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Why don't you work in our company?

183
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I will take care of it.

184
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's cold.

185
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I feel like my ears are going to fall off.

186
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Where is the law that makes people wait?

187
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You should have told us in advance.

188
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Do you know that there are only a few people who want to see you?

189
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What?

190
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Are you here to see the King?

191
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Where did you see me?

192
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Go back.

193
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
How can you take me?

194
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I just refused the offer.

195
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I just wanted to help you with your work.

196
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I can do anything for money.

197
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But I have something to do.

198
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Do you know what it is?

199
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's a loan.

200
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't even make a deal with a loan shark.

201
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm afraid I'll be caught by the owners of my own house.

202
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Please take care of the business.

203
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's important to sell,

204
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
but it's also important to buy the price.

205
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I understand.

206
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But I don't have enough experience.

207
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm worried about whether I can do it well.

208
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,320
I'll give you a

209
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,000
I'll give you a

210
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You can discuss it.

211
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Come here.

212
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'll show you the secret that we usually provide.

213
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'll show you the secret that we usually provide.

214
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Look.

215
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Is your wife not here?

216
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm going to make her a dress for her birthday.

217
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't know anything about secret clothes.

218
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Please wait a minute.

219
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Are you here?

220
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Long time no see.

221
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You're Choi Kuk-sun, aren't you?

222
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Don't you recognize me?

223
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm Kim Won-il.

224
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Kim Won-il.

225
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Won-il?

226
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I'm Kim Won-il.

227
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's so nice to meet you.

228
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I didn't know you were in Pohang.

229
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I mean, I wouldn't have known even if I knew.

230
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I guess I've changed a lot.

231
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I guess I've changed a lot.

232
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I saw your name while writing the initials for the case.

233
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I didn't think it was right.

234
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Did you?

235
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Are you going to keep working in the market?

236
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Aren't you a cheater?

237
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Cheater, who is just a fool.

238
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I don't think so anymore.

239
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm glad to see you two again.

241
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I've prepared a small gift for you.

242
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I put in a good, precious tea for you.

243
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Usually, I put in a lot of scents, but I put in tea leaves.

244
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Good flowers are enjoyed with justice,

245
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and tea is enjoyed with good law.

246
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Please think of your friendship as my heart,

247
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
wishing it to be gentle like this tea.

248
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Thank you.

249
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Thanks to you, I got a gift called a lucky charm.

250
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm so happy to meet a lucky charm like this.

251
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I feel so happy.

252
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What are you talking about?

253
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I feel so relieved to meet you.

254
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What made you feel so sad?

255
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I give up.

256
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
The next president of the Janggye-taek Group

257
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
should be a great man like you.

258
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I see.

259
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But I heard that the lucky charm

260
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
is the daughter of the great man.

261
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
How about it?

262
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Do you want to see her hands?

263
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If you don't mind,

264
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't mind if you give me a slap.

265
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
If you want it,

266
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'll help you.

267
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'll help you with the Janggye-taek Group.

268
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
If you say so.

269
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I thought you would make sense.

270
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
What about you?

271
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I know you're a lucky charm,

272
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
but you're a great man who doesn't understand.

273
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
There are a few things

274
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
that you don't understand.

275
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You said you wanted to hold hands

276
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
with the losers

277
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
with the young man

278
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
who doesn't know the physicality.

279
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The best.

280
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You said you wanted to hold hands with the losers.

281
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I hope your friendship

282
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
is as gentle as the scent of tea.

283
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
That's how I feel.

284
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Don't say that.

285
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You're the lucky charm

286
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
who can get over the losers.

287
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Do you think I'm doing this because I want to?

288
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
If my father was a loser,

289
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'd be a loser too.

290
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
If my father was a loser,

291
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'd be a loser too.

292
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'd be a loser if he died.

293
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Welcome.

295
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I brought you fish.

296
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Well...

297
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What is it?

298
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
There's not even a single piece

299
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
of silk left in our warehouse.

300
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Is it okay if you do this?

301
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
We'll have a lucky charm,

302
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
a prize, and a reward.

303
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
The highest prize is 500,000 times, 100,000 times.

304
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The next lucky charm is you.

305
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Almond New Peking Entertainment Center,

306
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
931-931.com

307
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh, well...

308
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Last night, we sold out

309
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
after we had a great deal.

310
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
We have to go to the beach.

311
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So, there is no new place to come in yesterday?

312
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
The river is frozen, so it's all flooded.

313
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Master!

314
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Master, it's the same with other movies.

315
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's the same with other movies.

316
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
All the people in the river have bought the money.

317
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I know. I told you yesterday that we should stop the fish and buy the money.

318
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Oh, my.

319
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Why are you so sure that you don't know what the fish is?

320
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Did you say that all the people in the river have bought the money?

321
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yes, all the people in the river have bought the money.

322
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Something is wrong.

323
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
We should go to the loser and find out what happened.

324
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I think there is a money-making secret.

325
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
What secret?

326
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Hurry up.

327
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Is it okay to do this?

328
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
What are you going to do with all this money?

329
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
That's what I'm going to do.

330
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm going to find Mapo-Naru.

331
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I have no choice.

332
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It's not my business anyway.

333
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Hurry up.

334
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yes, sir.

335
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yes, sir.

336
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I found out about my accomplice in the river.

337
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
As you said, there was a back-up.

338
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I knew it.

339
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Our superior took over the tax-saving right.

340
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
The river was hit hard.

341
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
There will be no money to buy the money.

342
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Then who is the back-up?

343
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
There is one.

344
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
He is Kim Ja-chun, who is famous for money-making in Yang-an.

345
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
His name is Kim Ja-chun.

346
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
There is no doubt about it.

347
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I am the next prime minister to take over the country.

348
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Where can I find a better candidate?

349
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I will find the best one.

350
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I will take the money from the court.

351
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I will prepare it.

352
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yes, yes, yes.

353
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,000
How is the new government?

354
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yes, it's going well.

355
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's a matter of time before you start a business.

356
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's all thanks to you.

357
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
How did you come?

358
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I want to see the elder of this house.

359
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Did you make the appointment in advance?

360
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,000
If it's the best line in Gyeongju, you will remember.

361
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Who is this?

362
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Isn't he the young master of the Gyeongju family?

363
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's been a long time.

364
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I've never seen him before.

365
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Don't think about being a lowly man.

366
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I thought I would meet Yejin-hyeon, but things have changed.

367
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It seems that you have been innocent.

368
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yes.

369
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Why did you come to the Indian warehouse?

370
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I heard that you were going to buy a secret unit.

371
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I bought a little.

372
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Every store has a secret unit.

373
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So?

374
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Can you sell me a secret unit?

375
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Secret unit?

376
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Secret unit?

377
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm sorry to say this, but I'm sorry to say this,

378
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
but I need a secret unit.

379
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
How much will it cost?

380
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Tell me how much you want.

381
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Is it worth what I call it?

382
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Okay, good.

383
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
One secret unit and one ship.

384
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
No, no.

385
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
A secret unit and a ship.

386
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
No, you can't have that.

387
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Okay, that's good.

388
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Change the ship to a secret unit.

389
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I heard that you were at the warehouse.

390
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It seems that the wisdom that came to me was foolish.

391
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Would it be a white lie to tell a crow that it was white?

392
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It seems that the sacred water has improved,

393
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
but the rotten heart doesn't seem to have changed even after time has passed.

394
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
What?

395
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You're trying to tell me that I'm a traitor?

396
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
How dare you say that I'm a businessman

397
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
because I'm a businessman?

398
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Do I still look like a fool?

399
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Father, do you have to do that?

400
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I can't believe you did that.

401
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's only the beginning.

402
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's only the beginning.

403
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
From now on, it's only the beginning

404
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
that I will pay you back.

405
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You don't know

406
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
what I've been through because of that scoundrel Choi.

407
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You don't know.

408
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
You don't know what culture I've been through because of that scoundrel Choi.

409
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
What do you mean I don't know?

410
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Do you know what kind of wound I had on my chest when I was young?

411
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Every time I looked up the door of my house,

412
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I was so miserable.

413
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I was so miserable in front of that brave man

414
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
who I thought I could never see again.

415
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Do you know how much it hurt me?

416
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Do you know that Gukseon was a desperate existence

417
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
like a wall that I couldn't cross?

418
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
What?

419
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I will do it now.

420
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I will not use your wealth

421
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
but the power of my power

422
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
to overcome the power of Choi's family

423
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
who used to suppress me.

424
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
How did you manage the stock?

425
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I apologize.

426
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I spent 400 bn on the name-list

427
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
for the national fortune-telling team.

428
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You should have written it all down.

429
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
You spent 100 bn on the name-list

430
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
for the national fortune-telling team.

431
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You should have written it all down.

432
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
How many days does it take

433
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
for a ship to come in from the land of the secret?

434
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It will take a few days.

435
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Anyway, we must get the secret.

436
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It will be difficult if it takes more than five years.

437
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Of course.

438
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It is difficult to handle

439
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
if the general is blind.

440
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
The chief minister is here.

441
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You should leave.

442
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You are here.

443
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Is there nothing?

444
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
No.

445
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I don't understand why

446
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
the Westerners

447
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
let such a scoundrel

448
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
enter the world of the West.

449
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
What is the use of it?

450
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You should get a grip on yourself.

451
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I can't stand it anymore.

452
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I can't stand it anymore.

453
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It is so hard to stand it anymore.

454
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
The gods of heaven have not arrived yet.

455
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The gods of the control tower

456
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
are not able to meet each other.

457
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It is a matter of time.

458
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Anyway,

459
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
will you leave Tan Yi like that?

460
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We must find a way

461
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
to find out the source of the secret

462
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
of Han Jae-gyeom.

463
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
We must do it one day.

464
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
But now,

465
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
we can't do it in a hurry.

466
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
The Westerners' spirit

467
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
is not as good as ours.

468
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
The Westerners' spirit

469
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Mister, it is cold. Why are you here?

470
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
No.

471
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Actually, I have something

472
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
to tell you.

473
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
What?

474
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So a few days ago,

475
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I heard something amazing

476
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
from a man named Sim Jeong-hak

477
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
of the Chunchugwan Bridge.

478
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Hurry up.

479
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Let me see.

480
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It is not something else.

481
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It is about Han Jae-gyeom.

482
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Why are you talking about him?

483
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I saw a secret signal

484
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
in the Western Palace

485
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and found something amazing.

486
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It is evidence that

487
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Han Jae-gyeom's tomb

488
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
was fabricated.

489
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It is evidence that

490
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
your father framed him.

491
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
He said that the groom

492
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
had killed all the people

493
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
in the tomb

494
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
without even asking for

495
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
a letter of appointment.

496
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
He was not supposed to

497
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
have a letter of appointment

498
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and was just a scapegoat.

499
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
If that is true,

500
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
doesn't that mean

501
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
that we can prove your father's innocence?

502
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
That's right.

503
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But there is one problem.

504
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
He has a secret document

505
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
that shows his true identity.

506
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
The groom will not

507
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
give it to him.

508
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
He will ask for it

509
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
if he has any evidence.

510
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
He is in a daze.

511
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I will meet him.

512
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I will meet him.

513
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
If I can prove your father's innocence,

514
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I can do anything.

515
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But

516
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I want you to

517
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
confirm the secret document

518
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
with my own eyes.

519
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Please tell him.

520
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I found out from the middle-aged son

521
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
who was serving the secret order.

522
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
The closest secret order

523
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
is Yangju.

524
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But I heard

525
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
that the old man

526
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
was not right.

527
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
He said that he did not know

528
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
if there would be any secret orders left.

529
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
How many days

530
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
will it take to get there?

531
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It will not be a day

532
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
if we go to the river.

533
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But all the ships are

534
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
disembarked and

535
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
there is one ship left.

536
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
We have to go to the river.

537
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It will be much more difficult.

538
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Then,

539
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
we will have to walk for days.

540
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I heard that

541
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
it will be dangerous if we get caught in the rain.

542
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Do not worry.

543
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I have a way.

544
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
This is the end of the deal.

545
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Thank you.

546
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Oh, my.

547
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Why did you think of this?

548
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I saw this last time

549
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
in Naruto.

550
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I cannot swim.

551
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
If I can turn this around...

552
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I need someone

553
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
who is good at trading.

554
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I want to go with you.

555
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You will be with me even if you become a water ghost.

556
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Do not hate me.

557
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
What are you talking about?

558
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
What are you doing?

559
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It is a great honor

560
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
to be able to get rid of the water ghost.

561
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I cannot just let it go.

562
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
With this,

563
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
can I go crazy?

564
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I cannot.

565
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I cannot.

566
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
What is this?

567
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
The Great Shogun

568
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
was killed in the four cultures.

569
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
What? Is that true?

570
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

571
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Why do you

572
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
make others do good things?

573
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You can give it to the Great Shogun.

574
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
What is going on?

575
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Answer me.

576
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Answer me.

577
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
What is this?

578
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
A traveler from the Great Shogun

579
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
has come to save us.

580
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Something is wrong.

581
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
The Great Shogun

582
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
is going to kill us like a snake.

583
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
What should we do?

584
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Wait a moment.

585
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I will save you

586
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
no matter what.

587
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
The Great Shogun

588
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
is going to kill us.

589
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
What should we do?

590
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Answer me.

591
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
What is going on?

592
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Answer me.

593
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
What is going on?

594
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Answer me.

595
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
What is going on?

596
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Answer me.

597
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
What is going on?

598
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Answer me.

599
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
What is going on?

600
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Answer me.
