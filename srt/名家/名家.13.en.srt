1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,620
all the land techies.

2
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:17,260
Gra prenanda

3
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,000
This is the happen speed Rb

4
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,480
She samows

5
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,500
you know

6
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Look.

7
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,500
This is the record of the farm I collected.

8
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
The second method.

9
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,500
The second method is to grow a farm in a pot and plant it in the field.

10
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,500
If the water in the pot is enough,

11
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I think I can grow two times the amount of soil than when I spray the soil directly.

12
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,500
If I spray the soil evenly on the mat and then soil it,

13
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
and if the soil grows about a drop...

14
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I can grow two times the amount of soil.

15
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
The mat should be sprayed evenly.

16
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,500
And if the mat is about to float in the water,

17
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
you should immediately drain the water.

18
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Do you understand?

19
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
And if you feel that the mat didn't spray the soil well...

20
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
What a poor thing.

21
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
The mat is floating.

22
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Oh, my.

23
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
You can't make a bet?

24
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
That's right.

25
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
I can make a bet.

26
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
I can make a bet.

27
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
That's good.

28
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
That's good.

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
If you do well, you can stop the Korean farming.

30
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
If you don't have a good harvest,

31
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
the farmers will keep on farming until next year.

32
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Isn't that right?

33
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,500
So, if you do well, you can sell less seaweed.

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
What do you mean by that?

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
You can work less if you sell less seaweed?

36
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
I mean...

37
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
It's good to work less.

38
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
It's going to be hard for the farmers.

39
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
You know one thing and you don't know the other.

40
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
If you work less, you can work less.

41
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Why do you give us 10 people to build a farm

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
when we can build 3 farms?

43
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Then, if we all start a farm,

44
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
we don't need to work.

45
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
If we do it wrong,

46
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
we can only take the land.

47
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
I see.

48
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Now we can talk.

49
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
You're good at everything.

50
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
I'm just saying that you should send money to the farmers.

51
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Every time I see you, I get excited.

52
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
As you said,

53
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
the farmers have been watered enough

54
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
for the year of the pig.

55
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Of course.

56
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
The Golden Queen,

57
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
the Golden City,

58
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
the Golden Captain,

59
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
the Golden Banner,

60
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
the Golden Banner,

61
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
the Golden Banner,

62
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
the Golden Banner,

63
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
the Golden Banner,

64
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
the Golden Banner,

65
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
the Golden Banner,

66
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
the Golden Banner,

67
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
the Golden Banner,

68
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
the Golden Banner,

69
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
the Golden Banner,

70
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
the Golden Banner,

71
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
the Golden Banner,

72
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
the Golden Banner,

73
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
the Golden Banner.

74
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
You were keeping the farm, right?

75
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
It's not that, but...

76
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
I think everything's ready now.

77
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
So, rest well today.

78
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,500
It will start from tomorrow.

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Yes, sir!

80
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
I'll be back.

81
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Yes, leave it and go.

82
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
You have a fever.

83
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
You should rest today.

84
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
I'm not feeling well.

85
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
I'll go and get you some medicine.

86
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
I'll be back.

87
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I'll be back.

88
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
I'll be back.

89
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
I'll be back.

90
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I'll be back.

91
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll be back.

92
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I'll be back.

93
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
You should rest.

94
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
It's the first time I've ever been to your land.

95
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
How can I stay at home?

96
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Sir,

97
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I'll be needing this.

98
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Thank you.

99
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Sir!

100
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Sir,

101
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
I'm in trouble.

102
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
What's going on?

103
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Well,

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Madam,

105
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
you can't

106
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
sow the seeds.

107
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
What?

108
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
What are you talking about?

109
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
You can't sow the seeds?

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
What have I done?

111
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Oh, my!

112
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Oh, my!

113
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Oh, my!

114
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Oh, my!

115
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
This is...

116
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I don't know what kind of people they are,

117
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
but if they get caught, they'll just...

118
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
They'll just...

119
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
They'll just leave this alone!

120
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Tell me who did this!

121
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Sir!

122
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
What do you know if I tell you who did this?

123
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
If you do that,

124
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
they'll just stand up!

125
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
You have to make them pay.

126
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,500
You have to make them pay!

127
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Please be quiet.

128
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
What do you think of our young master?

129
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
We're not the ones to blame.

130
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Good job!

131
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Good job!

132
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
What's the point of having land?

133
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
It's no use if you can't farm.

134
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,500
You have to have the skills to turn the soil into rice.

135
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Now, the last year's farming is over.

136
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
It's over.

137
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,500
It's already too late to plant the seedlings.

138
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
It's all because Choi Guk-sun

139
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,500
has taken over the land.

140
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,500
He can just follow what others are doing.

141
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Why would he do something that others don't do?

142
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
He's just a young master.

143
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Do you think others know better than me?

144
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
I know.

145
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,500
They must have known very well.

146
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,500
They only know how to be nice and warm.

147
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Now, they'll never hear that kind of nonsense again.

148
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Look, just prepare the money.

149
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Make sure he doesn't notice.

150
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Yes, sir.

151
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
If he doesn't farm for a long time,

152
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
that's it.

153
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Do you think he can last until next year?

154
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Even those who want to plant the seedlings

155
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,500
will be lazy.

156
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,500
I'll take care of that.

157
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I'll take care of that.

158
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Is there...

159
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
no way...

160
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,500
to save the seedlings?

161
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Here.

162
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Here.

163
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Good job.

164
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
That's nothing.

165
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Sir, it's nothing?

166
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Don't say that.

167
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
You should know better.

168
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
We risked our lives.

169
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
If we get caught,

170
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
we'll be in trouble.

171
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
We ruined other people's farms.

172
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Lower your voice.

173
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
I know. I know everything.

174
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,500
My master knows everything.

175
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
You have no doubt about it.

176
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
If you want to plant the seedlings

177
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
in the best soil,

178
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
you can do it.

179
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Then...

180
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,680
you'll give me the

181
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,500
soil for the seedlings, right?

182
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Don't worry.

184
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Sir, are you here?

185
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Sir.

186
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Can't we just

187
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,500
do that?

188
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
But it's too late

189
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,500
to plant the seedlings in the soil.

190
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Oh, my back!

191
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Oh, my back!

192
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Oh, my!

193
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Why did you call me?

194
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
You're not healthy.

195
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Why did you do that?

196
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Let's move this to your room.

197
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
It's heavy.

198
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Mother, what's this?

199
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
It's a two-leaf clover.

200
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Mother's cough is getting worse.

201
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
She said that

202
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
it's good for the cough.

203
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
She told me to grow it.

204
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Can't we just leave it in the kitchen?

205
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Why did you move it to the room?

206
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
It's warm.

207
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
It'll grow well.

208
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Now that the weather is getting better,

209
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
we can't light the fire in the kitchen.

210
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,500
The room will be much warmer.

211
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Sir, can I come in?

212
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Come in.

213
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Sir, I have a new book.

214
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
A new book?

215
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
It's about the mother.

216
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
We can plant the seedlings in two months.

217
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
If we can grow the mother in it,

218
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,500
we can start farming this year.

219
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
You're not going to grow the mother soon.

220
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
We can grow the mother

221
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
in a warm house,

222
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
not in a field.

223
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Like a two-leaf clover.

224
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
A house?

225
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Are you talking about the earth?

226
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Earth?

227
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,500
I just saw an interesting title

228
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,500
in the book I read in the Sejong period.

229
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Sejong wanted to eat fresh

230
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,500
fresh food even in the middle of winter.

231
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
So he built a house called Tohu

232
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
and planted spring vegetables in it.

233
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
After building the house,

234
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
he put the shoes down,

235
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
and then he piled up a handful of soil

236
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
and returned the soil.

237
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
He put the firewood outside

238
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
and hung a tent.

239
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,500
The hot steam should cool the soil.

240
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
When it's cold,

241
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,500
you have to cover it with a thick blanket.

242
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Hey, Hongdu.

243
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Make a hole in the roof.

244
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Make a hole in the roof?

245
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Yes, make a hole in the roof.

246
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
What?

247
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
If you make a hole in the roof,

248
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
it will be windy.

249
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Is it windy?

250
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
It's raining.

251
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
It's going to rain.

252
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Bandora.

253
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Yes, sir.

254
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Prepare some oil paper.

255
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Oil paper?

256
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Yes, put a lot of oil on several layers of paper.

257
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Yes, sir.

258
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
What is he doing?

259
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
He's going.

260
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Now he's going to make a hole in the roof.

261
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Now he's completely gone.

262
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
He's gone.

263
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
He's a good boy.

264
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,500
I think he's done.

265
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
This way,

266
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,500
we can get enough sunlight during the day.

267
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Yes, sir.

268
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
The sun shines on everything in the world.

269
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
It's a great thing to grow up.

270
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Then, if I live here,

271
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
will I grow taller like Nari?

272
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
No, not that.

273
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
You will grow taller.

274
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Cheondung, you will grow much taller.

275
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Sir, I'm going to grow taller from today.

276
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
It's good to grow taller.

277
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
I'll grow taller by myself.

278
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,500
You're smart.

279
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Don't you think so?

280
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I want to marry you.

281
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
You grew up well.

282
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Sir, you're here.

283
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
You can get married soon.

284
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Yes, I'm thinking of getting married in four days.

285
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
You will grow up strong.

286
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,500
You will have many children.

287
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,500
You've worked so hard.

288
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
It's not easy to grow up.

289
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,500
It's not easy to grow up.

290
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I will think of you every time you harvest.

291
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,500
You will move the land and grow it.

292
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,500
It's not easy to get a land.

293
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,500
It's not easy to get a land.

294
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,500
It's not easy to get a land.

295
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
I don't know if I had the right.

296
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Sir, can I leave it here?

297
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Yes, thank you.

298
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
I'll bring it again.

299
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
The second method.

300
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
It's a common method of farming.

301
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,500
It was an innovative method in the 17th century.

302
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Instead of planting the seedlings on the ground,

303
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
you can plant them in the farm.

304
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
You can increase the harvest by two times.

305
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,500
The farmer's labor was reduced by half.

306
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,500
But if the seedlings were dried,

307
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,500
all the farming would fail.

308
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,500
So it was dangerous to plant the seedlings.

309
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Mr. Choi used the water from the seedlings

310
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,500
and planted the seedlings that no one tried.

311
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,500
The land is not easy to get.

312
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,500
It's not easy to get a land.

313
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,500
It's not easy to get a land.

314
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,500
It's not easy to get a land.

315
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,500
It's not easy to get a land.

316
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,500
It's not easy to get a land.

317
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,500
It's not easy to get a land.

318
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,500
It's not easy to get a land.

319
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Guk-shun.

320
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Yes.

321
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:12,500
It seems like my father has realized it from you.

322
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Pardon?

323
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,500
I thought that an empty heart was a person's heart.

324
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
I still think about it.

325
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:35,500
But I think I know what the value of an empty heart is.

326
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,500
You mean the clean fire?

327
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Yes.

328
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,500
If you are blind to your greed,

329
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,500
you will never be able to fill it.

330
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,500
You will rot in your greed.

331
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,500
But the way you are building a fire

332
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,500
is not only for our family,

333
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
but also for others' lives.

334
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Isn't an empty heart like this?

335
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Maybe the value of an empty heart is really here.

336
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Who wants to be a person

337
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,500
who is not a person?

338
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
If you can make a way

339
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500
that people won't be afraid of you

340
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
because of the fire I built,

341
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,500
that would be a clean path for a person.

342
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Your father has learned a great lesson from you.

343
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Father, don't be angry.

344
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,500
I am your son.

345
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,500
You are my blood.

346
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:18,500
I will be happy to see you.

347
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,500
I will be happy to see you.

348
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,500
I can't believe it.

349
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:14,500
I can't believe I am coming back to this house.

350
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,500
If you were with me on a day like this,

351
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,500
I would have been happy.

352
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,500
I would have been happy.

353
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,500
If you were with me,

354
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,500
how nice would it be?

355
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,500
I was thinking the same thing.

356
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
If you were in this house

357
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,500
where our ancestors lived,

358
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,500
and you stayed here all day,

359
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,500
how nice would it be?

360
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Father!

361
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
I am sorry.

362
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,500
I should show my son

363
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,500
the house where my father was born and raised.

364
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
I should show him.

365
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
It's so big!

366
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Let's go together.

367
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Where are you going?

368
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,500
It's so big!

369
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,500
It's so nice!

370
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Let's go together.

371
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
It's so nice, isn't it?

372
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
You are so nice.

373
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Leave this place empty.

374
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
What?

375
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
All this room is empty?

376
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,500
This is not for the singers.

377
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,500
It's for the visitors.

378
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
I want to treat the visitors

379
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
who pass by this area.

380
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,500
I hope you will take good care of this.

381
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Yes, I will.

382
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
It's so nice!

383
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
It looks so good!

384
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
It's so nice!

385
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
It's so nice!

386
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
It's so nice!

387
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
It's so nice!

388
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
It's so nice!

389
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
It's so nice!

390
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
It's so nice!

391
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
It's so nice!

392
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
It's so nice!

393
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
It's so nice!

394
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
It's so nice!

395
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
It's so nice!

396
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
It's so nice!

397
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
It's so nice!

398
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
It's so nice!

399
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
It's so nice!

400
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
It's so nice!

401
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
It's so nice!

402
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
It's so nice!

403
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
I caught it!

404
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Thank you!

405
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
I caught it!

406
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Thank you!

407
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Yes.

408
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Yes!

409
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Get him!

410
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Get him!

411
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,500
I beg you.

412
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:14,500
I think it would be better for you to learn the trade.

413
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,500
You are so smart. I don't know if I can teach you.

414
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
No, I can't. Please teach me.

415
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,500
I want to be a great businessman.

416
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
I will do my best.

417
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Really?

418
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Good. Let's start with how to get the trade.

419
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Thank you. I will do my best.

420
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
I will do my best.

421
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Search this area.

422
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Yes.

423
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Master.

424
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Master.

425
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,500
How have you been?

426
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
I'm fine.

427
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,500
You look comfortable.

428
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Do I?

429
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:56,500
I haven't been here for four years.

430
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,500
It was a short time, but a long time for me.

431
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,500
It's already been four years.

432
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
I didn't think you would be here.

433
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,500
I would have come here a month ago if I knew you were here.

434
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:26,500
I have been thinking about you for the past four years.

435
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,500
You asked me one day

436
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,500
if I wanted to marry you.

437
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
That is...

438
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I regret not answering you back then.

439
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
I learned from you.

440
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Can I answer you now?

441
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,500
I will marry you.

442
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Please forgive the girl who is not worthy of your love.

443
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Is it because of Gukseon?

444
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Do you know that Gukseon is married?

445
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,500
The neighborhood department is investigating Gyeongju.

446
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
I'm sorry.

447
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
Do you know that Gukseon is married?

448
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,500
The neighborhood department is not far from Gyeongju.

449
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,500
I heard it from the wind.

450
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:27,500
But why don't you say yes?

451
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
I...

452
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Do you say no?

453
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,500
I think so.

454
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,500
What are you looking at?

455
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Nothing.

456
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
Ilseon.

457
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Yes.

458
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,500
I will untie my hair and put it back on.

459
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Young lady.

460
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,500
I didn't marry you,

461
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,500
but you can't stay with your hair like that forever.

462
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,500
It doesn't suit you.

463
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,500
I almost got into trouble.

464
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Is there a place where I can get hurt?

465
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Fortunately, there were not many soldiers.

466
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:49,500
But I think it's a good thing that I dropped the gun.

467
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
I'm sorry.

468
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,500
I'm sorry.

469
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,500
I don't like dropping the gun.

470
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,500
I don't like it.

471
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Don't worry about it.

472
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:13,500
You should consider what you do here.

473
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
I understand.

474
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Give me what you prepared.

475
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Yes, sir.

476
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Write it down.

477
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
The money you sent last time

478
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,500
will be used up by now.

479
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:53,640
Look at the

480
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:03,500
I've been collecting money for this day.

481
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Please write it down.

482
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,500
I'm sorry.

483
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Our people will come here soon.

484
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,500
They will go to the mountain.

485
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
You and the general are people

486
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,500
who shouldn't be revealed to us.

487
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,500
It's good to hide.

488
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Yes.

489
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Thank you.

490
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,500
I'll tell the general.

491
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:25,500
I saw Dany when I was being chased by the neighborhood.

492
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Are you talking about Dany?

493
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
I've been looking around,

494
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,500
but I'm sure it's Dany.

495
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Yes, yes.

496
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,500
You've picked the wrong ones.

497
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:54,500
The general likes dried seafood.

498
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,500
They're hard to find in Hanyang.

499
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,500
He'll like them.

500
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
I feel so relieved

501
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
that you came all the way here.

502
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,500
It's a gift for the general.

503
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,500
How can I order the lower ones?

504
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Thank you.

505
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
I'm sure I can live in Gyeongju

506
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,500
because you're in Hanyang.

507
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:26,500
This is a gift for the general.

508
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Then Wonil will be happy.

509
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Yes, yes.

510
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Then it's not 7 to 3 anymore.

511
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
We're dead.

512
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
We're in the same year.

513
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Last year, we paid the same amount.

514
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
What can we eat?

515
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
We have nothing to eat.

516
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,500
You have to say something long.

517
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:02,500
I told you to do it yourself.

518
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Do what?

519
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,500
What do you mean?

520
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,500
How can you do it yourself?

521
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Then you can stick your land.

522
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Who told you to eat other people's land?

523
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
You bastard!

524
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
What are you doing?

525
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,500
What are you doing?

526
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Let's see who's better.

527
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
I'll show you.

528
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,500
You guys were like that before.

529
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:50,500
I trusted the guy who was a scoundrel.

530
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,500
It's my fault.

531
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Why did I stick my land?

532
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,500
If you're so cold,

533
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
the situation is so serious.

534
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,500
I didn't know you were this cold.

535
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,500
I saw the rocks running.

536
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
There's nothing to worry about.

537
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Half of them are dead.

538
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Then this year will be the 6th year.

539
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,500
It's not a big year.

540
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Everyone is worried.

541
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,500
If we lower the greed for profit,

542
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,500
and if we make good deals,

543
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,500
we'll be able to make a good business.

544
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

545
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

546
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

547
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
If we lower the greed for profit,

548
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,500
and if we make good deals,

549
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,500
we'll be able to make a good business.

550
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,500
I'm sure you'll be able to do it.

551
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Master.

552
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
Master.

553
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
Master.

554
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
What are you doing here?

555
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,500
Do you need anything?

556
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Pandora.

557
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:14,500
Call them in.

558
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
Give it to me.

559
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
You should have cut the flesh.

560
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,500
How could you do that?

561
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
That's what I want.

562
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
I'm not cutting it.

563
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,500
I'm just trying to make it look good.

564
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,500
I'm not cutting it.

565
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,500
But if you think you've lost to me last time,

566
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,500
you're not good enough.

567
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,500
How dare you play with me?

568
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,500
Let's go.

569
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
Let's go.

570
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,500
How could you do this to my family?

571
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,500
How could you do this to me?

572
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,500
You know that I don't keep my word.

573
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,500
I have something to say about the lady.

574
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,500
So I asked everyone to come here.

575
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,500
I've been thinking about it for days.

576
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,500
I think I've been wrong about the deposit.

577
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,500
You've been collecting seven times

578
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,500
the amount of money you've collected.

579
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,500
That's right.

580
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Then you should raise the deposit.

581
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,500
You should raise the deposit.

582
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,500
This year is the year of the bear.

583
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,500
If you raise the deposit...

584
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,500
No.

585
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
I've been thinking about it,

586
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,500
but I think there are too many.

587
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,500
Besides, there are few people

588
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,500
who are in the same age group as this year.

589
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,500
Let's split it in half.

590
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,500
Then we should pay half of the deposit

591
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
as the deposit?

592
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Are you going to keep doing this?

593
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Yes.

594
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,500
We'll start this year.

595
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,500
So you should pay the deposit

596
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
that you've collected this year.

597
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,500
Is this really possible?

598
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
Your Highness.

599
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,500
Thank you.

600
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,500
The half-sufficiency system

601
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,500
is the system of dividing the land

602
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
into half.

603
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,500
The land was so vast

604
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,500
that the land was so vast.

605
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,500
It was a great surprise

606
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,500
for the farmers

607
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,500
that they could have half of the production.

608
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
The country became so poor

609
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
that the farmers' lives were in danger.

610
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
The half-sufficiency system

611
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,500
was the most effective way

612
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,500
to prepare the land.

613
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
There's no doubt.

614
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
This is the soup that

615
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
is going to the Choe Won-hyang of Hanyang.

616
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,500
You've collected the grains.

617
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Isn't this all

618
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
the blood of the people

619
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,500
who have no power?

620
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Who are you?

621
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,500
That bastard!

622
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Let's go!

623
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
No!

624
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
Your Highness.

625
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
I'm sorry,

626
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,500
but may I say something?

627
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,500
Half of the collection costs are being deducted.

628
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
That's what you said

629
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,500
during this year's harvest.

630
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,500
If you say so,

631
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,500
can't you at least give me less?

632
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,500
It's not a big deal

633
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
if so many of my customers

634
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,500
are just a grain of rice.

635
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,500
They are customers,

636
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
but they are also teachers

637
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,500
who teach me the world.

638
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
If not for them,

639
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
how can I hear the news

640
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,500
of the harvest in Gyeongju?

641
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Even if we reduce the amount we use,

642
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,500
we don't want to waste the customers' money.

643
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,500
I think I said something wrong.

644
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
Even if we're saving the grain,

645
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
we need to reduce the amount

646
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,500
we use to maintain the harvest.

647
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,500
Yes, I understand what you're worried about.

648
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,500
I was thinking

649
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
if there's a way to increase the profit

650
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,500
as much as the sales.

651
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,500
Bandu, do you happen to have

652
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
any customers from the countryside

653
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
with a big family?

654
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Of the more than 10 customers,

655
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,500
I think it's from the neighborhood.

656
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,500
I'd like to meet them in person.

657
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
Yes, I understand.

658
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,500
So you're saying

659
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,500
you've made the business grow?

660
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,500
I think the neighborhood government

661
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,500
has made a secret deal.

662
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
If it's the neighborhood government...

663
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,500
The domestic market is close to the domestic market,

664
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,500
so if it went well,

665
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,500
I think they were trying to

666
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,500
sell it to foreign countries.

667
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,500
With the money we made from selling the land,

668
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,500
we've crossed the border.

669
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,500
Since we started to build the bridge,

670
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
the people of the border

671
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,500
have been able to survive.

672
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:34,500
Could you tell us more about that?

673
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,500
I'm sorry.

674
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,500
The shop is quite big.

675
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,500
I didn't know it was this big.

676
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,500
It's been a while since I've been here

677
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:58,500
with you, so it reminds me of the old days.

678
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,500
Yes, me too.

679
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,520
Where is the U.S.

680
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,520
intelligence?

681
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,520
It's been a few years since

682
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,520
I came to the U.S. intelligence.

683
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,520
It's been a while since I came to the U.S. intelligence.

684
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:23,520
Sir, isn't that the youngest of the U.S. intelligence?

685
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,520
Yes, that's right.

686
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,520
Makdoong.

687
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,520
Sir.

688
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,520
Have you seen him?

689
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,520
Yes, I came to see your father.

690
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,520
I have something to tell you.

691
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,520
Makdoong.

692
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,520
F really beautiful.

693
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,520
I saw merchants here everyday.

694
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,520
Those thermahan can raise more generates.

695
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,520
Finally, the thermahan has arrived.

696
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,520
The time has come.

697
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,520
Right.

698
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,520
The time is must be coming.

699
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,540
Give you our common realm.

700
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,540
Here are the responsibilities.

701
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:31,540
If you just pay the price, you'll be able to do it.

702
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,540
I think they lowered the price of the small storage room because it's a black-out.

703
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,540
They're thinking of sleeping in the small storage room with the small storage rooms.

704
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,540
Tonight, we will rise!

705
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,540
Think about it carefully.

706
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,540
The Ming family will be in charge of Gyeongju in a year.

707
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:49,540
If there's a military-oriented strategy in Gyeongju, they won't be able to do it.

708
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,540
The Ming family will be in charge of Gyeongju in a year.

709
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,540
If there's a military-oriented strategy in Gyeongju, they won't be able to do it.

710
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,540
If there's a military-oriented strategy in Gyeongju, they won't be able to do it.

711
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,540
If there's a military-oriented strategy in Gyeongju, they won't be able to do it.
