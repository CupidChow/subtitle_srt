1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,300
Look there, look there.

2
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,180
webinar

3
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:24,360
spec

4
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,140
Are you Choi Goksun?

5
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,800
He abducted the Hidan in the top of Jankil Bridge,

7
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,920
Do you know who we are?

8
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,940
We are your loyal sons....

9
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,660
who are stuck in the middle because you're so cheap

10
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,140
Are you talking about the Three B preservation relay?

11
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,640
Yes

12
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,400
That's right, the Historic Ref molestation relay

13
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Isn't it time for you to come in?

14
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Boss...

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,400
It's about time for you to come in.

16
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
Yes!

17
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,900
Come in and take a good look.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,200
If you come in, I'll start working right away.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,700
You can go to Mapo tomorrow and live there.

20
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
Live there!

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,700
Yes!

22
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Look at me with your eyes wide open.

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,500
Whether you come in or not,

24
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
you have to tell me as soon as you come in.

25
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Yes, boss.

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,700
Why are you talking to me in the middle of the night?

27
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,500
It's late at night. You won't sleep?

28
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,300
I'm having trouble sleeping.

29
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I'm too deep to sleep.

30
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Boss...

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
Now I can finally relieve my grief.

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,500
Relieve your grief?

33
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,500
As soon as the pain of my Wonyil disappears.

34
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you talking about?

35
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,500
How? How can the pain of my Wonyil disappear?

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,500
I carried you like a tiger.

37
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,000
You're not a tiger in the middle of the night.

38
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I carried you like the chief judge of the royal court, Choi Yeon-young.

39
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,500
If you do as the chief judge tells you,

40
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,500
you will be given a promise to relieve your grief.

41
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,500
Oh my goodness! Is this true?

42
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,500
I will relieve my grief,

43
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,500
and my grief, and my grief.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Besides,

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,500
Jang Gil-taek and Choi Gok-sun will be the finalists.

46
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
What?

47
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
My son.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,500
Please save me.

49
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Please save my life.

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

51
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Do you know that your life is important?

52
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Do you know that they are not ready to put off their lives with this knife?

53
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
What are these people?

54
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
What are they doing?

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
They are throwing away the cutting board.

56
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
What is this?

57
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,500
The highest prize is 500,000 times 100,000 times.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
The next lucky person is you.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,500
Aomansingpujing Entertainment Center, 931-931.com

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,500
Please help me.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,500
These people...

62
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
How can you kill me?

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
What are you doing?

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,500
What's going on?

65
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,460
The people are buying the

66
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
coal from the coal mine.

67
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
If we start buying the coal from a big company like Jang Gil-taek,

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,500
we don't know what will happen.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,500
The middlemen like us will starve to death.

70
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,500
The workers are already sitting and looking at the wall.

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,500
There are seven people who have to feed them.

72
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Most of us started from the head of the company.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,500
We were so heavy that we were about to fall.

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,500
We were so tired that we were about to break our legs.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,500
We wanted to live a life of peace and prosperity.

76
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,500
We have to go out and do some work.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,500
What kind of work is this?

78
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
It's a life of death.

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
It's a life of death.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,500
I can starve to death.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,500
But what kind of crime do the families commit?

82
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
It's the Jang Gil-taek Company.

83
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Are these people right?

84
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
It's true.

85
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Why did you do that?

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,500
Why did you cut off other people's food?

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,500
You should eat together.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,500
I know. I know.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,500
I know. I know.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,500
They are greedy.

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,500
Right? Am I right?

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,500
They are farmers. They are going to eat everything.

93
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,500
They are greedy. Can't you control them?

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If you eat little by little, you can eat together.

95
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,000
What did I say?

96
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,500
I said it's hard to do business.

97
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Business is...

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You can't see it when you see money.

99
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Business is good.

101
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,000
But you told me to build a farm together.

102
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,000
This land.

103
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,000
You told me to build a farm together.

104
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,000
If you don't have land, you'll be punished.

105
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,000
You...

106
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
You should talk to your leader.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Make a farm for them.

108
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,000
What can you do?

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,500
You should live well with this rich world.

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Let's stop here.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,500
Let's get rid of them.

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,500
Okay.

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's go.

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,500
You guys.

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,500
You guys are going to be killed.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,500
I've solved your problems.

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,500
You said your problem is a fire.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,500
A fire is a statue that moves up.

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,500
And you're going to be killed.

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,500
If you do something wrong, you'll die.

122
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,000
You should be gentle.

123
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,000
Otherwise, everything will be solved.

124
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,000
How can I thank you?

125
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you very much.

126
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,000
If it weren't for you, I would have been in trouble.

127
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't mention it.

128
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't know, but they didn't want to hurt you.

129
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,000
They wanted you to live.

130
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,000
That's why they did that.

131
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Who would do that?

132
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know what to do.

133
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,000
I thought the way to help farmers was the right way.

134
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,500
But I didn't think that the middle-aged son was also

135
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,000
a good person.

136
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,000
That's what business is.

137
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,000
If someone wants to get something,

138
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,000
they have to cry.

139
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,000
You don't look like a bad person.

140
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,000
If you want to change something, take your time.

141
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,000
Take your time.

142
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm Choi Guk-seon.

143
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,000
What's your name?

144
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,000
My name is Yoo Yeong-won.

145
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,000
You can call me Ban Gye.

146
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
You're older than me, so I'll call you brother.

147
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,000
Brother?

148
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,000
We're friends.

149
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,500
I'll call you brother.

150
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
Okay.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,500
Will you call me brother too?

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,500
What are you talking about?

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,500
I don't have a brother.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,500
Just call me brother.

155
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,500
We're all the same.

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,500
It's no use.

157
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:45,000
I'd be happy if you all came into this hard world.

158
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,000
Now, call me brother.

159
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,000
Now!

160
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,000
Brother, it sounds good.

161
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,000
It's good.

162
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,000
You're here.

163
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,000
I brought a guest.

164
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,000
He'll stay in my room for a while.

165
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,000
I sent this to Gyeongju.

166
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll be back soon.

167
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,000
You haven't been sleeping well lately.

168
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,000
I was watching you because the stars were shining.

169
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,000
How did you feel?

170
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,000
I was wondering what you felt.

171
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,000
I was curious.

172
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,000
What is it?

173
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,000
You left it to Gukseon.

174
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
He should open it.

175
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,000
I was wondering if it was your heart.

176
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,500
I'm not sure.

177
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,500
I can't imagine what you're feeling.

178
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You'll teach Gukseon the way

179
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,500
to the Northern Castle in the night sky

180
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,500
that you've been longing for.

181
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,000
I really miss you, Father.

182
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,000
Me too.

183
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,000
Isn't this a pig?

184
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,000
Why did the mother send a pig?

185
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,000
It said that you left it for me.

186
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,000
She told me to take it out

187
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,000
when the plague comes.

188
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,000
Did you recognize me?

189
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,000
Ilseon!

190
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,000
Ilseon!

191
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,000
Ilseon!

192
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,000
What are you doing?

193
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,000
Do it.

194
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,000
Why should I take it?

195
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,360
My mother is the one who made the

196
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,500
famous sewing machine in Geundong.

197
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,500
She sent it one by one.

198
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,500
It's a rare opportunity.

199
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,500
Here.

200
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,500
Why did I see you making it?

201
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,500
You're right.

202
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,500
I'll do it.

203
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,500
Go and do it.

204
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,500
It's cold.

205
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,500
It's warm.

206
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,500
Did you cough?

207
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,500
I slept well.

208
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm not feeling well.

209
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
I'm not feeling well.

210
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,500
What is this?

211
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,500
It's a medicine.

212
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,500
It's good for the wound.

213
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,500
The doctor made it for me.

214
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,500
I found out later.

215
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,500
I was in a bad situation.

216
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,500
I was in a bad situation.

217
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,500
I was in a bad situation.

218
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
You were even

219
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,000
punished because of me.

220
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm not crying.

221
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,000
You're not crying?

222
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,000
You still have a lot of blood.

223
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,000
Don't worry.

224
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,000
I'll apply it every day.

225
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,000
Take it.

226
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,000
Here.

227
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Here.

228
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,000
It's pretty.

229
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,000
It's a great color.

230
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,000
You like it, right?

231
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,000
What?

232
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,000
That professor.

233
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,000
Brother.

234
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,500
You like it.

235
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,500
Do you like it?

236
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,500
I didn't mean to see it.

237
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,500
I just wanted to see it.

238
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,500
That's right.

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Are you really not going to listen to me?

240
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,500
I'm not your brother.

241
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,500
Yes.

242
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,500
Brother.

243
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,500
That's right.

244
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,500
The three-point line is in the mapo.

245
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,500
Yes.

246
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,500
There should be no mistake in the process of

247
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,500
passing the three points.

248
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,500
The chief has to take care of it.

249
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,500
Yes.

250
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,500
The three-point line of the Jang Gil-taek team

251
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,500
is in.

252
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

253
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,000
It's time.

254
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
How is it?

255
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,000
It's bright, right?

256
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,000
Listen to me well from now on.

257
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,000
If you do as you are,

258
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,000
this money is yours.

259
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,000
Just leave it to me.

260
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,000
Today is a day full of water.

261
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,000
Hurry up.

262
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,000
Come this way.

263
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll put the truck down there.

264
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,000
Chief.

265
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,000
What are you doing here?

266
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,000
I came all the way here to talk about it.

267
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,500
I'm so busy with the three-point line.

268
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,500
Just give me a few days to get a warehouse.

270
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,500
My grandfather has a lot of money

271
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,500
and I can't afford to take it all.

272
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,500
It's not easy to get a warehouse.

273
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,500
You have to move the empty warehouse

274
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,500
and the pile of water.

275
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,000
Our workers are moving the pile of water

276
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,000
but it's not enough.

277
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,000
Just a few days.

278
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,000
You can just make a few days.

279
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,000
I heard that the deadline for the warehouse

280
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,000
is very short.

281
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,000
Will the rice be rotten?

282
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,000
Or will it be rotten in a few days?

283
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,500
What do you think?

284
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,500
You've been holding back for a while.

285
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,500
It's been a long time since I made a plan

286
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,500
because Choi Guk-sung saved the dam.

287
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,500
What good will it do to me?

288
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,500
Don't say that.

289
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,500
If you say that once,

290
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,500
I won't give up.

291
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,500
Just wait a little bit

292
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,500
and you'll know.

293
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,500
Just one warehouse at Jang Il-taek's house.

294
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,500
Just one warehouse?

295
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,500
Yes, yes.

296
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,500
Then I'll try one more time.

297
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,500
Tell your master to keep the contract.

298
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,500
If there's something to go,

299
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,500
there should be something to come.

300
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,500
Of course.

301
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,500
I'll just trust you.

302
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,500
Master, bring me the equipment.

303
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,500
Yes.

304
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,500
Do you have a warehouse to empty right now?

305
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,500
Yes.

306
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,500
I have a few.

307
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,500
Father, is that true?

308
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,500
Yes, son.

309
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,500
Just give me a good news.

310
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,000
Give me a good news.

311
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,000
The expulsion of the new song

312
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,000
will be the responsibility of the country.

313
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,000
It will be a great help to the country.

314
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,000
It's a great help.

315
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,000
So,

316
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,000
you're the one who's talking to you.

317
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,000
Isn't it your duty to catch those bad guys

318
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,000
and punish them?

319
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,000
If you catch the criminals who take the new song,

320
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,500
you'll get a bigger reward.

321
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,500
Isn't it?

322
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,500
Of course.

323
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,500
Besides, do you know who they are?

324
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,500
They are the people of Janggil Taek.

325
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,500
They take the new song.

326
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,500
It's not right.

327
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,500
They're the ones who gave the fish to the cat.

328
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,000
Did you say they're the people of Janggil Taek?

329
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,000
The expulsion of the new song

330
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,000
will be carried out in a thorough manner.

331
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,000
So, don't be too concerned about it.

332
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,000
Yes.

333
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,000
But,

334
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,000
Kim Soo Man will take care of him.

335
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,500
He'll be killed and buried.

336
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,500
So, we should make sure

337
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,500
that he doesn't get involved.

338
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,500
But,

339
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,500
what do you mean?

340
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,500
We should say that they took the fish

341
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,500
and put the fish in the Janggil Taek's house.

342
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,500
The expulsion of the new song

343
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,500
has caused a lot of controversy.

344
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,500
That's right.

345
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,500
I'm not sure if Janggil Taek

346
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,500
is just following our plan.

347
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,500
He's a tough guy.

348
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,500
He's not an easy man.

349
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,500
So, I have an idea.

350
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,500
Captain Podo,

351
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,000
I think there's a man

352
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,000
who can trust me.

353
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,000
I have a feeling.

354
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,000
I think I'll have to drink more.

355
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,500
Come and have a drink with me.

356
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,500
I don't know what you mean.

357
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,500
You said you wanted to open the door

358
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,500
when the people were pushing in.

359
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,500
It's like you've already guessed

360
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,500
how I feel.

361
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,500
What's so painful about it?

362
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,500
I'm just trying to earn money

363
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,000
and get back into the family.

364
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,000
I wanted to be a nurse.

365
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,000
I came all the way to Hanyang,

366
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,000
and I'm glad I came to this company.

367
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,000
I've never made money in my life,

368
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,000
but I'm not sure if it's right

369
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,000
for me to make money like this.

370
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,000
Do you see this?

371
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,000
What?

372
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,000
What do you think has changed?

373
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,000
What?

374
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,000
Has the food in the kitchen increased

375
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,000
or decreased?

376
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,000
It's still the same.

377
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,000
This is what you call business.

378
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,000
You move things here,

379
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,000
and there.

380
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,000
What a nice man.

381
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,000
He's still in time.

382
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,000
Excuse me?

383
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,000
This is what you call business.

384
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,000
Look. How is it?

385
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,000
The table is full now that I put one more plate.

386
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,000
Then I'll be full even more.

387
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,000
No matter how many plates I put on the table,

388
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,500
the contents will remain the same,

389
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,500
but if I put one more plate on the farm,

390
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,500
the table will be much better.

391
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,500
It's easy for me and others to live well together, right?

392
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,500
You are that kind of person.

393
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,500
Do you see your heart like that?

394
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,500
Then,

395
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,000
how about making things instead of buying or selling things?

396
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,000
Making things?

397
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,000
Yes, making things.

398
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,000
Don't ask someone else.

399
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,000
You can produce more and share more.

400
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,000
What happened?

401
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,000
As you said, I put everything in the safe.

402
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,000
Good.

403
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,000
Prepare everything as I told you.

404
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,000
Yes, sir.

405
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,000
The Great God will not meet anyone now.

406
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,000
He will not meet anyone.

407
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,500
The Great God will not meet anyone now.

408
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,500
He said he wanted to be alone.

409
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,500
It's cold.

410
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,000
Why is the weather so weak this year?

411
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,000
You have worked hard.

412
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,000
Who is it?

413
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,000
It's from the Great God.

414
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,000
It's cold, but I want you to drink warmly.

415
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,000
The Great God?

416
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm a farmer, so I can't drink.

417
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,500
The Great God must have sent you a drink.

418
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,500
Where can I put the drink in the bottle?

419
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,500
It's a warm soup.

420
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,500
If you drink, your body will be warm.

421
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,000
I should have brought it.

422
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,000
What are you doing?

423
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,500
Hurry up.

425
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,500
Hurry up.

426
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,000
Don't worry.

428
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,000
I can find the way back.

429
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,000
Are you sure?

430
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,000
Just trust me.

431
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm sure I can find the way back.

432
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,000
The Great God has escaped.

433
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,000
If the Great God falls,

434
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,000
what will happen to Hanhaeng?

435
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,000
I can call you Dan.

436
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:40,000
Dan, I think I should leave Hanhaeng.

437
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,000
I don't think I should stay here.

438
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,000
Miss.

439
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,000
No, I don't have any place to stay.

440
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,000
The moonlight is so beautiful.

441
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,000
I want to do my hair by myself.

442
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,000
The most exciting game on the line.

443
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,000
The mahjong is over.

444
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,000
The gold queen is looking for the gold city.

445
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,000
The gold captain is the most violent.

446
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,000
The next lucky one is you.

447
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,000
Macau New Peking Entertainment City 931 931.com

448
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,000
Miss.

449
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,000
I wish I could see Hanhaeng.

450
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,500
I wish I could see Hanhaeng.

451
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,500
You're not fully recovered.

452
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,500
But why?

453
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,500
I have to see her.

454
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,500
I'll find a way to see her.

455
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,500
I'll find a way to see her.

456
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,500
What do you mean?

457
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,500
You're leaving Hanhaeng?

458
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,500
I think so.

459
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,000
Is it because of your father?

460
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,500
I heard that you two were accused of

461
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
passing the secret letter to the priest.

462
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,000
Please understand.

463
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,000
Your father was a Hanrae official.

464
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,000
He had to go through all the hardships

465
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,000
to become a great leader.

466
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,000
I don't have any resentment for the old man.

467
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,000
I was forced to die

468
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,000
because I thought I had to make a profit

469
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,000
from the country of the enemy.

470
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,000
But how can I accuse a great leader?

471
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,000
But...

472
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,000
I have realized it now.

473
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,000
I...

474
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,000
have a different path to take.

475
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,000
Master.

476
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,000
I came to Hanhaeng and saw the world

477
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,000
and learned a lot.

478
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,000
But the more I learn, the more I learn.

479
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,000
I have to go deeper into the people.

480
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,000
No matter how much wealth I collect,

481
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,500
if I make others suffer like this,

482
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,500
what's the point?

483
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,500
Now...

484
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,500
I want to go back to my hometown

485
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,500
and start a new life.

486
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,500
Can't you change your mind?

487
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,500
I thought about it deeply.

488
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,500
I wanted to tell you this.

489
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,500
The happiest thing for me

490
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,500
in Hanhaeng was...

491
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,500
meeting you again.

492
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,500
Please, go back to your hometown.

493
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,500
Master Kuk Sun.

494
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,500
I chose this path.

495
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Hanhaeng.

496
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:10,500
Even if you're sad when you die,

497
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,500
please stay like this.

498
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,000
I hope you can look at me.

499
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,000
I love you.

500
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,000
Master!

501
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,000
Master!

502
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,000
What are you doing?

503
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,000
The chief of the Janggyeul team took three of our men

504
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,000
and they're trying to escape.

505
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,000
The police are saying that they've closed their eyes.

506
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,000
What are you doing?

507
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,000
Go and arrest them.

508
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,000
Yes, sir!

509
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,000
Search every corner of the warehouse!

510
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,000
Yes, sir!

511
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,000
I'll take everything.

512
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,000
I won't leave anything.

513
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,000
I won't leave a single thing

514
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,000
that you can count on.

515
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,000
I'll make it so that no one else can count on me.

516
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,000
Yes, sir!

517
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,000
The Janggyeul team's warehouse was definitely there.

518
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,000
Let's go!

519
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,000
Let's go!

520
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,000
Let's go!

521
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,000
Let's go!

522
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,000
Let's go!

523
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,000
Who is it?

524
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,000
Mandu!

525
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,000
Take the brother and get out of here!

526
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,000
Yes, sir!

527
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,000
Master!

528
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,000
Brother!

529
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,000
Brother!

530
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,000
Hanyeol!

531
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,000
Let's get out of here!

532
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,000
Let's go!

533
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,000
Let's go!

534
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,000
Let's go!

535
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,000
Let's go!

536
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,000
Let's go!

537
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,000
Let's go!

538
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,000
Master!

539
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,000
Master is down there!

540
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,000
Master!

541
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,000
Master!

542
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,000
No!

543
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,000
Master is not here!

544
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,000
It's dangerous!

545
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,000
I'll go.

546
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,000
Let's go!

547
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,000
Run!

548
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,000
Brother!

549
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,000
Master!

550
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,000
Master!

551
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,000
Master!

552
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,000
Master!

553
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,000
Master!

554
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,000
The End
