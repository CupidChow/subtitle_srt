I will never ask you to do this again.

110
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Don't cry.

111
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I know you're crying.

112
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
My lady is not that kind of person.

113
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
What are you talking about?

114
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Don't worry.

115
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I have the law.

116
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I will not let anyone without sin.

117
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Do you really think the law will protect you?

118
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
My lady, what should I do?

119
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I promised you that I would take your life.

120
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You trusted me and I trusted you.

121
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I will never ask you to do this again.

122
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Don't cry.

123
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000

124
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000

No shoes.

131
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Why didn't he have a god?

132
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
My lady!

133
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Sir, the young master is here.

134
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,760
Bandol sent this to you.

135
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,300
Here.

136
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,540
Bandol...

137
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,480
You take so long to pack all this.

138
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,380
Why did you send this?

139
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,380
I'm sorry.

140
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,380
I sent a letter and money to you.

141
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,380
Please don't open it.

142
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,380
Your father said that

143
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,380
the master of the country, Konichi, said that

144
00:46:52,380 --> 00:47:03,380
Konichi is the worst and the best of the 64 main regions.

145
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:11,380
The master's life changes depending on what kind of bowl he puts in.

146
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,380
Your father was happy with the independence of the country,

147
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:26,380
but he was especially worried that he would lose his loyalty.

148
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,380
Seeing how he was sending money from Hanyang,

149
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:39,380
I'm worried that he didn't lose his loyalty.

150
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:50,380
The great son has returned with the best art in the world

151
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,380
afterальury andBERGENES responsibility.

152
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:07,380
Perhaps he needs that joy for himself.

153
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,380
Of course.

154
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,380
What do you mean?

155
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:20,380
This is a message from the father to the motherland before he left.

156
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,380
Doctor.

157
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,380
I told you it was true.

158
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:33,380
I will find all the gold and silver thorns as soon as possible.

159
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:38,380
But I was surprised to hear that there was a man who sold the thorns.

160
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,380
Here.

161
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,380
This?

162
00:48:51,380 --> 00:49:01,380
I thought he was a god of the world, but he was a merchant.

163
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,380
I asked him to sell the thorns.

164
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:13,380
I thought I could get a good price if I saw his small hands.

165
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,380
Do you know who he is?

166
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,380
I don't know.

167
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,380
So...

168
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:28,380
Hurry up. We don't have time to be like this.

169
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,380
So, who does he live with?

170
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:53,380
Go through this bridge and turn over two hills and turn around.

171
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:59,380
You can find a man who looks like a god.

172
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,380
I know who he is.

173
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,380
We will buy the thorns.

174
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,380
Let's go.

175
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,380
He's good.

176
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,380
What is he doing here?

177
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,380
He stole the thorns from your house.

178
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,380
He's the one who taught me how to play the guitar.

179
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,380
No, no, no.

180
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,380
I'm going to kill you.

181
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,380
I'm going to kill you too.

182
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,380
Are you the one who killed Shim Jung-hak?

183
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,380
No, no, no.

184
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,380
I'm not.

185
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:20,380
Then why did you have the thorn of the dead?

186
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,380
I heard it.

187
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:30,380
If you don't do as I say, I'll send you to jail.

188
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,380
You'd better hurry up.

189
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,380
If you make him angry, it won't be fun.

190
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,380
When I was there, he was already dead.

191
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,380
I thought it was a waste to go to the dead.

192
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,380
And there was a letter in the sleeve.

193
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:58,380
I thought it would be money, so I brought it.

194
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,380
It's true.

195
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,380
There's nothing else.

196
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,380
Why did the woman come at night?

197
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:16,380
What woman? Are you sure?

198
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,380
I swear by your life.

199
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,380
I saw your face.

200
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:28,380
When I saw your body, my face was pale.

201
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,380
I was so happy that I took it out.

202
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,380
But you said it was a mistake.

203
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,380
This is the result of the investigation.

204
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:49,380
This is the handprint of the man.

205
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,380
The man is the culprit.

206
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,380
You're crying.

207
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,380
Are you defending the murderer?

208
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,380
Please don't say that.

209
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,380
Before you can be guilty,

210
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,380
you should not be accused of being a criminal.

211
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,380
Another thing is that

212
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,380
it is assumed that Shim Jeong-hak was caught in a fight after death.

213
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,380
This is impossible with the power of the woman.

214
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:23,380
The culprit is definitely a man.

215
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,380
There may be accomplices.

216
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,380
Oh, my God. It's not coming out quickly.

217
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,380
Why does it take so long to find a letter?

218
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,380
Do you really need a letter?

219
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,380
The dead man had it.

220
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,380
It will be a witness with the fake.

221
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,380
We must take it with us.

222
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:55,380
Sir, isn't this a rabbit?

223
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,380
I need a way to find something.

224
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,380
The murderer is the murderer.

225
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,380
Do you want to get back at me?

226
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,380
You like that professor, don't you?

227
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,380
Search every corner of the room.

228
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,380
You said that you were tired of the money.

229
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,380
You said that you were tired of the business.

230
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,380
He is the murderer.

231
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,380
You leave it to me.
