1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't you know?

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I have a answer.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Look!

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is the answer!

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Brother,

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
what are you talking about?

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why did you

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
build the land?

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's it.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You must have built the land for farming.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You want to

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
produce a crop

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
or a grain with your own hands.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then,

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
can't you do it without land?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Look! The land is far away.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Brother,

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the land is not all the same.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Look!

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What kind of farming do you do on this land?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You can make it.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can make the empty land, the abandoned land,

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
into a farmland.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You can make the abandoned land, the abandoned land,

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
into a farmland.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You said you need to produce

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
more rice because you lack rice.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you don't have a farm,

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
you can make a farm without it.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But,

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the abandoned land

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is not the power of the Han people.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
There is a way, but there is no way.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Brother,

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you came a long way.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You should stay a few more days.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I just want to see you

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and have a drink.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you leave like this,

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
when will we meet again?

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's not like that

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
even if a person seems to be breaking up.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wherever I am,

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I can breathe the air

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
that I breathe.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You will breathe the air that I breathe.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So, people who have the same

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
thoughts and feelings

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
will eventually be together in this world.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll go.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Brother.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't make a dog face

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
that's so clumsy.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Father, you go first.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to see

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
your strong back.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Come on.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Brother,

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
be strong.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You too.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Father,

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
don't worry.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you can't dream

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
because you have nothing,

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
then all hope in this world

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
will disappear.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
When you have nothing,

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you can start.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The more you have,

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the more impossible it is to start.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You might

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
start something

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
that no one else does.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will never give up.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I will stand up

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
in this land.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I will.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's good.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's spacious.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, it's good.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's so bright.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I can't see the welcome.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You should

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
be able to see

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that Kim Ja-chun

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
welcomed you.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
From now on,

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you should

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
look at the history

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
of the Choi family,

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and tell me

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
everything.

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Then you can't do

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
what the Choi family does.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You will be upset.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm back.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So it's time to start.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I will pay

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
back

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the debt.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Father,

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the son has become

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
a beggar.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
for showing you

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
his ugly side.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No,

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
there's no need to feel bad.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If you lost money

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
because you were deceived,

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
it's not because you

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
were a fool.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That money

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
wasn't yours.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
From the beginning,

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
think that it wasn't

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the money you should have.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You are right.

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If you lost

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
money,

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you might be

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
upset and angry.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're worried.

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sure

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you're happy

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to have lost money.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But it's only

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
a poison in your life.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You should just forget it.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
for your mother.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I want to start

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
a business.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I want to tell you

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
in advance.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What is it?

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I want to start

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
a business.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
A business?

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't have money to buy land.

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So I want to

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
start a business.

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have a good idea.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's useless to

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
throw away

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
what you've earned.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's not good

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
to change it.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's not a business

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that's been done

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
for years.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you can't do it alone.

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You need people.

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Father.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll think of a way.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Do it.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But you need to be strong.

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No one can do it

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
without knowing the truth.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, father.

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm ready.

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Do you have

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the land?

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Check if you have the land.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go to Hwan-ah and check.

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes, father.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What?

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're going to start a business?

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're going to start a business

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and start a farm?

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't have

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
money to lend you.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I can't lend you even if I have.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Father.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I was going to

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
visit your house

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
one day.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I heard that you

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
started a business in Hanyang.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You can't

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
disgrace our family.

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
swear to God

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I didn't do anything

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that would disgrace the family.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I earned enough money

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and learned a lot from it.

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Then

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
with that money

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you can start a farm

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
or start a farm.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Do whatever you want.

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And don't come

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to my house again.

209
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes.

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I thought you were dead

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
but I'm not.

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll go.

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Father.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Father.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is all your fault.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you didn't get scammed

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
by those 200 sheep

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
what would our father

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and family have to do?

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Stop it.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm not

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
scammed.

223
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What are you talking about?

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You did a good job.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Where is that

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
little boy?

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Hey.

228
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Put this in.

229
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's do it.

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes, sir.

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's go.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Sir.

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Please.

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you, sir.

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Come on.

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh my.

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Even the mountain is high.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Isn't that Kim Ja-chun?

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Watch your mouth.

240
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What are you going to do?

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The company is not

242
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
doing well.

243
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Even the son is

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
not doing well.

245
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What did you do?

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Why did you come back?

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What do you want?

248
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Get out of my way.

249
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Do you remember me?

250
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Who are you?

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You are a god.

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You are a god.

253
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You are a god.

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I will kick you out of the village.

255
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Are you human?

256
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I remember you very well.

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you have a good item?

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You can choose.

259
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If you have an item that I like,

260
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I can buy you

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
this whole thing.

262
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You can do that for me.

263
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
How about this?

264
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is a good item.

265
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't like

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
things in the village.

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What are you doing?

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I made a mistake.

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Do I have to bite this thing?

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Do I have to bite this thing?

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I made a mistake.

274
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I made a mistake.

276
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I made a mistake again.

278
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What are you looking at?

279
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What are you looking at?

280
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What are you going to do?

281
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What are you going to do?

282
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You crazy people.

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Listen up!

284
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If you are not careful,

285
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
you will be

286
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
in the bottom of the well

287
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and it will be difficult to eat and drink.

288
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Why are you lying here?

289
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You know,

290
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
our subordinates only get

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
trained in martial arts

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
during winter.

293
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
In other times,

294
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
this house was farming,

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
so they could build a house

296
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and make a house.

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We should have been more careful.

298
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You know,

299
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
we should have been more careful.

300
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We should have been more careful.

301
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We should have been more careful.

302
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This house was farming,

303
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
so they could build a house.

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Isn't that right?

305
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Master!

306
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Master!

307
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, my.

308
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Master!

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What are you talking about?

310
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Be happy.

311
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I think I can borrow money.

312
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I think I can borrow money.

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What?

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Where?

315
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Now,

316
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I will only take what is decided.

317
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Thank you.

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You are welcome.

319
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
We are the ones who

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
give back the money

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
when we have the money.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I heard you are good at writing.

323
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Did you see that?

324
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You are good at writing.

325
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You are good at writing.

326
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But,

327
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
how long do we have to pay back?

328
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
How long do we have to pay back?

329
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
How long do we have to pay back?

330
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
If you give me the interest on the right day,

331
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If you give me the interest on the right day,

332
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
you can pay it back later, right?

333
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yes.

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I will pay it back

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
when I have the money.

336
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Thank you.

337
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Please take a look.

338
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Did you finish it well?

339
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I think it went as planned.

340
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I think it went as planned.

341
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Good job.

342
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What do you mean?

343
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Why are you giving the money to that useless guy?

344
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Why are you giving the money to that useless guy?

345
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Lim Ja,

346
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
you just have to

347
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
eat the rice cake.

348
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You will know when the time comes.

349
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You will know when the time comes.

350
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You will know when the time comes.

351
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What do you want me to check in the government?

352
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What do you want me to check in the government?

353
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Please check that the land I am going to build

354
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
is a place without a tenant.

355
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
After the construction of the building,

356
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
if the tenant of the museum appears late

357
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and claims the rights,

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
what would be more difficult than that?

359
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What would be more difficult than that?

360
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Honey,

361
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
are you trying to prove that

362
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
there is no problem?

363
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Sir,

364
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
the Ministry of the Interior

365
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
is also recommending it.

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So you are saying

367
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
that I should cooperate

368
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
instead of the military?

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That is not what I meant.

370
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I will let you know about it,

371
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
but do you know

372
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
how much

373
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
study you need to do now?

374
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Your request

375
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
is really a cumbersome task.

376
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Thank you, Sato.

377
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I have searched the land you mentioned

378
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
in the government office.

379
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
How is it?

380
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Do not worry and go ahead.

381
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There is no doubt that the land is a place without a tenant.

382
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You can register the land

383
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
in the government office after you go ahead.

384
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Thank you very much.

385
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I have searched the land you mentioned.

386
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Good job.

387
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You can't even manage

388
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
the land registered in the government office.

389
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
How could you

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
check the owner of the land?

391
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What a strange case.

392
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What a strange case.

393
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Look at that guy.

394
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He is a poor man.

395
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
How could you

396
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
control the land?

397
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
How could you

398
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
control the land?

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What did you say?

400
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You two should

401
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
not fight.

402
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Just work hard.

403
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It seems to be going well.

404
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Father.

405
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Master.

406
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
How did you get here?

407
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Everyone is suffering

408
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
from the land.

409
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
How could you just stay here?

410
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Father.

411
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What a strange case.

412
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I can't work anymore.

413
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You are working with

414
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
a poor man like him?

415
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You don't have to work hard.

416
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You don't have to work hard.

417
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
We are much better than

418
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
the old people.

419
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What did you say?

420
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What did you say?

421
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You should think about work.

422
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Why are you so easy?

423
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I know.

424
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You said you had two bags of rice today.

425
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Look at you.

426
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You are working for hours.

427
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You are working for hours.

428
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
How could you work like us?

429
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You are right.

430
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I will listen to you.

431
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What if I do?

432
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The boss is here.

433
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Come on.

434
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Come on.

435
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Come on.

436
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's time to meet.

437
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Hurry up.

438
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's time to meet.

439
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Hurry up.

440
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's time to meet.

441
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Hurry up.

442
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Sir.

443
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The old man and the old woman

444
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
should not come tomorrow.

445
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Stop it.

446
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I told you not to give me rice.

447
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I am not a child.

448
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I am not a child.

449
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I have a lot of complaints.

450
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I will not come tomorrow.

451
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I am sorry.

452
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
How could you do this to the people who came to work?

453
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Leave it.

454
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I have a good idea.

455
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
What is it?

456
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
What do you mean?

457
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Is it a problem to protect the castle?

458
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Don't get me wrong.

459
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It is easy to

460
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
buy the people's support.

461
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Please allow me.

462
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It is my duty to protect the castle

463
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
and the castle.

464
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Of course.

465
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I understand you.

466
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I understand you.

467
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But last fall,

468
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I ordered the punishment.

469
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
A few hundred soldiers

470
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
left Gyeongju.

471
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
What?

472
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
A few hundred soldiers

473
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
fled the country.

474
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
What would they do?

475
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
They would become firemen

476
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
or the people who

477
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
cause problems.

478
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It is the duty of the people.

479
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I will do as the rules say.

480
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Those who are dissatisfied

481
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
with the castle and the castle

482
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
will be punished.

483
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I understand.

484
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I understand.

485
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But I will not let

486
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
anything happen to the people.

487
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
If that happens,

488
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I will be in trouble.

489
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I will be careful.

490
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
As I said,

491
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
the amount of rice you work

492
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
today is two times the amount of rice.

493
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
However,

494
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
depending on the amount of work

495
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
you do,

496
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
you will be paid.

497
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
From half the amount of rice

498
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
to one hundred thousand rice,

499
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
depending on the amount

500
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
you work today,

501
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
you will be paid more.

502
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Good.

503
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So you will be paid more?

504
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yes.

505
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Our company

506
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
pays the part of the pay

507
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
to the workers who have left

508
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
this part.

509
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
If everyone gets the same amount,

510
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
we will be able to pay you.

511
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Come on.

512
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Let's go.

513
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Come on.

514
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Father.

515
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What is it?

516
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Father,

517
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I thought you would be against

518
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:23,720
the

519
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,880
開心 만큼

520
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:48,380
먹

521
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,160
The clears were destroyed during the hunting.

522
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,660
Father

523
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,160
Your underling

524
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,420
The father never understood

525
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,860
His Getting

526
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,000
Such a big loss

527
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,060
As for land

528
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,060
I will not lose the value of a human being.

529
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:33,060
The sweat that has been spilled on this land will return with that much wealth.

530
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,060
This land will be worth a hundred times more than labor.

531
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,060
Now, I think this is enough.

532
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,060
This is enough.

533
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,060
Father.

534
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,060
Good job.

535
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
Huh?

536
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Uncle! You've worked a lot today.

537
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,060
You can get half of the salary.

538
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,060
Thank you.

539
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,060
Good job.

540
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,060
Thank you.

541
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,060
Take care.

542
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,060
Just two.

543
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,060
You have to work harder tomorrow and get paid.

544
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,060
Yes, I will.

545
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,060
Good job.

546
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,060
Take care.

547
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
Two.

548
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,060
Thank you.

549
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,060
Thank you.

550
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,060
Wait a moment.

551
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,060
Huh?

552
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,060
Master.

553
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,060
He has worked hard enough to get paid.

554
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,060
Master, he doesn't work as hard as others.

555
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,060
He gives you two times more.

556
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,060
You've worked hard today.

557
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,060
Thank you, Master.

558
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,060
Thank you.

559
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,060
Wait, wait.

560
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,060
Master.

561
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:07,060
I think that there is not one standard for a good worker.

562
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,060
How can you evaluate his work with just one amount?

563
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:21,060
He has worked hard all day today, leading the high-ranking workers.

564
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,060
He may be inferior to young workers,

565
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:30,060
but he must have done better than others in his age.

566
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,060
He did his best.

567
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:40,060
It is difficult to repay his hard work with that sincerity.

568
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,060
Next.

569
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,060
Two.

570
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
Thank you.

571
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,060
Thank you.

572
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,060
The highest rank is here.

573
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:09,060
Master Kim Ja Chun has sent a message to you.

574
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,060
Thank you.

575
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,060
I've heard about you from a long time ago.

576
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,060
Welcome to the city of Peking.

577
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,060
You are the next lucky one.

578
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,060
Aomansingpujingyulecheng931931.com

579
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,060
You manage the property, right?

580
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,060
Yes.

581
00:33:54,060 --> 00:34:00,060
If you need anything in the future, I will get it at any time.

582
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:06,060
Ah, it's not necessary.

583
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,060
I have a place to use my heart these days.

584
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,060
Tell me.

585
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:25,060
I heard that there are many houses in the south of Peking.

586
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,060
This is my land, right?

587
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,060
Yes.

588
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:53,060
Now the land of Peking is coming into the hands of Kim Ja Chun.

589
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,060
It feels different from living in the land in Hanyang.

590
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,060
Of course.

591
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,060
I have been waiting for this day.

592
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,060
Are you sure there are no problems with the oil?

593
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,060
Of course.

594
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,060
I can't do anything on the weekend.

595
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,060
I think I just smell the oil.

596
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,060
If you squeeze it, the oil will...

597
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,060
You have improved.

598
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,060
Yes.

599
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,060
What's wrong?

600
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,060
Everything is good.

601
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,060
Couldn't you have bought it cheaper?

602
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:45,060
I tried to do my best.

603
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,060
I need to listen to the song.

604
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,060
Song?

605
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,060
I'm starving.

606
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,060
I can't sell my land without you.

607
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,060
I'm so hungry.

608
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:07,060
I can't even eat.

609
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,060
I can't believe it.

610
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,060
I can't do this.

611
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:22,060
Go to the priest and get some talismans.

612
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,060
What talismans?

613
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,060
The talismans that make you a monk.

614
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,060
If you don't have the talismans, you can't even sell your old body.

615
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,060
Go to the temple and pray tomorrow.

616
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Pray for the coming of this woman.

617
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,060
Master!

618
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,060
Master!

619
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Master!

620
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,060
They all went to the temple.

621
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,060
Temple?

622
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,060
They said they were going to build a new temple.

623
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:08,060
They took all the talismans.

624
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,060
Master!

625
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,060
Master!

626
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,060
Master!

627
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,060
Master!

628
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,060
Master!

629
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,060
Master!

630
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,060
Master!

631
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,060
Master!

632
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,060
Master!

633
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,060
Master!

634
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,060
Master!

635
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,060
Master!

636
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,060
Master!

637
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,060
Master!

638
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Master!

639
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,060
This is so dirty.

640
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,060
Why is the priest so busy?

641
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,060
It's better to go to the temple.

642
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,060
Otherwise, the talismans will be gone.

643
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,060
What talismans?

644
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,060
When will this end?

645
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,060
This is going to be a disaster.

646
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:20,060
We have to get rid of this talisman and go to the temple.

647
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,060
It's not easy to be a hermit in the temple.

648
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,060
We have to survive.

649
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,060
Stop talking and do your work.

650
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,060
You can't do this.

651
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,060
I have something to discuss with you.

652
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,060
Hey, can you talk to me?

653
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,060
The construction of the desert?

654
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,060
It's just started.

655
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,060
The construction of the desert is the country's job.

656
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,060
The construction of your land is a private business.

657
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,060
I know what's going on.

658
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,060
I know.

659
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:20,060
But it's too much to send all those people to the desert.

660
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,060
We can't find the village.

661
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:27,060
What are you talking about?

662
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,060
You need to build your land.

663
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,060
You want me to reduce the size of the desert?

664
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:40,060
I'm not asking you to make me greedy.

665
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,060
Once the desert becomes a farmland,

666
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I will guarantee the economic rights of all the people who participated.

667
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:54,060
I'm trying to make a way for them and me to live together.

668
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,060
And I'm asking you to take a closer look at the situation

669
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,060
I'm not asking you to take a closer look at the situation

670
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,060
I'm not asking you to take a closer look at the situation

671
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,060
I'm just following my orders.

672
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,060
Is that so?

673
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,060
Yes, it's your position.

674
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,060
I'm sorry.

675
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,060
I'm sorry to make you uncomfortable.

676
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,060
Ibok.

677
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,060
Where is Han Aeng-soo?

678
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:39,060
I heard he came to Gyeongju with you.

679
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:46,060
I don't know that either.

680
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,060
What do you mean you don't know?

681
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,060
He left this place.

682
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,060
I don't know.

683
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,060
You're so good at everything.

684
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,060
I don't think I'm pretty.

685
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,060
I like you.

686
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:25,060
I think it's weird if you're not pretty.

687
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,060
I'm going to put alcohol in this box.

688
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,060
What?

689
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,060
If you put alcohol in it, you can sell it at a higher price.

690
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:41,060
It will be a little more expensive, but you can make a lot more.

691
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,060
Han Aeng-soo?

692
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:52,060
I heard that you will buy 20 of these.

693
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,060
20?

694
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,060
Do you have any gift for me?

695
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,060
I'm going to the store.

696
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,060
I'm the hightower.

697
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,060
You go to the house and buy more tea leaves.

698
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,060
You have to hurry before the sun goes down.

699
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,060
Yes.

700
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,060
Why are you doing that?

701
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,060
You can bring five more.

702
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,060
Here you go.

703
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,060
Thank you.

704
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,060
Excuse me.

705
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:32,060
I have a lot of work to do today.

706
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,060
I'm going to the store.

707
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,060
Excuse me.

708
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,060
Didn't you live in Gyeongju before?

709
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,060
Don't you know me?

710
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,060
I'm not everything.

711
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:26,060
You don't have to feed us for a hundred days in this town.

712
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,060
Don't treat us like beggars.

713
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:35,060
I think it's because of the cold sweat, cold hands and cold feet.

714
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,060
It's a medicine from our family.

715
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,060
I'm sorry.

716
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:54,060
I didn't know I would meet you like this.

717
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,060
You must have grown a lot.

718
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,060
Yes, I have 19 children.

719
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,060
It's all thanks to you.

720
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:11,060
If I had been wrong during the crisis, I wouldn't be here today.

721
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:17,060
I moved to the neighborhood after I got a job in Gyeongju.

722
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:23,060
I'm not worried about living a good life.

723
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,060
That's great.

724
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:32,060
I don't know what to say.

725
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,060
I was going to sell one of the stores.

726
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,060
If you don't mind, could you take care of it?

727
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:45,060
I heard you once ran a business in the Hanyang market.

728
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:51,060
I wanted someone who had experience in the business to help me.

729
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:56,060
That's too unexpected.

730
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,060
You need someone to trust.

731
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:03,060
Makdoong is the savior of life.

732
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:10,060
I heard that you should be thankful for what you have.

733
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:24,060
Sir, are you going to fire me now?

734
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,060
I'm going to look for workers in the market.

735
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,060
I can't find anyone to work for.

736
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:40,060
I just thought it was right to keep farming in the land.

737
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:47,060
Sir, aren't you the son of Jeong Junsa?

738
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,060
Let's go.

739
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,060
Fire!

740
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,060
What's going on?

741
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,060
Get him!

742
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,060
Are you all right?

743
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,060
Stop!

744
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,060
Stop!

745
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,060
You're a good night watcher.

746
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,060
Let's go.

747
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,060
Are you coming?

748
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,060
Let me go.

749
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,060
Come on.

750
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,060
Stand up straight.

751
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:39,060
I did find him, but I can't trust him.

752
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,060
He followed me.

753
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:48,060
Did you eat?

754
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,060
Eat slowly.

755
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,060
Someone might eat it.

756
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:56,060
He's been starving for days.

757
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,060
Here.

758
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:02,060
Ma'am, one more bowl of rice.

759
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,060
It's good to sell Soyeon and rice,

760
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:08,060
but you can't do that.

761
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,060
What do you mean?

762
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,060
I mean, you can't do that.

763
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,060
I'm not a housewife.

764
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,060
You're not following the right way.

765
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,060
If you left your house and went to the countryside,

766
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:24,060
you should have gone to the mountains and lived in peace.

767
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,060
You should have come to the countryside

768
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,060
and used your life to steal.

769
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,060
You should have even set fire to the house.

770
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,060
Oh, my.

771
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,060
It's really scary.

772
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,060
You're being too harsh.

773
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,060
Why would I be harsh?

774
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,060
One more bowl of rice, please.

775
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,060
Did you say Cheondong?

776
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:05,060
Can you do me a favor?

777
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,060
I thought it was a small town,

778
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,060
but it's bigger than I thought.

779
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,060
It's because of the outside.

780
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,060
I heard that not only are you trading,

781
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,060
but you're also trading for foreign goods.

782
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,060
I see.

783
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,060
This is a good place.

784
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,060
Dan went to Gyeongju with Bukseon.

785
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:45,060
At this point, Gyeongju is not far from here.

786
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,060
Sangbaek.

787
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,060
Yes.

788
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,060
Send some gold to me

789
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:55,060
and buy me a bowl of rice.

790
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:07,060
Is this the place where the Queen should be?

791
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,060
Yes.

792
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,060
Isn't it better to stay away from her?

793
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,060
I'm in a hurry.

794
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,060
I can't just hide.

795
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,060
Sir, I can't believe it.

796
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:31,060
I saw clearly that she might be alive.

797
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:35,060
I saw the house collapse.

798
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,060
I don't know for sure either.

799
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:43,060
But, isn't that the only way to go?

800
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,060
The King has something to do with me.

801
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,060
He has been preparing for a long time.

802
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,060
If we are not sure about each other,

803
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:56,060
we can try to communicate.

804
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:01,060
I have to check that to make sure I feel better.

805
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,060
Sir!

806
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,060
Sir, please slow down.

807
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,060
I'm sorry.

808
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,060
What is this?

809
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,060
It looks like a drug.

810
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,060
This is a hangover medicine.

811
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,060
I thought it would be helpful.

812
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,060
It's a drug.

813
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,060
I'm hungry.

814
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,060
Let's have some soup.

815
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:50,060
Let's have some soup.

816
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,060
I'm hungry.

817
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,060
What should we do?

818
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:01,060
I think we have a chance.

819
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,060
Let's go.

820
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,060
Wait here.

821
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,060
I can't show you the way.

822
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,060
I'll go and bring the adults.

823
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,060
Are you trying to fool us?

824
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,060
Are you trying to fool us?

825
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:35,060
I don't lie.

826
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,060
A thief doesn't lie?

827
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,060
Does that make sense?

828
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,060
Do you think I believe you?

829
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,060
Yes, I believe you.

830
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,060
We'll wait here.

831
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,060
Sir!

832
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,060
Sir!

833
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,060
Let's wait.

834
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,060
Why isn't he coming?

835
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,060
He's far away.

836
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,060
Wait here.

837
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:25,060
I shouldn't have sent him alone.

838
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,060
This is the fifth division.

839
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,060
Wait here without fear.

840
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,060
Give me everything you have.

841
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,060
Just go.

842
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,060
Let me keep the 4th Division.

843
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,060
I'll pay you back.

844
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:06,060
Give me 200 taels of silver.

845
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:10,060
He's the head of the royal court.

846
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,060
He should be in charge.

847
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,060
Do you think I don't know how to treat a traitor?

848
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,060
You're going to eat me alive like a beast.

849
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,060
Who takes care of the people?

850
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,060
The officials?

851
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:23,060
Or the leaders?

852
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,060
I'll raise the military.

853
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,060
It's time to stand up.

854
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,060
We'll start.

855
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,060
What's going on?

856
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,060
The Europeans are invading Gyeongju.

857
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,060
Yes, it seems so.

858
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:38,060
If we stay like this, the world will change.

859
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,060
I'll give you my land and my homeland.
