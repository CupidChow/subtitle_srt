Episode 9

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, my god.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You are so late.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why did you take so long to find a book?

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you really need a book?

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have it.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It will be a good gift with the phoenix.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I have to take it with me.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Master.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Isn't he a rabbit?

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I need to find something.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He is dead.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Master.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Good job.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
示いてみせよう

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Father!

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000

Father!

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Father!

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Father!

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Father!

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Father!

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Father!

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Father!

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Father!

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Father!

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Father!

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Father!

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Father!

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Father!

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Father!

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Father!

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Father!

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Father!

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Father!

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Father!

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Father!

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Father!

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Father!

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Father!

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Father!

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Father!

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Father!

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Father!

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Father!

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Father!

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Father!

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Father!

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Father!

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Father!

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Father!

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Father!

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Father!

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Father!

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Father!

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Father!

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Father!

76
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,700
I should fishing for a deal next year.

77
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,700
inconvenient

78
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,620
Flying fish

79
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,440
bulk

80
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,260
konsullah

81
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:39,360
you

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,040
executive director

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,640
You have the best alot to

84
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,160
previous

85
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,960
shooting

86
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
4

87
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,720
good

88
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,720
I told him clearly.

89
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,720
When I went there, he was already dead.

90
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,720
I thought it was a waste to go there.

91
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,720
And there was a book in his sleeve.

92
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,720
I thought it would be money, so I brought it.

93
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,720
He said that his wife ran away from the scene because I appeared.

94
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,720
The woman he was talking about was definitely the concubine.

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,720
So you're saying that the concubine arrived at the scene after the death?

96
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,720
You're not the culprit.

97
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,720
But what's the use of the dead man's testimony?

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
I told you there was a book.

99
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
That's right.

100
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,720
I went to his house to get it in case it would be an important evidence.

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Stop making excuses.

102
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I ordered the guards to search the house, but the book didn't come out.

103
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I have a bad feeling.

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Do you know who the dead man is?

105
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
He is a major officer of the Jun Chugan.

106
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,720
He is in charge of the record of the investigation of the crime.

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Why did he try to meet you?

108
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,720
And what is the book?

109
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
What do you mean?

110
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Han Hengsu is not very good at murder,

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,720
but he doesn't tell us why he went to meet him.

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Does it mean that there is a secret that we don't know?

113
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,720
There must be something in this case.

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,720
I feel that there is a political case or an actor that we don't know.

115
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,720
It's not going to be easy to solve.

116
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Save Hengsu.

117
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,720
You are the only one who can do this.

118
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I have nothing to rely on.

119
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
I have something to tell you.

120
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,720
When I was young, I was a child.

121
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,720
I was a child who was in our village.

122
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
Do you remember?

123
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Hengsu is the child of Dan.

124
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Take this.

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
I don't need it.

126
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
What?

127
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I'm not a beggar.

128
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Do you want this?

129
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Am I eating this?

130
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Let's sleep.

131
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,720
I am rest.

132
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Hengsu was sent here from the good place.

133
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Go to fool him.

134
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Don't go to the good place.

135
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
This is the real thing.

136
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,720
I'm sorry, but this is not a simple murder case.

137
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
If the director of the military is right,

138
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,720
it's because of the death of the chief of the military.

139
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
I was too modest.

140
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I shouldn't have let him meet Dan Yi.

141
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Someone needed a sacrifice.

142
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Our Dan Yi was just lucky to be saved.

143
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
To save Dan Yi,

144
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,720
we have to lend him our strength.

145
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Would he help us?

146
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,720
The director of Han Jae Gyeom's murder is a conspiracy.

147
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
He was a military agent.

148
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,720
He could have been involved in the operation.

149
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I will find out the truth.

150
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Yeong Mo?

151
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
bipartisan

152
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,720
You're lucky to have a friend like you.

153
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,720
People in the capital don't have as much luck as you.

154
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,720
How can Dan Yi be a victim of attitude?

155
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,720
We're so stupid to let him into my shave.

156
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,720
I'm sorry, but I have one more thing to say.

157
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,720
As you said, you cannot approach the dead with personal use.

158
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Personal use? You don't know who I am?

159
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,720
I am the head of the Japanese army who is in charge of the investigation of the dead!

160
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,720
There is a national treasure that the Japanese have sent to Heaven.

161
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,720
But I don't think personal use is a good thing.

162
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Please enjoy your meal.

163
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,720
Master, where are you going?

164
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,720
I don't know.

165
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,120
I can't stay at home because I'm so frustrated.

166
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,320
I don't know how to save you.

167
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,520
That's a lie.

168
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:23,920
Right.

169
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,720
Young Master.

170
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,020
Yes?

171
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,020
Excuse me.

172
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,720
If you use this medicine, you can get the best medicine in the world.

173
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Please go inside.

174
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Master, what are you doing?

175
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Bandura, you have to take those pojol to somewhere else.

176
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Now?

177
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Please.

178
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
What's going on?

179
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
What's going on?

180
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Catch him!

181
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Catch him!

182
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
What's going on?

183
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Master, please let go of this grudge.

184
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,720
There is a man who committed murder and is sentenced to death.

185
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Please let go of this grudge.

186
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,720
There is a woman who committed murder and is sentenced to death.

187
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Please listen to my confession.

188
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
It's a grudge.

189
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
It's a grudge.

190
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Please listen to my confession.

191
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
It's a grudge.

192
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
Please let go of this grudge.

193
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
It's a grudge.

194
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,720
It's a grudge.

195
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
How is it?

196
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
After going through the hard times,

197
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,720
do you feel like you can atone for your sins now?

198
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,720
I can't atone for my sins.

199
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Take her away!

200
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Yes.

201
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Take her away!

202
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Yes.

203
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Are you asking me to save the woman?

204
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Is she a murderer?

205
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,720
She is not a child to be killed.

206
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Everyone believes in children.

207
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
The dead man was sentenced to death.

208
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,720
The court ruled that the man was killed.

209
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,720
How can I solve this matter?

210
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,720
If you are the king, you can do it.

211
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
How can you think so?

212
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,720
You don't have to tell me.

213
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,720
If you are the king, you can do anything.

214
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I said no.

215
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,720
I will make you not be able to refuse.

216
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Do you know how much money our company has been given to the king?

217
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
It's hard to imagine.

218
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,720
If the court ruled that the money was given to the king,

219
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,720
the court will not be quiet.

220
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,720
The other party is drinking very dangerously.

221
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Who is the person who can't be bitten by a beast that has lost its child?

222
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
What is the justice of this house?

223
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,720
The fight between children and adults is like a fight between adults.

224
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
I will give you time.

225
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Lock them up for three days.

226
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
They fought outside the gate.

227
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,720
I have a grudge against you.

228
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
What grudge?

229
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,720
There is a woman who is locked up in this court.

230
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
What?

231
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
She is not a murderer.

232
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
She is innocent.

233
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Shut up.

234
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
How dare you?

235
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
We are innocent.

236
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
If there is a crime, you will be punished.

237
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
If there is no crime, you will be released.

238
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,720
If you want to fight, you have to follow the law.

239
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
I know.

240
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,720
But what age is that?

241
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
You are a prisoner of the court, a prisoner of the Han family,

242
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,720
and you want to fight against the people.

243
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
What is the use of not being able to punish them?

244
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
If you can't make them cry when they are wronged,

245
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,720
you will only hurt the people.

246
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
You can't do anything.

247
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
What is the use of being a poor man?

248
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,720
You are talking nonsense.

249
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Are you trying to destroy the law?

250
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I can't do that.

251
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Take him to the Taeyong 30th Army.

252
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Yes.

253
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,720
The court is interrogating the murderer.

254
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
I see.

255
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
I will go there.

256
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Twelve.

257
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Thirteen.

258
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Fourteen.

259
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
Please listen to me.

260
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
There is something wrong.

261
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Can't you shut up?

262
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Please release the injustice.

263
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Yes.

264
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,720
That woman is not a sinner.

265
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
She is not a sinner.

266
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
I demand that you release her.

267
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
She is not a sinner.

268
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Please release the injustice.

269
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
She is not a sinner.

270
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
I demand that you release her.

271
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
I demand that you release her.

272
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
I ask you again.

273
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Why did you go to see Shim Jeonghak?

274
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
If I am not a sinner,

275
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
why can't I be there?

276
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Why are you so angry?

277
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Let's see how I can keep my mouth shut.

278
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Prepare the parachute.

279
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Yes.

280
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
I will do it.

281
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Do you understand?

282
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Then,

283
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,720
you will draw a sword at me.

284
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
I will kill you.

285
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
Go.

286
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Brother.

287
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Wait.

288
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Brother.

289
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
Are you there?

290
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Why did you do this?

291
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Why did you do this?

292
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,720
No one is guilty.

293
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
I will do it again.

294
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
What did you say?

295
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
I will do it again.

296
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,720
I will keep doing it until I get the master.

297
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Brother.

298
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
Are you not a monk?

299
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
I am not a monk.

300
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Miss.

301
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Master.

302
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,720
Are you okay?

303
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I can't hear you.

304
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
Hurry up.

305
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Hurry up.

306
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I have taken your life.

307
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
You have lived your life.

308
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,720
You have died for your sin.

309
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
You have been allowed to live once again.

310
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
You should die for the world.

311
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Brother.

312
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
I brought the committee.

313
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
I will go.

314
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
The reason why Han Jae Gyeom framed me

315
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
is because I know that

316
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
the Seoyeon Il Pa is behind this.

317
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Give her away.

318
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Give her away.

319
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
There must be something in this case.

320
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I feel that there must be something

321
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
in this case.

322
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
What is going on?

323
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,720
Can't I be your strength?

324
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
What is this sudden meeting?

325
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
There is no evidence.

326
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
What is this sudden meeting?

327
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
We can't just accept the confession.

328
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
If we just look at it as a false accusation...

329
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
False accusation?

330
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
How can you just say it as a false accusation?

331
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
When you were there,

332
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
there was no evidence of the murder.

333
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Because of that,

334
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Han Jae Gyeom even started a war.

335
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
He wanted to get married to a man

336
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
who was accused of being a criminal

337
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
by the Ministry of the Ministry of the Interior.

338
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Han Jae Gyeom

339
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Han Jae Gyeom

340
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Han Jae Gyeom

341
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Han Jae Gyeom

342
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Han Jae Gyeom

343
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,720
That woman is not a criminal.

344
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
She is not guilty.

345
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
She is innocent.

346
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,720
That woman is not a criminal.

347
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
Who is he?

348
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
It is Choe Won Young.

349
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,720
He will not be left alone.

350
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,720
I am already ready.

351
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,720
Even if my whole fortune is lost,

352
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,720
it will be better than losing our Dan Yi.

353
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Anyway, it is a good thing that Dan Yi is released.

354
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,720
I am happy that you are relieved.

355
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,720
We will discuss the murder case of Shim Jeong Hak.

356
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,720
The investigation is over.

357
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
We are looking for a way to get the case

358
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,720
into the military.

359
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
If that is the case...

360
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Han Jae Kyeom's plan was to kill the Seon people.

361
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,720
If we can find the truth,

362
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,720
we might be able to get Choe Won Young out of the case.

363
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
We have no evidence,

364
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
so we could not act hastily.

365
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Now we know that there is a record of the crime.

366
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,720
It is time.

367
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
What?

368
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Han Jae Kyeom's plan is clear.

369
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
What?

370
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Han Jae Kyeom's plan is clear.

371
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
How can that be?

372
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
Why is Han Jae Kyeom's plan

373
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,720
written by Jang Gil Taek?

374
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,720
When Han Jae Kyeom went to the temple,

375
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,720
he went to the temple.

376
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
He saved Jang Gil Taek,

377
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,720
who was killed by the Seon people.

378
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
As you know,

379
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
the crime of stealing the military

380
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,720
should be punished.

381
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,720
Han Jae Kyeom is the culprit.

382
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,720
That's why...

383
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,720
When Han Jae Kyeom died and the mountain was destroyed,

384
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,720
he took his daughter.

385
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
That's right.

386
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,720
He raised her as a daughter.

387
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,720
But the problem is...

388
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,720
What?

389
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Do you know that Kim Soo Man is the culprit?

390
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Oh, the criminal?

391
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
Yes.

392
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,720
He is particularly interested in the Shim Jeong Hak case.

393
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,720
He is planning to re-investigate the case

394
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,720
with the help of the E-Sports Department.

395
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,720
What is this?

396
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,720
What's more suspicious is...

397
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
What?

398
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:48,720
He is holding the case of Jang Gil Taek.

399
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Then...

400
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,720
I can't just leave it like this.

401
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Oh, my goodness.

402
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,720
He lost all his weight.

403
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,720
How could you hold it in?

404
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Be gentle.

405
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Young Master,

406
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,720
I'm glad that you are not injured.

407
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
What are you talking about?

408
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
I'm going to lose weight again.

409
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
I've lost weight once,

410
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
but I can't lose weight again.

411
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
The King of the Golden Horde,

412
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

413
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

414
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

415
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

416
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

417
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

418
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

419
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

420
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

421
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

422
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

423
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

424
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,720
the King of the Golden Horde,

425
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,720
but you look different today.

426
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,720
What do you mean?

427
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,720
I knew you were fearless when I was young,

428
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,720
but you didn't even think about taking the punishment.

429
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
You knew you were going to be punished.

430
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
Then what can I do?

431
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,720
I don't have a way to save you.

432
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
You took the punishment today,

433
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,720
so you're not feeling well.

434
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
I don't think so.

435
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,720
Then why did you do that?

436
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,720
That's right.

437
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Why would you do that?

438
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,720
You're the one who's guilty,

439
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
and you're the one who's innocent.

440
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
You're the one who's innocent.

441
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
You're the one who's innocent.

442
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Hello.

443
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Hello.

444
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,720
Please wait a moment.

445
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
I'll call you back.

446
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Okay.

447
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Please sit down.

448
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
Okay.

449
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Hanyang is far away from home.

450
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Why?

451
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
If you're not well,

452
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
I'll be fine.

453
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
I'll be fine.

454
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Please tell Pandori on the way home.

455
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Don't think about sending money.

456
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Take care of yourself.

457
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Take care of yourself.

458
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Okay?

459
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Okay.

460
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
What's this?

461
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,720
It's for you.

462
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Thank you.

463
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
I feel so reassured.

464
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Father is protecting Kuk Sun.

465
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Kuk Sun will feel the same way.

466
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
I'm sorry.

467
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,720
I'm sorry.

468
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I'm sorry.

469
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,720
I'm sorry.

470
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
I'm sorry.

471
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,720
I'm always grateful to you.

472
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
What do you mean?

473
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
You're not well yet.

474
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Why are you here?

475
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,720
It's cold.

476
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
Please go inside.

477
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
I have you by my side.

478
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,720
Please take care of yourself.

479
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Don't worry.

480
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Please get well soon.

481
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
I'm sorry.

482
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
I'm sorry.

483
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
I'm sorry.

484
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
I'm sorry.

485
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
I'm sorry.

486
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
I'm sorry.

487
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
I'm sorry.

488
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
I'm sorry.

489
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
I'm sorry.

490
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
I'm sorry.

491
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
I'm sorry.

492
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
I'm sorry.

493
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
I'm sorry.

494
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
I'm sorry.

495
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
I'm sorry.

496
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
I'm sorry.

497
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
I'm sorry.

498
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
I'm sorry.

499
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
I'm sorry.

500
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
I'm sorry.

501
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,720
I'm sorry.

502
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
I'm sorry.

503
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
I'm sorry.

504
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
I'm sorry.

505
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
I'm sorry.

506
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
I'm sorry.

507
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
I'm sorry.

508
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
I'm sorry.

509
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
I'm sorry.

510
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
I'm sorry.

511
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
I'm sorry.

512
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
I'm sorry.

513
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
I'm sorry.

514
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
I'm sorry.

515
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
I'm sorry.

516
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
I'm sorry.

517
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,720
The waste from Yangju is almost sold out.

518
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,720
If they continue like this, they will run out of stock.

519
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Well,

520
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
You can't be wrong.

521
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
What happened?

522
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
That is...

523
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
How many did you sell?

524
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,720
35 and 72.

525
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
How many in total?

526
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,720
107.

527
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,720
I have something to tell you.

528
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,720
I will leave.

529
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Okay.

530
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,720
What did you do with the money that you bought from Yangju?

531
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Why are you asking?

532
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720
I want to know.

533
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Did you send the money to the Chief of the Imperial Guards?

534
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Did you give it to the Minister of the State of the Qing Dynasty?

535
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,720
I just made a deal.

536
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
What deal?

537
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
The right to the independence of the country?

538
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,720
The right to the military control of the country?

539
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,720
What did you get from the money?

540
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,720
Is that the only way to do business in Korea?

541
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,720
My father died in the Battle of Byongja.

542
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,720
He died in the Qing Dynasty.

543
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,720
I will never forget that.

544
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,720
You should be strong.

545
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,720
Why did you suffer so much?

546
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,720
It's because the country is weak.

547
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Why do you have to live with the weak?

548
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,720
Why don't you become stronger?

549
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,720
I will become stronger.

550
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,720
I will do anything to become stronger.

551
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,720
Can you say that being strong is to bow your head to the strong and become stronger?

552
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:08,720
To be strong is to endure the dirt and suffer the pain.

553
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Did you think you were beautiful and decent?

554
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Do you know what it means to be strong?

555
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,720
Do you know what it means to earn money?

556
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,720
Do you think this world is as simple and innocent as you think it is?

557
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,720
If you can't change the world, you can change me.

558
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Why can't you change the world?

559
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,720
If you have money, you can change the world.

560
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,720
I have been respecting the great adults for a long time.

561
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
I thought I learned a lot.

562
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,720
But I can't follow everything.

563
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,720
For me, heaven is the country of the enemies.

564
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,720
I have been trying to destroy the traitors who have been trying to take over the country of the enemies.

565
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,680
Now I can even be the

566
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,680
traitor of the enemy country who killed my grandfather.

567
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,680
I have forgotten my life.

568
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,680
I don't know you.

569
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,640
I will change the world someday.

570
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,640
For that day, I will become stronger.

571
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,640
What happened?

572
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
Let's have a drink.

573
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
Drink?

574
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,640
Let's start with the dinner.

575
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
Attention.

576
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
Bring a bottle of wine here.

577
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
Yes.

578
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,640
You really know everything that you didn't do.

579
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,640
Come on.

580
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,380
Jin gambling

581
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,560
A burner

582
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,220
Who are you?

583
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,480
Me?

584
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,180
A person

585
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,960
This non- première student

586
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,080
How could I not know?

587
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,960
How could you just suddenly show up

588
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,660
and snxe everyone's wine there?

589
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,380
There's a saying

590
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,320
So simple

591
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,820
Now, this person has money,

592
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,820
and I don't have money.

593
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,320
So, the person who has money has alcohol,

594
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,320
so, I, who don't have money,

595
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,820
have to drink alcohol because of this person.

596
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,820
Why?

597
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,820
What did you say?

598
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,820
Are you crazy?

599
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,320
I'm sorry.

600
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
Please go away.

601
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Don't interfere with other people's business.

602
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,820
I'll always be there for you.

603
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,320
I'll always be there for you.

604
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,320
This person has not only money,

605
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,320
but also a human heart.

606
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
Thank you.

607
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,320
I'll drink it.

608
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,320
Leave it.

609
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
Why are you throwing it away?

610
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
Give me a drink.

611
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
It's like coffee.

612
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,320
I'm sorry.

613
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
Every house that Zhang Jiltai owns,

614
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
he doesn't buy ordinary things.

615
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,320
He's offering a price to the loser.

616
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,320
He's a marketer,

617
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,320
and he's trying to get the gold.

618
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,320
Does that make sense?

619
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,320
It's a little strange to say this,

620
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
but the losers

621
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,320
know that the people in Zhang's family

622
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,320
are doing everything they can to help.

623
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
They're all stupid.

624
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,320
They're offering things to losers like that.

625
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,320
So,

626
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,320
why don't you stand on the other side

627
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,320
and give a big bow to the leader?

628
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Your son is the general of the Ministry of the Interior, right?

629
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,320
Yes, that's right.

630
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,320
How about it?

631
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,320
I want to make a suggestion to you.

632
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,320
Will you do as I say?

633
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
Master,

634
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,320
you're so smart.

635
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
Huan Dong.

636
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
Yes, Master.

637
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
I don't like Han Yang.

638
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,320
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

639
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
You don't like Han Yang,

640
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
and you don't like money.

641
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,320
You're all so annoying.

642
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
What are you doing?

643
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
What are you doing?

644
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
Calm down.

645
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
What are you doing?

646
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,320
Are you Choi Gok Sun?

647
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
Yes.

648
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
You're the one who's been

649
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:47,180
selling the secret

650
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,320
to the people.

651
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
I know.

652
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,320
You even got the sun because of me.

653
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,320
You like it, right?

654
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,320
That professor

655
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,320
must have taken everything away.

656
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
I can't rely on anyone else.

657
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,320
I'll make it.

658
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
I've been selling money

659
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,320
for the first time in my life,

660
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,320
but is it right for me to make money like this?

661
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,320
What happened?

662
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,320
As you said,

663
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
I put everything in the safe.

664
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
Good job.

665
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,320
You're like that.

666
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,320
I'm Choi Gok Sun.

667
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,320
I'll make a big deal.

668
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,320
I'll make a big deal.

669
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
I'll make a big deal.

670
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
I'll make a big deal.

671
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
I'll make a big deal.
