1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,300
Back to cushion Henry.

2
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,940
Yes, sir.

3
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,960
My gosh. Why are you so slow?

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,940
It'll take me a while to make it home.

5
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,940
I shouldn't have let him go alone.

6
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,940
This is the Udae.

7
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,940
You can go now.

8
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,940
Give me everything you have.

9
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,940
I'll let you go.

10
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,940
I'll let you go.

11
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,940
Why are you doing this?

12
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,940
You are the Yurang people.

13
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,940
I came to see you.

14
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,940
Shut up!

15
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,940
You are no good.

16
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,940
You are just like this.

17
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,940
I was going to let you go, but you didn't listen.

18
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Then, it's best to see your hands first.

19
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,940
You are a thief!

20
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,940
Cheondung!

21
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,940
I was wondering where you were going.

22
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,940
I was going to tell Cheondung...

23
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,940
Cheondung!

24
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,940
You are Lee Shinji.

25
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,940
Lee Seobang?

26
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,940
Yes!

27
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,940
Cheondung!

28
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,940
Cheondung!

29
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,940
Cheondung!

30
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,940
Cheondung!

31
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:56,940
I did something that I couldn't do with you.

32
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,940
I lost the land.

33
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,940
I think this is my last chance.

34
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,940
I'll turn my back on you.

35
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,940
Forget everything.

36
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,940
I already forgot.

37
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,940
It's all in the past.

38
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,940
Cheondung!

39
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,940
But, how did you get here?

40
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,940
It's not easy to be a human.

41
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,940
I made a lot of money.

42
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:45,940
I was so greedy that I quit.

43
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,940
Did you even invest in it?

44
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,940
No, I didn't.

45
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,940
I just took a step over the line.

46
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,940
I'm going to give you 50,000 times 100,000 times.

47
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,940
You are the next lucky one.

48
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,940
Aomansingpujing Entertainment.

49
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,940
I heard that you can just cut all the money with your hands.

50
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,940
But, why did you keep on cutting it?

51
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,940
I just cut it myself.

52
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,940
I see.

53
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,940
I was punished.

54
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,940
Mr. Lee,

55
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:07,940
I have something to discuss with you.

56
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,940
Cheondung,

57
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,940
I thought you were lying to us.

58
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,940
I told you I wouldn't lie.

59
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,940
Are you living with your parents?

60
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Are your parents not here?

61
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,940
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Hey, you guys!

63
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,940
Gather around!

64
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,940
You are going to get married?

65
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,940
You are going to write us a letter and give us a gift?

66
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,940
Shut up!

67
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,940
You are going to write a letter to the beggars?

68
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,940
I'll give you a few minutes, so think about me in winter.

69
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,940
That's not it.

70
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,940
No, it's not!

71
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,940
You think I don't know what a traitor is?

72
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:42,940
You want to kill me by throwing me in the air?

73
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
You've been saying that for a long time.

74
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,940
You can't just talk to him.

75
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,940
You are talking like a bastard.

76
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
I'm your brother.

77
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,940
Do I look like a brother to you?

78
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,940
If you don't look like a brother, then you are a bastard.

79
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,940
Listen to him.

80
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,940
You should listen to him.

81
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,940
Why are you talking to him?

82
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Hey, Hong-du, what's wrong?

83
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,940
Let's hear him out.

84
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,940
I want to start a business with you.

85
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,940
I'll give you a good price.

86
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,940
And I have one more thing to promise you.

87
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,940
Once the land is cleared and it becomes a farmland,

88
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,940
I will guarantee you the right to the economy.

89
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,940
What?

90
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,940
You mean the land?

91
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,940
Are you saying that you will let us plant the land?

92
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Yes.

93
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,940
We came to the mountains because we were sick of farming.

94
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,940
It's not farming.

95
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,940
The world was sick of it.

96
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:25,940
I don't know how difficult it is to live as farmers in this country.

97
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,940
The tax and tax that is added every year.

98
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,940
The tax and tax that is added every year.

99
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,940
We are sick of it.

100
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,940
We are sick of it.

101
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,940
But how long are we going to leave the land

102
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,940
and continue our lives in the mountains?

103
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,940
Do you think the world will change?

104
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,940
I promise you everything.

105
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,940
I promise you my family and ancestors.

106
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,940
I will not just let you be a worker.

107
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,940
I will find you your home and land.

108
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

109
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

110
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

111
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

112
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

113
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

114
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

115
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

116
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

117
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

118
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

119
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

120
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,940
I will be with you and share my wealth.

121
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Lord Zhang.

122
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,940
I was waiting for you.

123
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,940
I am so glad.

124
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,940
I could not believe you were so angry.

125
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,940
It is all thanks to you.

126
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,940
You made a path for me.

127
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:29,940
If it was not for you, I would not have been able to find the path.

128
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,940
I do not know how to thank you.

129
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,940
Do you know that Lord Zhang is alive?

130
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,940
I do not know.

131
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,940
I do not need to know.

132
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,940
You do not need to know?

133
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,940
How sad would that child be?

134
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:08,940
I do not want to drag him into the things I do not want to do.

135
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,940
Lord Zhang.

136
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,940
Yes.

137
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:25,940
I think this is the will of heaven.

138
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,940
I agree.

139
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,940
This is the time to stand up.

140
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,940
Lord Zhang.

141
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,940
What is it?

142
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,940
A message from Gyeongju.

143
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,940
The mayor wants to see you.

144
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,940
Who is taking care of the people?

145
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,940
The leaders of the province?

146
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,940
I have been to many places to meet you.

147
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,940
The people's lives are in danger.

148
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,940
The people are suffering.

149
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:34,940
I saw the people leaving their homes and going to the streets.

150
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,940
Who is this world for?

151
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,940
Lord Zhang.

152
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,940
Yes.

153
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,940
I will pay the money as I promised.

154
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Did you find out what the mayor told you?

155
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
Yes.

156
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,940
We can get the weapons from the outside of the city.

157
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Did you hear?

158
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,940
I understand.

159
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,940
I will gather the people who have become the victims and raise the army.

160
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,940
It is time to start.

161
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:37,940
When we start, the people who have ears will start.

162
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,940
Good job.

163
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,940
Are you okay?

164
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,940
Don't be greedy.

165
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,940
Let's go to the small rocks.

166
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
I am strong.

167
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,940
Okay.

168
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,940
Let's do it together.

169
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,940
You are stubborn.

170
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
Let's go.

171
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,940
You are good at work.

172
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
Yes.

173
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,940
I used to be a blacksmith.

174
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,940
Don't miss a single person.

175
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Let's go.

176
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,940
What is going on?

177
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,940
It is the order of the wife of the mayor.

178
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,940
The order of the mayor?

179
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,940
Listen.

180
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,940
You are the people who have betrayed the country.

181
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,940
You are the criminals who have ruined the people.

182
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,940
Are you guilty of the crime of the government?

183
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,940
The wife of the mayor did not ask for your crime.

184
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,940
She was sent to the mountain to report the crime.

185
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,940
Take her to the mountain.

186
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,940
Yes.

187
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,940
Don't do this.

188
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,940
You are the people who have been living in the mountains for a long time.

189
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,940
Please let us know the situation.

190
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,940
You want to know the situation?

191
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,940
You are doing this for the country.

192
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,940
I want to protect their lives.

193
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,940
What do you want to protect?

194
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:20,940
You have not protected the life of a woman who came here only because of you.

195
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,940
What do you protect?

196
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,940
Who do you protect?

197
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,940
What did I do?

198
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,940
We are the ones who are being punished in this world.

199
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
What is this?

200
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,940
It is the order of the wife of the mayor.

201
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
Wait.

202
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,940
What will you protect?

203
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,940
Don't give up and trust me.

204
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,940
You can't give up.

205
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,940
Please wait.

206
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,940
I will make you come back.

207
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,940
You...

208
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,940
Mayor!

209
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
Mayor!

210
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,940
Mayor!

211
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:28,940
I will make you come back to this land with me.

212
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,940
What brings you here?

213
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,940
I want to see my wife. I am Choi Goksun.

214
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,940
I know that.

215
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
I want to see her right now.

216
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,940
Do you know the word 100 times?

217
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,940
If you don't pay taxes and just accept the people who fled,

218
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,940
what kind of order will you make?

219
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,940
Fortunately, you know that you are ending it with a curse.

220
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,940
I am here to settle the people of Yurang.

221
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,940
Then, do you have a way to settle them after the curse?

222
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,940
If you want to settle them, you need to eat and live.

223
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,940
If you forget what you did, you will have to work overtime again.

224
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,940
This time, you will hide even more.

225
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,940
I will do it.

226
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:46,940
Sato, do you want them to die or get hurt while they are in prison?

227
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:56,260
Or do you want them to become a

228
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,260
What kind of a person will they become?

229
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,260
Can you leave it to me?

230
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:31,260
They fled last time.

231
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Keep an eye on them.

232
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,260
Yes.

233
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:49,260
Yu Jung-ho sent a messenger from Hanyang.

234
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,260
What is it?

235
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:08,260
The chief wants to buy land for the land sale.

236
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,260
It's not a small amount.

237
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,260
It's a huge amount.

238
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Really?

239
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,260
That's good.

240
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,260
The chief will come all the way down here.

241
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:32,260
He can just buy the land and send the money to the chief.

242
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Then he will manage the property of the chief.

243
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,260
He should do it himself.

244
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,260
Think about it.

245
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,260
Who will pay for the land sale?

246
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,260
That's why he is so good.

247
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,260
He is so good.

248
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:59,260
You can't ignore someone who manages his property.

249
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,260
I don't have to feel pressured.

250
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,260
He will send the money to the chief.

251
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,260
Why is he so good?

252
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:25,260
I will let them take over the land.

253
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:30,260
They will become farmers and harvest in the fall.

254
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Then they will be able to pay taxes.

255
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,260
That's easy.

256
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,260
When will that be?

257
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,260
This fall.

258
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,260
If the sale continues like this,

259
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,260
the property will be sold.

260
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,260
If you look a little further,

261
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,260
you will see the people.

262
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:58,260
In this land where the people are living,

263
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,260
if the people come back to their hometown,

264
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,260
this is all thanks to the chief.

265
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,260
It's also known to the chief.

266
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:21,260
Tomorrow, I will send the money to the people.

267
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,260
I will gather the information about the chief's

268
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,260
corruption and make a statement.

269
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,260
Father.

270
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,260
We can't let them go to the land anymore.

271
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,260
They will leave the land.

272
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,260
Father.

273
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Chief.

274
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,260
I want to become stronger.

275
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,260
I suddenly thought of something today.

276
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,260
I had the medicine I used to persuade them

277
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,260
to bring them down from the mountain.

278
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,260
But I didn't have anything,

279
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,260
so I emptied all the medicine.

280
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,260
I want to become stronger enough

281
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,260
to keep my promise to someone.

282
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,260
I want to make a land where they can farm

283
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,260
as they want to.

284
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,260
I want to make a foundation for life

285
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,260
so that poor people can continue to eat and live.

286
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,260
Guk-sun.

287
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,260
No matter what you do in the future,

288
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,260
don't change your mind.

289
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,260
The land itself is not worth anything.

290
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,260
Even if you have all the land in the world,

291
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,260
if there is no one to farm there,

292
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,260
it will be a land that cannot produce anything.

293
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,260
The oil-poured octopuses

294
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,260
will be nothing but rough deserts.

295
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,260
Chief.

296
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,260
Chief.

297
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,260
What is it?

298
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,260
The desert.

299
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,260
The desert. Look.

300
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,260
Chief.

301
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,260
Chief.

302
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
The young master is here.

303
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,260
What happened?

304
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,260
The young master kept his promise.

305
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,260
He said he would protect us.

306
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,260
You went to the temple for us.

307
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,260
We heard everything.

308
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,260
The young master told us to release us.

309
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,260
Instead, he promised to pay us back in the fall.

310
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
It's good.

311
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,260
But why are we here tonight?

312
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:11,260
We have to do something we couldn't do tonight.

313
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
Don't push yourself too hard.

314
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
You should rest today.

315
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,260
You must have been stuck in the desert all day.

316
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,260
We all used to farm.

317
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,260
We don't know that we have to hurry up

318
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,260
to destroy this land in the spring.

319
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:37,260
You're not trying to save your money, are you?

320
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
That's not it.

321
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,260
I just tried.

322
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,260
We're going to burn this place down.

323
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:05,260
Let's burn this night down!

324
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,260
Leave this place to us.

325
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,260
You should rest.

326
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,260
No, I can't.

327
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,260
I'll work with you.

328
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
Yes, sir.

329
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,260
You're going to destroy the desert?

330
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Yes, sir.

331
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,260
I heard that the Choi family is opening up the land.

332
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,260
I promise.

333
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,260
I should have said hello to you earlier.

334
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,260
What are you talking about?

335
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,260
But do you know why I left Hanyang

336
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,260
and came to Gyeongju?

337
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,260
You were the son of the leader of Gyeongju.

338
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,260
That's why you came with me.

339
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,260
That's just an excuse.

340
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,260
Actually...

341
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,260
The chief judge of the royal family

342
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:53,260
is in charge of the management of the property.

343
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,260
Chief Choi Won-young?

344
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,260
Yes, sir.

345
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,260
He's the chief judge now,

346
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,260
but he'll be a minister soon.

347
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,260
I'm buying his land

348
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,260
because I only have a small farm.

349
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,260
Are you not ready yet?

350
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,260
I'll be right there.

351
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,260
Get ready.

352
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,260
Yes, sir.

353
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,260
You're here.

354
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,260
Yes.

355
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,260
I couldn't call you last time,

356
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,260
so your mother sent me back.

357
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,260
Thank you so much.

358
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,260
Mother.

359
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,260
The chief judge told me to get you plenty of food.

360
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,260
I did, but why did I bring all this?

361
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,260
I think we should call someone.

362
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,260
Can I help you?

363
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
I'm sorry.

364
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,260
You've grown up so much.

365
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,260
You're a good judge.

366
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,260
I'm sorry.

367
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,260
I'm sorry.

368
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,260
What? You're done?

369
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Yes, sir.

370
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,260
I think it'll be over in a day or two.

371
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,260
I'm going to sell it.

372
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,260
Get the cart ready.

373
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
Yes, sir.

374
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,260
Where are you going?

375
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,260
The gold city of the treasure hunt.

376
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,780
The

377
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,780
highest prize is 500,000 times 100,000 times.

378
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,780
The next lucky one is you.

379
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,780
Macau New Peking Entertainment City 931 931.com

380
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,780
It's been a long time.

381
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,300
What brings you here?

382
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:10,300
I'm here because I found out something amazing today.

383
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,300
You'll be surprised when you find out.

384
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Take it out.

385
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,300
Yes, sir.

386
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,300
Here.

387
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,300
No, this is...

388
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,300
I have a lot of money.

389
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:43,300
I called so many people and made a deal.

390
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
No, sir.

391
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,300
That's not possible.

392
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,300
That money is in the treasury of the treasury.

393
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Yes, sir.

394
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
As soon as it comes down,

395
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,300
I'll give you a little money.

396
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,820
I paid you for the first time.

397
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,820
I didn't know that the rich man was playing with money.

398
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,820
I didn't know it was all my money.

399
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,820
I'll give you my money right now.

400
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,820
200,000 times.

401
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,820
Pay me back the money written here by tomorrow.

402
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,340
How can I do that?

403
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,340
Or you can give me this land.

404
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,860
Eureka!

405
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,860
May God forgive you for your penny.

406
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,860
The higher the debal, the greater is the reward.

407
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:58,860
I don't think that's good.

408
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,860
If I steal, I'll lose.

409
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,860
I'm not going to go to the army. I'm going to sell my land.

410
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,860
What are you talking about?

411
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,860
Isn't that Choi Guk-sun, the son of the young master?

412
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,860
Yes, but why?

413
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,860
I'm on my way to Gyeongju to meet him.

414
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,860
What? You're not going to be able to speak.

415
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,860
Why is it that the young master is suffering so much?

416
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,860
I want to get out of the pain caused by money.

417
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Step by step, step by step,

418
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:54,860
I want to get out of the pain caused by money.

419
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Step by step, step by step,

420
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,860
I'm suffering so much.

421
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:29,860
Why don't you speak?

422
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,860
You want to kill me, don't you?

423
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:40,860
I know. Not once, but twice.

424
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,860
Oh, my. Your mother is going to die.

425
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,860
I want to die.

426
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,860
Oh, my. Your mother is going to die.

427
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,860
I want to die.

428
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,860
Please hit me until I die.

429
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:08,860
I want to die because I'm hit by your hand.

430
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,860
It's okay.

431
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,860
I'm sorry.

432
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:41,860
What are you doing with the remaining money?

433
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,860
Master, we discussed it together.

434
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,860
If you pay me back with this...

435
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,860
It's not been long since I've been left with a mouthful of money.

436
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:16,860
It won't help much, but...

437
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,860
No, it's not.

438
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,860
Don't worry about it and just do your work.

439
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,860
I'll take care of it.

440
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,860
You can't just come in here!

441
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:40,860
I haven't paid you back.

442
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,860
You can't just come in here.

443
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,860
Give me a few days. I'll do something.

444
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,860
Give you?

445
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,860
I told you yesterday that I'd pay you back today.

446
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,860
Don't do this. Please accept this.

447
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,860
Can't you pay me back?

448
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,860
You're crazy.

449
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,860
What are you doing?

450
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,860
If you can't pay me back right now,

451
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,860
you can go out with this money.

452
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,860
I'll pay you back.

453
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,860
I'll pay you back.

454
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,860
Your son is so good.

455
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,860
It's all thanks to you.

456
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:59,860
Thanks to you, I saved my son's life.

457
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,860
No, it's not that.

458
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:06,860
When you went back to the forest,

459
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,860
you got saved.

460
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,860
How can I thank you?

461
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,860
No, it's not that.

462
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,860
I'm glad I had a chance to repay you.

463
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,860
I was busy eating and living,

464
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,860
but I came to Gyeongju to see you.

465
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,860
I borrowed 200 taels from you.

466
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,860
I'll pay you back.

467
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:43,860
If you're so kind, then do as you wish.

468
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,860
Thank you for giving me your money.

469
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:54,860
I didn't know you'd be in such a difficult situation.

470
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,860
I'll give you the rest of the money.

471
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,860
No, it's okay.

472
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,860
You've been in charge of the business,

473
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,860
so I'll pay you back.

474
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,860
You said you wouldn't take it for granted.

475
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,860
You insisted on paying me back.

476
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,860
I knew you'd say that.

477
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,860
You're like that.

478
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,860
But you should accept this money.

479
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,860
That's what makes me feel better.

480
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,860
I understand.

481
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,860
I ordered the tea you mentioned last time

482
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,860
from the merchants outside.

483
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,860
Yes, you can look at the test papers

484
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,860
and if you like it, you can lower the price.

485
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,860
I've never thought about selling rice.

486
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,860
You're very smart.

487
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,860
No, I'm not.

488
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,860
I'm just making a tea pot.

489
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,860
I'm not sure if I'll be able to sell tea.

490
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,860
Then I'll bring the tea to the market.

491
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,860
Yes.

492
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,860
What kind of money is that?

493
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,860
Why did you give it all away?

494
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,860
You've been working all night.

495
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,860
How could you sell it all away?

496
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,860
I can make money again.

497
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,860
I'm more desperate to make money

498
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,860
than I am now.

499
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,860
I can't be with you

500
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,860
in your dream,

501
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,860
but I can help you from afar.

502
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:56,860
We're walking the same path.

503
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,860
Everyone, get out!

504
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,860
Yes!

505
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,860
What's going on?

506
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,860
There's a problem with the bank.

507
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,860
What problem?

508
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,860
The land owner who took the land

509
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,860
said he illegally occupied the land.

510
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,860
There's a land owner?

511
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,860
No way!

512
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,860
Didn't you say that land

513
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,860
was a land without a owner?

514
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,860
Are you talking to me?

515
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:48,860
When did I ever check the bank?

516
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,860
Do you think Bu Yun is that kind of person?

517
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,860
You made him look for the land.

518
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,860
Is there a land outside?

519
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,860
Yes.

520
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,860
Do you know the name of the land?

521
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,860
Yes.

522
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,860
The land that was the problem

523
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,860
was the land that the land owner

524
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,860
took the land.

525
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,860
You're lying!

526
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,860
The land owner took the land.

527
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,860
I think there's a dispute

528
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,860
over the ownership.

529
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,860
You're saying you took the land first?

530
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,860
I know the land that was the problem.

531
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,860
Didn't you tell me to take the land?

532
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,860
Is it true?

533
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,860
I think it's a fact.

534
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,860
Look!

535
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,860
You're lying!

536
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,860
How can a person who doesn't know me

537
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,860
lie about the land?

538
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,860
Didn't you tell me to register

539
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,860
the ownership of the land

540
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,860
after I took the land?

541
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,860
What's going on outside?

542
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,860
What's going on?

543
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,860
What's going on?

544
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,860
Are you here?

545
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,860
The 17th century.

546
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,860
In the past, the land owner

547
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,860
took the land.

548
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,860
But the people who wanted to take

549
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,860
the land

550
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,860
and the people who actually

551
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,860
took the land

552
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,860
had a constant dispute

553
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,860
over the ownership.

554
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,860
The process of taking the land

555
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,860
was only a formal procedure

556
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,860
that had the right to take the land.

557
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,860
But if someone took the land

558
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,860
and made a farm,

559
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,860
the owner of the land

560
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,860
would claim ownership of the land.

561
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,860
The person who won the battle

562
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,860
was the one with the most power.

563
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,860
Sir,

564
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,860
the people of the Yurang

565
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,860
are invading the Gyeongju Gana.

566
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:33,860
Yes, it seems so.

567
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,860
What are you doing?

568
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,860
Sir,

569
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,860
the people of the Yurang

570
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,860
are here to die

571
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,860
and they are all here.

572
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,860
Where do you think this is?

573
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,860
We are the people of Gyeongju.

574
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,860
The people of Gyeongju.

575
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,860
The people of the Yurang

576
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,860
are here to take the Gyeongju Gana.

577
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,860
Can't you see?

578
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,860
This is...

579
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,860
Everyone,

580
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,860
you have to pay the price

581
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,860
to keep your spirits up.

582
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,860
You can't just leave

583
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,860
before everyone is in a bad mood.

584
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,860
I can't leave

585
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,860
so you better pay the price.

586
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,860
I'm already dead,

587
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,860
but I have nothing to fear

588
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,860
or fear.

589
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,860
I don't care if I starve

590
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,860
or die in a bad mood.

591
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,860
I want you to rip my dead body apart

592
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,860
right now.

593
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,860
You will be my friend

594
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,860
and I will be your servant forever.

595
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,860
How dare you!

596
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,860
Hey!

597
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,860
What are you doing?

598
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,860
What are you looking at?

599
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,860
No!

600
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,860
Let me go!

601
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,860
Let me go!

602
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,860
Let me go!

603
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,860
Let me go!

604
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,860
What are you doing?

605
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,860
What are you doing?

606
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,860
What are you doing?

607
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,860
Young-ja, where are you?

608
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,860
Young-ja!

609
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,860
Yeo-won!

610
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,860
Arrest those who have

611
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,860
invaded Gana!

612
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,860
Yes!

613
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,860
Stop!

614
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,860
No!

615
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,860
Please,

616
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,860
stop!

617
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,860
They are innocent.

618
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,860
I will give up.

619
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,860
Young-ja!

620
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,860
You can give up.

621
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,860
You can't

622
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,860
just leave the land

623
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,860
to the?

624
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,860
No!

625
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,860
Master!

626
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,860
The old man

627
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,860
is now a priest.

628
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,860
He is a sinner

629
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,860
who has lived longer than others.

630
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,860
He is sick and old.

631
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,860
He has a dirty life

632
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,860
but he is still alive.

633
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,860
You know that

634
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,860
he is alive

635
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,860
because of the

636
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,860
old man's

637
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,860
life.

638
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,860
He has changed

639
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,860
the dirt of his farm

640
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,860
to a field

641
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,860
and he has given

642
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,860
the old man

643
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,860
a new life.

644
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,860
Please listen

645
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,860
to the prayer

646
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,860
of the old man.

647
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,860
The land is

648
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,860
the land of the

649
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,860
old man who died.

650
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,860
I want to

651
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,860
put a plate on the land

652
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,860
with my hands.

653
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,860
Master,

654
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,860
how long will you live

655
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,860
in front of the old man?

656
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,860
I want to

657
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,860
take a vow

658
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,860
before I die.

659
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,860
Master,

660
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,860
I am his life.

661
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,860
Master,

662
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,860
I want to take a vow

663
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,860
before I die.

664
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,860
Please,

665
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,860
I want to take a vow

666
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,860
before I die.

667
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,860
I want to

668
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,860
kill him!

669
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,860
Kill him!

670
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,860
Kill him!

671
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,860
Kill him!

672
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,860
Kill him!

673
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,860
Hurry!

674
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,860
Look at Jiao Zuo!

675
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,860
Look at Jiao Zuo!

676
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,860
Kill him!

677
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,860
Look at him!

678
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,860
Jiao Zuo!

679
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,860
Kill him!

680
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,860
Venice is changed

681
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,860
in this new world!

682
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,860
No!

683
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,860
Look at Yuezhuang!

684
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,860
He can only be completed

685
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,860
by Yanmei.

686
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,860
Jae наб고

687
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,860
Help! Help!

688
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,860
Honey!

689
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,860
What's wrong?

690
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,860
Well...

691
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,860
Hwang Mun-ji...

692
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,860
What's wrong with you?

693
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,860
You bastard!

694
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,860
Just...

695
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,860
As promised...

696
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,860
I will give you the right to this land...

697
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,860
...to the people who participated in the war.

698
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,860
When spring comes...

699
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,860
...we will start farming by spraying the walls.

700
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:01,860
Go!
