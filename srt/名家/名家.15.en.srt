00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
A lot of you have been waiting for this video.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I hope you enjoy it.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I hope you enjoy it.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I hope you enjoy it.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I hope you enjoy it.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I hope you enjoy it.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I hope you enjoy it.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I hope you enjoy it.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What is going on in my house?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is this my house?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You are right.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My lord.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, no!

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My lady!

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My lady! My lady!

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Who are you?

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What are you doing?

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Look over there!

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The villain of this house put a gold coin on the wall.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Come on.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Kim Ja-chun, you bastard!

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You will be in deep trouble!

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I will save you.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Save me!

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You are all starving because of the death of the villain.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is ridiculous!

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You killed me!

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is it your wish to die?

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't worry.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It will be done as you wish.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Save me!

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Please, save me!

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Honey!

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Honey!

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is General Hwang.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You bastards!

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
People are like the sky.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It is not easy to see the sky.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You are blinded by the evil eye.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How dare you come to the coffin?

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You are treating the people like a prisoner.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I am sorry.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Go away!

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Where are the people of Gyeongju?

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They are coming to save us.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We have brought all the villains.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The people of Gyeongju are coming to save us.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Listen carefully!

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It is not a crime to have more than others.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You have used your power to commit a lot of crimes.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You have used your power to commit a lot of crimes.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You have taken away the last Sarantul.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You have used your power to kill the villains.

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You are the luckiest person in the world.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
www.aomansingpujing.com

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You are the thieves of this world.

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You are the villains who are killing the people.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You will be executed in the name of the people.

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You will know the end of the evil eye.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You will kill the evil eye.

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Take the people away.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Take the people away.

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hwado!

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mother!

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What happened?

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let me go.

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Stay here.

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Move over.

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let me go.

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Stay here.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I have to go.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can't stay here.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I will follow you wherever you take Gukseon.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Mother, I will go.

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No!

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Mother!

77
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What happened?

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We are the people of this village.

79
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We rushed here after hearing the news.

80
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Please listen to us.

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Our savior is over there.

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You can't die like this.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You are a bad person.

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You are not worthy.

85
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You are a bad person.

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You are a bad person.

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We are sorry for our sins.

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I heard that the people of this village are not evil.

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I heard that the people of this village are not evil.

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I am not guilty.

91
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Then?

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Is it our sin to let you farm us?

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Or is it our sin to cut your income?

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you ask a sinner like us, you will be punished.

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Please save us.

96
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Please save us.

97
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Take him away!

98
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Take off his mask!

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes, sir!

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh, my god!

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, my god!

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, my god!

103
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, my god!

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, my god!

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why do you have to go through this?

106
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, my god!

107
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Get out of my way!

108
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
My head!

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
My head!

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
My head!

111
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
My head!

112
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What is going on?

113
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Mother.

114
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Are you General Choi Jin-lip's family?

115
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes, I am.

116
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I am Kim So-man, who led General Choi Jin-lip to the end.

117
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
My lord, something is wrong.

118
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The spirit is quiet, and I can't find the shadow of the famous man.

119
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Now, let's go home.

120
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Let's go home.

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I almost cried when I saw you.

122
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Thank you.

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you.

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No, thank you.

125
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I am sorry for the trouble.

126
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Please forgive me.

127
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
May I ask you something?

128
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What are you going to do with them?

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
They are the thieves who suck the blood of the people.

130
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They will kill people and kill the animals.

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
They will kill people and kill the animals.

132
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They will not leave anything on this land.

133
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They are also human beings.

134
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
When I was young, my grandfather always said,

135
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
People are important.

136
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Everyone in this world is important.

137
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
They are important people.

138
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They have important lives.

139
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Can you give them a chance?

140
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Give them a chance to live a good life.

141
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Can you give them a chance to live a good life?

142
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Can you give them a chance?

143
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Give them a chance to live a good life.

144
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Give them a chance to live a good life.

145
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Give them a chance to live a good life.

146
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
They are coming.

147
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
They are coming.

148
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
They are coming.

149
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, my God.

150
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Please forgive me.

151
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You saved my life today.

152
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I am indebted to you.

153
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What do you mean?

154
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
They are already dead.

155
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You are my life's debtors.

156
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I will never forget this debt.

157
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I will never forget this debt.

158
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Are you okay?

159
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
They all ran away.

160
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
They even revealed our lives.

161
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Mother.

162
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What should we do?

163
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They are all my life's debtors.

164
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
They are all my life's debtors.

165
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I am doomed.

166
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The attack in Gyeongju was a success.

167
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They burned all the Korean generals in Gyeongju.

168
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
They opened up the weaponry and the gunships.

169
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They were able to kill over 300 people.

170
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You used the same strategy as the enemy.

171
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Sangbaek, you did a great job.

172
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I have something to tell you.

173
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
On the way here last time,

174
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Kim Soo-man said he saw Miss Dan-yi

175
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
in the house of the village head.

176
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's not Gyeongju.

177
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The village head is the one.

178
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He said it was the village head.

179
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yangsan, Miryang, Cheongdo, Gyeongju.

180
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yangsan, Miryang, Cheongdo, Gyeongju.

181
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I brought the gun you asked for.

182
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Here it is.

183
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes.

184
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They are investigating the village head and the merchants.

185
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They are focusing on the merchants

186
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
who are patrolling the village.

187
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The gunships like this

188
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
are likely to have been sold through foreign countries.

189
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
They also want to kill the village head.

190
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
If they were able to kill Gyeongju,

191
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
they would have made weapons

192
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
or repaired them.

193
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes, sir.

194
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Good day.

195
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know what happened.

196
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I heard you went to Gyeongju

197
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to see the village head.

198
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There must have been a story that I couldn't avoid.

199
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You were alone in a strange neighborhood

200
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
without a chair.

201
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Wouldn't it be better

202
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
if the village head stopped you from going?

203
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No.

204
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That child can live in this world

205
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
by himself.

206
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I raised him like that.

207
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
He is not like me.

208
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He can survive in any situation.

209
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You were treated like a fool.

210
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
How worried are you?

211
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I didn't just turn the door on you.

212
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I also tried to kill you

213
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
but you didn't even dare to kill me.

214
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Should I just let you go?

215
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I didn't want to say this.

216
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What do you mean?

217
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm talking about Choi's family.

218
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You must have realized that Choi's family

219
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and the village head are not ordinary people.

220
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But it's not like they are all the same.

221
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Anyway, we risked our lives

222
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
because of Choi's family.

223
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
How do you know it was all planned?

224
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What do you mean?

225
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If we save Choi's family from Gyeongju,

226
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
there is no way to avoid suspicion.

227
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
If we kill them all and save them right away,

228
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
they will think that we are the benefactors of life.

229
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There must have been a plan like this.

230
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's a reasonable thing.

231
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
If it wasn't for Han Dongseok,

232
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
why would the soldiers have given Choi's family

233
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
their last assets?

234
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What?

235
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Is that true?

236
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's true.

237
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Look at that. Han Dongseok is definitely the one.

238
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't think we should let his family go.

239
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's right.

240
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You are a good man.

241
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't think so.

242
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Choi's family has nothing to do with the Minghwa family.

243
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I just realized a lot of things

244
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
when I saw the soldiers who gathered that day

245
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
talking about Choi's family.

246
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I was ashamed of the days I lived.

247
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I was wondering what kind of life I should live

248
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
for the wealth I had.

249
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I kept thinking about it since that day.

250
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What do you mean?

251
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
If you are so concerned about these things,

252
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I don't want to hear it anymore.

253
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll go now.

254
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
No...

255
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Homi,

256
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Choi's family has a deal with those rebels?

257
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That's right, Sato.

258
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Everyone here saw the situation very clearly.

259
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The Minghwa family's leader didn't say a word.

260
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's not a single day's worth of training.

261
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Even if they cover up the rest,

262
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
look at this.

263
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
None of them is as big as this one.

264
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And if it's a waste, it's a waste.

265
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
If it's a gold, it's a gold.

266
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The Minghwa family is the most likely to be the rich.

267
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But Choi's family is not just safe.

268
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
They didn't even take away a single grain of rice.

269
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's strange.

270
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Homi,

271
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Choi Kuk-sun is saying that

272
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
he's behind the Minghwa family.

273
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's right.

274
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Whether Choi Kuk-sun is behind the Minghwa family

275
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
or ahead of them,

276
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
you should tell me now.

277
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Hyeonggong,

278
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
if you don't know the responsibility

279
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
of the Gyeongju family

280
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
for what the rebels have done,

281
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
you should be responsible for it.

282
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So, thanks to Choi's family,

283
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
the Gyeongju rebels have survived.

284
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Is that it?

285
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yes, sir.

286
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The people are asking for the lives

287
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
of the rebels

288
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and the Gyeongju people.

289
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
If Choi Kuk-sun is going to

290
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
bring the people of the Yurang family back,

291
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
he's going to lower the price of the land

292
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and even lower the rate of the oil.

293
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I think he's getting the people's trust.

294
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It's a problem.

295
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It's a problem.

296
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What?

297
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't know.

298
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
He's saying that

299
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
the people are scarier than the Minghwa family.

300
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
They're more unstable than the Minghwa family.

301
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Think about it.

302
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Because of the disaster he's going through,

303
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
the other rebels are being criticized.

304
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
This is a hindrance to the proper

305
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
events and the good deeds of the rebels.

306
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
They're trying to control the poor

307
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and are threatening the rebels.

308
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
They're not the ones who are

309
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
trying to shake the people's hearts

310
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and make things worse.

311
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
They shouldn't just let it go.

312
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Then what if they turn this into

313
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
a business war?

314
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That's not good.

315
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
They don't know how scary the people are.

316
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
They said they'd spread the rumor

317
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
that the people were being attacked.

318
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
If they mess with the people,

319
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
they'll set the people's hearts on fire.

320
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
They should just

321
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
let themselves die.

322
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You should go to Gyeongju right now.

323
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Get him!

324
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What are you doing?

325
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What were you trying to do?

326
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Can't you do what you're supposed to do?

327
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What?

328
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What?

329
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Here.

330
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'll go get Gyeongju.

331
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Here.

332
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Here.

333
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Here.

334
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Here.

335
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We'll make three rows of the beds.

336
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
We can make more beds

337
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
in the same area.

338
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That's right.

339
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Get out of the way.

340
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:46,440
Then we can put the

341
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,000
bedding on here.

342
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Put it on properly.

343
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Don't worry.

344
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Can't we put this on the windows?

345
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
That's right.

346
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You have to put the bedding on the windows

347
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and the floor to get rid of the moisture.

348
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What are you talking about?

349
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What are you talking about?

350
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
What's going on?

351
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
We came to arrest the criminal,

352
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and we came under his order.

353
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What are you talking about?

354
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Look at this.

355
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
How could only your family

356
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
be safe from the attack of the Ming?

357
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Did you not

358
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
put clothes on the Ming?

359
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
What do you mean?

360
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Are you asking me if I paid

361
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
the Ming?

362
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I never did.

363
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
All the people in Gyeongju

364
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
were attacked.

365
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Why would the Ming

366
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
only harm your family?

367
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
How could you do this

368
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
without the money

369
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
or the support of the Ming?

370
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
How could it be a crime

371
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
to harm the Ming?

372
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's a crime to harm the Ming

373
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
by putting the blame on the Ming.

374
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Shut up!

375
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
How dare you!

376
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You don't know what's

377
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
going on in Gyeongju.

378
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You are the master of the Ming.

379
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You are a traitor.

380
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You should respect the law.

381
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Listen!

382
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Until the truth is revealed,

383
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
you are to be released!

384
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Yes, sir!

385
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What?

386
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
How could he betray the Ming?

387
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
How could he do this again?

388
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
He is a traitor.

389
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He is a traitor.

390
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
He is a traitor.

391
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
He is a traitor.

392
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I will go to Gyeongju.

393
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So,

394
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
the strings of the imperial court

395
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
are all out?

396
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
No.

397
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
The court

398
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
was not going to be closed anymore.

399
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But,

400
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
did he come here right after he escaped?

401
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes.

402
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
He is seriously injured.

403
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Dochi.

404
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yes.

405
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I have a bad feeling.

406
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I think we should

407
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
move the body.

408
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
What?

409
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Get ready.

410
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
First, we will kill the woman and the child.

411
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
What do you mean?

412
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
We don't have time.

413
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Kill them!

414
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Kill them!

415
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Kill them!

416
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Attack!

417
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Calm down!

418
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
We can't let them get away!

419
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Attack the enemy!

420
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Don't let them get away!

421
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't let any of them escape!

422
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Kill them!

423
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Kill them!

424
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Kill them!

425
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Kill them!

426
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's him!

427
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Get him!

428
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Are you okay, sir?

429
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Get out of the way!

430
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Sir, get out of the way!

431
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Find out about this

432
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and kill them!

433
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Kill them!

434
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Kill them!

435
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Drop your sword.

436
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You are

437
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
former gold master, Kim Sooman.

438
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
How did you become

439
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
the head of the army

440
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
who was the master of the country?

441
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
How did you

442
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
put that sword in the country?

443
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Did my sword

444
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
put the country in the country?

445
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
My sword

446
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
is putting the right place

447
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
in the country.

448
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
The people who enjoy power

449
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
from the blood of the country.

450
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The evil leaders who suck the blood

451
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
of the poor people

452
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and make them the rulers.

453
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The traitors who became

454
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the front line

455
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and became the blood of the people.

456
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
This sword

457
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
is not fair.

458
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's not fair.

459
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Stop holding the sword.

460
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Why did you

461
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
lose justice

462
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
under the sword of the traitors?

463
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You are

464
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
the one who

465
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
put the country and the people

466
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
in the right place.

467
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Think about it!

468
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
The sword of the country

469
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
is putting the country in the right place.

470
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
The evil leaders who suck the blood

471
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
of the people.

472
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
The traitors who suck the blood

473
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
of the people.

474
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
The evil leaders who suck the blood

475
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
of the people.

476
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
The traitors who suck the blood

477
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
of the people.

478
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
The evil leaders who suck the blood

479
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
of the people.

480
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
The traitors who suck the blood

481
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
of the people.

482
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
The evil leaders who suck the blood

483
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
of the people.

484
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The traitors who suck the blood

485
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
of the people.

486
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
The evil leaders who suck the blood

487
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
of the people.

488
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
The traitors who suck the blood

489
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
of the people.

490
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
The evil leaders who suck the blood

491
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
of the people.

492
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The traitors who suck the blood

493
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
of the people.

494
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
The evil leaders who suck the blood

495
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
of the people.

496
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The evil leaders who suck the blood

497
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
of the people.

498
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I will ask you one last time.

499
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Is Dani

500
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
the daughter of Han Jae Gyeom?

501
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yes, she is.

502
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
She was the daughter of a traitor.

503
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Do you know what a traitor is?

504
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You didn't just

505
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
put her in your mouth.

506
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You just

507
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
framed her.

508
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You framed her.

509
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Her innocence

510
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
is recorded in the records of the Emperor.

511
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You were sacrificed

512
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
for Choi Won Young's

513
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
murder.

514
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Choi Won Young?

515
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Do you understand?

516
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The world you live in

517
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
is like this.

518
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Your loyalty

519
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
is destroyed

520
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
by the name of the traitors.

521
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The cursed gods

522
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
are enjoying the movie of weapons

523
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
and the evil leaders.

524
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But,

525
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
you are smart.

526
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
This rotten world

527
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
will be destroyed.

528
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
One day,

529
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
a new world

530
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
will be born.

531
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
A new world

532
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
will be born.

533
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
A new world

534
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
will be born.

535
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
A new world

536
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
will be born.

537
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
A new world

538
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
will be born.

539
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
A new world

540
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
will be born.

541
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
A new world

542
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
will be born.

543
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Choi Won Young's death

544
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Choi Won Young's death?

545
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yes, it is.

546
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
In Yeongnam,

547
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
how much is the land of

548
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
the great leader?

549
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You don't know

550
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
how much he owns.

551
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
If it is the case of

552
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
this region,

553
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
you are very worried.

554
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
These days,

555
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
you are more worried than ever.

556
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But,

557
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
the leader of the country

558
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
is the back of the great leader.

559
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
How can he be the leader?

560
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
After the death of the great leader,

561
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
the leader of the country

562
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
is more dangerous

563
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
than the great leader.

564
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
He said

565
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
killing him is not a good thing.

566
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
When will the time come?

567
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It is possible that

568
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
the people will be angry

569
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
and it will be difficult to deal with.

570
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
He said

571
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
to reverse

572
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
his words.

573
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
He said

574
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
to kill

575
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
his words.

576
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Choi Won Young's death

577
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Leave the chicken.

578
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I have

579
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
something to suggest to you.

580
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
If you accept this offer,

581
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I can release

582
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
your sin

583
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
without any more punishment.

584
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
What?

585
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
What did you say?

586
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Are you crazy?

587
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What?

588
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Why did you

589
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
meet with the vice-president of Gyeongju?

590
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It was the crown of Choi Won Young.

591
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
The crown of the great leader?

592
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Why did you

593
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
make a fool of the great leader?

594
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
If you had caught Choi Won Young

595
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
and put him in prison,

596
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
he would have been executed

597
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
by the police.

598
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Why did you follow him?

599
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You are exaggerating.

600
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
What?

601
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
What is?

602
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
You are still

603
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
a traitor.

604
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
You are a traitor.

605
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
You are a traitor.

606
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I caught you

607
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
because you are a businessman.

608
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You were running around

609
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
with the vice-president

610
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and you are a traitor.

611
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
If the vice-president

612
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
had said so,

613
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
you should have come to me first.

614
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
What is your name?

615
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You met with the vice-president

616
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and you did this, right?

617
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You just do what I tell you

618
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
and do what I tell you.

619
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
You just do what I tell you.

620
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You don't know that

621
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
my house is the same as yours.

622
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Right?

623
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Right.

624
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Where did you go?

625
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
If you do this again,

626
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I will kill you.

627
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
If you don't want to

628
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
be a traitor,

629
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
do it yourself.

630
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
The body was taken away

631
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and the one who lost his life

632
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
is more than 100 people.

633
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
The one who was caught

634
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
is more than 200 people.

635
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
They will all be

636
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
sent to the slave.

637
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And

638
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
the daughter of Kim Sooman

639
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
will be

640
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
in the hands of the crown.

641
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Let the tears fall.

642
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Let the tears fall.

643
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
In front of those who

644
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
shed blood for the world,

645
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
we will only answer with blood.

646
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Let the tears fall.

647
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Let the tears fall.

648
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

649
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

650
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It's Soin 300.

651
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It's Soin 300.

652
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's Soin 300.

653
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It's Soin 300.

654
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It's Soin 300.

655
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The king of the empire

656
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
of Gyeongju

657
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
will be

658
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
executed

659
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
by the Myeonghwa Empire.

660
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So

661
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Miss Tania

662
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
went to Gyeongju

663
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
in a hurry.

664
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
What?

665
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Did you come to me

666
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
because you wanted to see me?

667
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I didn't think of anyone

668
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
other than you, Your Majesty.

669
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
You know better than anyone

670
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
about me.

671
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You are innocent.

672
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Please reveal the truth

673
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
in the name of the crown.

674
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
What will you do

675
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
if I refuse?

676
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I will not give up.

677
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I will bet everything on myself.

678
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I will bet everything

679
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
on myself to save his life.

680
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But

681
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
if I am frustrated,

682
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
then I will also

683
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
be the last one to be with you.

684
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
What will you do

685
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
if I release the signal

686
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
of the crown?

687
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I know

688
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
that you are the

689
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
late Han Jae Gyeon.

690
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
If I

691
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
prove

692
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
that you are innocent,

693
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
will you

694
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
stop the

695
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
national war?

696
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I will not release

697
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
the signal.

698
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I have been hoping for this

699
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
for a long time.

700
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It was my only goal.

701
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
But now,

702
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
it is different.

703
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
If I release the signal,

704
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
my father will not come back.

705
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
If I

706
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
don't help him,

707
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
he will not

708
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
be able to come back.

709
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
He will be free from

710
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
his sin.

711
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You are the father

712
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
who died unjustly.

713
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You want me to

714
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
reveal the truth

715
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
by removing the blame

716
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
of the innocent.

717
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
How can you

718
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
make such a

719
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
suggestion?

720
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It is not only me.

721
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
There are many people

722
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
who want to die with me

723
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and die for the country.

724
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
There are people who want to

725
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
risk everything for the country.

726
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Do you have

727
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
such people

728
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
next to you?

729
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Do you have

730
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
people who risk everything

731
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
for you?

732
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Have you thought about it?

733
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I have thought about it

734
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
deeply.

735
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Then,

736
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
will you

737
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
return the lifetime

738
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
property rights

739
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
and give half of the land

740
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
to the country?

741
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Will you destroy

742
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
the property rights

743
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
and get the same property rights

744
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
as the country?

745
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You will not

746
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
return the land

747
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and will you

748
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
never return the land?

749
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You will only

750
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
use this as a bait.

751
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
If you use this as a bait

752
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and do what you do,

753
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I will save your life.

754
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
The End
