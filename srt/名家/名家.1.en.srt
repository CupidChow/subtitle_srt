00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
스톰틀

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,960
Explosive

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What have they done?

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
been stuck in one place

5
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,020
For a very long time

6
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,120
Eun Beom lammed

7
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,080
Nem

8
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,480
It's an old story

9
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,260
This place

10
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,120
A impressions can't be remained

11
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,920
Like The records

12
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,100
It's a lost

13
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,240
Friends have been lost

14
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,280
Lyrics

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,120
I was sold

16
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,860
But the attitude

17
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,940
Pour tea

18
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:06,940
The secret of the rich for 300 years is the unique teaching of this family.

19
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:21,180
There should be no

20
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:40,180
The story of a famous writer who has protected the wealth of the Manchuk-gun for 300 years and completed it most beautifully.

21
00:02:51,180 --> 00:03:01,180
The story of a famous writer who has protected the wealth of the Manchuk-gun for 300 years and completed it most beautifully.

The story of a famous writer who has protected the wealth of the Manchuk-gun for 300 years and completed it most beautifully.

23
00:03:51,180 --> 00:04:01,180
The story of a famous writer who has protected the wealth of the Manchuk-gun for 300 years and completed it most beautifully.

24
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:11,180
The story of a famous writer who has protected the wealth of the Manchuk-gun for 300 years and completed it most beautifully.

25
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:21,180
The story of a famous writer who has protected the wealth of the Manchuk-gun for 300 years and completed it most beautifully.

The story of a famous writer who has protected the wealth of the Manchuk-gun for 300 years and completed it most beautifully.

29
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:21,180
The story of a famous writer who has protected the wealth of the Manchuk-gun for 300 years and completed it most beautifully.

30
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:31,180
The story of a famous writer who has protected the wealth of the Manchuk-gun for 300 years and completed it most beautifully.

31
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,180
You're following me, you bastard!

32
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
Grandpa!

33
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,180
Grandpa!

34
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,180
We're in trouble.

35
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
What trouble?

36
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,180
They're in trouble.

37
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:10,180
The Oirangkhe from Cheongna are coming in and a lot of people are coming to our neighborhood.

38
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:21,180
The Oirangkhe from Cheongna are coming in and a lot of people are coming to our neighborhood.

39
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:31,180
The Oirangkhe from Cheongna are coming in and a lot of people are coming to our neighborhood.

40
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,180
The Oirangkhe from Cheongna are coming in and a lot of people are coming to our neighborhood.

41
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,180
Hurry up!

42
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,180
You have to hurry up!

43
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,180
We have to hurry up!

44
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,180
You're all dead!

45
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,180
You can sleep like dogs, but I can't sleep like that!

46
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:01,180
If you keep sleeping like that, you'll be in trouble!

47
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,180
Hurry up!

48
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,180
Oh my god.

49
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,180
Are you really sick?

50
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,180
From now on, make this song and make it die.

51
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,180
What?

52
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,180
We have to make porridge for the refugees.

53
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,180
Everyone is starving, so don't save rice and make plenty.

54
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,180
Yes, father.

55
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
Hurry up and make the porridge.

56
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,180
Yes, mother.

57
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,180
What are you doing?

58
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,180
You're going to feed them to death?

59
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,180
To all those people?

60
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,180
You're going to make a mess.

61
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,180
Hey, give me some rice.

62
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,180
I'm going to make porridge for the refugees.

63
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,180
Porridge!

64
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,180
Oh, I'm alive.

65
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,180
I'm alive.

66
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,180
What are you doing?

67
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,180
You're going to make porridge and make porridge?

68
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,180
You're going to make porridge and make porridge?

69
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Stand in line!

70
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,180
Please stand in line!

71
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,180
Slowly!

72
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,180
Come forward!

73
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,180
What are you doing?

74
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,180
What are you doing?

75
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,180
Take off your clothes.

76
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,180
Slowly!

77
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,180
Stand in line!

78
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,180
Grandma, stand in line!

79
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,180
Stand in line!

80
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,180
Take off your clothes!

81
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,180
Slowly!

82
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,180
Slowly!

83
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,180
Don't push!

84
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,180
Take off your clothes!

85
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,180
Take off your clothes!

86
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,180
Hey!

87
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,180
I won!

88
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,180
Sir!

89
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,180
Hey, you should look straight.

90
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,180
I'm sorry.

91
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,180
I'm sorry.

92
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,180
Sir, can you give me a bowl of porridge?

93
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Sir, are you going to make porridge?

94
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,180
No, I'm not going to eat it.

95
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Just a bowl of porridge.

96
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,180
What's wrong with you?

97
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,180
You're so clumsy today.

98
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,180
Darn it.

99
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,180
Wait here for a moment.

100
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,180
Grandpa.

101
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,180
Oh, you're here.

102
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,180
Can you give me a pound of money?

103
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
A pound of money?

104
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,180
I need money.

105
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,180
Did you see anything you wanted?

106
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,180
Well...

107
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,180
Didn't you say you needed money?

108
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,180
I have a favor to ask.

109
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,180
A favor?

110
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,180
You're going to ask for money?

111
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,180
I'm sorry.

112
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
Hey, you!

113
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,180
Take this.

114
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,180
My brother is giving it to you.

115
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,180
Take it.

116
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,180
You did something wrong.

117
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,180
He's feeling sorry for you.

118
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,180
What are you doing? Take it.

119
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,180
I don't need it.

120
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
What?

121
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,180
I'm not a beggar.

122
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,180
And if you want to give it to me, you have to give it to me.

123
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,180
Why are you asking me to give it to you?

124
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,180
What the hell is this?

125
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,180
You're going to give me this?

126
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Are you trying to feed me?

127
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,180
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

128
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,180
You're not going to teach me anything?

129
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,180
I'm sorry, sir. I don't know much about the young.

130
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
You're a bastard.

131
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,180
You should teach me properly.

132
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,180
I'm sorry.

133
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,180
You're not going to teach me anything?

134
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,180
You're not going to teach me properly.

135
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
Sir...

136
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,180
What are you doing?

137
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,180
You're dead!

138
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,180
You're not going to teach me properly.

139
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
You're a bastard.

140
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,180
Sir...

141
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,180
Sir...

142
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,180
Didn't you say you had something to apologize for with this money?

143
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,180
I gave it to you, but you didn't take it.

144
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,180
I didn't take it?

145
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:18,180
Then I don't take money, but I accept the meaning of apology.

146
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,180
Guk-sun, come closer.

147
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,180
Come closer.

148
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,180
Have you ever thought about why the power is like this?

149
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,180
It's the shape of a power supply. Isn't it supposed to be like this?

150
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,180
That's right. It's the shape of a power supply. It's supposed to be like this.

151
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:06,180
Guk-sun, if you look at this power supply, there's a big meaning in it.

152
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,180
Do you see the meaning?

153
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,180
No.

154
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,180
This round thing is the sky.

155
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,180
The square hole in the middle is the shape of the earth.

156
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,180
The shape of the power supply means the connection between the sky and the earth.

157
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,180
That's called the power supply.

158
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,180
The power supply between the sky and the earth?

159
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,180
That's right.

160
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:50,180
The meaning that people shouldn't go against is the power supply between the sky and the earth.

161
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:57,180
You were going to apologize to someone with this power supply today,

162
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,180
but you couldn't fulfill that.

163
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
Yes.

164
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:12,180
The fact that people's hearts can never be obtained or solved with money is the power supply between the sky and the earth.

165
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,180
You'll realize it someday.

166
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:26,180
You'll just have to do this so you don't forget the meaning of the power supply.

167
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,180
Yes.

168
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,180
Why are you suddenly taking out the food?

169
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,180
Im-ja, it's time.

170
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,180
What do you mean, time?

171
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,180
When will you make money?

172
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,180
Money is supposed to be like a monster.

173
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:07,180
It's easier to protect when there's a war.

174
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,180
Think about it.

175
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,180
Would the refugees just come here?

176
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,180
They would have brought a ride or something.

177
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:24,180
But gold is not enough to eat.

178
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,180
Let's go, guys.

179
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,180
Yes.

180
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,180
The price of the chicken is so high that the people at home don't even pay.

181
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,180
It's worth the price of the grass.

182
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,180
It's cold.

183
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,180
The refugees are suffering.

184
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,180
They can't even go out.

185
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,180
Just give them a little bit.

186
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,180
You changed your clothes.

187
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,180
Just give them a little bit.

188
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,180
If you have something good, bring it.

189
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,180
What is it?

190
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,180
The rice is here.

191
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,180
Take the food.

192
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,180
The rice is here.

193
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Come on.

194
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,180
Just give them a little bit.

195
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,180
It's cold, but my heart is warm.

196
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,180
Give them a little bit.

197
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,180
It's cold.

198
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,180
Hey, uncle.

199
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,180
My wrist is still numb.

200
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,180
It's cold.

201
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,180
Get on the boat.

202
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,180
He's so bitter.

203
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,180
What's wrong?

204
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
Nothing.

205
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,180
Let's go.

206
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
My shoes.

207
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,180
My shoes.

208
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
My shoes.

209
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,180
I'm not the one.

210
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,180
I'm not the one.

211
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,180
I'm not the one.

212
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,180
I'm not the one.

213
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,180
I came all the way here to see you.

214
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,180
Isn't this the bond we have?

215
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:54,180
Thanks to your eyes,

216
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:00,180
your wrist is still so numb.

217
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,180
Please don't say that.

218
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,180
Don't worry.

219
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,800
I can't bring this

220
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:57,060
Abandoned Do dueلة

221
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,600
I got

222
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,180
I'm sorry.

223
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,180
Hold on.

224
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,180
What if you don't die tomorrow?

225
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,180
Not that.

226
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,180
It's deep there, so we need a bigger rock.

227
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
That's too small.

228
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,180
We need a bigger rock.

229
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,180
We need to put it in the middle.

230
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,180
Your Excellency, the King is here.

231
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,180
Don't push yourself so hard.

232
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,180
How can I not know my body?

233
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,180
Ok Dong, get the cart ready.

234
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,180
I need to give the medicine to the King.

235
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,180
Ok, I got it.

236
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,180
Yes, that's it.

237
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,180
I got it.

238
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
Now I'm on the rock.

239
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,180
Grandpa, I...

240
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,180
Follow me.

241
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Get off me.

242
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,180
What's going on?

243
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,180
Father, I'm not going to die.

244
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,180
You're going to get the Prince?

245
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,180
Did you do it or not?

246
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,180
You're driving me crazy.

247
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,180
I didn't do it in a bad way.

248
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,180
You don't know what you did wrong?

249
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,180
It's unfair.

250
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,180
I'm so sorry for the poor people

251
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:40,180
who are walking in the cold in this cold winter.

252
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,180
I just wanted to help them,

253
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,180
so I let go of their legs.

254
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,180
I don't know why you're so cruel.

255
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,180
I let go of their legs because I wanted to.

256
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,180
How long did it take?

257
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,180
About 20 hours.

258
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,180
Then go to the cold and let go of their legs.

259
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,180
And stand there for 20 hours.

260
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Master, can you come out now?

261
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,180
I'm not a beggar yet.

262
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,180
You're a beggar.

263
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,180
You're not even a beggar.

264
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
You're a beggar.

265
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,180
Isn't that what you're doing?

266
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:42,180
You told me to stand there for 20 hours.

267
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,180
I'm going to stand there for 20 hours.

268
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:01,180
How is my body?

269
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,180
It's cold.

270
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
My feet are cold.

271
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,180
It hurts like they're going to rip.

272
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,180
It's like I'm frozen.

273
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,180
Come out now.

274
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Come out now.

275
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,180
Do you know how the children who let go of their legs

276
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,180
for 20 hours in the cold water feel?

277
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,180
Yes.

278
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,180
They endure the pain of being torn apart

279
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,180
and they let go of their legs without a word.

280
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,180
Why do you think that is?

281
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:07,180
Because they're eating the blood from our family.

282
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,180
That's it.

283
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,180
You used the children's weaknesses.

284
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,180
Because you were the child of a family who gave birth to you,

285
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,180
the children who ate your blood were worried

286
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,180
that you might be a bad daughter.

287
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,180
That's why you let go of your legs.

288
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,180
I don't know how you feel about letting go of your legs

289
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,180
to help others.

290
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,180
But if you do good things

291
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:42,180
and push other weak people into pain,

292
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,180
will you be able to do good things?

293
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,180
I'm sorry.

294
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,180
Above all, people are important.

295
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,180
Goksun.

296
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:05,180
Everyone in this world is important.

297
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,180
I'll be kind.

298
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,180
The End

299
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,180
You must be tired.

300
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,180
Trust me.

301
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,180
I've told you the right thing.

302
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,180
You'll be relieved.

303
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,180
You don't have to believe me.

304
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,180
Think about it.

305
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,180
How long will this go on?

306
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,180
Can we beat the Cheongna?

307
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
It's hard.

308
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,180
If we beat the Cheongna,

309
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,180
the Cheongna will be destroyed.

310
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,180
We'll eat the blood of the woman

311
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,180
and then we'll eat the blood of the woman.

312
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,180
I'll be right back.

313
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,180
I told you.

314
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,180
I'll be right back.

315
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,180
Stand in line.

316
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,180
One more line.

317
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,180
One more line.

318
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
One more line.

319
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,180
One more line.

320
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,180
Did I live a lie?

321
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,180
I paid for the milk I got from the old man.

322
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,180
I'm innocent.

323
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,180
I paid for the milk

324
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,180
and I took the woman away.

325
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,180
Before you get caught,

326
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,180
you must pay me.

327
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,180
I see.

328
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,180
I'll pay you.

329
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,180
I don't have time to talk to him.

330
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,180
Let's go.

331
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,180
My mother told me to cook porridge today.

332
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,180
I understand.

333
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,180
No!

334
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,180
No!

335
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,180
100,000 times 100,000 times.

336
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,180
You're the next lucky one.

339
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,180
Tan is not allowed to live!

340
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,180
You bastard!

341
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,180
Tan is your daughter!

342

Tan is my daughter!

00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,180
You bastard!

344
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Tan is my daughter!

345
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180
What are you doing?

346
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,180
Give me the money and go!

347
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,180
No, sir!

348
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,180
No!

349
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:26,180
My daughter can't die!

350
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,180
I don't like things.

351
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,180
My daughter is not a monster!

352
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,180
You bastard!

353
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,180
Father!

354
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,180
I'm sorry.

355
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,180
I'm sorry.

356
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,180
I'm sorry.

357
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,180
I'm sorry.

358
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,180
Have you ever treated me like a human?

359
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,180
I'll kill you today.

360
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
What are you doing?

361
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,180
You're a criminal.

362
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,180
Go to the court.

363
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,180
Yes, sir.

364
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,180
No!

365
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,180
No, sir!

366
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,180
Father!

367
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,180
No, sir!

368
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,180
Father!

369
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,180
No!

370
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,180
Be his mistress.

371
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,180
Yes, sir.

372
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,180
Let's go!

373
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,180
Father!

374
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,180
Father!

375
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
Let me go!

376
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
No!

377
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,180
Grandpa!

378
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,180
You're almost a man.

379
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,180
You're a man of great importance.

380
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:46,180
Everyone in this world is important to me.

381
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:51,180
But how can you bully Ga-yeon?

382
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:58,180
Do I look like I'm bullying the poor?

383
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,180
You're so wrong.

384
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,180
Please let go of my poor father.

385
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,180
That's not possible.

386
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:13,180
There are laws and regulations in this world.

387
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:19,180
You think it's right to kill people no matter what?

388
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,180
Father!

389
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,180
Father!

390
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:50,180
I couldn't get any money from the money I had.

391
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,180
I was so poor.

392
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:59,180
I was going to sell my wife and get a job.

393
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,180
But I was so poor that Kim Jae-chun broke my leg.

394
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,180
I was so poor that I was going to be fired.

395
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:13,180
I think the father is the one who caused the trouble.

396
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,180
My wife said that.

397
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,180
Is that all?

398
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:26,180
She was so happy that she got a job.

399
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:35,180
Don't you need a maid at your house?

400
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,180
The daughter of the head of the family is very smart.

401
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:50,180
She can work at your house and sell her wife.

402
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,180
Look.

403
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:59,180
You have to take care of your wife like a singer.

404
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:05,180
How can you leave your wife and go to college?

405
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:10,180
Are you teaching me?

406
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,180
I'll give you a hundred.

407
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,180
Leave this village with your father and daughter.

408
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,180
A hundred?

409
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,180
I have two slaves. I'll take 200.

410
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,180
I told you to leave.

411
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,180
How can you leave a young girl to your father?

412
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,180
How can you do this to a human?

413
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,180
Since you are a high-ranking official,

414
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,180
your father will be punished.

415
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,180
We will take care of the girl.

416
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,180
Are you going to leave here with this money?

417
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:57,180
If you say so, I will.

418
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Call the guest.

419
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,180
Get out of here.

420
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,180
Get out of here.

421
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,180
Get out of here.

422
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:41,180
Is it true that you fired your wife?

423
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,180
I was killed.

424
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:50,180
How can you do such a thing?

425
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:57,180
I was so embarrassed that I couldn't even stand.

426
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:07,180
If you forgive me once, I will never do it again.

427
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,180
Leave it.

428
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,180
It's your first time, so I'll forgive you.

429
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,180
But it's only once.

430
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,180
If you do this again, I will not stand still.

431
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,180
Do you understand?

432
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:41,180
I will not forget this.

433
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,180
I will not forget this.

434
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,180
It's a mission.

435
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:18,180
I am here to give you a mission.

436
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:23,180
The death of the princess has been a crisis for hundreds of years.

437
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:28,180
So, we will take the death of the princess

438
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,180
and send her to the palace.

439
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:36,180
We will prepare for the death of the princess

440
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,180
so that the courtiers and the courtiers can serve the court.

441
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,180
We will prepare for the death of the princess

442
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,180
and send her to the palace.

443
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,180
The situation is getting worse.

444
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,180
The enemies have captured Pyongyang in ten days.

445
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:08,180
If it's like this, they could have attacked the outside of Pyongyang.

446
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,180
The city is surrounded.

447
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:16,180
Does that mean it could be difficult?

448
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,180
Yes.

449
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:24,180
Then we should move all the troops and prepare for battle.

450
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,180
I am the one who is in trouble.

451
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:35,180
I called the courtiers, but please report this.

452
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:41,180
I will go and tell them that the situation is getting worse.

453
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,180
This battle will not be a life-or-death situation.

454
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:50,180
It will be a path of death.

455
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:12,180
She should be in the detail.

456
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,180
Please come out

457
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,180
The people of Pyongyang are after Mr Jisoon.

458
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,180
If they bring Pyongyang to the city,

459
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,180
they will daddy in that place,

460
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,180
Because he will get recovered soon.

461
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:34,180
Mother, can you stop going to the palace?

462
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:40,180
I don't want you to go.

463
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,180
What do you mean?

464
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:50,180
This battle will not be a guarantee of life and death.

465
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,180
It will be the path of death.

466
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,180
I can't bear it because I'm worried.

467
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,180
Father is not in the family, but if grandfather is not...

468
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,180
You are the father, aren't you?

469
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:14,180
When grandfather and father are not in the family, you have to take care of the family.

470
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:22,180
And don't try to act like that to grandfather.

471
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,180
Since grandfather has given his order,

472
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:36,180
he will definitely think that he is a sacred stone.

473
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:51,180
Father, father, can't I not go?

474
00:45:53,180 --> 00:46:02,180
Pandora, do you want a father who doesn't know grace?

475
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,180
You too, right?

476
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:11,180
Your father has given great grace to the great godmother.

477
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:18,180
The great godmother has treated me, a good man, with a precious person.

478
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:26,180
This father has been eating that great godmother's food for the rest of his life.

479
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:37,180
Pandora, a man should eat a grain of grain once and then he should eat it until he dies.

480
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:44,180
It's not a man's job to turn a grain of grain into a palm.

481
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,180
Don't cry.

482
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,180
Don't say that.

483
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:07,180
You are the one who took care of that bastard and let him live in the house.

484
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,180
Who? Do you think I did that because I wanted to?

485
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:16,180
If father were a grain of grain, I would be a son of a grain too.

486
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:23,180
If father were a grain of grain, I would be a godfather who would die if he died.

487
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:46,180
Father, father, don't cry.

488
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,180
Do you think it's easy to eat a grain of grain?

489
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,180
Do you think the night will pass by like this?

490
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,180
Uncle!

491
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,180
Sir!

492
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,180
You said that bastard was going to the palace.

493
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:26,180
I heard that bastard didn't have to leave here.

494
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:33,180
You are a rich man.

495
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,180
You saw everything.

496
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,180
I'm sorry I didn't see it.

497
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,180
I'm sorry.

498
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:53,180
The 18th grandson of the late King of Silla, the great King of Go-eun,

499
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,180
the descendant of the four-star dynasty, Choi Jin-il,

500
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,180
I am here to receive the blessing of the ancestors.

501
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,180
It is important to be as heavy as a mountain.

502
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,180
It is the life of a man who is as light as a feather.

503
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,180
By the teachings of the ancestors,

504
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:17,180
he is loyal to the crisis of the Nuran and protects the temple.

505
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,180
This life is all for him.

506
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:36,180
Your father left the house to work as a guard.

507
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:44,180
I'm so heavy that I feel like I'm leaving you with all my stuff.

508
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,180
Father.

509
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:50,180
I'm not strong enough to carry you.

510
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,180
Please take care of yourself.

511
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:59,180
Father, please take care of yourself.

512
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:06,180
We made some rice to eat on the way.

513
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:13,180
I'm sorry I didn't prepare any food.

514
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,180
Thank you.

515
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,180
Why can't I see the national flag?

516
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,180
Father.

517
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:32,180
You haven't been seen since this morning.

518
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,180
Okay.

519
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,180
Ok-dong, let's go.

520
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:44,180
Father, please take care of yourself.

521
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,180
Father.

522
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,180
The great godmother left.

523
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:36,180
She went to find the young master.

524
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:41,180
It hasn't been long since she left.

525
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,180
Young master.

526
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,180
Hey, what are you doing?

527
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,180
Your grandfather is leaving.

528
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:54,180
Aren't you going to see him leave?

529
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,180
You're a fool.

530
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:05,180
You don't know how precious you are.

531
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,180
You're a fool.

532
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:17,180
Do you think you can see someone precious forever?

533
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,180
It's not over now.

534
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,180
It's not over now.

535
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:28,180
Someone precious...

536
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,180
now...

537
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:37,180
You have to keep it in your eyes.

538
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,180
Go.

539
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:56,180
If you go now, you can say goodbye even if you're far away.

540
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,180
Go.

541
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,180
Father.

542
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,180
What's wrong, your grandfather?

543
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,180
Nothing.

544
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,180
Let's go.

545
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,180
Let's go.

546
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,180
Grandfather.

547
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,180
Grandfather.

548
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:39,180
Grandfather, please go well.

549
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,180
Let's go.

550
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,180
Let's go.

551
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,180
Let's go.

552
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,180
Let's go.

553
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,180
Oh, my.

554
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,180
Did you have more?

555
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,180
Try this.

556
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,180
Oh, my.

557
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,180
It's a good breakfast.

558
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,180
What? Are you sick?

559
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,180
No.

560
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,180
I'm not sick.

561
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,180
I'm sick.

562
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:27,180
I'm sick.

563
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,180
I'm sick.

564
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:37,180
But today, the old man left.

565
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,180
Don't stop until you see him.

566
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:48,180
I'm so embarrassed.

567
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,180
That's why I'm telling you.

568
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:58,180
I have a good miracle to get revenge on that evil woman.

569
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:26,180
Don't you miss your father?

570
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:36,180
You said you should keep the precious person in your eyes.

571
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,180
I'm sorry.

572
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,180
I'm sorry.

573
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,180
I'm sorry.

574
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,180
I'm sorry.

575
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,180
I'm sorry.

576
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,180
Young Master.

577
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,180
You have to keep your secret.

578
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,180
I see.

579
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,180
Father.

580
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,180
Father.

581
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,180
What do you mean, father?

582
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:34,180
Don't say that when you have eyes.

583
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,180
How can I be like you?

584
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,180
No.

585
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,180
No.

586
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:46,180
You're my father now.

587
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:50,180
You're my father.

588
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:55,180
You're my father.

589
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,180
Young Master.

590
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:05,180
You're my only father.

591
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,180
Don't cry.

592
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,180
He's about to die.

593
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,180
No.

594
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,180
No.

595
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,180
No.

596
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,180
Run!

597
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,180
Run!

598
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,180
Run!

599
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,180
I should have been alive.

600
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,180
I should have been alive.

601
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,180
I should have been alive.

602
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,180
I will be ready to die,

603
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,180
I will be ready to die,

604
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,180
but I will be ready to take care of my body.

605
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,180
What do you mean?

606
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,180
I will prepare a foodstuff for you.

607
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,180
You will be there with your father.

608
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,180
I am not a fool.

609
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:57,180
I have a good reason to be alive.

610
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,180
Have you seen a child like this?

611
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,180
He is not a child.

612
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,180
You are not a child.

613
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,180
Do not treat him like a fool.

614
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,180
I am not a child.

615
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,180
I do not care about my life.

616
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,180
Have you seen a baby like this?

617
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,180
I have a good reason to be alive.

618
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,180
I have a good reason to be alive.

619
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,180
I have a good reason to be alive.
