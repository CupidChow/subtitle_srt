1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Starynanych 현이에요

2
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,420
This guy got Jake

3
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,500
How the?

4
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,500
I can't let her go.

5
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
How can you say that?

6
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,500
I heard that she was a criminal in Hanyang.

7
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Our family can't lose our family's dignity.

8
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,500
And she was a slave of our family.

9
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
How can you...

10
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
let her go?

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Father, even so,

12
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
I can't marry someone I don't like.

13
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Please reconsider.

14
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,500
How long are you going to keep talking nonsense?

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
To you,

16
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
the law and the family are all the same.

17
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I can't let her go.

18
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I can't follow your will either.

19
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Mother!

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Mother!

21
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Mother!

22
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Mother!

23
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Mother!

24
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Mother!

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Mother, are you okay?

26
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm okay.

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm okay.

28
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I'm okay.

29
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I'm okay.

30
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,500
How can she be so blind?

31
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
She's going to be a witch.

32
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
She's going to eat a lot of things.

33
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
What should I do?

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
What did she do?

35
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

36
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
No, no.

37
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Oh, my.

38
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
She doesn't know what kind of person she is.

39
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Is she like that with all the women in Hanyang?

40
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Oh, my. Look at me.

41
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
I forgot to put the herbal medicine in the soup.

42
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
I forgot. I forgot.

43
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Miss, what's wrong?

44
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Did something happen?

45
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,500
No.

46
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
The witch is here.

47
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
The witch is here.

48
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
The witch is here.

49
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
The witch is here.

50
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
The witch is here.

51
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,500
The witch is here.

52
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
The witch is here.

53
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
The witch is here.

54
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,500
The witch is here.

55
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
The witch is here.

56
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Mother, please eat more.

57
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
That's enough.

58
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Guk-sun.

59
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Can't you do as father says?

60
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Master!

62
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Master!

63
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,500
The witch came to the capital and did a thing.

64
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
You said you bought land.

65
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
I just dug up the ground.

66
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
I put a lot of bricks in the house.

67
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
I put a lot of bricks in the house.

68
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
What are you doing?

69
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
It's raining.

70
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
You should be careful.

71
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
You should be careful.

72
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
You've been working all day.

73
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Do you think I'm just playing?

74
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
And you're my wife.

75
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
If you want to scratch your pants,

76
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
scratch your back.

77
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
What did you say?

78
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Mother just laid down.

79
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Please be quiet.

80
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Can you see the land tomorrow?

81
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Yes, I can.

82
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
You'll see, but this is a land of matchmaking.

83
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
I knew it.

84
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
How can you know?

85
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
What?

86
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Go inside and rest.

87
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
What's wrong?

88
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
You're weak.

89
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
You're weak.

90
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Be quiet.

91
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
If you have the strength to chew, fly.

92
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
How are you?

93
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
How are you?

94
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Thank you.

95
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
I have a serious disease.

96
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
I thought I was getting better,

97
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
but I was getting better.

98
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
I have a serious disease.

99
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
I have a serious disease.

100
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
I have a serious disease.

101
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
I'm so worried.

102
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I'm so worried.

103
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
No, it's okay.

104
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
I'll do it.

105
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
You're still young.

106
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
You're still young.

107
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
You grew up so well.

108
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,500
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Did you hear everything?

110
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Don't be sad.

111
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
How can you tell me not to be sad

112
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
with such a sad face?

113
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Don't be sad.

114
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Just as you came here

115
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,500
to trust me,

116
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,500
please continue to love me.

117
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
What do you want me to do?

118
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,500
You're a man and a woman.

119
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Why are you walking in the kitchen?

120
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
I was passing by...

121
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
It's late. Go inside.

122
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Yes.

123
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
You should go inside too.

124
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
It's cold in the room.

125
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Don't worry about me.

126
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Go inside and sleep.

127
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Yes.

128
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,500
I'm begging you.

131
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Please.

132
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I couldn't sleep at all

133
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
after Gukseon left Hanyang.

134
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Now that she's finally back,

135
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
I can't see her

136
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,500
standing up to you like that.

137
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Please.

138
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm sorry that Gukseon

139
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
made you go back to your mother.

140
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,500
I'm begging you.

141
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Can you tell me

142
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
how I feel?

143
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I'm sorry.

144
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I'm sorry.

145
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
I'm sorry.

146
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,500
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm sorry.

148
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Yes.

149
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
I heard that you have a big contribution

150
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
to the investigation of the murder of Gukseon.

151
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
You're exaggerating.

152
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
How can you

153
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
keep this kind of person

154
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,500
in a corner?

155
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
It must be a lot of trouble.

156
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Don't worry.

157
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
I'll call your heir.

158
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
You should be able to

159
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
get the throne.

160
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Your Majesty,

161
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I'm here to pay you back.

162
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,500
What kind of favor?

163
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,500
First, you'll be a local official

164
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
and then you'll be a general.

165
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Then you'll be in the central government.

166
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I'll be happy to see you.

167
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Then I'll be happy

168
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
to see you in Gyeongju.

169
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,500
If you ask me what I want,

170
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,500
I want to go to Gyeongju.

171
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,500
I want to go to Gyeongju.

172
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
How are you?

173
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I'm fine.

174
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
How are you?

175
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,500
This is what a landowner does.

176
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,500
The soil is sticky and oily.

177
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Usually,

178
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
a handful of rice is enough,

179
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
but this much soil is a handful of rice.

180
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
But why does a landowner

181
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
come here to sell rice?

182
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Is it because he can't afford it?

183
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
No, it's not that.

184
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,500
The landowner is a rich man.

185
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
He sells the land

186
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
and starts a different business.

187
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
That's what he does.

188
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,500
Then...

189
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
I want to live well together.

190
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
I want to live well together.

191
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I can see that in you.

192
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Then why don't you

193
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
do something instead of

194
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
buying or selling?

195
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Do something?

196
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Yes, do something.

197
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Don't get married to someone.

198
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
You can make more money

199
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
and share it with others.

200
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Brother,

201
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
I'm going to make

202
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
grain and

203
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,500
puseonggyu.

204
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
What do you think?

205
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,500
What do you think?

206
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
I will buy this land.

207
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I will buy this land.

208
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,500
I will buy this land.

209
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Madam, please come in.

210
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Welcome.

211
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Please come in.

212
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
What did I say?

213
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
You have to trust me.

214
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I told you that the land

215
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
was made in the morning.

216
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Yes.

217
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
It was good that you

218
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
brought me to Gyeongju.

219
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm glad I came with you.

220
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
But should we

221
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
make it more exciting?

222
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,500
If it's 20,000 won per person,

223
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
it's a bit too much.

224
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
No, it's more comfortable

225
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
to live with my own money.

226
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
If it's 20,000 won,

227
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
it's worth it.

228
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I made 200 people

229
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
in Hanyang.

230
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
It's enough for us

231
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
to farm.

232
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
You want to buy the land?

233
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Please check the documents.

234
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Have we met before?

235
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
It seems familiar.

236
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,500
No, it's not.

237
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Sir,

238
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
we are here.

239
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
We are here.

240
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
We are here.

241
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Sir,

242
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
we are here.

243
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
We are in trouble.

244
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
What's wrong?

245
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
The lady

246
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
asked us to come.

247
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
We can't see her.

248
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
We have no guards.

249
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Sir,

250
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
you have to put this away.

251
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
She asked us to make a dream come true.

252
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
But she couldn't help us.

253
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
She just left.

254
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Please forgive her.

255
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Wait.

256
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Gukseon.

257
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Gukseon.

258
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Wherever I go,

259
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
I will always be watching you.

260
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
I will hear about you

261
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
in the wind, in your dreams.

262
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
I will be there for you.

263
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,500
I will make your dream come true.

264
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,500
I will make your dream come true.

265
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,500
You will make it.

266
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
You will read the fortune

267
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
in the vast land.

268
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
You will make the world

269
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,500
of the one you love.

270
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
You have a dream.

271
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
What are you going to do?

272
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
I don't know.

273
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500
The lady left.

274
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,500
I have to push the deal tomorrow.

275
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
That's not possible.

276
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
I couldn't say anything

277
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,500
because I was too young.

278
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Do you know why

279
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,500
we sell land?

280
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
What is it?

281
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
We are selling plates.

282
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
We are selling the land

283
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,500
without telling your wife.

284
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
So you want to sell

285
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
the land

286
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
without telling your wife.

287
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
I knew it.

288
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
You are smart.

289
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
So you want to sell it

290
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
as soon as possible.

291
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
If you push the deal tomorrow,

292
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
you will have the land.

293
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I can't do it.

294
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Is that so?

295
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I sell the land

296
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,500
because I have a story.

297
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,500
It's a waste of money.

298
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
It's been 200 years since I've been a farmer.

299
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Right?

300
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
You are lucky.

301
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,500
You are talented.

302
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
You are lucky

303
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
that you escaped from the Han family.

304
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Welcome to my hometown.

305
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Why are you going to Gyeongju?

306
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
You have to go to a place

307
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
where there is no study

308
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
to work in a public university.

309
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
You don't have to worry about that.

310
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
I learned a lot while I was in the prison.

311
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
In any case,

312
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
I learned that the person in charge

313
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,500
should not make a building with a private building.

314
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Are you talking about me?

315
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
You are so weak.

316
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
You should be careful.

317
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
You should be careful.

318
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
The office will be replaced

319
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
by a public university tomorrow.

320
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
The day of the mass production.

321
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Mr.

322
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Mr.

323
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
There was a similar incident.

324
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Is that so?

325
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
This is the record.

326
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
I'm sorry to leave,

327
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
but I'm sorry to hear that you are leaving.

328
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
I'm sorry to hear that you are leaving.

329
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
It's because you've helped me a lot.

330
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
You will continue to work

331
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
in Gyeongju as a leader.

332
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
You will continue to work in Gyeongju as a leader.

333
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Please, be strong.

334
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Please, be strong.

335
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
Honey!

336
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,500
The new uniform that Wonil will wear is complete.

337
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
It's great.

338
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
It's great.

339
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,500
The uniform is full of earwax.

340
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Is this why you say it's good?

341
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Is Gyeongju's leader

342
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
that much higher than the official?

343
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
It's high.

344
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
Very high.

345
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Very high.

346
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Now, get ready.

347
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Hurry up.

348
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,500
What?

349
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
We have to go down with Wonil.

350
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
With Wonil?

351
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
You mean Gyeongju?

352
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Yes.

353
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Why do you have to leave such a good Han Yang?

354
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
The time has come.

355
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
What time?

356
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Yes.

357
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
Do you know how bad it has been?

358
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
When I ran away and left home,

359
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
I couldn't say anything

360
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
because I was so scared.

361
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
I couldn't say anything

362
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
because I was so scared.

363
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Now, why can't I go back

364
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
to the yard where Wonil

365
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
has become Gyeongju's leader?

366
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I want to go there as soon as possible.

367
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
I want to go there as soon as possible.

368
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
I will show you.

369
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Whether you are here or not,

370
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
I want you to see clearly

371
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
whether you are here or not.

372
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
The reason why his son, Kim Wonil,

373
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
has become the leader

374
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
of Gyeongju's leader

375
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
is because he has always dreamed of becoming a leader.

376
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
I want you to see clearly.

377
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Kim Soo Man and Shim Jung Hak

378
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
studied in the same school

379
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
under Han Jae Gyeon, a South Korean.

380
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
Han Jae Gyeon.

381
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Han Jae Gyeon.

382
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
Han Jae Gyeon.

383
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Han Jae Gyeon became

384
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
the son of two people

385
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
and the wife of one thousand won.

386
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
When he was young,

387
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
he was trying to escape from Gyeongju

388
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
but his actions were obvious.

389
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
His actions were obvious.

390
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Gyeongju.

391
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
He is the one who is obvious.

392
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
He is the one who is

393
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
behind us in the battle

394
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
and is like a chicken in the boiling water.

395
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
He is a scoundrel.

396
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
He is a scoundrel.

397
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Why did you hang

398
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
a medal on your body?

399
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Oh, right.

400
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Oh, no wonder.

401
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Oh, no wonder.

402
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Have you ever seen it?

403
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
I was afraid I would get caught

404
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
so I was sweating like crazy.

405
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I was sweating like crazy.

406
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Now that we are done with the big fight,

407
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
let's get out of here.

408
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
Let's go.

409
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Let's go.

410
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Let's go.

411
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Let's go.

412
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Let's go.

413
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Why did you drink

414
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
so much?

415
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
It's late at night.

416
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
You should go home early.

417
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Father.

418
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Father.

419
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Father

420
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
is always right.

421
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
A man

422
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
is always

423
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
not enough in front of

424
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
his father.

425
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
What are you talking about?

426
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Father is

427
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
always right.

428
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
I don't know

429
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
if he is still right.

430
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Why do you

431
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
always make

432
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
your son

433
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
so sad?

434
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
You forgot that you were

435
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
getting treated.

436
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Tell me.

437
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
Why did you do that?

438
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
It's all because of you.

439
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
When did I say

440
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
I was getting married to your daughter?

441
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Can't you just

442
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
have mercy on me?

443
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Stop it.

444
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Stop it.

445
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
What kind of

446
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
behavior

447
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
are you causing

448
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
to your father?

449
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Mother.

450
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
I'm sorry.

451
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
I'm heartbroken.

452
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
I'm heartbroken

453
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
because of

454
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
your father.

455
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
I'm heartbroken

456
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
because of your father.

457
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Why did you

458
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
tear my heart apart?

459
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Why?

460
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
I did it.

461
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
I did it.

462
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
I asked you to leave him.

463
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
I told you to go far away.

464
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
I asked you to

465
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
change your mind.

466
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Mother.

467
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
I don't blame you.

468
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
I did it.

469
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
You

470
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
are the daughter

471
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
of my father.

472
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Have you ever thought about

473
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
how I feel?

474
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Seeing my child

475
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
get bruised in my heart,

476
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
I feel like I'm bleeding.

477
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
How can I

478
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
live

479
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
the way I want to?

480
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Huh?

481
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Mother.

482
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
Mother.

483
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Mother.

484
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
I can't live.

485
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Then you go away.

486
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
No.

487
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Ma Jiang Hu La Er.

488
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Golden Queen.

489
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Golden City.

490
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Golden Captain.

491
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
The highest

492
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
is 500,000 times 100,000 times.

493
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
The next lucky one is you.

494
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
Macau New Peking Entertainment City.

495
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
931 931.com

496
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
What are you doing here?

497
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Mother.

498
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
I want to drink with you.

499
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Don't forget your seat.

500
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Take care of yourself.

501
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
It's a comfortable day in the house.

502
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
I'm going to Il Seon.

503
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
I'm going to Il Seon.

504
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
I'm going to Il Seon.

505
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
I'm going to Il Seon.

506
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Il Seon is Gashina.

507
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Where is it?

508
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Even if I go,

509
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
I'll wear this scarf.

510
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Even if the winter is over,

511
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
it's still cold.

512
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
This is Abakhan Gashina.

513
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
Come on.

514
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Come on.

515
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Stop.

516
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Stop.

517
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Stop.

518
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
You did a good job.

519
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
You look

520
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
like you're going to be late.

521
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Here you are.

522
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Thank you.

523
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
This scarf.

524
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
It's still my clothes.

525
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
I should be careful.

526
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Here you are.

527
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Thank you.

528
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
What kind of behavior is this?

529
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Who are you?

530
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Looking at you from this distance,

531
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
you're even more beautiful.

532
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
You're much better

533
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
than the ghosts here.

534
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
With this fine hand,

535
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
you're not even worth a penny.

536
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
You're not meant to be.

537
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Stay still.

538
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Oh, Seon.

539
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Oh, Seon.

540
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Oh, Seon.

541
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Oh, Seon.

542
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
You.

543
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
What are you doing?

544
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Why are you touching me?

545
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Oh, it wasn't a dream.

546
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
I'm sorry.

547
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
I'm sorry.

548
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
I saw this in the village.

549
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
The male and female holy places

550
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
are right in front of me.

551
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
I was wondering if it was a dream or a reality.

552
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Oh, my.

553
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
I should have just let him go.

554
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
I missed the fun part.

555
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Oh, my.

556
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
Oh, my.

557
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Ouch.

558
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
It hurts.

559
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Today,

560
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
I'll make you lose your mind.

561
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
I told you it hurts when you hit me.

562
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
I'm not going to hit you.

563
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
I'm going to hit you.

564
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
My arm.

565
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
My arm.

566
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Let go of me.

567
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Let's live a nice life.

568
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
That guy.

569
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
I told you I was sorry.

570
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Oh, my.

571
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
I told you I was sorry.

572
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
I told you.

573
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Let go of me.

574
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Let go of me.

575
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Okay, okay.

576
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Oh, my.

577
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Ouch.

578
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
Ouch.

579
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Ouch.

580
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Ouch.

581
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Ouch.

582
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Ouch.

583
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Ouch.

584
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Ouch.

585
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Ouch.

586
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Ouch.

587
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
I don't think there's anything broken.

588
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
I hit you with my fist.

589
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
You're hitting me like a dog.

590
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Why am I asking for a free drink?

591
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
I just need to fill it up for a day.

592
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
People with a roof under the sky,

593
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
what's wrong with them?

594
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
I'm sorry.

595
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
That professor.

596
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
There's no way he's doing this.

597
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Where do I avoid this drink tonight?

598
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Where did she go?

599
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Miss,

600
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
you're going to the market, right?

601
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Have some.

602
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
I got some side dishes from the kitchen.

603
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Okay.

604
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
I got a sewing machine, too.

605
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
I got a lot of things.

606
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Miss.

607
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
It looks delicious.

608
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Let's serve it.

609
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,500
I don't like you

610
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
staying on the street like this.

611
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
We're not in a position to do anything.

612
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500
But it won't be easy to get this much.

613
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Above all,

614
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
it's a lot of work.

615
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
I'll do the work.

616
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
I'll take you home.

617
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Don't say that.

618
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,500
How can I ask you to do it?

619
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
I

620
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
will stand up again.

621
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,500
I just fell for a moment.

622
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
I'll just stand up again.

623
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
No matter how many times,

624
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
no, hundreds of times,

625
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,500
I will stand up again.

626
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
You're going to Gyeongju?

627
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Now I can finally

628
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
relieve my grief.

629
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
You're crazy.

630
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
What?

631
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
No, no.

632
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
I have a favor

633
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,500
to ask you.

634
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
I'll give you

635
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,500
the money I've got in Hanyang.

636
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Then?

637
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
You're going to take care

638
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
of all the assets in Hanyang.

639
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Who are you?

640
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,500
You're the leader

641
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
of the people in Gyeongju.

642
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
I'll give you

643
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
my money.

644
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
I trust you.

645
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I'll do my best.

646
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
You're the smartest

647
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
of the people around me.

648
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
If it were you,

649
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
I wouldn't have my money.

650
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
I'll play with money in Hanyang,

651
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
buy land in Gyeongju,

652
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
and live a life

653
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
that's not worth living.

654
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
You've done a great job.

655
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,500
I've been looking for you

656
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,500
everywhere.

657
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
I heard there are many

658
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
precious things in the city.

659
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
I didn't know you'd get

660
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
the farm land.

661
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
It's hard to get all the

662
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
farm land you live in.

663
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
I'll see you again.

664
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
If I could get

665
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
these books,

666
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
I'd get them all.

667
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,500
How long

668
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,500
is Gyeongju from here?

669
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
It's not far.

670
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Why?

671
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Do you want to go?

672
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
No.

673
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,500
I want to meet

674
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
someone.

675
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
You'll do it.

676
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,500
You'll get the land

677
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
you live in.

678
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
You'll find the world

679
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
you want.

680
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
You'll build

681
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
a world of precious people.

682
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
You have a picture.

683
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
One day,

684
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
when we meet again,

685
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
I'll show you

686
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
how I make

687
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
my promises.

688
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
I'll show you.

689
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
You're so fast.

690
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
You're so fast.

691
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
You don't even know

692
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
how to do it.

693
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,500
I need to rest.

694
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,500
I was busy.

695
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
I was running instead of you.

696
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
You're so good at

697
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
making promises.

698
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,500
What are you doing in the room?

699
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Get ready.

700
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
What?

701
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,500
Spring is coming.

702
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,500
Get ready to farm.

703
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,500
We have to go to work.

704
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,500
Sir.

705
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,500
Sir.

706
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,500
Let's go.

707
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Come on.

708
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Good boy.

709
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Good boy.

710
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Good boy.

711
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Good boy.

712
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
Good boy.

713
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Good boy.

714
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,500
Good boy.

715
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:46,500
Hey, come here!

716
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,500
Oh my!

717
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,500
Master, the ground seems to be frozen.

718
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
Aren't you rushing too much?

719
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,500
I think we should loosen the ice a little more.

720
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Now, let's change the place.

721
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,500
The ground is getting better, right?

722
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,500
What does the first guy in Hanyang know?

723
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,500
What?

724
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,500
No, from earlier...

725
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Let's go to sleep.

726
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,500
Stop it.

727
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,500
It's the first day we work in our land.

728
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,500
Master!

729
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Who did this?

730
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,500
They dug up the ground and made a mess!

731
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
Master!

732
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,500
You must have some misunderstanding.

733
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,500
This is my land.

734
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
What?

735
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,500
Are you crazy?

736
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,500
This is my land!

737
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Blue Claw!

738
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Blue Claw!

739
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Blue Claw!

740
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
Blue Claw!

741
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,500
Welcome, Master.

742
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,500
I'm sorry for the situation in Gyeongju.

743
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:30,500
I will learn from you about the people.

744
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,500
What a wise man.

745
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,500
You are a thief!

746
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,500
How can you say that this is your land?

747
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:50,500
The whole world knows that my family built this land.

748
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,500
Do you still think this is your land?

749
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,500
What's going on?

750
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,500
Master, what's going on?

751
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,500
You are saying that this is your land.

752
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,500
No, I paid for it.

753
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
Look at this.

754
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,500
This is my land.

755
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,500
Master, this is my life.

756
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Please, tell me the truth.

757
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
Master!

758
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,500
Look at this.

759
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,500
This is the document that proves that I paid for it.

760
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Master, you are walking a lot these days.

761
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,500
I'm looking for a drink.

762
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Give me a bottle of wine.

763
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
I'm sorry.

764
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
I'm sorry.

765
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
I'm sorry.

766
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
I'm sorry.

767
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
I'm sorry.

768
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
I'm sorry.

769
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
I'm sorry.

770
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500
I'm sorry.

771
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
I'm sorry.

772
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,500
I'm sorry.

773
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,500
Give me a bottle of wine.

774
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,500
All right.

775
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
Brother!

776
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,500
What are you talking about?

777
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,500
You can't even drink well.

778
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
You're dead meat!

779
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,500
Don't you know what that money is?

780
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Stop it!

781
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,500
How did I know if that money is real or fake?

782
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
You bastard!

783
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,500
You don't even know that there should be a written statement in the document.

784
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,500
You've been making me nervous since you set up the land.

785
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
I'm a black man.

786
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,500
How can I read the letters?

787
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,500
I just found out that there was a black man in charge of the land.

788
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,500
So I thought I was right.

789
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
What?

790
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,500
I thought you were from Hanyang.

791
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,500
You're not even from Hanyang.

792
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500
You're from Cheonchi.

793
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:16,500
How could you come back to your hometown without asking for money?

794
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
You're so cruel.

795
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,500
You're going to be in trouble.

796
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,500
Oh, my God.

797
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,500
So you're an empty-handed?

798
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,500
You don't have any money left?

799
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,500
I'm ashamed of myself.

800
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:41,500
I'm not a man who can dream.

801
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,500
As soon as I took a step...

802
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,500
Why?

803
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,500
As soon as you take a step, you fall right into the cliff.

804
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,500
I'm not a man who can dream.

805
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,500
It's not easy to achieve, so I'm trying to make it happen.

806
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,500
If it goes as I want, it's not a dream.

807
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,500
It's an empty hand, so it's easy to start.

808
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
I've had enough.

809
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,500
I'm going to make it happen.

810
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,500
What are you doing?

811
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,500
I'll teach you how to make your dreams come true.

812
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,500
I'm going to make it happen.

813
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
That's it.

814
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,500
I'm going to make it happen.

815
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,500
I knew there would be a place like this in Gyeongju.

816
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
Don't you know?

817
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,500
There's an answer here.

818
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,500
Look.

819
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Is this the answer?

820
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,500
I'm going to make it happen.

821
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
I'm going to make it happen.

822
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,500
I'm going to make it happen.

823
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
I'm going to make it happen.

824
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,500
I'm going to make it happen.

825
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
I'm going to make it happen.

826
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,500
I'm going to make it happen.

827
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,500
I'm going to make it happen.

828
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,500
I'm going to make it happen.

829
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
I'm going to make it happen.

830
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,500
I'm going to make it happen.

831
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
I'm going to make it happen.

832
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,500
I'm going to make it happen.

833
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,500
I'm going to make it happen.
