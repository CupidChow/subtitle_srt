1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:18,600
In this film

2
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,520
You're quite a big boy.

3
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,400
I didn't know you were this big.

4
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,400
It's been a while since I've been with you.

5
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,400
It reminds me of the old days.

6
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,400
I agree.

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:49,080
Where is the U.C.

8
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,080
It's been years since I came to your house.

9
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Sir, isn't that the youngest of the U.C.

10
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Yes, it is.

11
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Makdoong.

12
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Sir.

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
What brings you here?

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,080
I came to see your father.

15
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
I have something to tell you.

16
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Makdoong.

17
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Have you been well?

18
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,080
I didn't know you were in the neighborhood.

19
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
I can't live because the fish are biting.

20
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,080
I can't do business because I can't do the job.

21
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,080
I see.

22
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,080
You look good.

23
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,080
You have fulfilled all my wishes.

24
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:41,080
You don't resent me, do you?

25
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,080
What do you mean?

26
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,080
I'm embarrassed to hear that.

27
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,080
I'm happy to learn again.

28
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,080
I'm glad you fulfilled your wishes.

29
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:13,080
I couldn't keep the most important promise.

30
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,080
What do you mean?

31
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:24,080
What was the most important promise you made to me?

32
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,080
You said you were going to get rich with your hands.

33
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,080
You said you were going to get back on your feet.

34
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:41,080
I learned today that you have fulfilled all my wishes.

35
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,080
And you.

36
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,760
Half of the people who areě

37
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,080
You are really cool.

38
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,080
What do you mean?

39
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,300
Why did you even warn me?

40
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,720
Why would you do that?

41
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,080
Tel me again.

42
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,340
We've not even met for years

43
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,140
and if she gets angry over it...

44
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,060
I missed her totally.

45
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,280
I really missed her.

46
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,460
Ol' girl.

47
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Now it's time for you to know.

48
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:22,080
You say you are grateful to me, but the money was actually transferred by your wife.

49
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:31,080
You knew that you were in a position to take the land that was stolen, and you prepared 200 sheep.

50
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,080
I just gave them to you in the middle.

51
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
That's not true.

52
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Mak Dong-hee came running to you saying that he was meeting your wife.

53
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,080
I thought I should tell you about it.

54
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Yes. What should I say?

55
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,080
You paid me back.

56
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Thank you. I didn't know that you helped me like that.

57
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,080
I just wanted to help you a little bit.

58
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,080
It's something that's meant for me.

59
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:30,080
I felt a little bit of pressure because you were right and you were using the money for the right thing.

60
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,080
But why did you go so far away?

61
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
Sheep?

62
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,080
My husband gave the sheep half of the money to the herders.

63
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,080
He said that they could earn more money by doing other things.

64
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,080
He said that he would tell the herders about the sheep and the street in the neighborhood.

65
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Then you're doing the right thing.

66
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,080
It's not easy to keep buying the best sheep.

67
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,080
So you're trying to trade with foreigners through the nearby town.

68
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,080
That's what I'm saying.

69
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Il-sun, let's go to Gyeongju.

70
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Tell your wife that we should have sheep in Gyeongju.

71
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Thank you for the food.

72
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Tell me if you need anything else.

73
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,080
I'm worried about my wife.

74
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
What?

75
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,080
She's always so worried about her husband.

76
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,080
She's trying to handle the misunderstanding.

77
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
I think she's getting more and more worried because she's a pregnant woman.

78
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,080
But what's the big worry about the herds?

79
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Look, I'm going to sell the sheep.

80
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,080
I'm going to sell the sheep.

81
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
What?

82
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
I'm going to sell the sheep.

83
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
I'm going to keep getting half of the farmland.

84
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,080
I'm going to keep the farmland.

85
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
You don't know that.

86
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,080
My husband grew up in this house.

87
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,080
He was a farmer.

88
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
He was a farmer.

89
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
He was a farmer.

90
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
He was a farmer.

91
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,080
And he built this house with extreme care.

92
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,080
I'm worried about him seeing all the suffering he's going through.

93
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,080
I'm worried about him seeing all the suffering he's going through.

94
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Really?

95
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,080
It's good to be kind to others,

96
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,080
but I don't think I should pull out the pillars of my house.

97
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Finally, the time has come.

98
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,080
It's the time when you were living in the dark.

99
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
That's right.

100
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Now I'm going to buy you land.

101
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Did you find out?

102
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Yes.

103
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Now every house has a dead end.

104
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,080
The trees are cut off in the mountains and there are a few people.

105
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,080
But that's only for a day or two.

106
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
The dead end is growing,

107
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
so if it's worth the money,

108
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,080
I'll sell it to sell it.

109
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Yes, yes.

110
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Buy me a house,

111
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
a house,

112
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,080
or a house.

113
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
I know a lot of people who are very rich.

114
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,080
They're good at farming and they're good at selling land.

115
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,080
I hate it.

116
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,080
We have nothing to be sorry about.

117
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,080
We'll buy you land.

118
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,080
If you don't want to sell the land,

119
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
we'll give you the land.

120
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Yes.

121
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,080
We have to increase the land in the next year.

122
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,080
Will there be another good opportunity?

123
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Oh, my God.

124
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
I know it's a lot,

125
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
but it's too much.

126
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
It's not too much.

127
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
It's time.

128
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,080
It's time to change the course of the world.

129
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Haven't you heard of the snake?

130
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Oh, my God.

131
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
There's no one in this land

132
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,080
to give my family a hug.

133
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,080
My son's blood is sweat.

134
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Oh, my God.

135
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
If you don't want to sell the land,

136
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,080
you can die in the middle of the field.

137
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,080
What are you talking about?

138
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Give me the land.

139
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Master,

140
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
if you ask me for help,

141
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
wouldn't you help me?

142
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Yes.

143
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,080
How can I ask for help?

144
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,080
And I didn't know

145
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,080
how to get help

146
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,080
from the old days.

147
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,080
I'm ashamed of myself.

148
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,080
That's not your fault.

149
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,080
You never told me not to tell you.

150
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,080
But I'm ashamed of myself.

151
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
You're not ashamed of yourself?

152
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,080
But you're not going to leave?

153
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Every time I think of the past few years,

154
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,080
I don't know what I'm going through.

155
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,080
I'm in pain.

156
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
I'm doing well,

157
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,080
but I'm worried about my enemy.

158
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,080
My heart doesn't change.

159
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,080
You trusted me and came all the way to Gyeongju.

160
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,080
I didn't do anything for you.

161
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Master, don't think like that.

162
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,080
You're the one who's responsible

163
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,080
for the lives of all people.

164
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,080
We all have our own lives.

165
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,080
You have your own life.

166
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Fate and fate are natural.

167
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Fate doesn't work on people.

168
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Fate doesn't work on people.

169
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Don't be so heartbroken.

170
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Yes.

171
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Fate is something that people can't do.

172
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Miss.

173
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Did Master say anything?

174
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
What?

175
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,080
He said he came to the neighborhood.

176
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
What does he mean?

177
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Brother Bandol said he was going to

178
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,080
have a family dinner with the village elders.

179
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
He must have paid the village elders

180
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
for the training.

181
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
So he's looking for something to do

182
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
with the villagers.

183
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,080
Master.

184
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
No, Master!

185
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Don't say that!

186
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Look at your son.

187
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Eat.

188
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Oh, my.

189
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,080
How can you take away the blood of the king?

190
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,080
You're going to die!

191
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,080
Oh, my!

192
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,080
What?

193
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,080
You took the soup from Gyeongju

194
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,080
and got beaten up?

195
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Master, please kill him.

196
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
What?

197
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
What are you talking about?

198
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,080
What about the money

199
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,080
I took from Yeongnam?

200
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
Don't worry about that.

201
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,080
I'll give you a beating.

202
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Oh, come on.

203
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,080
That's how you do it.

204
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,080
No, Master.

205
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
If you give me a chance,

206
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,080
I'll give you a beating.

207
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
I'll get you a new one.

208
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
Oh, my.

209
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,080
You're so kind.

210
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,080
But I have something to tell you.

211
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
What is it?

212
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,080
I saw it with my own eyes.

213
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
There was a man

214
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,080
who had lost his job.

215
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
What?

216
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
A man?

217
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Did you just say Kim Sooman?

218
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,080
Now,

219
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,080
the day has come.

220
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,080
Tonight,

221
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,080
we will rise up!

222
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,080
The world calls us the enemy,

223
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,080
but we are not the bandits.

224
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,080
We are the bandits

225
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,080
who have been chased by the people

226
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,080
because of the evil of the people

227
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,080
and the evil of the people.

228
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,080
We will never hurt the innocent people

229
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,080
because we suck the blood of the people.

230
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
From now on,

231
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,080
we will rise up!

232
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,080
We will light up the world

233
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,080
by lighting up the torch

234
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,080
on our way.

235
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,080
We will lead the people

236
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,080
to the world where the people

237
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
will be the sky

238
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,080
by the evil of the people.

239
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,080
We will be the light

240
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
that will show them

241
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,080
that we are alive!

242
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Let's go!

243
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Let's go!

244
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
What are you doing?

245
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
What are you doing?

246
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
Let's go!

247
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Let's go!

248
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
Let's go!

249
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
My son!

250
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
My son!

251
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,080
My son!

252
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
You bastard!

253
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
You are the leader of the evil people.

254
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
You can't take care of the people

255
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
like your father.

256
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
How could you do this?

257
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
You have made a mistake

258
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
by making the people suffer.

259
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
I have never done that.

260
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,080
You have ten times the return on the debt.

261
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,080
You have five times the tax you have paid.

262
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
You have taken the daughter

263
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
of the poor people

264
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,080
and you are the leader of the people.

265
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,080
You want to be the leader?

266
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
Please save me.

267
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
Open the gate.

268
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
Kill him

269
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
and open the gate.

270
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Yes, sir.

271
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Come on!

272
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
What are you doing?

273
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
Let's go!

274
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Commander,

275
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
the spirit of the evil people

276
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,080
is unusual.

277
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
They tied the leader of the evil people

278
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
in the mountains and made a great effort.

279
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,080
Where can they be?

280
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,080
I will strengthen the defense of the castle.

281
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
There is a formation in Gyeongju.

282
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
Even if the evil people are the evil people,

283
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
they can't come to the place

284
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
where the soldiers are.

285
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
I trust you.

286
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,080
The evil people are the people.

287
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,080
There is no problem

288
00:22:51,080 --> 00:23:09,800
with the

289
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
evil people.

290
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,080
You mean you will save them?

291
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Yes.

292
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,080
I don't know what you mean,

293
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,080
but there are many people

294
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,080
who are in this situation.

295
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,080
I said that I couldn't save the poor people.

296
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
But

297
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,080
when I saw the way back from the neighborhood,

298
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,080
I saw that the children had nothing to eat.

299
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,080
They were eating the soil.

300
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,080
We can't feed them all,

301
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,080
but at least in our house,

302
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
we want to make sure

303
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,080
that there are no people starving.

304
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Even though I know that

305
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
there are people who can't eat

306
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
and can't breathe,

307
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,080
I don't think I can eat

308
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,080
a meal a day.

309
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
I understand.

310
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
I will do that.

311
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,080
I will hurry up and kill them.

312
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,080
I have something to tell you.

313
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,080
What is all this?

314
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,080
It's a map of the land.

315
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,080
It's cheap because it's a year.

316
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
I received it as a proof

317
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,080
that I would sell the land.

318
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
If you pay the price,

319
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,080
the land will be yours.

320
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
I took advantage of the fact

321
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,080
that bad people like Kim Ja-chun

322
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
were trying to sell it for less than 10%

323
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,080
If you pay half the price,

324
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,080
you will be a big fan.

325
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,080
I will give you a gift.

326
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Come on.

327
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,080
Slowly.

328
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,080
I will give you a gift.

329
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
Come on.

330
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Slowly.

331
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
Slowly.

332
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Come on.

333
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
Come on.

334
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
I will give you a gift.

335
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,080
Slowly.

336
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Hello.

337
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
What are you doing here?

338
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
You said you would pay the price.

339
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,080
I thought you would need a discount.

340
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
Thanks to the discount,

341
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,080
we can survive the winter.

342
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,080
It's not enough, but we have nothing to starve.

343
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
We have nothing to do

344
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,080
so I went to the mountains to get some.

345
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,080
I will bring it every day if it's useful.

346
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Thank you for your kindness.

347
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,080
I will use it here.

348
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
It's good.

349
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
It's dry and crispy.

350
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Of course.

351
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
Master.

352
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Master.

353
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
What happened?

354
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
You look uncomfortable.

355
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Master, what's wrong?

356
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
What happened?

357
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,080
I can't buy the land.

358
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Is the land too expensive?

359
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,080
It's not because of the land.

360
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
If you take this money,

361
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,080
I will kill my grandchildren.

362
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Just buy it at the price of the man.

363
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,080
I almost sold my old hair to the old man.

364
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,080
I will sell it to him.

365
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,080
I don't think I can pay you that much.

366
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Look at that.

367
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,080
What did I say?

368
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,080
I didn't mean to bite you.

369
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,080
I brought the rice that I bought with the land.

370
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,080
You can pay me back next year.

371
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,080
How many years will you sell your land?

372
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
If you sell your land,

373
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,080
what are you going to do next year?

374
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Master.

375
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,080
I will go now.

376
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Thank you.

377
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,080
Thank you.

378
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
Master.

379
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Which house is next?

380
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
There.

381
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
It's the master's house.

382
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,080
Let's go.

383
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,080
It's delicious.

384
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
In winter,

385
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,080
the meat is very chewy.

386
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,080
Try this.

387
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,080
I'm fine.

388
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,080
May I come in?

389
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
Come in.

390
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,080
What is it?

391
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,080
Well...

392
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
What is it?

393
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
Well...

394
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:15,080
I'm not sure if I can buy you land.

395
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
What are you talking about?

396
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Well...

397
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,080
The new owner,

398
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,080
I took all the land I was going to buy.

399
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,080
He said he would pay me back.

400
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
What?

401
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,080
He did that?

402
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
And he's talking about it.

403
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Today, the landlord, Choi Guk-sun,

404
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,080
is running the town and giving me back the land.

405
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,080
He said he wouldn't buy the land,

406
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,080
but he's lending me the rice.

407
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,080
What?

408
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,080
Choi Guk-sun is going to be my enemy?

409
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,080
That's not all.

410
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,080
He's been making rice wine since this morning.

411
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,080
He's even given me a treasure.

412
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,080
He's going to sell the land.

413
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,080
He's not going to sell it?

414
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,080
How capable can someone so low-екong,

415
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,080
have attentively traded to my Ad Kun Tzu?

416
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,080
Just ask him how much he spent.

417
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Cunning mulberry.

418
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,080
It's no use kill him when there's so little rice left.

419
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,080
It'll be useless to Drop his blows and apologize later.

420
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
Daddy.

421
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
Here.

422
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Here's your water.

423
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
Try it.

424
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
It will help you relieve the heat.

425
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
You should drink this.

426
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,080
You must have had a hard time sharing the porridge all day.

427
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
No, it wasn't hard.

428
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Master.

429
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
Yes?

430
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Can I come in and learn?

431
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
Come in.

432
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Master.

433
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
You are so stupid.

434
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:38,080
Now you are trying to get rid of me by making a plan.

435
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,080
Is that true?

436
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,080
Master.

437
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,080
I just want to be good to you.

438
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,080
How can you always try to do me a favor?

439
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,080
You are disappointed in my actions.

440
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,080
No, I'm not.

441
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
I just...

442
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
When I first came to Gyeongju,

443
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,080
I was cheated on many times and was greatly insulted.

444
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,080
I feel so sorry for myself.

445
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
It's all in the past.

446
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
I don't even remember it.

447
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
The highest is 50,000 times 100,000 times.

448
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,080
The next lucky one is you.

449
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Aomansingpujing Entertainment Center, 931-931.com

450
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,080
I still want to die thinking about it.

451
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,080
So I thought I had a chance to wash that sin.

452
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:05,080
So I bought the land for a good price and wanted to help myself.

453
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
But I didn't know how to use it.

454
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,080
You lowered the deposit and gave it to the customers.

455
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,080
You even used 931-931.

456
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
It's a hard-earned fortune.

457
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,080
I don't think it will disappear so soon.

458
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Shouldn't we find a way to get rid of it?

459
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,080
I don't know how grateful you are for me.

460
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:39,080
But, Bubong, do you think I'm only good at losing money?

461
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,080
I will never buy land for the next year.

462
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,080
No, I will tell my children not to buy land for the next year.

463
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Do you know why?

464
00:34:53,080 --> 00:35:01,080
My grandfather said that you should not take advantage of others' weaknesses to survive.

465
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:09,080
Even if you want to make good will, you should not use other people's hard work.

466
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:22,080
It is right to buy land for poor people to starve to death to increase my wealth.

467
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,080
I didn't know.

468
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:34,080
I know that you are worried about the singers because of my decision.

469
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,080
But trust me and follow my will.

470
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,080
You two should help me.

471
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Yes, sir.

472
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Sir.

473
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Don't say that you are leaving.

474
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,080
I didn't mean to be mean to you.

475
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:05,080
I was just being mean to you.

476
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:16,080
I shared wealth with you, but I didn't share my will.

477
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:26,080
God wants to break the law.

478
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,080
As the king of all things, the empire will remain sovereign for the searches of lap за Dák dм einerế andWellinga.

479
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:39,480
Then, my kingdom will beเี�

480
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,480
I'm sorry.

481
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,480
You must be tired.

482
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,480
How come you're here?

483
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
It's all my fault.

484
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Why did Mubong gather those land documents?

485
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,480
I'm just worried about the land.

486
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,480
I can't trust the land management.

487
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,480
The other people are worried about it.

488
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Don't think like that.

489
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,480
We all depend on you.

490
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,480
But you must be tired of the rest.

491
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,480
I miss you a lot.

492
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,480
You broke the old seal for the people of Pyramid.

493
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Why did you do that?

494
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Did you feel the same way?

495
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:21,480
I lost my fear when I opened the seal.

496
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:29,480
I was afraid that if I lost the seal and couldn't fill it again,

497
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,480
I would be in a state of panic.

498
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,480
I wanted to close the seal.

499
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,480
But the children who were eating the land

500
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,480
reminded me of their faces.

501
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,480
I think we should save them.

502
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Good.

503
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
Good job.

504
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,480
I also shared my death today.

505
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,480
I feel better than ever.

506
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:27,480
If we can save someone by reducing the amount of food we eat a day,

507
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,480
we should do that.

508
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,480
Thank you.

509
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,480
I'm so happy to hear that.

510
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,480
I know what poverty is.

511
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,480
I don't want to be in pain like him.

512
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
I'm sorry.

513
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:04,480
I must find a way to overcome this hate.

514
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
I'm sorry.

515
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,480
How could you release the old seal?

516
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,480
I've never heard of this before.

517
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,480
It's not surprising to see that.

518
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
Yes.

519
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,480
My father was a refugee in Gyeongju when I was young.

520
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,480
He had the old seal juice from Nari's house

521
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
and endured the refugee.

522
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,480
He was so poor that he couldn't even drink water.

523
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,480
How could he be a refugee?

524
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,480
I see why Nari came to the neighborhood.

525
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,480
I'm a merchant from the neighborhood.

526
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,480
I brought Nari to the house.

527
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,480
I beg you.

528
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,480
If you send the good-quality Korean silk to the outside world,

529
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,480
you can sell it.

530
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,480
I want to trade with foreigners.

531
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,480
I'm not sure if I can do that.

532
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,480
I want to trade with foreigners.

533
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,480
If I can create a stable company in Gyeongju,

534
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,480
it will be of great help to me.

535
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
What do you think?

536
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,480
Sir, there is no such thing as gratitude.

537
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
Isn't that right?

538
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Yes, it is.

539
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,480
But we don't know how to do it.

540
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,480
It will be difficult to do it right now.

541
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Don't worry. I'll tell you.

542
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
This should be good.

543
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,480
It's good for me for a while.

544
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,480
It's good for me for a while.

545
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,480
It's not humid.

546
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,480
I hope there are windows on the walls.

547
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,480
Windows?

548
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,480
Yes, the wind is good and the sunlight is good.

549
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,480
It's easier to tell when a slave wakes up when the windows are bright.

550
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Do you have to take care of the time to wake up?

551
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,480
The slave is more difficult than I thought.

552
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,480
I can't leave the ship for long, so I have to go back to the neighborhood.

553
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,480
I'll leave Il-San here,

554
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,480
so you'll be able to help me while you're getting ready.

555
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,480
But where should I get the leaves?

556
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,480
We don't have mulberry trees in our village.

557
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,480
If you plant mulberry trees this winter,

558
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,480
you'll be able to grow mulberry trees in my village.

559
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,480
Until then, I have a garden in the neighboring village,

560
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,480
so I'll guide you.

561
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,480
The next mission will be in Gyeongju.

562
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,480
But Gyeongju is heavily guarded by the Jinyoung.

563
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,480
As the Japanese army said, we need help from the enemy.

564
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,480
I'll go to the village and get the leaves.

565
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,480
I'll go to the village and get the leaves.

566
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,480
I'll go to the village and get the leaves.

567
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,480
Sangbaek,

568
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,480
tell the merchants who enter our inn

569
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,480
and the merchants who are in charge of the business

570
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:18,480
that the enemy will attack Gyeongju.

571
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,480
If you say so, do you mean the day of the full moon?

572
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,480
Yes, the day of the full moon.

573
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,480
I'll tell them that I'll attack Gyeongju.

574
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,480
And you go to the Jinyoung.

575
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,480
Go to the fort and get the ship.

576
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,480
Choose only the bad ones

577
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,480
and put them on the ship.

578
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,480
You must be a good man.

579
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,480
You must be a good man.

580
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,480
Stop!

581
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,480
What's the matter, Sangyeon?

582
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,480
Where is the king of the two-storied tribe?

583
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
If it's the two-storied tribe...

584
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,480
I'll take you back soon.

585
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,480
Do I have to check the body?

586
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,480
No, go ahead.

587
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,480
Yes.

588
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,480
Let's go.

589
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
What did you say?

590
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
What did you say?

591
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
What did you say?

592
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,480
What did you say?

593
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
What did you say?

594
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
What did you say?

595
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
What did you say?

596
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,480
The Ming family is going to attack Gyeongju on the full moon.

597
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
The Ming family?

598
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
Yes.

599
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,480
Then we should at least do some training.

600
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,480
What are you talking about?

601
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,480
We have nothing to do.

602
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,480
We should do something.

603
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,480
What?

604
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,480
We'll get the two-storied tribe in trouble.

605
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
Yes.

606
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,480
And we'll tell the evil people

607
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,480
that we're here.

608
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,480
Be careful.

609
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,480
Rumors that Ming family is going to attack Gyeongju

610
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,480
have been around for a long time.

611
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,480
Rumors have been around for a long time.

612
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,480
But now that we have the two-storied tribe...

613
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,480
It's not a bad thing.

614
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,480
It's not a bad thing?

615
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,480
They don't know that Gyeongju has a military base.

616
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,480
It's not easy to invade other areas.

617
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,480
But I don't know why they attacked Mancheon.

618
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,480
It's obvious that they'll be on the edge.

619
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,480
How can they be so reckless?

620
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,480
They're just trying to get away.

621
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,480
I heard that the Ming family

622
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,480
is now above the level of the bandits.

623
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,480
They're well trained and they're going to be successful.

624
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:42,480
Before they get into trouble,

625
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,480
I hope that the bandits will be eliminated as soon as possible.

626
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,480
Yes.

627
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,480
Now that the leader of Gyeongju has added the bandits,

628
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,480
I feel a little heavy.

629
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,480
Soon, we'll get rid of the people who are in the way

630
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,480
and get rid of the people who are in the way.

631
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
Yes.

632
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,480
I'll trust the bandits.

633
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,480
I'm going to sell the land.

634
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,480
How can I sell the land?

635
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,480
Why do you do this?

636
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,480
You're not a real man.

637
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,480
You're just a good man.

638
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,480
You're just a good man.

639
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,480
I'm not a good man.

640
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,480
I'm just a good man.

641
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,480
I'm just a good man.

642
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,480
Is it true that Ming family is coming?

643
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,480
Of course not.

644
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,480
Who is your son?

645
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,480
Isn't he the leader of Gyeongju?

646
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,480
This is not a small village.

647
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,480
This is a big village.

648
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,480
Where are the bandits coming from?

649
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,480
Then why are you asking this?

650
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:52,480
There's nothing wrong with being careful.

651
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,480
Oh, my.

652
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,480
Commander Tokkasa!

653
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,480
A soldier just raised his watch.

654
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,480
He said he found a suspicious meat boat last night.

655
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,480
Suspicious meat boat?

656
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:32,480
The leader of Gyeongju told me all the captives are missing.

657
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,480
I see.

658
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,480
Sergeant Song Dong Gyeok.

659
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,480
Yes.

660
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,480
He's a scout who's attacking the west.

661
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,480
He's got a plan to tie our foot up in Gyeongju

662
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,480
and attack Yeongin.

663
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,480
Let's go to Yeongin and meet all the other agents.

664
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,480
Yes.

665
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,480
I will go through the Myeonghwa Castle in advance.

666
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,480
What do we do?

667
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,480
The Gyeongju Commander just led the soldiers and left for Yeongil.

668
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
I see.

669
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,480
This way!

670
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,480
After we find the General and burn him, we will kill him!

671
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,480
Yes!

672
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,480
Let me go!

673
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,480
Take the Gyeongju Commander away!

674
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,480
Yes!

675
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,480
Madam, don't come out of the house.

676
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,480
Sir!

677
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,480
What's going on in my house?

678
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,480
Are you the owner of this house?

679
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,480
Yes.

680
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,480
Madam!

681
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,480
Madam!

682
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,480
Madam!

683
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,480
No!

684
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,480
The End
