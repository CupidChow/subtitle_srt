1
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,840
I didn't expect you to ask me out.

2
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,800
There's something

3
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,800
I don't know how to bring up with you.

4
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,120
Is there anything in this world

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,120
that Mrs. Long can't speak about?

6
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,960
No.

7
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,800
Actually...

8
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,640
You want to talk about

9
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,240
the cooperation between Long Corporation and me, right?

10
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,840
Yes.

11
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,240
I know

12
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,650
I shouldn't interfere.

13
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,440
But

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,240
I can't just watch Haotian

15
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,840
bear all this burden alone.

16
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,360
If we're discussing business matters,

17
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,440
let's meet at the office.

18
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,640
Wait.

19
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,320
Hold on.

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,120
I asked you to meet me here

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,840
precisely because I don't want to discuss this

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,240
at a corporate level.

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,700
Then how do you want to discuss it?

24
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,600
As friends.

25
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,000
Friends?

26
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,200
Good

27
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,440
friends.

28
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,970
Your contract with Long Group is about to expire.

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,120
This time,

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,460
the company is facing some minor issues,

31
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,490
and the contract

32
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
might not be fulfilled on schedule.

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,800
So,

34
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,760
I'd like to ask you to give Haotian a few more days

35
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
to get through this difficult time.

36
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,500
Do you know with this request,

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,900
how much I'll lose?

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,440
I know,

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,440
and your losses

40
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,440
will be compensated by Haotian.

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
How?

42
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,170
We're all businesspeople,

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,760
why should I help you?

44
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,040
I'll have Haotian

45
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,560
reduce the price

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,900
by 5% on this contract.

47
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,040
And,

48
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,600
if you encounter any difficulties in the future,

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,560
Long Group

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
will help you unconditionally.

51
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,900
The offer is tempting,

52
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,490
but I'm not interested.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,000
What do you want then?

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,500
I haven't decided yet,

55
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,860
I'll let you know when I figure it out.

56
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,160
Fine,

57
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,720
I agree.

58
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,920
However,

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,400
I won't do anything

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,240
illegal.

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,700
You're overthinking.

62
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,760
Go back and tell Long Haotian

63
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm only giving him three more days.

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,960
Okay.

65
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,760
Thank you.

66
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,400
Haotian.

67
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,160
About the company issues.

68
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,680
Oh.

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,300
Actually, they're almost resolved now.

70
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,640
We found a new supplier.

71
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,360
It's just that their production capacity is a bit limited.

72
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
So

73
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,100
it might take a few extra days.

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
Today I

75
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,040
talked to Zhong Zimo.

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,130
What did you see him for?

77
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,890
I didn't want you to worry alone every day.

78
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,880
So I met with him to talk things over.

79
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,500
He agreed to

80
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,240
give us three more days.

81
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,240
Thank you, Ruoyun.

82
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,960
I promised you a carefree life with me.

83
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,640
I never meant for you to worry like this.

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,159
Haotian.

85
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,840
Don't say that.

86
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm your wife.

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,900
We're supposed to share both the good and bad times.

88
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
What I can do

89
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,210
is just this little bit.

90
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,340
It's more than enough.

91
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,040
Brother Zimo.

92
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,280
The contract period has expired,

93
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,080
why haven't you asked Haotian for the penalty fee?

94
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,960
I promised a friend

95
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,370
to give him three more days.

96
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,560
What friend

97
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,000
is more important than our plan?

98
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,330
Don't worry,

99
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,100
even with three more days,

100
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,740
Long Haotian still won't be able to solve it.

101
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,040
But why didn't you tell me in advance?

102
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,280
Yiran,

103
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
you've waited for eight years,

104
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,740
what's a couple more days?

105
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,160
Rest assured,

106
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,040
when the time comes,

107
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,100
I'll go to Long Haotian immediately.

108
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,000
Brother Zimo.

109
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,840
Oh,

110
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,770
I will definitely help you, Yiran.

111
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,040
Besides,

112
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,040
I have another plan.

113
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,640
It's been so many years since I've been back,

114
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,440
things have really changed.

115
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,100
Have another bite.

116
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,320
Delicious, isn't it?

117
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,160
It's really good.

118
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,450
If you like it, eat more,

119
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
good girl.

120
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,120
If you like it, eat more.

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,400
Nuonuo loved the pastries from this shop when she was little.

122
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,409
I wonder if Miss Chu likes them?

123
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,840
Madam.

124
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,360
There's a middle-aged man with the surname Li outside who wants to see you.

125
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Someone named Li?

126
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,480
I don't know anyone with the surname Li.

127
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,840
Then

128
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,280
I'll go send him away.

129
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,370
Uncle Zhang.

130
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
Please bring him in,

131
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,040
in case it's something important.

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,530
Alright.

133
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
This way, please.

134
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,960
Madam.

135
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,960
Hello.

136
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,040
Young lady,

137
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,880
don't you remember me?

138
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,640
Who are you?

139
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,040
One day,

140
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,400
I was passing by your house

141
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,760
and asked you about that bridge.

142
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,680
Oh, it's you, sir.

143
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,560
Yes.

144
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Please have a seat.

145
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
Have a seat.

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
Young lady,

147
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,760
I live not far from here.

148
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,040
That's good you live nearby.

149
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,040
Sir,

150
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
do you need

151
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,120
any help with anything today?

152
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,400
No, no.

153
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,240
I came today

154
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,680
mainly to thank you

155
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,840
for helping me the other day.

156
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,080
Sir,

157
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,640
you're too kind.

158
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Anyone would have helped you with such a small matter.

159
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,280
Madam,

160
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,570
dinner is ready.

161
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Thank you, Zhang.

162
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,800
Sir,

163
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,540
have you eaten yet?

164
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
If not,

165
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
why don't you join us?

166
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,480
Sure,

167
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,240
let's go.

168
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,120
Okay.

169
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,900
Please have a seat.

170
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,000
We're having hot pot.

171
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,640
Yes.

172
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,200
This hot pot is different from what you get outside.

173
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,130
Please try it and see if you like it.

174
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,600
Just looking at all these ingredients,

175
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,720
it must be delicious.

176
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,600
Let's try it.

177
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,200
Yes, everything in there is ready to eat.

178
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,840
Great.

179
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,400
How is it?

180
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,660
Delicious.

181
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,140
Really delicious.

182
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,840
Please have some more.

183
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,500
Have a seat.

184
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,880
Uncle,

185
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,920
if you enjoy the food,

186
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,640
feel free to come by whenever you're free.

187
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,280
I'll have Uncle Zhang cook for you.

188
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,800
Sure.

189
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,810
Alright.

190
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,480
Try that one too.

191
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,240
My husband

192
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,840
loves this hotpot too.

193
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,720
Young lady,

194
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
your husband is so fortunate to have

195
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,770
such a kind and virtuous wife like you.

196
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,600
He's truly blessed.

197
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,840
Uncle,

198
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,600
my husband

199
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,660
is always very busy with work,

200
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,740
and I haven't been able to do much for him.

201
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,040
Dear,

202
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,520
if I may ask,

203
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,400
is your husband

204
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,570
facing some difficulties?

205
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,800
Tell me about it,

206
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,040
maybe I can help you both.

207
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,640
No need, uncle.

208
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,370
We'll figure it out ourselves.

209
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,040
Thank you.

210
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,240
Alright.

211
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,200
Grandma.

212
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,320
Grandma.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
Why did you come here?

214
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,680
Why shouldn't I come?

215
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,840
I came to see if Long Corporation still exists.

216
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,170
What are you talking about?

217
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,380
How long were you planning to keep me in the dark?

218
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,250
Grandma.

219
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,680
You already know everything.

220
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,140
So many things have happened at the company,

221
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,040
and I was

222
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,200
the last one to know.

223
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,400
Do you still

224
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
see me as your grandmother anymore?

225
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,040
Grandma.

226
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
I didn't want to burden you with more troubles,

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
that's why I didn't tell you.

228
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,080
Haotian.

229
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,800
I'm worried about you.

230
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,640
Those uncles

231
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,280
and elder uncles of yours

232
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,440
have been keeping their eyes on you.

233
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,370
If such a serious matter isn't handled properly,

234
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,880
I'm afraid

235
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,640
that you might...

236
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,800
Grandma,

237
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,840
don't worry,

238
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,000
I know what I'm doing.

239
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,170
I'm already working on a solution.

240
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,040
Good.

241
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,770
I'm glad you have it under control.

242
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,240
I came here

243
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,480
to make you understand how serious this matter is.

244
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,280
This situation,

245
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,240
you absolutely cannot take it lightly.

246
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,610
I understand, Grandma.

247
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,840
Alright,

248
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,410
I won't disturb your work anymore.

249
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,520
Okay.

250
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,440
Take your time on your way back.

251
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay.

252
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,640
Take care, Grandma.

253
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,480
I will.
