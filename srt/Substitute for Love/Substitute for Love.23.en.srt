Can anyone tell me

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,100
why this month's performance is so poor?

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,360
Tonight when you go home,

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
I want each of you to submit a report to me,

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,160
with at least 10,000 words.

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Did you hear me?

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:14,760
Hello.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,640
I'm here to see Manager Chu from your company.

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,440
What's your name?

23
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
My name is Xiao Ai.

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,640
Given that

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,680
the target company has a registered capital of 10 million yuan,

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,640
the equity transferor

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,160
will proceed with the acquisition through the company's existing shareholders.

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,420
Mr. Zhong, Li Yiran has sold the company.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,760
Let's end here for today.

30
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,210
Meeting adjourned.

31
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,120
Go ahead.

32
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,000
What is Li Yiran up to?

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,560
Xiao Ai.

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,320
Madam,

35
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,440
what's happening?

36
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,700
Li Yiran wants to sell Long Corporation.

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,040
What?

38
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,200
Really?

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,500
Does Haotian know?

40
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,000
I've spoken with the chairman.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
He said it has nothing to do with him,

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,820
so I came to you.

43
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,420
Let's go to Long Corporation.

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,840
Mr. Zhong.

45
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,200
Hey, Uncle Li.

46
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,760
Where are you?

47
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,260
I need to talk to you about something.

48
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,560
Okay.

49
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,240
Uncle Li.

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
Zimo, you're here!

51
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
Join me for dinner.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Uncle Li,

53
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,560
actually,

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
I've been investigating something recently,

55
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,320
about Chu Ruoyun.

56
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
What is it?

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,260
You need to prepare yourself.

58
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,920
How serious could it be?

59
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,520
You're being so mysterious.

60
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Chu Ruoyun is your biological daughter.

61
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,320
Come here,

62
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,120
let's eat first.

63
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,920
Come on,

64
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,400
come over.

65
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,280
Uncle Li.

66
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,860
Everything I said is true.

67
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,400
Have a seat.

68
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,020
Try the food first.

69
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,680
Actually, I've known for a while that Ruoyun is my daughter.

70
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,560
I was the one who saved her when she fell into the sea.

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,920
Fate has a way of working things out for the best.

72
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
Chu Ruoyun is alive?

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,860
Yes, of course.

74
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,520
You've known she's your daughter all along?

75
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
Yes, come on.

76
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
Try this.

77
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,159
Once when Ruoyun went back to her hometown,

78
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,000
I got curious and followed her,

79
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,690
then I met Ruoyun's mother,

80
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,160
and as we talked, the truth came out.

81
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,520
No wonder you're not surprised.

82
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,450
Try this one too.

83
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,280
By the way, Uncle Li,

84
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
Yiran is planning to sell the Long Group,

85
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
did you know that?

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
What?

87
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,660
She didn't tell me anything about it.

88
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,400
I originally thought Yiran was doing this to get back together with Long Haotian,

89
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,960
but now it seems

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,600
it's not just about pressuring Long Haotian anymore.

91
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,520
It seems

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,800
she wants to leave the Li family.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,460
Uncle Li, what do you mean?

94
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,000
That's right.

95
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,280
There are some things

96
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,560
that it's time for her to know.

97
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,320
Let's go.

98
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,680
Jin A·55555

99
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,280
Jin A55555

100
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,480
Is there any problem with the contract?

101
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,960
I have a question.

102
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,360
Ruoyun,

103
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
you're still alive.

104
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,560
Of course madam is alive,

105
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
you wicked woman.

106
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,320
Li Yiran, you keep claiming you're doing this for Haotian,

107
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,240
so why are you selling

108
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,500
Long Corporation now?

109
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,280
I thought Haotian would come,

110
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,250
but it's you who showed up instead.

111
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,380
Since you're still alive,

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,730
I have even more reason to sell Long Corporation.

113
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,840
Did you plan all this from the beginning?

114
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
Not exactly.

115
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,240
If Haotian weren't so stubborn,

116
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
I wouldn't have gone this far.

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,460
Ms. Li, are you still signing this contract?

118
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,240
Yes.

119
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,880
Don't sign it!

120
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,080
Li Yiran, you're trying to take Long Corporation for yourself.

121
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,740
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

122
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,840
Who do you think you are?

123
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,520
All the shares of Long Corporation are in my hands,

124
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,720
I can do whatever I want.

125
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,880
I suspect that buyer is your partner, isn't he?

126
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,000
So what if he is?

127
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,000
Any sale or transfer at Li Yiran Group

128
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,600
requires the legal representative's signature and seal.

129
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,200
The legal representative of Long Corporation is Haotian,

130
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,530
does he know about this?

131
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,840
If I'm not mistaken,

132
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,560
what you're about to sign is just a share transfer agreement.

133
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,160
Do the directors of Hongfan Capital know about this?

134
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,360
The fact that I can use Hongfan Capital's money to buy all this

135
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,960
already proves everything,

136
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,800
understand?

137
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm warning you,

138
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,600
if you're trying to transfer Long Corporation's shares

139
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
into your own name,

140
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
be careful not to trap yourself.

141
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,200
I am the heir to Hongfan Capital,

142
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,840
I don't need your warnings.

143
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,200
You will never become the heir to Hongfan Capital.

144
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,640
Dad.

145
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,440
Why are you here?

146
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,400
If I hadn't come now,

147
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
would Hongfan Capital

148
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,340
have been hollowed out by you too?

149
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,040
Dad, I never thought of doing that.

150
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,540
Then let me ask you,

151
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,640
what does equity transfer mean?

152
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,290
Let me tell you something else,

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,760
Chu Ruoyun is my biological daughter.

154
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,440
Dad, what are you saying?

155
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
I'm your daughter.

156
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,760
Yiran?

157
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,500
You've disappointed me greatly.

158
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,880
Years ago at the orphanage,

159
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,440
I saw you were exceptionally bright

160
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,560
and hardworking,

161
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,490
so I adopted you as my daughter.

162
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,840
I never imagined you'd do so many wrong things behind my back.

163
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
Dad, are you mistaken?

164
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
She's not your daughter.

165
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,400
Nono died 8 years ago.

166
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,200
Shut up!

167
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,880
What do you know?

168
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,480
She is...

169
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,840
Never mind,

170
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,420
you don't deserve to know any of this.

171
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,560
Sir,

172
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,800
are you mistaken?

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,840
My surname is Chu, I'm Chu Ruoyun,

174
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,600
I'm not your daughter.

175
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Ruoyun, there's no mistake.

176
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,240
It's a long story,

177
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,040
I'll explain everything to you gradually.

178
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,840
Dad.

179
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,200
Yiran.

180
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,360
Did you really think I didn't know what you've been doing?

181
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,680
No, Dad.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,160
I never expected things to turn out this way,

183
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,360
I didn't know she was your daughter.

184
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,560
From now on,

185
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,240
all your actions

186
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,820
have nothing to do with Hongfan Capital.

187
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,160
Dad.

188
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,600
