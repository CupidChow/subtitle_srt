1
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,560
Oh, Miss Lin.

2
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry,

3
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,680
the CEO is resting

4
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,720
and not taking any visitors.

5
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,520
Oh,

6
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,880
could you please tell him

7
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,440
it's about Chu Ruoyun?

8
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,560
Please wait a moment.

9
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,440
Just tell me what it is.

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,320
Chu Ruyun doesn't love you at all,

11
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
I'm the one who truly loves you.

12
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,840
Let's get back together,

13
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,960
shall we?

14
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,810
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

15
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,180
Let's not discuss this matter again.

16
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,680
Haotian.

17
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,200
I know

18
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,480
I made mistakes

19
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,960
in the past.

20
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
But

21
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,820
I only did that because I love you,

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,530
that's why I acted that way.

23
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,250
Please give me another chance.

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,760
Let's

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,400
start over.

26
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,440
What are you doing?

27
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,360
What are we doing?

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,120
Can't you see?

29
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,560
Mr. Zhang.

30
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,820
This way, Miss Lin.

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,040
Haotian.

32
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,440
Miss Lin,

33
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,780
please come in.

34
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,960
Why did she come to our house?

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,720
Why?

36
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,890
It's all because of you.

37
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,840
Because of me?

38
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,000
What does this have to do with me?

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,360
I didn't ask her to come.

40
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,200
Did you see Zhong Zimo today?

41
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
Don't you know who he is?

42
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,090
Why did you meet him?

43
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,440
I didn't meet him on purpose.

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,920
I was reading there,

45
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,360
and he came over to say hello.

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,620
We just chatted briefly and then he left.

47
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,200
Did Lin Xiaoxin see us?

48
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,160
She's here to drive a wedge between us.

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,920
Haotian,

50
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,320
there's nothing between Zhong Zimo and me.

51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,320
I know,

52
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,640
but you're my wife now,

53
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,240
and many people are watching your every move.

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,900
Be more careful in the future,

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,080
okay?

56
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,560
I understand.

57
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,840
Alright,

58
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,280
go upstairs and rest now.

59
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,810
I'll stay here a bit longer.

60
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,520
Zi Mo.

61
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
You've been doing well these years,

62
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,250
I've been keeping an eye on you.

63
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,000
Uncle Li,

64
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,180
you've always been my role model.

65
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,560
Are you tired?

66
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,360
Have some fruit.

67
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,480
Thanks,

68
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,810
just leave it there.

69
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,920
I won't disturb you then.

70
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,920
Your birthday is coming up in a few days,

71
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,720
I've made all the arrangements.

72
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,760
You don't think I forgot, do you?

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,120
What was that little trick

74
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,159
you just pulled?

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,000
What trick?

76
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,000
Nothing.

77
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,680
Haotian.

78
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,080
Don't you

79
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,700
recognize me anymore?

80
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,780
I never thought

81
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,560
I'd run into you here again.

82
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,620
After all these years,

83
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,370
you're still jogging here.

84
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,920
Just a habit.

85
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,090
Long time no see.

86
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,010
Long time no see.

87
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,520
How have you been?

88
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,159
Pretty good.

89
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,840
I got married.

90
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,560
So you two must

91
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,360
be very much in love?

92
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,160
Yes.

93
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,320
I'm very happy now.

94
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,640
If there's nothing else,

95
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
I'll be going now.

96
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,720
Yiran.

97
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,160
You asked me to go running today. Why are you dressed like this?

98
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,090
You didn't even change your shoes.

99
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,240
What's wrong?

100
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,570
You don't seem very energetic.

101
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,980
I probably didn't sleep well.

102
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,320
It's starting

103
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,160
to rain.

104
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Go home and rest.

105
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,380
I'll keep running for a while.

106
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,920
Haotian.

107
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,720
Your shoelace is untied.

108
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,039
Thank you, Yiran.

109
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,080
By the way,

110
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,520
it's your birthday in a few days.

111
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,720
I've prepared a gift for you.

112
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,880
Don't get all

113
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,580
emotional and cry when you see it.

114
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,090
You're crying already.

115
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,960
Haotian.

116
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,920
I'm leaving this place.

117
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,520
Leaving?

118
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,160
Where to?

119
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,440
You always have stomach pain.

120
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
I've put your stomach medicine in the drawer.

121
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,210
Remember to take it on time.

122
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,840
I'll be away for a long time.

123
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,160
I came today to say goodbye.

124
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
Haotian,

125
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
take good care of yourself.

126
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,960
Yiran!

127
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,120
Wait!

128
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,320
Yiran!

129
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,880
Where are you going?

130
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,720
Yiran, tell me where you're going!

131
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,720
Yiran!

132
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,840
