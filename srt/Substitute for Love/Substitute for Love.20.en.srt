14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,940
At this moment, I finally understand

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,039
why everyone says

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,460
finding a job is so difficult.

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,560
Life is actually

18
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,640
so bitter.

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
I used to be taken care of

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,880
and life was so easy.

21
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,820
Ruoyun is waiting for you at home.

22
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,360
Come on,

23
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,000
you can do it.

24
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,240
Here's my resume.

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Your education background is good,

26
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,160
but you don't have any work experience.

27
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,240
For the team leader position,

28
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,300
I'm afraid you're not qualified.

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,040
Well,

30
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,640
I'm a fast learner.

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,720
Could you

32
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,360
give me a chance to prove myself?

33
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,160
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,720
We can't spend time and resources training a newcomer.

35
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay.

36
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,440
Thank you.

37
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,320
Mr. Long,

38
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,400
given your current situation,

39
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,180
you can't expect to start at a high position.

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,180
We have a staff position available here,

41
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,720
if that works for you,

42
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,560
we can discuss it.

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,120
Thank you.

44
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,280
With this job,

45
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,600
even if it's not at Long Corporation,

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll work hard gradually

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,720
and definitely give Ruoyun a good life.

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,480
Hey,

49
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,940
Xiao Ai.

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,079
Chairman.

51
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,529
What are you saying?

52
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,180
Your wife has fallen into the sea!

53
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,880
What?

54
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,320
Chu Ruoyun is dead.

55
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
It seems so.

56
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,700
We searched all night but couldn't find her.

57
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,820
How could this happen?

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
You didn't push her, did you?

59
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,280
Even you think that of me.

60
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,160
Zimo.

61
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,740
Where's Long Haotian?

62
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,520
I don't know.

63
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,640
He's not answering his phone

64
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,520
and can't be found anywhere.

65
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,640
Uncle

66
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,880
why is it you?

67
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,480
Don't move!

68
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,140
Don't move!

69
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,720
One problem isn't solved

70
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,120
and another one appears.

71
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,520
Nuo Nuo.

72
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,760
Should I

73
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,930
not have let Uncle Li come back?

74
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,970
Uncle Li,

75
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,650
why are you here?

76
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
I couldn't sleep,

77
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,760
so I came to chat with you.

78
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,580
Come in,

79
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,900
have a seat.

80
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:20,960
Uncle Li,

81
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,880
would you like something to drink?

82
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,440
No need,

83
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,050
let's just talk.

84
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,450
Alright.

85
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,720
Zi Mo.

86
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,840
I heard

87
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,040
Yi Ran is Long Haotian's first love?

88
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,960
Is that so?

89
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,159
Yes.

90
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,440
Yes.

91
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,159
It seems

92
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,240
Yi Ran's acquisition of Long Group shares

93
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,770
has a purpose behind it.

94
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,120
Yi Ran wants

95
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,520
to get back together with Long Haotian,

96
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,720
but he doesn't agree,

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
so she's using

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,730
the Long Group to pressure him.

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,480
It seems the rumors

100
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,920
are all true,

101
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,180
but Miss Chu is the one suffering.

102
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,210
Uncle Li,

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,400
there's something else you might not know.

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,720
What is it?

105
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,720
Chu Ruoyun

106
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,760
fell into the sea and died.

107
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,840
Is Yi Ran involved?

108
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,120
As far as I know,

109
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,400
they were chatting by the sea,

110
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,210
Miss Chu accidentally fell in,

111
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,929
so Yi Ran isn't directly responsible.

112
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,720
It seems Yi Ran's return

113
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
has a specific purpose behind it.

114
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,250
Alright,

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,610
I'm going to bed now.

116
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,200
Okay,

117
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,730
Uncle Li.

118
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,240
Then I

119
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
don't need to turn on the lights,

120
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,050
I'm leaving.

121
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,800
At this point, Chu Ruoyun has nowhere to go and can only stay temporarily at Li Xiaohan's home.

122
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,840
Ruoyun.

123
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,520
Your body is still weak,

124
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,780
you shouldn't stand for too long.

125
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,240
Uncle,

126
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,400
I'm feeling much better now,

127
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,980
and it's boring just lying in bed,

128
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,970
so I thought I'd get some fresh air.

129
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,680
Uncle,

130
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,850
I've been thinking,

131
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,780
maybe my husband Haotian and I

132
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,800
shouldn't be together?

133
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,360
Why would you think that?

134
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,040
To him,

135
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,920
I'm just a burden.

136
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,720
Solving problems

137
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,320
takes time,

138
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,380
don't rush,

139
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,770
take it slow.

140
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,980
Go inside and rest.

141
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,300
