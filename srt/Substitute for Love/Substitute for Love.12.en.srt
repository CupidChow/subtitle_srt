We're here.

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,479
Oh my!

16
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,759
Look at Xiao Ai,

17
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,039
how much did she drink?

18
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,240
Zhang,

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,000
quickly make some sobering soup for Xiao Ai.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,560
They're all despicable people.

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,800
20 billion...

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm not drunk.

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,680
20 billion.

24
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,960
Take it easy,

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,890
go get some rest.

26
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,020
Poor Xiao Ai, she's been through so much.

27
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,440
These people.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,460
It's one thing not to help,

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,060
but they're kicking her when she's down.

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,400
Don't worry,

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,820
I'll definitely find a solution.

32
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,640
Hmm.

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,079
By the way,

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,240
how did you know to look for me there?

35
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,360
Xiao Ai told me

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,440
you went drinking for business alone.

37
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,880
I was worried you might drink too much,

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,480
so I wanted to look after you.

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,160
But when I got there,

40
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,090
I heard those things they said.

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,560
I was so angry,

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,360
I just went in.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,079
I'm sorry

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
for making you worry.

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,240
Hello, Grandmother.

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,560
Who are you?

47
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,760
You don't remember me?

48
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
I've met many people in my life,

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,880
I can't remember everyone.

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,200
That's true.

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Back then I was just an unknown little girl,

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
not worth remembering.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,960
So,

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,800
we've met before?

55
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,560
Do you remember,

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,930
eight years ago,

57
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,760
a young girl named Li Yiran?

58
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,200
Are you

59
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,080
Li Yiran?

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,440
That's right.

61
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,080
It's me.

62
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,959
About Hongfan Capital

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
Group's matter.

64
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,960
You should talk to Haotian instead.

65
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,880
I already did,

66
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,560
but he didn't agree to my terms.

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,200
What terms?

68
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,960
To make Chu Ruoyun

69
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,000
leave Haotian.

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,760
On what grounds?

71
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,240
Because I can offer

72
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
30 billion to invest in the Long Group.

73
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,640
I'm old now,

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,080
I can't manage so many affairs anymore.

75
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,159
For these matters,

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,140
you should still talk to Haotian.

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,960
Because of Chu Ruoyun,

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,280
Haotian can no longer make rational decisions.

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
If he continues being so stubborn,

80
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
the entire Long

81
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,480
Group will face bankruptcy.

82
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,160
Can you bear to see such an outcome?

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Ruoyun

84
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,880
is now my grandson's wife.

85
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,400
Moreover,

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,280
she's carrying Haotian's child.

87
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm afraid

88
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,960
this...

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
Then I won't

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,800
trouble you anymore.

91
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,600
You...

92
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,090
How can you expect me

93
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,760
to say such things?

94
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Hello, Grandma.

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,200
Ruoyun,

96
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,160
come to my room later.

97
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,760
Yes, Grandma,

98
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,020
I'll be there soon.

99
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,880
I never thought

100
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,360
at my age,

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,260
I'd still have to do something like this.

102
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,360
Grandma, don't blame yourself,

103
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,280
I'll help Haotian properly.

104
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,560
Mr. Zhong,

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,480
I heard that

106
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,960
this Long Group...

107
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,160
The Long Corporation is going to fall into your hands.

108
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,159
It's just a breach of contract penalty,

109
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,159
not enough to bring down Long Corporation.

110
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,960
This is satisfying enough.

111
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,680
Here.

112
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,640
Let's use tea instead of wine,

113
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,440
to celebrate.

114
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,560
Mr. Zhong.

115
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,200
So what's next,

116
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,010
what are your plans?

117
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,680
Yes, Mr. Zhong,

118
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,360
if you have any good opportunities,

119
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
take us along.

120
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,080
No rush,

121
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,760
I do have plans,

122
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,560
but the time isn't right yet.

123
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,560
Mr. Zhong,

124
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,820
why don't we strike while Long Corporation is vulnerable,

125
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,480
and find a way to squeeze more money out of them?

126
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,560
What,

127
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
are you short on cash?

128
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,400
No.

129
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,690
When the time comes,

130
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,560
I'll tell you the plan.

131
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,560
Alright,

132
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,400
we'll wait for your update.

133
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,120
Grandma.

134
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,200
Did you call me here for something?

135
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,080
Yes,

136
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,000
Grandma called you back

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
to ask about the company affairs.

138
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,600
Grandma,

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,760
you should be asking me about this,

140
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,560
Ruoyun isn't very familiar with company matters.

141
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,720
Well then, Grandma,

142
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,180
I'll be straightforward.

143
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,800
Haotian,

144
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,720
I can handle

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,730
the company affairs just fine,

146
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,210
so we won't need to trouble Miss Li.

147
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,960
Haotian.

148
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,880
Regarding the company matters,

149
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,800
if Miss Li is willing to help,

150
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,559
that would be fine.

151
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,360
Ruoyun.

152
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,799
You don't understand what happened,

153
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,600
stay out of it for now.

154
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,360
Haotian,

155
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,960
this concerns the future of our company,

156
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,120
don't let your emotions cloud your judgment.

157
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
Haotian.

158
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
Grandmother is right,

159
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,410
let's overcome the current difficulties first.

160
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Yes, Haotian,

161
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,730
even Ruoyun has agreed.

162
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
You just won't let this go, will you?

163
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,960
Haotian.

164
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,960
Miss Li is right,

165
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,960
if we don't do this,

166
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,180
the company's future is in jeopardy.

167
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,240
Grandmother.

168
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,970
I will take responsibility

169
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,360
for all my actions.

170
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
If you think I'm not capable enough,

171
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,240
I can step down right now.

172
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,900
Grandmother wants you to make the right choice.

173
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,330
I'm sorry, Grandma.

174
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,450
This is the right choice for me.

175
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
Grandma, we're leaving now.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,880
This matter

177
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,080
concerns the future of the Long family,

178
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,280
no one can interfere.

179
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,200
I'll find a way to handle it.

180
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,280
Drink this,

181
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,080
it helps stop coughing.

182
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,960
Really?

183
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,780
My mom used to make it for me when I was little.

184
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,320
Delicious.

185
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,290
Have some more then.

186
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,280
All done.

187
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,680
Thank you for your hard work.

188
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,010
You're still up so late.

189
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,570
You're still awake too.

190
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,740
You're still worried about the company issues.

191
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,960
Not entirely.

192
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,560
I have some vague ideas in my mind,

193
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,300
but I can't quite figure them out.

194
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,640
If you can't figure it out, let it go for now.

195
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,560
Maybe

196
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,500
someone will help you find the answers someday.

197
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,560
You're right.

198
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,580
I'll stop thinking about it then.

199
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,220
Let's go get some rest.

200
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,960
There's something else.

201
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,160
Haotian.

202
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
Are you refusing Miss Li's help

203
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,220
because you're afraid I'll get jealous?

204
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,240
If it's purely a business partnership,

205
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,320
I don't mind.

206
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,960
You can work with her

207
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
to help you get through this crisis.

208
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,480
You know,

209
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,500
what's been going through your mind all day?

210
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,850
The recent issues facing our company.

211
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Could she be the one behind all this?

212
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,180
Should we call the police?

213
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,690
It's just speculation,

214
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,640
we have no evidence,

215
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,900
it doesn't make sense.

216
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,560
So what do we do now?

217
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,320
Didn't you just say it yourself?

218
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,970
When the time comes,

219
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,610
someone will naturally provide us with answers.

220
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,560
Right now,

221
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,560
we need to go back and rest.
