00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,240
Hello

16
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,200
Uncle Li.

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,360
Dad.

18
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,600
Zimo called and said

19
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,280
they found a girl in China who looks very similar to our Nuonuo.

20
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,600
Very similar.

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,040
Yes, Dad.

22
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,970
I want to go back for a visit.

23
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,880
Sure.

24
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,800
Go back and find her quickly.

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,720
Call me if you need anything.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,280
I'll come right away.

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,600
Okay, Dad.

28
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,360
Good.

29
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,720
When are you leaving?

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,520
I've already bought the ticket.

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,850
I'm leaving right away.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,640
Does Yiran know about this?

33
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,240
I haven't told her.

34
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,000
That's good.

35
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
Go ahead.

36
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,020
I'll be going then.

37
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,000
Dad.

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,000
Grandpa.

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,680
Dad, I heard you're going back to China?

40
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,810
How did you find out?

41
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,940
I just passed by your room and Uncle Qian told me.

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,480
What, you want to go back too?

43
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,200
I want to go back too.

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,600
Yiran.

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,560
Dad's not going back for fun this time. I'm going there to work,

46
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,420
and to see some friends I haven't seen in many years.

47
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,400
I also have many friends I haven't seen in years,

48
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,480
please take me with you.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,960
Yiran,

50
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,920
don't get involved with him,

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,440
stay home with Grandpa.

52
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,320
Grandpa,

53
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,480
I promise you,

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,740
I'll come back early to be with you, okay?

55
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,720
No.

56
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a deal.

57
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,800
Grandpa.

58
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,080
Grandpa.

59
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,000
Grandpa.

60
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,200
Let Yiran go with you.

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Let's go.

62
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,480
Is this seat taken?

63
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,520
What scheme are you plotting now?

64
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,240
So this is how Miss Chu

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,320
sees me.

66
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,480
Actually, I just wanted to come over

67
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,540
to say hello to you.

68
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,560
That's not too much to ask, is it?

69
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,560
Fine.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,880
You've said your hello,

71
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
now you can leave.

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,960
Miss Chu really has quite a personality,

73
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,890
no wonder Mr. Long is so fond of you.

74
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,120
What exactly do you want?

75
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,810
Actually, I used to come here often

76
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,840
to meet an old friend.

77
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,500
I think you look a lot like her.

78
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,000
An old friend?

79
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
Who was it?

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,330
She's no longer with us.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No longer with us?

82
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,960
She went to

83
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,400
a faraway place.

84
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,500
You don't need to be so sad.

85
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,170
As long as you remember her,

86
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,120
she'll always exist.

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,080
Yes,

88
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,320
as long as I remember her.

89
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
So, Miss Chu,

90
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,520
do you have anyone

91
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
you keep close to your heart?

92
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,520
I...

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,200
No.

94
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,010
Then Miss Chu is truly a fortunate person.

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,960
Unlike me,

96
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,020
who can only remember in my heart.

97
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,120
Not exactly.

98
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,530
I've grown up without a father.

99
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,820
I want to remember him,

100
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,840
Life: Zhou meets a better version of himself.

101
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,500
but I don't even know his face.

102
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,280
I shouldn't have brought up this topic.

103
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,960
It's nothing.

105
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,520
So, Miss Chu,

106
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
I wonder if we could become friends?

107
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,500
I'm afraid not.

108
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
Haotian wouldn't be happy about it.

109
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,130
That's true.

110
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,920
I shouldn't come between you two.

111
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,040
Well then, excuse me.

112
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
I'll be going now.

113
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,920
Mr. Zhong,

114
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,090
Mr. Li's flight arrives tomorrow.

115
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,880

116
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,080
