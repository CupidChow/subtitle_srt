13
00:01:59,039 --> 00:01:59,840
Haotian,

14
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
what's wrong?

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,620
Did something happen at the company?

16
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,160
No,

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,090
I just don't have much appetite today.

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,360
Why do I feel like

19
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,780
you're not very happy?

20
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
How could that be?

21
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
When I'm with you,

22
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,520
no matter what happens,

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,920
I always face it with a smile.

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Me too.

25
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,880
When you're happy, I'm happy.

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,760
Nothing is more important than that.

27
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,890
By the way, Haotian,

28
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,360
we've been busy with company matters lately,

29
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,960
and haven't gone out for quite some time.

30
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,480
After this busy period is over,

31
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,160
shall we go out and relax a bit?

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,560
Sounds good.

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,560
Wherever you want to go then,

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,820
that's where we'll go.

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,160
Mm-hmm.

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,760
Zimo, you're here.

38
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,840
It's been so long since you've been back.

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,440
Has this place changed much?

40
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,560
Quite a bit.

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,850
Haven't you looked around?

42
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,040
No.

43
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,890
I don't want to go anywhere.

44
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,960
What's wrong?

45
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,890
You look so down.

46
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
What happened?

47
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,360
Tell me.

48
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,840
I want to cheer up too.

49
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,090
I just got back and you're already teasing me.

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm just

51
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,200
trying to make you feel better.

52
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,320
Look at you,

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
you don't even look pretty anymore.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,760
Well,

55
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,320
the person I like got married.

56
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,000
Who could be so blind?

57
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
My dear sister is so elegant

58
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,720
and graceful.

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,200
Another business elite,

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,920
right?

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,800
Back in the day, you had suitors lining up.

62
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Let me tell you,

63
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,220
if you like him, that's his good fortune.

64
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:46,760
I see.

65
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,640
Tell me,

66
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,200
who is he?

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,060
What does he do?

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,600
You might know him.

69
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
I know him?

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
Who is it?

71
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,360
Long Haotian.

72
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,120
Long Haotian...

73
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Long Haotian from Long Corporation?

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
That's right.

75
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,600
What's wrong, Zimo?

76
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,640
How did you two

77
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,570
meet each other?

78
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,920
We met when

79
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,440
he came to the orphanage

80
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,500
to do charity work,

81
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
that's how we got to know each other.

82
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
Then why did you

83
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
break up with him

84
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,560
and how

85
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,020
did you become Uncle Li's adopted daughter?

86
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,600
I don't want to talk about that anymore.

87
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,560
Okay.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,360
Let's drop it then.

89
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
What if I could help you get him back?

90
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,320
He's already married,

91
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,050
how could you possibly help me?

92
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,560
What if Long Haotian

93
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,520
doesn't actually love Chu Ruoyun,

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,159
but the child in her womb?

95
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,160
Yiran,

96
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,890
you still have a chance.

97
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,900
If you want this relationship

98
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,000
to continue,

99
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,440
we can work together.

100
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,290
How would we work together?

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,730
We each get what we want.

102
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,320
You get Long Haotian.

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,200
And Chu Ruoyun...

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,720
Chu Ruoyun.

105
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,760
Actually,

106
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,960
I don't know why,

107
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,560
but every time I see her,

108
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,130
I really want to get to know her.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,640
Maybe

110
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,159
she reminds you too much of Nono.

111
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,520
I understand,

112
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,360
emotional attachment.

113
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,220
You're still as smart as ever.

114
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,780
So for this matter,

115
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,560
I need your help too.

116
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,040
Do you have any plans?

117
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,160
Well,

118
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,100
let's go to his company tomorrow.

119
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,760
Mr. Zhong, please wait a moment,

120
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,220
I'll inform the chairman.

121
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
Come in.

122
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,960
Chairman,

123
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,290
Mr. Zhong is already waiting for you in the conference room.

124
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,360
Okay,

125
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,160
I got it.

126
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,840
Mr. Zhong

127
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,240
this Mr. Long is really too much,

128
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,760
making us wait for so long.

129
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,560
Why don't we leave now

130
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,280
and reconsider the cooperation later.

131
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,360
No rush.

132
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,480
It's business.

133
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Take it slow.

134
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,880
If we leave first,

135
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,440
it would make us look bad.

136
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,040
Mr. Zhong.

137
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,160
I'm sorry,

138
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,120
I've been so busy I lost track of time.

139
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,920
It's fine,

140
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,690
our business discussion won't take long anyway.

141
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,640
Great,

142
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
let's make the most of our time then.

143
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,520
Here's the project proposal

144
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
and the contract.

145
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,520
10 billion.

146
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,640
Mr. Zhong,

147
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,560
that's quite ambitious.

148
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,240
However,

149
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,040
I notice the products in your proposal

150
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,560
could be manufactured by companies other than Long Group,

151
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
so why choose us?

152
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,780
Other companies can do it,

153
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,240
but when it comes to capability

154
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,160
and quality,

155
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,760
it has to be your

156
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,160
Long Group.

157
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,080
Of course,

158
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,920
if you have any concerns, Mr. Long,

159
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,250
we can always work together another time.

160
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,360
Well,

161
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,560
Mr. Zhong,

162
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,560
if you're in such a hurry to give me money,

163
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
how could I possibly refuse?

164
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,280
But since this is our first collaboration,

165
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,480
we need to follow proper procedures,

166
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
can't skip those.

167
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,840
We'll do as you say, Mr. Long.

168
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,840
Good.

169
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,160
It seems there's no problem.

170
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,240
Since Mr. Zhong is showing such sincerity,

171
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,970
let's work together this time.

172
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,880
Alright.

173
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,560
Mr. Zhong,

174
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,040
here's to

175
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,690
a successful partnership.

176
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,520
I hope we can collaborate frequently in the future.

177
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,580
We certainly will.

178
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,480
Well then,

179
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,540
I'll take my leave.

180
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,560
Take care.

181
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,720
You're Chu Ruoyun, aren't you?

182
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,120
And you are?

183
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,640
I'm Li Yiran.

184
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,500
Let's find a place to talk.

185
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,520
Well...

186
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,160
Is that a problem?

187
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,320
Do we know each other?

188
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,240
We don't.

189
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,480
But we both know

190
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,320
Long Haotian.

191
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,020
Cast

192
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,320
