You're awake.

15
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,160
I failed to protect you.

17
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,040
Haotian.

19
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,490
It's not your fault,

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,660
you don't have to be like this.

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,320
It's all my own fault.

22
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,820
You're just too naive and kind-hearted,

23
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
that's why you've suffered so much.

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,560
This little suffering is nothing,

25
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,760
don't worry about me.

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,360
Madam.

27
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,640
Are you alright?

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,960
During these days you were gone,

29
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,220
I missed you terribly.

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
I missed you too,

31
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
and Haotian.

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,920
Madam,

33
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,720
now that you're back,

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,380
please don't separate from the Chairman again.

35
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,920
From now on,

36
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,640
we'll never be apart again.

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,560
You can never leave me again.

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,490
By the way, Haotian,

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,400
did the doctor say

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
how our baby is doing?

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,800
Chu Ruoyun.

42
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Take it easy.

43
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,520
Our child.

44
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,840
Our child.

45
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,440
Is gone.

46
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,520
Haotian.

47
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,530
You're lying to me, aren't you?

48
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Our baby.

49
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,400
Ruoyun.

50
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,240
Ruoyun.

51
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,159
It's okay.

52
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,760
It's alright.

53
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,220
We're still young.

54
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,420
As long as you're safe.

55
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,360
I'm sorry,

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,840
it's all my fault.

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,800
Ruoyun.

59
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,090
It's not your fault,

60
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,560
it's my fault,

61
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,160
I failed to protect both of you.

62
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I'll take care of

63
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,770
everything from now on.

64
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,090
Grandma, you look well.

65
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,180
I haven't been doing well lately,

66
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,450
I often can't sleep.

67
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,960
I have a home remedy

68
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,690
I'll bring it for you next time.

69
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,220
No need to be so formal,

70
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
just tell me what's on your mind.

71
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,280
I heard that

72
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Chu Ruoyun

73
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,020
had a miscarriage,

74
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,160
so I came to discuss with you

75
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,200
what we should do next.

76
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,960
Don't talk nonsense here.

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,180
You don't know yet?

78
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,320
Haotian,

79
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
take a rest,

80
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,180
you didn't sleep well last night.

81
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,680
I'm not tired.

82
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,280
Here,

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,720
eat this.

84
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,480
We can check out of the hospital soon

85
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,140
and go home.

86
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,480
Haotian

87
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,000
what about Grandma and Li Yiran?

88
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,760
I

89
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,159
don't need to worry about them.

90
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,360
Worst case scenario,

91
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
I'll leave the Long family with you.

92
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,960
But

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,560
Grandma...

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,320
Enough.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,800
No buts.

96
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,600
You don't need to worry about these things anymore.

97
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,800
All you need to do now

98
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,810
is focus on getting better.

99
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,740
I'm not talking nonsense.

100
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,480
Madam,

101
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,760
don't worry.

102
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,120
With the Chairman here,

103
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,520
everything will be fine.

104
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,560
Mr. Long,

105
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,000
here are your discharge papers.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,730
You can leave the hospital now.

107
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,760
Thank you.

108
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,690
Let's go,

109
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,850
back to our home.

110
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,960
Let's go.

111
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,000
Going home now.

112
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:33,560
Hello?

113
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Okay, I got it.

114
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,690
Grandma,

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,800
Chu Ruoyun has been discharged from the hospital.

116
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,409
Let's go.

117
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,450
Let's go.

118
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,890
Take it slow.

119
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,760
Grandmother.

120
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,690
Haotian.

121
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,380
Why did you bring her back?

122
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,360
Ruoyun is my wife,

123
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,559
bringing her home

124
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,620
isn't that normal?

125
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,360
Ruoyun.

126
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,410
What about my family's bloodline?

127
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,720
Grandmother.

128
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,690
The baby is gone.

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,960
Chu Ruoyun.

130
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,420
Now that the child is gone,

131
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,960
your marriage to Haotian

132
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,520
ends here.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,560
Fine.

134
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,850
I'll leave the Long family with Ruoyun right now.

135
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,680
Haotian.

136
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,490
Are you trying to upset me to death?

137
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,800
You're a Long,

138
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,020
everything in this family

139
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
belongs to you,

140
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,060
you need to think about the family's interests.

141
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,560
Think about the family?

142
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,770
Grandmother, have you ever truly thought about what I want?

143
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,200
All you ever talk about is the family fortune,

144
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,640
the family's glory,

145
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
you've never asked what I want.

146
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,440
Everything I do

147
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,520
is for your sake, isn't it?

148
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,340
Again, for my sake.

149
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,440
Grandmother.

150
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,020
Don't bother anymore.

151
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,640
Haotian.

152
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,040
If you step one foot outside this door,

153
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,900
you're no longer part of this family.
