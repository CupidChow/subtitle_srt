1
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,360
You're here.

2
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Did I wake you?

3
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
No.

4
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,780
What did you bring?

5
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,720
It smells so good.

6
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,200
I brought you some food.

7
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,040
Have some.

8
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,040
By the way,

9
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,960
Grandma was just here.

10
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,970
Didn't you run into her?

11
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,120
No,

12
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,770
we must have missed each other.

13
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,300
What did Grandma want?

14
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,280
Did she scold you?

15
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,280
Yes,

16
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,040
she blamed me for not telling her about the company.

17
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,880
I just didn't want to worry her.

18
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,240
Did you make this?

19
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,410
Your cooking has improved so much.

20
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,320
If you like it, eat more.

21
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,880
Dad.

22
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,760
Make a wish.

23
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,840
Okay.

24
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,400
Happy birthday to you.

25
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:13,560
Happy birthday to you.

26
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,720
Happy birthday to you.

27
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,280
Dad.

28
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,880
What did you wish for?

29
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,960
I wished that

30
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,600
our family would

31
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,920
always be happy

32
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,650
and healthy together forever.

33
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,540
Is there a gift too?

34
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,360
A watch.

35
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,170
Once you put it on, you can't take it off again.

36
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,520
I won't.

37
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
I'll wear it for the rest of my life.

38
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,120
Good.

39
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,600
Mom.

40
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,760
I want a watch too.

41
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,880
Okay.

42
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,810
I'll buy you one for your birthday.

43
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,080
Have some cake.

44
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,880
Okay.

45
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,040
Hello.

46
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,160
Girl,

47
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,960
don't you remember me?

48
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,760
Who are you?

49
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:36,200
Li Xiaohan increasingly feels that Chu Ruoyun is like his daughter,

50
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,800
so he decides to conduct a secret investigation.

51
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,360
Chairman,

52
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,460
CEO Zhong and his team from Hengxin Group have arrived at the company.

53
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,500
I've already given you three days

54
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,300
to complete this project,

55
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,760
but I'm not very satisfied

56
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,840
with these results.

57
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,620
I'll give you another three days to transfer the penalty payment.

58
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,360
Well,

59
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,040
don't disappoint me again.

60
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,200
Otherwise,

61
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,780
things won't end well.

62
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,720
When we signed the contract,

63
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,380
I had a bad feeling about this.

64
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,720
I never expected that

65
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
compared to Director Zhong,

66
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,380
I was ultimately one move behind.

67
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,580
I don't understand what Director Long is talking about at all.

68
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,580
However, integrity is the foundation of business.

69
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
That's also why

70
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,970
I wanted to cooperate with Long Group.

71
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,440
Don't ruin your own reputation.

72
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,400
Rest assured.

73
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Long Group has come this far

74
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,600
through honest and upright means.

75
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,520
Of course,

76
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,560
if I find out who's pulling strings behind the scenes,

77
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,159
I won't let them off the hook.

78
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,440
Your company's affairs

79
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
are none of my business

80
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,240
and I have no right to interfere.

81
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,840
Anyway,

82
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,760
I hope Director Long will make the payment as agreed.

83
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,690
Let's not disturb Director Long's work any further.

84
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,460
I hope you find the mastermind behind this soon.

85
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,320
What is it now?

86
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,200
Mr.

87
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Director,

88
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,840
someone named Li Yiran from Red Sail Capital wants to see you.

89
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,520
Let her in.

90
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,040
Haotian.

91
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,200
You look tired.

92
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,240
What brings you

93
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,320
here today?

94
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,560
I heard

95
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
you're facing some difficulties,

96
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,400
so I came to see if I could help.

97
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,720
Help me?

98
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,800
Do you have any idea how serious this is?

99
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,240
Isn't it just

100
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,000
about the contract with Hengxin Group

101
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,200
and the penalty fees?

102
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,730
That amount of money

103
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,260
is something I can afford.

104
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,120
That amount?

105
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,180
Do you even know how much it is?

106
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,200
I do.

107
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,040
Haotian.

108
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,280
Didn't I tell you before?

109
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,160
Eight years ago, I left you

110
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,380
to improve myself so I could help you.

111
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
And now,

112
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,530
I can really come back and help you.

113
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,560
Help me?

114
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
How could you possibly help?

115
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,320
To be honest,

116
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
I am now

117
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,840
the heir to Red Sail Capital.

118
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Red Sail Capital?

119
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,720
I know you might not believe me

120
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,960
but what I'm saying

121
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,320
is the truth.

122
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,720
Children.

123
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,570
Today I'm here representing the company to visit you all

124
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,700
please don't be shy

125
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,240
we're all old friends now.

126
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,760
May I relax a bit?

127
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
Yes.

128
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,520
If you have anything you want to do in the future

129
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,440
or any wishes you want to fulfill

130
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,320
just tell Director Wang

131
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
and I'll help make them come true.

132
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,440
Okay?

133
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay.

134
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,560
Mr. Li.

135
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,920
Thank you for all these years

136
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,240
of donations to our orphanage

137
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,920
I thank you again on behalf of everyone.

138
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,960
Oh, Director Wang, you're too kind

139
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,080
being able to do something for these children

140
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,520
is my greatest honor.

141
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,920
Mr. Li, you're too modest

142
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,780
this is all what I should be doing.

143
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,480
Very good, children.

144
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,000
Come.

145
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,730
Come, Yiran.

146
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,680
Come, Yiran.

147
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,540
Come over here.

148
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,680
Mr. Li

149
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,810
let me introduce you

150
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,120
this is Li Yiran

151
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,780
she's eighteen this year.

152
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,000
This child

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,680
has been smart and sensible since she was little

154
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,480
and often helps us take care of the other children.

155
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,880
Every time she sees you doing charity work

156
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,920
Yiran says

157
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,920
that when she grows up, she wants to be like you

158
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,600
using her own abilities

159
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
to help others.

160
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
However

161
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
our orphanage

162
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,320
can provide very limited resources for these children.

163
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,280
So I'd like to introduce her to you

164
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,920
so she can learn from you

165
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,280
and gain some experience.

166
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,680
If she becomes successful in the future

167
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,320
I believe

168
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,380
Yiran will definitely pass on your kindness to others.

169
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,520
So

170
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,900
would you please consider it?

171
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,320
Yes.

172
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,680
Young lady.

173
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,020
Would you like to learn business from me?

174
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,520
If one day

175
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,600
Haotian faces problems at work

176
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,620
what can you do to help?

177
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,360
Our Long family needs someone of equal status

178
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,020
someone who can help Haotian.

179
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,360
And you?

180
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,000
You can't do anything.

181
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,720
I'm willing

182
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,840
I want to be like you

183
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,480
able to help more people.

184
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,620
It's very good that you think this way

185
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,320
but you must remember

186
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,480
business is very hard work

187
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,450
aren't you afraid of the hardship?

188
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,060
No matter how difficult, I'm not afraid.

189
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,280
Good.

190
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,280
I can teach you business

191
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,020
but you must remember what you said today

192
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,240
when you have the ability in the future

193
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,120
you must help more people.

194
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,600
I will never forget my original intention.

195
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,120
Never forget your original intention.

196
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,320
Good.

197
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,920
Then get ready

198
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,050
you'll come with me in a couple of days.

199
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,560
Thank you, Mr. Li,

200
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,600
thank you, Director.

201
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,480
Great! Keep up the good work, Yiran.

202
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,600
I'll go attend to my work now.

203
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,280
Ah, sure.

204
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,520
With Mr. Li's help,

205
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,290
I quickly became an elite in the industry.

206
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,600
Later,

207
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,700
he adopted me as his daughter.

208
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,720
All these years, he never married or had children.

209
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,520
He said that after he's gone,

210
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,060
I would inherit Red Sail Capital.

211
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,800
Haotian.

212
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,320
All my efforts these years have been for you.

213
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,600
Seems like you've already gotten what you wanted.

214
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,160
As for the rest,

215
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,340
I told you not to mention it again.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,920
Tell me,

217
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
what are your conditions for helping me?

218
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't want anything,

219
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,320
I only want you.

220
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,840
You mean

221
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,200
I have to break up with Chu Ruoyun

222
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,680
before you'll help me, right?

223
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,480
As long as you agree,

224
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,810
I'll fund you immediately. I don't agree.

225
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,160
Haotian.

226
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,600
You know better than anyone

227
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,680
how much the breach of contract penalty will cost.

228
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,000
Only I can help you.

229
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,680
Is Chu Ruoyun

230
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,080
more important than the survival of the Long Group?

231
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,010
I'll figure something out myself.

232
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,440
Xiao Ai.

233
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,900
Please book a private room for me.
