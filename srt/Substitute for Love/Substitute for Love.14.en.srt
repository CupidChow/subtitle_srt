1
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,080
Grandma.

2
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,580
What did you say to Ruoyun?

3
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
I said some things for your own good.

4
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,680
For my own good?

5
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,720
I told you I can handle the company matters.

6
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,940
Why did you have to tell Ruoyun those things?

7
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
Would you have told her if I didn't?

8
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,160
Or were you planning to wait until the Long family collapsed?

9
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,320
When it comes to the interests of the Long family and the company,

10
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,480
everyone else must step aside.

11
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,140
The company's interests.

12
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,579
The company's interests.

13
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,520
Grandma,

14
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,680
I'm your grandson.

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,940
Ruoyun is carrying your great-grandchild.

16
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,560
Doesn't any of this matter to you?

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,360
It matters,

18
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,280
but we need to get through this crisis first.

19
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,960
If Ruoyun can't stay by my side,

20
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,210
I'm willing to give up everything.

21
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,480
From now on,

22
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,140
I am no longer the chairman of Long Corporation.

23
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
Stop right there!

24
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,000
Haotian!

25
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:31,640
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,480
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,320
I'm leaving.

28
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,180
Please forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

29
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,380
It's not that I don't love you.

30
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,410
It's precisely because I care about you too much.

31
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,079
That's why I have to leave.

32
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,000
Ruoyun.

33
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,610
I'm really useless.

34
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,140
I won't let you suffer anymore in the future.

35
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,320
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,080
Haotian.

37
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,680
Don't come looking for me.

38
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,040
Just focus on what you need to do.

39
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,640
Take good care of yourself.

40
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
Don't worry.

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,770
I will definitely find you and bring you back.

42
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Hey, Brother Bao.

43
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,010
Mr. Zhao.

44
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,720
Is the money ready?

45
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,280
Brother Bao.

46
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,159
Please give me a little more time.

47
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,680
I'll have it ready soon.

48
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,280
More time?

49
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,320
How much time have I already given you?

50
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,250
Do you think I'm running a charity?

51
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,560
Brother Bao, please give me a little more time.

52
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,080
As soon as I get my money back,

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,280
I'll give it all to you,

54
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,080
Brother Bao.

55
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,320
Cut the crap.

56
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
You must pay back

57
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,650
the money today.

58
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,480
Otherwise, I'll be paying you a visit.

59
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,960
Hey, Brother Bao,

60
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,880
please give me a little more time,

61
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,680
Brother Bao.

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
Hello?

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,960
Are you okay?

64
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
Look at me now,

65
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,140
are you satisfied?

66
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,560
We can go back to how things were.

67
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,880
Go back?

68
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,730
Are you sure you're still the same Li Yiran as before?

69
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,200
We

70
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,120
can start over.

71
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,720
You said

72
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,280
we would be together forever.

73
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,560
That was your idea.

74
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,180
No one can replace Chu Ruoyun.

75
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,320
But

76
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,480
she can't help you.

77
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,530
Even if I have someone else in my heart,

78
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,760
you don't mind?

79
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,120
Hello everyone,

80
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,480
welcome to

81
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,360
the signing ceremony between

82
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Long Group and Redsail Capital.

83
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,080
Haotian.

84
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,120
Mr. Zhang.

85
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
Any news about Ruoyun?

86
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,920
There's still no news about your wife, sir.

87
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,600
Mr. Zhang,

88
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,280
whatever it takes,

89
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,340
you must help me find her as soon as possible.

90
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
I understand, Chairman.

91
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,080
By the way,

92
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,560
will you be coming home for dinner tonight?

93
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,620
No, I can't.

94
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,440
The banquet will probably

95
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,370
go on until late.

96
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,780
Please take care of

97
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
things at home for me.

98
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
I understand.

99
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,680
Sir.

100
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,840
Can I help you?

101
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,290
Are you President Long?

102
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,360
I'm here to see Miss Chu.

103
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,560
She told me

104
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
I could visit anytime.

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,730
Oh, it's you.

106
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,560
Ruoyun did mention that.

107
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,200
However,

108
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,400
she's not home today.

109
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,320
You can come back another day.

110
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,250
President Long.

111
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,440
Miss Chu

112
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,890
is a wonderful girl.

113
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,640
You must cherish her.

114
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,450
What do you mean by that?

115
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,280
I saw in the news that

116
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,120
you're forming a marriage alliance with Hongfan Capital.

117
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
This matter is...

118
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,320
Let me thank you on Ruoyun's behalf.

119
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
But rest assured,

120
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,720
nothing will affect our relationship.

121
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,520
Those are just stories fabricated by the media

122
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,320
for the sake of sensationalism.

123
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,210
That's good.

124
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,450
I have something

125
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,010
to attend to. I'll go first.

126
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,130
Go ahead.

127
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:56,920
Go on,

128
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,520
what is it?

129
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,880
You told me before

130
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,900
that Chu Ruoyun offended you,

131
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,890
and I want to know

132
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,250
what exactly she did to offend you.

133
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Does that matter?

134
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,960
Of course it matters.

135
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,880
I need to figure out

136
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,050
if Chu Ruoyun really offended you,

137
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,360
or if her relationship with Long Haotian is what bothers you.

138
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,200
So that's why

139
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,480
you're trying everything to break them up, right?

140
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,100
There's no difference, is there?

141
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,080
Of course there is a difference.

142
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,040
If you simply dislike Chu Ruoyun,

143
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,580
then we can be friends.

144
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,880
But if

145
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,340
it's because of Long Haotian,

146
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,490
then we can only be enemies.
