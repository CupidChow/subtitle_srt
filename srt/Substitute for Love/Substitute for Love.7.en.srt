1
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,900
Don't be too pessimistic.

2
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,160
Things might

3
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,400
get better.

4
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,320
Okay.

5
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,320
I won't see you out then, Ruoyun,

6
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,250
since my legs aren't working well.

7
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,960
That's disgusting.

8
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,680
How could I live without you?

9
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,680
How could you even say that?

10
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,240
It's just acting,

11
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
why take it so seriously?

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,320
Look.

13
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,960
Xiao Ai,

14
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
where's Haotian?

15
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,640
Madam,

16
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,440
the CEO is out with clients on a site visit.

17
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,970
Is there anything you need?

18
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,160
A site visit at this time?

19
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,380
He's not answering his phone either.

20
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,920
It's fine,

21
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,800
go back to work.

22
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,000
Madam,

23
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,440
please let me know if you need anything.

24
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:08,960
Wow,

25
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,800
why is he with that woman?

26
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
How did they end up together?

27
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,960
This story is already trending,

28
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,820
and it's getting more attention.

29
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,440
Maybe

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,570
they're having an argument right now.

31
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,960
I'd love to see Chu Ruoyun

32
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,360
being scolded by Long Haotian until she's completely flustered.

33
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,160
Yeah.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,360
But from now on, Manager Zhong and Manager Li

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
should give us more opportunities.

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,000
This matter

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
you two handled well.

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm driving today,

39
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,640
so I'll toast with tea instead.

40
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,200
Alright.

41
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,200
Haotian.

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,079
You're back.

43
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,890
I haven't checked my phone.

44
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,920
No.

45
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,400
My phone was charging.

46
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,600
Haotian.

47
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,450
It's not what it looks like.

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,120
I

49
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,400
know.

50
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,650
But you shouldn't have met him.

51
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,460
I didn't meet him intentionally.

52
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,360
He called me

53
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,480
saying

54
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,200
Lin Xiaoxin had prepared a lot of negative material about you

55
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,120
to expose you

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,440
and smear your reputation.

57
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,560
He said he has a terminal illness

58
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,920
and couldn't travel easily,

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,580
so that's why I went to see him.

60
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,160
I got all the materials back.

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,120
I was going to

62
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,920
bring them to the office for you right away,

63
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,160
but you weren't there.

64
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,420
What about the photos?

65
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,960
Zhao Zi'ang said he has a terminal illness.

66
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,720
He's dying.

67
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,560
He wanted to see me one last time to end everything.

68
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,560
But this photo,

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,240
I don't know how he took it.

70
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
I understand,

71
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,210
it's not your fault.

72
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,920
You're just too kind-hearted,

73
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,050
that's why they took advantage of you.

74
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,040
This was clearly a trap.

75
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,159
Haotian.

76
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,440
I had my doubts,

77
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,240
but I was more afraid they would expose you,

78
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,960
so...

79
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,000
It's okay,

80
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,960
I'll handle it.

81
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,120
Grandma.

82
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,040
Hello?

83
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,650
Grandma.

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,640
Grandmother.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,920
We're back.

86
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,840
Grandmother.

87
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,400
Ruoyun,

88
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
do you know why I called you back?

89
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,040
I know.

90
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,159
Grandmother.

91
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,240
Grandmother,

92
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,680
I've figured out what happened.

93
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,480
I wasn't asking you.

94
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,360
Ruoyun,

95
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,570
you are now a daughter-in-law of the Long family.

96
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,880
How could you act

97
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,520
with such poor judgment?

98
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,920
Your every move

99
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,720
affects the reputation of the Long family,

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,050
do you understand that?

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,120
In this city,

102
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,130
so many people are waiting for our family to fall,

103
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,360
eager to laugh at our misfortune.

104
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
And what do you do?

105
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,560
One single photo

106
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,970
has ruined Haotian's reputation.

107
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,240
As a daughter-in-law of the Long family,

108
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,900
is this how you should behave?

109
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
I'm sorry, Grandmother.

110
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,570
Please punish me as you see fit.

111
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,880
Ruoyun,

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,240
punish you?

113
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,610
What good would that do now?

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,600
Do you realize

115
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,640
how much damage this incident has caused to the Long Corporation?

116
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,240
Our stock prices are falling.

117
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,640
Reputation is declining

118
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,600
what should we

119
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,760
do about this?

120
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,360
Grandmother.

121
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,159
Ruoyun was actually framed by Zhao Zi'ang

122
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,040
I've already asked the PR department to handle it

123
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,440
and I'll find Zhao Zi'ang

124
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,380
to make him publicly clarify and apologize online.

125
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,680
Ruoyun

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
remember this,

127
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,090
the Long family and Haotian

128
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,800
cannot have any stain on their reputation.

129
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,760
Although the Long family

130
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,420
isn't afraid of such matters,

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,720
we cannot allow others

132
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,000
to casually defame

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,840
our family's reputation.

134
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,000
I understand, Grandmother.

135
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,640
I will be more

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,260
careful in the future.

137
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,520
Since Haotian

138
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
has already started handling this matter,

139
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,960
I won't

140
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,659
say much more about it.

141
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,320
If we don't

142
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,039
teach you a lesson,

143
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,039
I'm afraid you might

144
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,289
make an even bigger mess in the future.

145
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,919
I understand what you mean, Grandmother,

146
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,450
Ruoyun will remember this.

147
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,360
Grandmother.

148
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,840
We'll be going now.

149
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,400
Haotian.

150
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,490
What are you doing here?

151
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,360
If I hadn't come, I wouldn't have seen this.

152
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,080
You two, drunk late at night

153
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,930
heading back to the same place,

154
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,760
you really do make a nice couple.

155
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,720
No.

156
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,920
Haotian,

157
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,490
it's not what you think.

158
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,000
There's nothing between us,

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,760
you've got it all wrong.

160
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,160
I don't care what your relationship is.

161
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,360
I came here today mainly for two things.

162
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,080
First,

163
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,760
stay away from Chu Ruoyun.

164
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,160
She's pure and kind-hearted,

165
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,890
and I don't want her to get hurt.

166
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,560
Second,

167
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,620
delete all the photos you posted online.

168
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,360
And

169
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,760
apologize online,

170
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,400
clarify

171
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,560
and reveal the truth about what happened.

172
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,160
That's it.

173
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Long Haotian,

174
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,920
don't think you can control everything in Jin City.

175
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,000
Others may fear you,

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,560
but I, Zhao Zi'ang, am not afraid of you, got it?

177
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,020
I don't need you to fear me.

178
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,080
But if anyone tries to slander

179
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,400
or hurt my family,

180
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,580
I absolutely won't let them get away with it.

181
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,120
Haotian!

182
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,400
Haotian!

183
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,000
It's not what you think.

184
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,880
There's nothing between us,

185
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,360
I...

186
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,720
Why did you two

187
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,420
suddenly come back again?

188
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,600
Long Haotian wants us to delete the photos

189
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,400
and make a public apology at the press conference.

190
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,760
Haotian and I

191
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,840
will probably never have a chance together.

192
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Look at the situation we're in!

193
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,040
How can you still think about that?

194
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,840
Even without Ruoyun,

195
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
you and Haotian would never work out,

196
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,100
don't you understand?

197
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,600
How can you say that?

198
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,100
If you hadn't insisted I go to your place,

199
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,920
how would Haotian have seen us together

200
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,600
and misunderstood?

201
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,240
Blaming me again. Fine, it's my fault.

202
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,920
I'm not trying to blame you...

203
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Alright, enough.

204
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,000
Stop arguing.

205
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,180
We need to present a united front.

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,360
So what do we do next?

207
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,290
Here's the plan:

208
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,600
first, do as he asks.

209
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,000
After that,

210
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,930
I have my own arrangements.

211
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,330
What arrangements?

212
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,640
What's it to you?

213
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,440
Isn't this my business too?

214
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,240
Let's go.

215
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm leaving now.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,660

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,320
