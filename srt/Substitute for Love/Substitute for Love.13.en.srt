Grandma,

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,800
what brings you here?

17
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,000
Ruoyun.

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,720
I need to talk to you.

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,380
Go ahead, Grandma.

20
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,760
Grandma.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,320
We're family,

22
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,720
please just tell me what's on your mind.

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,520
Ruoyun.

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,820
About the company situation,

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,720
you're now aware of everything.

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,490
A turning point.

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,740
There still is one.

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,360
However.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,079
Grandma,

30
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,880
do you

31
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,740
want me to do something specific?

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,280
I hope

33
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,280
that you

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,720
will leave Haotian.

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,320
I know

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
this is unfair

37
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
to you.

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,720
I...

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
I have no choice,

40
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,090
this is all for the Long family.

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Why, Grandma?

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,880
What did I do wrong?

43
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,820
You didn't do anything wrong.

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,960
This is

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,760
Miss Li's

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,080
condition.

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,010
What condition?

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,360
She's offering to invest

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,880
to help the Long Group

50
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,380
overcome this crisis.

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
The condition is

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,280
that you leave Haotian.

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
Grandma.

54
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,200
Haotian and I truly love each other,

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,560
I believe in him,

56
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,760
he can solve our current difficulties.

57
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,960
I know.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,720
Haotian has

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,260
repeatedly rejected Miss Li for you.

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
And.

61
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,200
He's willing to give up

62
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,160
his position as chairman of the Long Group for you.

63
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
This proves

64
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,160
how much you mean to him.

65
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,800
But sometimes

66
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,000
he can't make the right choice.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
So.

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,720
I'm just...

69
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm asking you to make the best choice.

70
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,370
I'm sorry, Grandma,

71
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,050
but this is my right choice.

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,400
So

73
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,040
you were all

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,920
talking about me yesterday?

75
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,800
Yes.

76
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,890
You've seen it clearly.

77
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,159
Haotian

78
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,560
would rather give up everything

79
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,400
than agree to this.

80
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,440
Grandma,

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,120
this isn't fair.

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
Is the company's interest

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,800
really more important than Haotian's happiness?

84
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,960
Of course it is.

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,000
All of this,

86
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
you already know.

87
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,320
The Long Group's success today

88
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
comes from how much

89
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,640
our family has sacrificed.

90
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
If it all

91
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
falls apart

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,120
with me and Haotian,

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,720
collapses.

94
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,040
Haotian and I...

95
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,840
I'll say goodbye

96
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
to the Long family ancestors

97
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Ruoyun.

98
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,040
If you truly love Haotian,

99
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,660
then you should

100
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,120
leave him.

101
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,440
Ruoyun.

102
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,520
I have never begged anyone

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,920
in my entire life.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,240
This time,

105
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,960
consider it my plea to you.

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,760
I understand, Grandmother.

107
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,360
This kindness of yours

108
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
my family

109
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,659
will remember.

110
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,040
Haotian.

111
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,200
You've done so much for me.

112
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,800
This time,

113
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,760
let me do something for you.

114
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,080
Only one day remained before the penalty deadline.

115
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,240
Haotian,

116
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,240
I'm sorry,

117
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,640
I'm leaving.

118
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,900
Please forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,159
This time,

120
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,800
consider it my plea to you.

121
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,840
It's only because I care about you too much

122
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,760
that I have to choose to leave you.

123
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,040
Looking back at everything,

124
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,220
from our first meeting

125
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,220
to getting to know each other,

126
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,800
from understanding each other

127
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
to falling in love.

128
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,450
All along this journey,

129
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,560
you've given me so much.

130
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,920
I clearly remember

131
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,920
you holding my hand,

132
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,800
saying I was your most right choice.

133
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,560
I also remember

134
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
all your confessions,

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,360
all your promises.

136
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,160
I was truly happy.

137
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,520
Thank heaven.

138
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,960
Thank you.

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,400
All of this

140
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,760
will be the most beautiful memory in my life.

141
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,919
Don't worry,

142
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,960
I will definitely give birth to our child

143
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,400
and raise them well.

144
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,360
I will surely tell them

145
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,000
that their father loves them very much.

146
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,560
Haotian,

147
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,300
please don't come looking for me.

148
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,800
Do what you need to do

149
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,120
and take good care of yourself.

150
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,640
Love, Ruoyun.
