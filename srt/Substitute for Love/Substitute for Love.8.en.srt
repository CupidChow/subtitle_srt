1
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,560
Haotian,

2
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,320
look.

3
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,039
Hello everyone, my name is Zhao Zi'ang.

4
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,080
I deliberately posted a photo

5
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,759
with a malicious caption

6
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,840
to defame Director Long and his wife.

7
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,080
This has caused extremely negative consequences for them.

8
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,680
Here,

9
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,760
I sincerely apologize to Director Long and his wife.

10
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,639
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,640
At least this gives Grandma some closure.

12
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,200
But

13
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,280
I don't know when these negative effects will finally fade away.

14
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,640
It's okay.

15
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,079
Time heals all wounds.

16
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,170
And reveals all truths.

17
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,480
Hey, Xiao Ai,

18
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,440
wait for me.

19
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,440
There are some issues at the company

20
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,970
that I might need to handle.

21
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,920
Wait for me at home.

22
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,720
Okay.

23
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,120
What's going on?

24
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,760
The production department reported this morning

25
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,040
that all our suppliers

26
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,080
have stopped providing us with goods.

27
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,920
What's the reason?

28
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,720
It's not clear yet,

29
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
we're still communicating with them.

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,580
Which project?

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,980
The Hengxin Group one.

32
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,800
Notify all departments for a meeting.

33
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,060
They're already in the conference room.

34
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
All departments,

35
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,140
please report the information you have now.

36
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,340
What are you all doing?

37
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,050
Is there not a single department that knows what's going on?

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,600
Chairman,

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,079
we immediately sent someone to communicate with them,

40
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,960
but

41
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,290
we haven't received any feedback yet.

42
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,280
Hello?

43
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,640
Yes.

44
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,360
Okay.

45
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
Chairman,

46
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,200
the southern branch has sent back news.

47
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,260
The reason they stopped supplying us

48
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
is because someone bought out

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,200
all the raw materials on the market at a premium price.

50
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,080
Which company?

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,920
This is still unclear.

52
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,200
Use all company resources

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,730
to investigate thoroughly

54
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,680
Find out which company is behind this

55
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,280
and what their objective is.

56
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,960
Also,

57
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,400
relevant departments need to develop a plan as soon as possible,

58
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,659
the sooner the better.

59
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,840
Alright,

60
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,130
you all can get back to work now.

61
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,280
Mr. Long.

62
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,600
I heard our cooperation

63
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,920
has hit a snag,

64
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,360
is that true?

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,130
Mr. Zhong, you're certainly well-informed.

66
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,980
Don't tell me you've planted a spy in my company?

67
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,320
You flatter me, Mr. Long.

68
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,620
I don't have that kind of capability.

69
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,960
However, as a businessman,

70
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,920
gathering first-hand information

71
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,380
is absolutely essential.

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,130
Judging by your company's current state,

73
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,610
I guess the rumors are true.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
So, Mr. Zhong, did you come here today

75
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,140
to laugh at my misfortune,

76
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,159
or to put pressure on me?

77
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
I'm just here to remind you, Mr. Long,

78
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,680
that if you fail to fulfill the contract on time,

79
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,610
the consequences will be serious.

80
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,159
Don't worry,

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,010
Long Corporation has weathered all kinds of storms.

82
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,240
This little issue

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,090
can certainly be resolved.

84
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,560
That's good.

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,320
I wouldn't want our first collaboration

86
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,520
to end on such an unpleasant note.

87
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,880
Mr. Zhong.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,080
Then to prevent any unpleasantness,

89
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,120
I'd appreciate it if

90
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,180
you could cooperate with my investigation.

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,960
Don't worry.

92
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Whatever cooperation is needed,

93
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,320
I'll definitely cooperate.

94
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,720
Mr. Zhong isn't planning any tricks, is he?

95
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
What do you mean?

96
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,120
Nothing,

97
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,520
just thinking out loud.

98
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,200
Mr. Long,

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,520
as the head of Long Group,

100
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,080
a man of your status,

101
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,610
you should be careful with your words.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,800
That's right,

103
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,800
as the head of Long Group,

104
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,820
anyone who tries to bring down Long Group

105
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,800
will pay the price.

106
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,800
Good.

107
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,720
When the contract expires,

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
I'll be back.

109
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,480
Haotian,

110
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,680
how are things going

111
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,140
with the company matters?

112
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,280
They haven't been fully resolved yet,

113
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,940
but we're already preparing a second solution.

114
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,800
Haven't you found out who they are yet?

115
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,960
No.

116
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,360
Whoever we're dealing with

117
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
is very powerful,

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,130
and we still can't figure out who it is.

119
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,560
Do you think

120
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,600
it could be the Hengxin Group?

121
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,880
I've certainly considered that possibility.

122
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,410
But Zhong Zimo visited our company today.

123
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,160
Based on their company's capabilities

124
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,100
and my conversation with him,

125
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,200
I don't think it's him.

126
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Then why did he come to the company

127
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,890
at this time?

128
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,010
If we fail to fulfill the contract on time,

129
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,480
we'll have to pay him triple compensation.

130
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,840
That's serious.

131
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,640
The Long Group can afford to pay it,

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,600
but it would take at least two years to recover.

133
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,890
If we encounter any other problems...

134
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,560
It seems

135
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,200
this person's goal

136
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,800
is to destroy the Long Group.

137
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,400
Don't worry.

138
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,020
The Long Group won't collapse so easily.

139
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,440
But

140
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,040
the contract will expire soon.

141
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,500
I'll definitely find a way to solve this.

142
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,960
How's the situation

143
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,420
with the Long Group going?

144
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,540
Everything's going well.

145
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,240
Long Haotian is using all his resources

146
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,840
to investigate this matter.

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,730
I'm using overseas resources,

148
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,500
he won't be able to trace them.

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,400
Indeed,

150
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,880
he'll never figure it out no matter how hard he tries.

151
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,720
It will be so.

152
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,800
Are you sure

153
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,180
there won't be any more unexpected changes?

154
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,440
On this point,

155
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,480
rest assured,

156
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,000
the old Mrs. Long has already stepped back,

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,200
and in these past two years,

158
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,400
Long Haotian has offended quite a few people in business.

159
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,480
No one will help him.

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,440
I just hope that through this matter,

161
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,800
Haotian will know who truly loves him,

162
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
who will stand up for him.

163
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,320
Indeed.

164
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,320
Well then,

165
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,640
I wish you success, Sister Yiran.

166
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,680
Is this all?

167
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,080
Yes, Chairman.

168
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,680
We've used all our resources,

169
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,880
but only found a few foreign companies involved in the disruption,

170
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
the mastermind behind it all

171
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,140
remains untraceable.

172
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,450
What about production?

173
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,320
We've selected new suppliers,

174
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,160
but their production capacity isn't sufficient.

175
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,560
To fulfill the contract,

176
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
it might take an extra 10-plus days.

177
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,320
I understand.

178
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,240
You may go.

179
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,340
Cast

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,960
