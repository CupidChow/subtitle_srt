1
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,800
Jinhua

2
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,000
Building 6,

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,860
Apartment 802.

4
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:46,960
Got it.

5
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,850
Where are you going?

6
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,330
Li Yiran.

7
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,160
In my heart,

8
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,580
there's only room for Chu Ruoyun.

9
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,920
Lin Xiaoxin.

10
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
Why are you in my house?

11
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,930
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

12
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,040
Zhao Zi'ang.

13
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,960
What are you all waiting for me to do?

14
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,890
What's going on?

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,360
Everything that's happening now is because of you.

16
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,120
So

17
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,760
you must take responsibility for this.

18
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,840
What have I done that you want me to be responsible for?

19
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,260
What have you done?

20
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,920
If it weren't for you,

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,920
would Haotian have broken up with me?

22
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,240
If it weren't for you,

23
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,720
would my company have terminated my contract?

24
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,840
Your company terminating your contract

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,240
has nothing to do with me.

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,000
Of course it does.

27
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,960
You

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,320
are the one behind everything.

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,360
What exactly do you want from me?

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,250
It's simple.

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,800
Call Haotian

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,560
and tell him

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,090
to kick Li Yiran out of Jincheng for me.

34
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,560
Oh,

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,490
and also,

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
transfer 20% of Long Group's shares

37
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,760
to our names.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,000
I can't possibly do that.

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,800
You...

40
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,920
you don't have a choice here.

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,980
What are you doing?

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,640
Let me go!

43
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,420
Be good now.

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,890
We'll release you soon.

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm warning you.

46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,500
Zhong Zimo knows where I live.

47
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,440
You'd better leave quickly,

48
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,160
or else

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,060
he could show up at any moment.

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,570
You just reminded me of something.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,520
Zhao Zi'ang, let go of me!

52
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,960
At that moment, Zhong Zimo received a call about Chu Ruoyun's kidnapping.

53
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,450
Zhao Zi'ang.

54
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,120
What are you trying to do?

55
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,170
Don't worry,

56
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,360
as long as you cooperate with us,

57
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,400
we'll let you go.

58
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
What you're doing

59
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,600
is illegal.

60
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,360
If I can't pay back the loan sharks, I'm dead anyway,

61
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,020
so why would I care about that?

62
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,890
About the money,

63
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880
we can figure something out gradually.

64
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,360
If you continue down this path,

65
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,960
there'll be no turning back.

66
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,720
If you had helped me back then,

67
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,000
why would things have come to this?

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What's the point of saying this now?

69
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,480
Zhao Zi'ang.

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,440
Why are you

71
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,200
wasting time talking to her?

72
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,020
It's you again.

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,440
May I help you with something?

74
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm sorry,

75
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,090
for disturbing you.

76
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,800
I haven't seen

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,160
your madam for quite some time.

78
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,890
Has something happened to her?

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,840
I'm sorry,

80
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
but I cannot disclose

81
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,620
any information about our madam.

82
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,760
Please leave.

83
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,290
It's right here.

84
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,440
I really need to use the bathroom. I can't hold it anymore.

85
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll wait right here.

86
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,700
Don't try anything funny.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,360
Here.

88
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,440
There's not even a door here.

89
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,460
I'll wait for you here.

90
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,320
What a hassle.

91
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,120
Hurry up!

92
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,760
Hurry up!

93
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Stop rushing me.

94
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,560
Come on!

95
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,170
Are you done yet?

96
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,320
Almost.

97
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,360
Don't rush me.

98
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,360
Chu Ruoyun.

99
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,280
Chu Ruoyun.

100
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,960
Chu Ruoyun.

101
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,280
Ruoyun.

102
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,130
Haotian.

103
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,960
My stomach hurts so much.

104
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,680
It's okay,

105
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,060
I'll take you to the hospital.

106
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,360
Everything will be fine.

107
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,820
Doctor!

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,720
Hurry up,

109
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,250
make way please.

110
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,850
Excuse me, coming through.

111
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,340
Hang in there, Ruoyun.

112
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,039
Doctor!

113
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,360
Doctor!

114
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,740
Family members are waiting outside.

115
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,120
Contains abundant nutrients from certain water vegetables.

116
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:22,760
The most natural embodiment of vital nutrients.

117
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
Requires more than 1 time the standard processing, fresh.

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,200
Vegetables and summer water crops contain high amounts.

119
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,730
Xuzhou Province's Yongkang contains significant nutrients.

120
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,530
Are you a family member of the patient?

121
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,780
We couldn't save the baby.

122
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,580
What about my wife?

123
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,000
Your wife doesn't have any serious problems.

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,280
She'll be transferred to a regular ward soon.

125
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,080
She'll recover after some rest.

126
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,120
Thank you.

127
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,130
Hello, are you Lin Xiaoxin?

129
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,280
Come with us.

130
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,200
Mr. Li,

131
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
I've received news

132
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,010
that Chu Ruoyun had a miscarriage.

133
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,240
A miscarriage?

134
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,770
Are you sure?

135
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,890
I'm certain.

136
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,440
You may go now.
