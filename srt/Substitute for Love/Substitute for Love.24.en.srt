1
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,039
Sir

2
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,680
you just said

3
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,340
I'm your biological daughter

4
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,960
what's going on here?

5
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,320
Ruoyun.

6
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,580
Your adoptive mother and I

7
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,680
were once in love.

8
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,420
Later, when I wanted to break up with her,

9
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,050
she couldn't accept it.

10
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,880
On the day you were born,

11
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,720
she took you away.

12
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,140
I always thought I had only one daughter.

13
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,320
That's why

14
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,079
I missed out on 20 years of caring for you.

15
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,170
You don't hate your father, do you?

16
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,360
Sir.

17
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,820
Is everything you said

18
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,280
really true?

19
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,680
Yes.

20
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,760
It's all true.

21
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,440
By the way,

22
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,480
Zimo can testify to this.

23
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,320
It's true.

24
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,960
Ruoyun, I know this is hard to understand,

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but it's okay.

26
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,500
Once we arrive at Chu Village,

27
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
and meet Mama Chu,

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,960
everything will become clear.

29
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,520
Okay.

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,240
But I need to see someone first.

31
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,200
Haotian.

32
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
I know about everything

33
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,560
that has happened recently.

34
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,760
What are your plans

35
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,200
now that you're back?

36
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,880
Grandma.

37
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,959
Grandma, we've come back

38
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,890
to return the company to you first.

39
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
We've decided to live a simple life.

40
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm too old

41
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,900
to manage so many affairs now.

42
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
Children and grandchildren

43
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,159
will make their own fortune.

44
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
You take care of the company.

45
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Just come visit me

46
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,960
when you have time.

47
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,800
Grandma.

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,640
Can we have

49
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,240
your blessing?

50
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,840
Heaven rewards diligence.

51
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,160
Earth rewards kindness.

52
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,680
Dad.

53
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,960
Ruoyun has returned.

54
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,360
This is her husband, Long Haotian.

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,280
Good,

56
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,240
say hello to Grandpa.

57
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,760
Grandpa.

58
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,760
My granddaughter,

59
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,820
you've been through so much all these years.

60
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,280
Dad.

61
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,960
Grandpa.

62
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,560
I've brought our daughter

63
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,680
Ruoyun

64
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,159
to see you.

65
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,280
I'm sorry,

66
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,130
it's all my fault

67
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,620
that you never got to meet her.

68
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,300
You're not angry with me, are you?

69
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,159
Ruoyun is doing well now.

70
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,800
She has found someone

71
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,760
who truly cares for her

72
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,220
and loves her as a husband.

73
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,880
You can rest easy.

74
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,440
Mom,

75
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,690
I've come to see you.

76
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,160
Thank you

77
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,840
for bringing me into this world.

78
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,880
Although I've never met you,

79
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,040
I believe

80
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,420
you're always watching over me from heaven.

81
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,640
Dad and Grandpa

82
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,960
from now on

83
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,940
will be taken care of by me.

84
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,760
You can rest assured.

85
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,400
In the future,

86
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,799
I'll come visit you

87
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,289
and my sister often.

88
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,040
By the way,

89
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,560
Huihui.

90
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,360
I want to relocate the company

91
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,160
back to China.

92
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,360
This way,

93
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,760
Ruoyun and I can

94
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,640
come see you

95
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
and Yinuo regularly.

96
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,400
Nuo.

97
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,160
Zimo.

98
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,480
Some things

99
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,440
need to be

100
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,560
let go.

101
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,440
I think Yinuo

102
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,880
wouldn't want to see you going on like this.

103
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
Nuo.

104
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Give me your hand.

105
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,960
What for?

106
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,960
Hurry up.

107
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,600
It's for you.

108
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,690
You're just giving me a worn-out hair tie?

109
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,160
Idiot.

110
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,400
Li.

111
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,960
Li.
