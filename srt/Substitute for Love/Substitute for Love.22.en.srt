Ruoyun, you're back.

15
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,759
Uncle.

16
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,360
Come.

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,680
Sit down and eat.

18
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,560
Uncle.

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,120
Did you make all this?

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,520
Yes,

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,080
I'm not much of a cook,

22
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,240
not sure if it suits your taste.

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,120
Try it.

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,520
Here,

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
have a taste.

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
How is it? Tasty?

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,720
It's delicious.

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,720
If it's good, eat more.

29
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
You've lost weight lately.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,120
Eat up.

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,360
By the way, Ruoyun,

32
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,020
about what we discussed earlier,

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,740
have you thought about it?

34
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,520
Uncle,

35
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,020
I can't bear to see Haotian like this,

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,610
I'm planning to go back.

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Ruoyun.

38
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,160
I think your choice

39
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,480
lacks foresight.

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Would you like to hear my advice?

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,280
Do I have better options?

42
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,080
Of course.

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,160
Think about it,

44
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,520
if you go back now,

45
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,840
how will you two live?

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,240
In the future,

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,900
you'll want to have children.

48
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,880
If Haotian leaves Long Group,

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,960
what else can he do?

50
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,680
I think

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,960
you don't want to become his burden, right?

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,520
Then what can I do?

53
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,320
My suggestion is

54
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,520
learn,

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,760
improve,

56
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,740
transform.

57
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,960
Appear in the public eye

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
as a different Chu Ruoyun.

59
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,920
But

60
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,720
now...

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,960
If you want to change.

62
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
I'll arrange it.

63
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,440
It's okay,

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,480
you can think it over,

65
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,640
and let me know when you've decided.

66
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,560
Alright,

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,320
let's eat.

68
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,760
Eat some meat.

69
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,800
From now on,

70
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,080
the company is yours.

71
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,640
Drink this,

72
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,240
it helps with coughing.

73
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Really?

74
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,860
My mom used to make it for me when I was little.

75
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,560
It's good.

76
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,680
Then have some more.

77
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,240
I finished it.

78
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,620
You went to see him.

79
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,440
Haotian is sick.

80
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,840
I want to make him a bowl of snow pear tea.

81
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,440
Ruoyun.

82
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,360
I've told you before,

83
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
until you complete the plan I've set for you,

84
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,960
you two cannot meet.

85
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,800
I know,

86
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,740
I'll have someone else deliver it for me.

87
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,240
Xiao Ai.

88
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,880
Madam, you...

89
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,760
You...

90
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,720
it's me.

91
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Madam, you're alive! Thank goodness!

92
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,520
You scared me to death.

93
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,440
I'm fine.

94
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,720
All right.

95
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,640
Madam,

96
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,920
do you know?

97
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,160
During these days you've been away,

98
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,920
the Chairman has been going to the beach every day waiting for you,

99
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,520
he looks much more haggard now.

100
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,360
I know.

101
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,690
Madam, he has no spirit left at all.

102
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,960
Xiao Ai.

103
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,640
I can't see

104
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,080
Haotian right now.

105
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Don't tell anyone that you've seen me.

106
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,920
Why?

107
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,520
It's a long story,

108
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
you'll understand later.

109
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,080
Remember, don't let anyone know.

110
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,560
But the Chairman, he...

111
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,440
I believe

112
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,040
he will understand me eventually.

113
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,960
Xiao Ai.

114
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,410
Please deliver this to Haotian for me.

115
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,920
He's not feeling well now,

116
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,410
don't let him know it's from me.

117
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,920
Okay.

118
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,200
If anything happens,

119
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,920
come find me at this place.

120
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,560
Take care of yourself,

121
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,160
I'll deliver this to him now.

122
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,680
What?

123
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,720
Mr. Li is selling Long Group?

124
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,600
Keep your voice down.

125
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,770
The buyers will be here soon to discuss the contract.

126
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,800
Is that for real?

127
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
Of course it's true.

128
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,280
We're doomed.

129
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,560
Many of us will definitely be laid off.

130
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah.

131
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Who told you this?

132
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,080
Assistant Ai,

133
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,160
