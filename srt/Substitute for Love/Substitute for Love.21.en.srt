What's wrong, Ruoyun?

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,800
Uncle,

16
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,280
I see my husband at the beach every day,

17
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,400
I can see him there,

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,640
still waiting for me.

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,039
I didn't expect this guy

20
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,500
to be such a devoted lover.

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,120
Come,

22
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,010
sit down.

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,980
What are you thinking?

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,000
I can't bear to see him like this,

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,460
I want to go back to him.

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,040
Ruoyun,

27
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,400
if you go back now,

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,220
you might temporarily ease the pain of separation,

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,200
but what about

30
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,220
the future? Have you thought about that?

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,280
I...

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,760
I...

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,080
Mom!

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,040
Mr. Li,

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,170
you wanted to see me?

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Find a buyer,

37
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
keep it quiet.

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,120
Yes, Mr. Li.

39
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,120
Xiaohan.

40
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,120
Yulan,

41
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,850
you're here.

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,760
Yulan.

43
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
Come on, it's time

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,960
for us to end this relationship.

45
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,920
Why?

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Weren't we doing fine?

47
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,290
I'm going to be a father.

48
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,279
Yulan.

49
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480
To keep my family intact,

50
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,880
we can't continue like this anymore.

51
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,240
You can't do this to me.

52
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,760
Yulan.

53
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,920
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,159
Madam.

55
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,490
The company just sent news that

56
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,720
Li Yiran is

57
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,600
secretly acquiring shares of the company,

58
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,860
and several directors

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,880
have already transferred their shares to her name.

60
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,960
This Li Yiran

61
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
is quite cunning.

62
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,520
In the future,

63
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,800
whether Long Corporation remains with the Long family

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,880
or becomes Li's,

65
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,980
depends on what Haotian does.

66
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,640
Huihui.

67
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,720
I found our other child.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm sorry, Xiaohan.

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,720
Only Nono can be with you now.

70
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,960
We originally had two children.

71
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,240
She lost one.

72
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,640
Now only Nono is left.

73
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,560
Her health is poor.

74
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,980
You must take good care of her.

75
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,320
I will.

76
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
Meeting you in this life

77
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,160
has been the greatest happiness

78
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,520
of my entire existence.

79
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,320
Don't overthink things.

80
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,800
You'll get better,

81
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,850
you'll definitely get better.

82
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,240
I hope in our next life

83
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,160
we can be husband and wife again.

84
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,600
It's all my fault.

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,000
We've been separated for so many years.

86
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,320
To the point that

87
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,400
you didn't even know she existed.

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,159
This child

89
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,000
is naturally kind-hearted.

90
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
She's especially lovable.

91
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,920
But I

92
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,920
can't protect her forever.

93
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
So

94
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,920
I want to raise her to be

95
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,240
a strong, independent person.

96
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,320
Huihui.

97
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,320
Don't worry.

98
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,720
I will definitely

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,560
bring her to see you.
