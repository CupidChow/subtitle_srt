13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,960
Mr. Long

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
I heard your Long Corporation was acquired

15
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,850
and you still came to this party

16
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,960
That's quite a mindset

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,820
I'm impressed.

18
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,210
Yes, Mr. Long

19
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,120
I don't think you know

20
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,050
what this party is actually about.

21
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,770
I was invited, so I came.

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,520
Why worry about all that?

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,960
Today

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,960
But Mr. Li is hosting this party

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,290
to celebrate his successful acquisition

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,780
of your Long Corporation.

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,360
And that doesn't bother you?

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,960
Not at all.

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,170
Mr. Long, where's your pride gone?

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,820
That's right, Mr. Long

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
this isn't like you at all.

32
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,040
Well, if it isn't Mr. Long

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,810
If you had finished those drinks back then

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,560
your Long Corporation wouldn't have

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,420
ended up in someone else's hands.

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,700
By the way, Mr. Long

37
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,050
everyone here is wealthy and influential

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,720
if you were to beg around

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,360
and everyone pitched in a little

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,480
you might buy back your company, Mr. Ding.

41
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,240
Mr. Chen

42
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,170
how dare you speak to Haotian like that

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,920
You won't be able

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
to do business in Jincheng anymore.

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,960
Haotian

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,320
Let me introduce you.

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,640
This is

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,240
Mr. Long Haotian, CEO of Long Group.

49
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,480
Today,

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,760
I've invited you all here for two reasons.

51
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,360
First,

52
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,480
I've just returned to the country

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,240
and I'm not familiar with many things yet,

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,280
so I wanted everyone to meet

55
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,480
to facilitate our future cooperation.

56
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Second,

57
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,079
Mr. Long here

58
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,010
is now my business partner.

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,560
From now on,

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
anyone who disrespects Mr. Long

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,640
is disrespecting

62
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,300
my company, Red Sail Capital.

63
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,920
How shameless.

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,530
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,880
Li Yiran.

66
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,050
How can you be so shameless?

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,680
You schemed to drive Mrs. Long away

68
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,240
and now you're here pretending to care

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,570
deceiving everyone with your hypocrisy.

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,839
You're not welcome here.

71
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,880
Please leave.

72
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,320
What's wrong?

73
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,780
Feeling guilty about something?

74
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,400
Aren't you afraid

75
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,460
that all those dirty secrets of yours

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,680
will be exposed to everyone?

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,490
Haotian.

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,240
This woman has done many things to hurt Chu Ruoyun.

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,440
You can't be with her.

80
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,200
I never said I was with her.

81
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,760
I knew

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,640
Haotian

83
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,600
this woman

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,130
is extremely calculating.

85
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,760
I'll take you away from here.

86
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,400
Security!

87
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,420
Get her out of here.

88
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,960
Haotian,

89
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,220
you have to believe me!

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,360
Haotian!

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,400
What are you waiting for?

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,840
Haotian!

93
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,040
What Lin Xiaoxin said isn't true,

94
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,100
don't believe her.

95
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,240
I know what I'm doing.

96
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,220
Since we're done here,

97
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,360
I'll be going.

98
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,880
Haotian!

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,440
Mr. Li, I'm...

100
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,400
Yes.

101
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,890
Did I do the right thing?

102
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,730
Perhaps Ruoyun shouldn't have been involved in this conflict.

103
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,040
It's not fair to her.

104
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,600
Everyone stop for a moment,

105
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,040
stop!

106
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,200
Mr. Wang,

107
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,480
I'm in a hurry,

108
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,100
why did you make them stop?

109
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
You don't need to hurry anymore,

110
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,159
for this cover,

111
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,740
we don't need you anymore.

112
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,050
On what grounds?

113
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm halfway through this project,

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,400
why are you replacing me?

115
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,560
Because I'm

116
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,920
the one in charge.

117
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,840
Fine,

118
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,340
whatever you want,

119
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:56,970
actually

120
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,820
I could use a break anyway.

121
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,280
Yes, you should take a good rest,

122
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,600
starting today,

123
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,660
you don't need to come to the office anymore.

124
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,010
What did you say?

125
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,600
I said,

126
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,560
you're fired.

127
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,520
All these years,

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,480
I've generated all the company's profits,

129
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,800
and now that I'm no longer needed,

130
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,730
you're just kicking me to the curb?

131
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,280
I'm going to speak to the chairman.

132
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,800
This...

133
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,159
This is the chairman's decision.

134
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,440
To be honest with you,

135
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,679
the company has been acquired by Hongfan Capital.

136
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,200
Now

137
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,440
the company's owner

138
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,600
is from Hongfan Capital,

139
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,760
Mr. Li.

140
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,600
Li Yiran?

141
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,960
Look,

142
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,800
hand over your work

143
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,120
and leave.

144
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,770
Li Yiran, get down here!

145
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,000
Get down here!

146
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,000
Come down!

147
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,360
Get down here! Did you hear me?

148
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,160
Get down here!

149
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,450
Did you hear what I said?

150
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,120
Come down!

151
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,040
Open the door!

152
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,100
Did you hear me?

153
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,960
Open up!

154
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:37,920
Hey

155
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,200
who said you could leave?

156
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,120
Get back here!

157
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
That bastard,

158
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,760
you'll regret this!

159
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,920
Haotian!

160
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,360
Haotian!

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Haotian!

162
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,840
Mr. Zhang!

163
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,560
Miss Lin.

164
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,320
The chairman is resting

165
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,120
and not available for visitors.

166
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,040
Mr. Zhang.

167
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,160
Please tell Haotian

168
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
it's about Chu Ruoyun.

169
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,920
Just a moment.

170
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,800
Haotian.

171
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,320
You can't be with Li Yiran.

172
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,170
Chu Ruoyun's departure

173
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,360
was all her doing.

174
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
I know about that.

175
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,160
There's more.

176
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,640
Zhong Zimo and Li Yiran came to me

177
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,050
and asked me to slander Chu Ruoyun.

178
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
And that time

179
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,360
when Chu Ruoyun was defamed online,

180
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,360
Li Yiran was behind that too.

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,600
Zhong Zimo was involved as well.

182
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,000
Hmm,

183
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
what's their relationship?

184
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,960
Well,

185
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm not really sure.

186
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,920
Anything else?

187
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,640
Haotian.

188
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,400
I know

189
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,560
I've done many things that hurt you and Chu Ruoyun.

190
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,880
I apologize for my mistakes.

191
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,440
Please forgive me,

192
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,680
will you?

193
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,960
It's too late.

194

Haotian.

196
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,960
I know I was wrong,

197
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,680
please forgive me, will you?

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,720
I have

199
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,640
nothing left now.

200
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,680
Mr. Zhang.

201
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,280
Show them out.

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,240
Haotian.

203
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,920
I'm a victim too.

204
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,640
Please leave.

205
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,040
After all this time,

206
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,940

208

209
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,680
Yiran,

210
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,120
what are

211
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
your plans now?

with Haotian

214
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,810

216
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,280
do you know

217
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,880

Well,

219
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,320
I'm not sure.

220
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,760
Why,

221
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,880
are you still worried about her?

222
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
