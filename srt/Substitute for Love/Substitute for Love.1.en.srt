15
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,760
How did I not notice before we got married

16
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,690
that you had such an adorable side?

17
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
Seems like you really love this place.

18
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,720
I'll ask Uncle Zhang to turn this whole area into a sea of flowers.

19
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,570
It can be your own little world.

20
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,320
Then let's not plant flowers here anymore.

21
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,890
We'll donate them all to the nursing home.

22
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,880
What name are you planning to give the baby?

23
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,010
Isn't it too early for that?

24
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,200
Let's have Grandma name the baby.

25
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
She's the elder in the family,

26
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,480
so it would be better to let her decide.

27
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,280
Grandma will definitely be happy about it.

28
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Why did you suddenly appear behind me?

29
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
You could scare someone to death like that.

30
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
I just saw you gesturing excitedly.

32
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,080
Madam, they're so in love.

33
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,680
Lovers are destined to be together.

34
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,120
The chairman and his wife are still the perfect match.

35
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,340
Father.

36
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,640
He just gave me a cheap hair tie.

37
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,600
If you ignore me, I'll ignore you too.

38
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,100
I never expected to miss this chance.

39
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,170
Why hasn't Li Yinuo been coming to school lately?

40
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,080
She went to a place far, far away.

41
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,090
Grandpa, you're teasing me again.

42
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,780
Li Yinuo must still be inside.
