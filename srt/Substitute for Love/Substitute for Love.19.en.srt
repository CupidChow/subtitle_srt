Hello.

18
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
I'm Long Haotian.

19
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,640
Hello.

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,040
I'm Li Yiran.

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,380
Haotian, why are you running so fast?

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,180
You ate Liang Xiaotang's candy, didn't you?

23
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680
Don't let me catch you!

24
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,520
Haotian.

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
I think

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,079
we're the happiest people in the world.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,480
Can we stay together forever?

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,640
He doesn't know any better.

29
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,170
Are you being childish too?

30
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,680
If you truly love Haotian,

31
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,840
for his own good,

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
you should leave him.

33
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,240
Young lady,

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,740
would you like to learn business from me?

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
I would.

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,800
I want to be like you,

37
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,320
able to help more people.

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,760
It's wonderful that you think this way.

39
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,360
But remember,

40
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,370
business is very hard work.

41
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,800
Aren't you afraid of the hardship?

42
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,079
No matter how difficult or tough it gets,

43
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,940
I'm not afraid.

44
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,170
Where are you going?

45
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,850
Li Yiran.

46
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,120
In my heart,

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,540
there's only room for Chu Ruoyun.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,720
Haotian.

49
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,720
If you step even half a foot outside this door today,

50
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,980
you're no longer part of the Long family.

51
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,840
You can't drink anymore.

52
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,560
Give it to me.

53
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,320
What are you doing?

54
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,720
Give it back.

55
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,180
Is this really necessary?

56
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,380
Just let me drink myself to death,

57
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,800
get drunk.

58
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,320
Then I won't feel so miserable.

59
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,840
Yiran.

60
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,960
I know you're hurting,

61
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,500
but you can't drink like this.

62
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,600
Zimo,

63
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,180
you don't understand.

64
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,920
Haotian.

65
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,120
The man I love most

66
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,360
would rather give up 30 billion

67
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,120
just to be with Chu Ruoyun.

68
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,800
I just realized

69
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,240
that everything I did for him

70
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,440
was so ridiculous.

71
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,520
Yiran.

72
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
I'm just a clown.

73
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,960
I'm a fool.

74
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,700
Good day, Director Zhong.

75
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,810
Hello, boss.

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,170
Good morning, boss.

77
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,460
Morning, Director Zhong.

78
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,080
Mr. Long.

79
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,650
Looking at your resume,

80
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,930
your educational background is fine.

81
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,040
However,

82
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,159
you don't have any work experience.

83
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,680
The position of general manager

84
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,159
might not be suitable for you.

85
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,000
Well,

86
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,420
it's like this.

87
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,840
I just didn't include my work experience,

88
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,100
but I do have many years

89
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,640
of experience working in major companies.

90
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Why didn't you include that on your resume?

91
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,640
Which company was it?

92
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,280
Well,

93
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,620
I'd rather not say.

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,530
Alright.

95
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,400
