Everyone,

14
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
thank you all for coming today.

15
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,479
Today,

16
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,960
first, it's been a long time since we've seen each other,

17
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,620
so I wanted us to get together.

18
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,640
And secondly,

19
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,960
I'd like to ask all of you

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,160
for a small favor.

21
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,320
Madam,

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,210
why did you call me here?

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,520
Xiao Ai,

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,480
Haotian has been working too hard lately,

25
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,760
I want to make him some soup to boost his energy.

26
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,560
But,

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,820
you know what my cooking skills are like.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,920
I'd like to ask for your help.

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,120
Madam,

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
I have something urgent to attend to,

31
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,620
I need to go.

32
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,079
Stop right there!

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,200
If you dare leave,

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,880
I'll tell Haotian all about it.

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,000
Madam,

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,800
please spare me.

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Xiao Ai.

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,760
Today it's just one soup.

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,360
Wait for me.

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,320
How is it?

41
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,920
Delicious.

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,160
Really?

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,680
Look at my face,

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,210
does it look like I'm lying?

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,520
That's great, Xiao Ai,

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
I did it!

47
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,320
Madam,

48
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,200
please give me another bowl,

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,000
okay?

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,680
Here.

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,180
Careful, it's hot.

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,079
The chairman is so lucky,

53
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,920
coming back after drinking

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,480
and having such a warm soup waiting for him,

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,760
I'm jealous.

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,210
After drinking?

57
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,540
Xiao Ai.

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,040
Did you just say

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,570
Haotian went out drinking?

60
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
It's not just drinking,

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,520
it's a business meeting.

62
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,280
Did he go alone?

63
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,680
I believe so.

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,040
Xiao Ai.

65
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Do you know where Haotian is?

66
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,280
Yes, I do,

67
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,880
I booked the private room for the chairman.

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,240
Good,

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,360
take me there.

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,060
That's not a good idea,

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,730
the chairman will scold me.

72
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,680
Xiao Ai.

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
Haotian doesn't drink often,

74
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,760
I'm worried he might drink too much,

75
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,020
take me there quickly.

76
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,520
Mr. Long,

77
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,680
your group used to be wealthy and powerful,

78
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,079
acting like you owned the world,

79
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,200
and we

80
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,650
might have shown you some respect.

81
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,520
But now

82
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,200
if you want us to invest

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,280
you'll have to drink all the alcohol

84
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,400
on this table.

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,920
Drink up.

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,080
That's right,

87
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,960
if Mr. Long

88
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,360
drinks all of it,

89
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,960
we'll invest.

90
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,480
Go ahead,

91
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,280
each bottle

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,480
is worth 5 billion.

93
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,400
Everyone agrees, right?

94
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,960
Fine,

95
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,640
I'll drink.

96
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,840
Alright.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,360
Good.

98
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,760
Someone drank for you,

99
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,090
just these few bottles.

100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,520
Here.

101
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,130
Why are you here?

102
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,960
Drink up.

103
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,920
I hope everyone here

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
keeps their word.

105
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,690
You can't drink.

106
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,600
50 billion.

107
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,720
Xiao Ai.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,400
100 billion.

109
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,600
There's still 200 billion more.

110
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,120
Drink.

111
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,000
Xiao Ai.

112
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,560
You can't drink anymore.

113
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,320
Xiao Ai.

114
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,930
Your body can't take it.

115
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,159
It's fine,

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
don't worry.

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,640
150 billion.

118
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,040
150 billion.

119
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,050
Billion.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,760
Xiao Ai.

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,360
Xiao Ai.

122
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,560
Thought you were so impressive,

123
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,320
don't stick your neck out if you can't handle it,

124
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,360
serves you right if you puke yourself to death.

125
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,240
That's right,

126
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,620
you didn't finish the drinks,

127
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,700
we're not paying for this.

128
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,720
You people,

129
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
you used to flatter me,

130
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,580
now that Long Corporation is in trouble,

131
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
you all come to kick me when I'm down.

132
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,360
I, Long Haotian,

133
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,160
will remember what happened today.

134
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,180
All of you, get out!

135
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,160
Let's go then.

136
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,640
