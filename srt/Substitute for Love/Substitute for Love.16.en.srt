Ruoyun

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,759
Where are you?

16
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,210
Have you been eating properly?

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,560
Have you been sleeping well?

18
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,370
Are you and the baby doing alright?

19
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,140
Stop drinking.

20
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,130
Give it to me.

21
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,240
Stop drinking.

22
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,620
That's enough.

23
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,480
Zi'ang.

24
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,680
I've lost everything.

25
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,120
I have nothing left.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,920
Don't worry.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,010
I'll fight alongside you till the end.

28
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,680
How can we fight?

29
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,080
What do we have to fight them with?

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,120
This Li Yiran,

31
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,440
she's just too ruthless.

32
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,100
It's all Li Yiran's fault.

33
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,840
Everything was fine,

34
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,880
where did she even come from?

35
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,760
No,

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,680
it's Chu Ruoyun's fault.

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,480
If it weren't for her,

38
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,770
Haotian and I would still be together.

39
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,160
Yes.

40
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
I was so good to her,

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
loved her so much,

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,800
but she abandoned me for wealth and status.

43
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,880
That's right,

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,920
if you had kept her close back then,

45
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,780
none of this would have happened.

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,800
Oh, right,

47
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,200
yes.

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,280
It's my fault.

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,720
I'll drink as punishment.

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,180
I'll pour myself another.

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,160
Enough.

52
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,610
What's the point of blaming yourself?

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,920
Actually,

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,480
I just can't accept it.

55
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,090
Why should it be that in the end,

56
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,800
I'm left with nothing?

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,600
Right,

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,360
we can't end up with nothing.

59
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,560
Do you have any

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,079
ideas?

61
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,740
What ideas could I possibly have?

62
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,120
Now,

63
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,720
nobody is willing to help me.

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,220
My situation is

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,260
even worse than yours.

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,050
Everything that's happened to us,

67
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
it's all Chu Ruoyun's fault.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,240
She should be the one

69
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,520
to pay for all of this.

70
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,080
Do you want to know

71
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,090
where Chu Ruoyun is?

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,560
Where is she?

73
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,040
Why did you ask me out today?

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,640
Is there something you need?

75
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,880
Can't I just invite you for a meal without a reason?

76
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,320
I've been back in the country for so long,

77
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,250
yet we haven't had a meal together.

78
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
I've been quite busy lately,

79
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,340
but that will pass.

80
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,680
Once this period is over,

81
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,080
I'll treat you to dinner.

82
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,440
Thank you for helping my Long Group overcome this crisis.

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,760
No need to be so formal.

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,280
Thank you.

85
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,650
Haotian.

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,580
Cheers.

87
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,500
Let's celebrate the Long Group overcoming its difficulties.

88
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,159
By the way,

89
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,170
do you know Zhong Zimo from Hengxin Group?

90
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,720
I do.

91
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,840
Isn't he the one

92
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,040
who caused the crisis for your company?

93
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,560
Why are you suddenly asking about him?

94
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,360
It wasn't him.

95
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,410
I've looked into it.

96
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
It was foreign capital entering the market

97
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,330
that forced us to terminate our cooperation.

98
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,440
So,

99
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,240
have you found out who it was?

100
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,600
Not yet.

101
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
But a few days ago,

102
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,620
Lin Xiaoxin came to see me.

103
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,860
What did she want from you?

104
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,040
She told

105
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,840
me that

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,050
Why are you looking at me like that?

107
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,960
Nothing.

108
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,320
She asked me

109
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,520
to beg you for a favor,

110
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,020
to let him off the hook.

111
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,850
Well, I wasn't planning to do anything to her anyway.

112
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,159
Since you've asked,

113
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,760
I'll do whatever you say.

114
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,800
Mr. Zhong.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,600
Mr. Zhong.

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,300
This document needs your signature.

117
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,640
Haotian.

118
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,320
About what happened this time,

119
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,800
I've been thinking for a long time,

120
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,560
I think we should...

121
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,740
Ruoyun.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
Haotian.

123
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,620
You still can't let her go.

124
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,720
Yiran,

125
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,780
we can only be friends.

126
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
Friends.

127
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,400
If it weren't for me,

128
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,730
Long Group would have collapsed already.

129
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
I've done so much for you,

130
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,049
yet you only have her in your heart.

131
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I've found Chu Ruoyun's residence.

132
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,290
Where is she?
