Leave Haotian,

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,080
you two aren't right for each other.

16
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,360
Why, Grandma?

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,340
What's not suitable about it?

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,759
If one day

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,759
Haotian faces problems at work,

20
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,080
what can you do to help?

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
I...

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,600
If one day

23
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,760
Long Corporation faces bankruptcy,

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,820
what can you possibly do then?

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,720
I...

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,560
What our Long family needs is

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,720
someone of equal social standing,

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,380
someone who can help Haotian.

29
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,960
As for you,

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,360
you can't do anything.

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,760
Grandmother,

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,400
Haotian and I truly love each other.

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,760
If that day you mentioned really comes,

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,200
I'll work hard to earn money.

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,160
Please give us your blessing,

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
Grandmother.

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,960
He may be foolish,

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,560
but are you just as naive?

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,760
If you truly love Haotian,

40
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,360
do what's best for him.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,960
Just leave him.

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,440
Yes, Mr. Zhong.

43
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,480
I understand.

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
Hey, what have you been up to lately?

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,640
Nothing much.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,840
Why are you calling so late?

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Mr. Zhong wants to meet us tomorrow.

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,680
Oh.

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,400
Got it.

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Hmm.

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,040
Miss Lin, it's time for the photo shoot.

52
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,880
Let's go.

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,079
Mr. Zhong.

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,160
Mr. Zhang.

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Where's Haotian?

56
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,400
The chairman went to the office early this morning.

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,760
Before leaving, he specifically instructed

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,000
not to wake you up,

59
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,600
so you could get some more rest.

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,480
He also said

61
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
you don't need to go to the office today,

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,160
just stay home and rest well.

63
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,400
Okay.

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,800
I understand.

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,200
Yiran,

66
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,170
this is the tea you sent back last time,

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,460
it tastes really good.

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,920
Mr. Zhong.

69
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,760
What did you want to see us about?

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,420
Let me introduce you to

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
this is Li Yiran from Red Sail Capital.

72
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,159
Li Yiran.

73
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,280
Hello.

74
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,409
I'm Zhao Zi'ang.

75
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,200
Hi.

76
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I'm Lin Xiaoxin.

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Actually, it's nothing important.

78
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,880
First

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,280
I'd like to introduce Manager Li to you both

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,520
and second

81
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,240
it's about some matters concerning Chu Ruyun.

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,180
I'd like to ask for your help with something.

83
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,159
Of course

84
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,600
once it's done

85
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,560
there'll be plenty of benefits for both of you.

86
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,920
Chu Ruyun.

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,580
Manager Zhong.

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,200
What do you

89
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,640
want us to do?

90
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,280
Sir, who are you?

91
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,540
Hello, young lady.

92
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,440
I remember there used to be

93
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,000
a bridge over this river,

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,720
why can't I see it now?

95
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,560
Go about 200 meters that way and you'll see it.

96
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,600
Okay, thank you.

97
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,090
You're welcome.

98
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,200
Madam,

99
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,320
your phone call.

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,920
All right.

101
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,440
Just then, Chu Ruoyun received a call from her ex-boyfriend, Zhao Zi'ang.

102
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Hey, Ruoyun.

103
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,040
Why are you calling me again?

104
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm calling this time

105
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
specifically to apologize to you.

106
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,159
I've done many things that hurt you before,

107
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,640
can you forgive me?

108
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,640
Zhao Zi'ang,

109
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,200
just don't disturb my life anymore, that's all I ask.

110
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,720
No need to apologize. Let's leave it at that.

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
Ruoyun.

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,730
I'm not just calling to apologize,

113
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I also have a secret to tell you.

114
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Zhao Zi'ang,

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,520
you're trying to trick me with this kind of thing again.

116
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,000
No, Ruoyun.

117
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,640
I'm a dying man,

118
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,840
why would I lie to you?

119
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,240
Here's what happened.

120
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,760
Today Lin Xiaoxin came to see me

121
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,320
wanting to expose dirt on Long Haotian.

122
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,320
She gave me a lot of negative news about Long Haotian and Long Corporation.

123
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,960
I don't want to hurt you and Haotian anymore,

124
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
that's why I'm calling to tell you.

125
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,520
I have cancer,

126
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,520
terminal stage.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,080
I'm just waiting to die at home now. I can't go anywhere.

128
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,400
If I weren't feeling so ill,

129
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,250
I would have brought it to you, Ruoyun.

130
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,000
Consider it seeing me for the last time,

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,440
just come over and get it.

132
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,840
I understand.

133
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,800
How did it go?

134
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,760
It's done.

135
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,920
So professional.

136
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,560
Look weaker.

137
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,360
Don't stick your butt out.

138
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,690
I'm not sticking it out.

139
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,000
Is this okay?

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,080
Yes, that's good.

141
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,800
It's fine,

142
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
definitely fine.

143
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,890
I'm going in.

144
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,960
Good luck.

145
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,520
Coming!

146
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,200
I'm here!

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,280
Please come in,

148
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,360
have a seat,

149
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,320
anywhere is fine.

150
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,050
My right foot isn't working well anymore.

151
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,210
What terminal illness do you have?

152
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,680
Bone cancer.

153
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,880
The doctor says I shouldn't walk much,

154
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
that's why I asked you to come over.

155
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,210
Can't it be treated?

156
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,480
The doctor says

157
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,080
it's too late for treatment.

158
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,480
Besides,

159
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,960
without you by my side,

160
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,760
life doesn't mean much to me anyway.

161
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,520
Let it be.

162
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,280
You said you wanted me to come get some documents.

163
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,140
Where are they?

164
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,680
Right,

165
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,200
I forgot.

166
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,080
Making things up.

167
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,650
These are just slanders against Haotian.

168
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,180
I don't believe it,

169
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,480
but as these lies spread,

170
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,160
even falsehoods

171
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,490
can eventually become truth, can't they?

172
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,320
Thank you.

173
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,930
I'll take these to Haotian right away.

174
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,960
Ruoyun.

175
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,560
Let's

176
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,060
have one last embrace,

177
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,530
to bring closure to our relationship.
