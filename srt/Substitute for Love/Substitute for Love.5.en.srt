1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,180
Jincheng Welfare.

2
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,320
Do we know each other?

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,240
We don't know each other,

4
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,520
but we both know

5
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,320
Long Haotian.

6
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,360
Let me formally introduce myself,

7
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,820
I'm Haotian's first love.

8
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,520
A few years ago, I went abroad for Haotian's sake,

9
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,040
and now I'm back.

10
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,120
There are certain things

11
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,520
he can't conveniently do,

12
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,120
so I'm here to do them for him.

13
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,360
Are you saying

14
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Haotian sent you to find me?

15
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,170
What does this mean?

16
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,680
I don't know who sent you here.

17
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,400
But if you think

18
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,360
this will break up Haotian and me,

19
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,210
you're sadly mistaken.

20
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,040
Also,

21
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
even if everything you said is true,

22
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,000
that's between Haotian and me,

23
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,780
and none of your business.

24
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,530
Are you sure Haotian loves you?

25
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,360
What he actually

26
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,079
truly needs

27
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,240
is just that child.

28
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,250
What you're saying isn't true.

29
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,000
Whether it's true or not,

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,400
you know it in your heart.

31
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,240
I met with him.

32
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,570
Did he tell you about it?

33
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
If one day

34
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,400
Haotian faces problems at work,

35
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,800
what can you do for him?

36
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,640
If one day

37
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,560
Long Corporation faces bankruptcy,

38
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,620
what can you possibly do for him then?

39
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,650
These aren't things

40
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,520
that can be solved just by giving him a child.

41
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,320
Enough.

42
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Stop talking.

43
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,250
I'll go back and ask him about all this.

44
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,399
Will he tell you the truth?

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,480
He didn't even tell you about our meeting.

46
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,140
Not being good enough for the person you love

47
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,120
is like standing under this eave together.

48
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,000
It's raining.

49
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,000
You don't even dare to say to him,

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,240
'let's go together,'

51
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,580
because you don't even have an umbrella.

52
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,500
I really like a phrase from navigation systems:

53
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,290
'Please make a U-turn when possible.'

54
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,890
Are you sure Haotian loves you?

55
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,400
What he actually

56
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,000
truly needs

57
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,480
is just that child.

58
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,360
Whether it's true or not,

59
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
you know it in your heart.

60
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,560
I met with him.

61
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,890
Did he tell you about it?

62
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
If one day

63
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Haotian faces problems at work,

64
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,120
what can you do for him?

65
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,960
If one day

66
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,920
Long Corporation faces bankruptcy,

67
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,980
what can you possibly do for him then?

68
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,720
These aren't things

69
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,780
that can be solved just by giving him a child.

70
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,020
I really like a phrase from navigation systems:

71
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,810
'Please make a U-turn when possible.'

72
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,760
Ruoyun,

73
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,520
you're finally back.

74
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,760
Are you okay?

75
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,480
What's wrong?

76
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,120
Why aren't you saying anything?

77
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,560
Did something upsetting happen?

78
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
You can tell me.

79
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,600
What he

80
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,120
really needs

81
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,520
is just that child,

82
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,240
Long Haotian.

83
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,200
Let's get divorced.

84
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,810
What are you saying?

85
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,840
I know

86
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,290
I'm not good enough for you.

87
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,970
If you have something to say, you could tell me directly,

88
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,900
why did you have to get someone else to pass the message?

89
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,120
Ruoyun.

90
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,780
Did someone say something to you?

91
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
There are some things

92
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,730
he can't do himself,

93
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,180
so I'll do them for him.

94
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,740
If you don't want the baby,

95
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,920
I can raise it myself.

96
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Tomorrow we'll go file for divorce.

97
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,560
Ruoyun.

98
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,360
Calm down.

99
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,400
Tell me everything

100
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,570
about what happened today,

101
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,520
okay?

102
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,560
Did you meet your first love?

103
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,680
Yes.

104
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,040
She did come to see me.

105
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,240
That's why.

106
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,240
She came to see me today,

107
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,560
saying it was your idea

108
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,880
to give me money

109
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,840
to leave you.

110
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,920
Ruoyun.

111
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,520
I never had such thoughts,

112
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,980
and I would never ask her to say those things.

113
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,720
Enough.

114
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,650
You don't need to explain anymore.

115
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
If it wasn't your idea,

116
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,720
why would she come to me?

117
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,330
Why would she say those things?

118
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,520
And why did you go see her?

119
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,720
I know

120
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,200
you never loved me.

121
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,100
You could have just told me directly.

122
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,000
Ruoyun.

123
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,520
Ruoyun.

124
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,040
I truly want to marry you.

125
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,880
I want to build a family with you.

126
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
A warm harbor.

127
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,740
I want us to support each other

128
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,300
and grow old together.

129
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,480
Please believe me, will you?

130
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,400
Okay?

131
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,680
Haotian.

132
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,600
I...

133
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,680
Don't worry.

134
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,540
I'll get to the bottom of this,

135
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,010
and won't let you be hurt again.

136
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,360
Mr. Zhang.

137
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,040
Chairman.

138
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,650
Find Li Yiran's address immediately.

139
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,400
Yes, Chairman,

140
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,000
I'll look into it right away.

141
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,460
Let me handle this.

142
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,560
Huihui.

143
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,920
I miss you.

144
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,960
I miss Nuonuo.

145
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm sorry, Xiaohan.

146
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,440
Only Nuonuo can be with you now.

147
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,720
We originally had two children.

148
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,960
But one died young.

149
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,360
Now only Nuonuo is left.

150
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,320
Her health is poor.

151
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,740
You must take good care of her.

152
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,080
I will.

153
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,920
Meeting you in this life

154
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,720
has been the greatest

155
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,280
happiness of my life.

156
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,880
Don't overthink.

157
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,520
You'll get better,

158
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,520
you definitely will.

159
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,960
I hope in our next life,

160
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,920
we can be husband and wife again.
