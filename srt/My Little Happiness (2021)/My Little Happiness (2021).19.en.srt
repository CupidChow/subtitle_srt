He patted my head.

00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,610
(Previously on My Little Happiness)

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,920
He held my hands, too.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,280
I’ll chase him.

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,350
She kept the first inspiration
of being a lawyer.

35
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,230
I’d like to help her.

36
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,230
So, I’ve decided to offer her a chance.

37
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,120
I’ll wait for you at the end.

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,400
If you pass it,

39
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,760
then be my girlfriend.

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,480
I can’t wait until tomorrow.

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,590
I want to see you today.

42
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,400
Cong Rong and I have known each other
since we were children.

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,560
I’ve been waiting for her for years.

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,760
Now we’re finally together.

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,230
Gentle and unhurried.

46
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,790
Live a quiet life.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,190
She didn’t understand you.

48
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,910
It’s not worth you denying yourself.

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,590
Still cold?

50
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,800
You may feel cold now.

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,000
(Nurse Station)
I liked you.

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,190
Once.

53
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,430
The health of the lawyer
is also very important.

54
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,750
It’s meaningless for you

55
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,710
to waste energy on me.

56
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,240
I don’t want to be involved in anything

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,120
that I’m not interested in.

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,000
Mr. Shangguan?

59
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,310
Take a seat.

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,030
I have nothing

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,190
but respect for him.

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,190
Are you really gonna take Zhang’s case?

63
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,000
To get justice without
any strings attached,

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,080
which is why I want to be a lawyer.

65
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,150
They said that they trust you.

66
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,520
And we want to file a joinder.

67
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,430
I took this case myself.

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,150
No matter what, I must do my best.

69
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,120
You always look

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
so shiny to me.

71
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,080
I’m gonna get you back.

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,800
He… He… He… He’s with me.

73
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,280
He won’t get back with you.

74
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
I came back this time

75
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,960
to hear it from him.

76
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,190
A girl you can’t let go of.

77
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,960
And…

78
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,360
A girl who can’t let go of you.

79
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,120
Don’t I have my right to be hesitant?

80
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,280
Who are you to me?

81
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,680
Am I really

82
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,430
a bad girlfriend?

83
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,470
You’re amazing.

84
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,430
You did your best.

85
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,000
However late it is,

86
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,560
I’ll come home and cook soup for you.
Is that okay with you?

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,910
(Thank you. From Shangguan Yi)
Why would he give you a scarf?

88
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,190
Is it because of the gift,

89
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,280
or the porridge?

90
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,870
Or are you angry

91
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,120
that I often bail on you?

92
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,750
You don’t trust me at all.

93
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,700
Boss,

94
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,810
could it be a mistake?

95
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,810
She isn’t that kind of person.

96
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,370
I know.

97
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,170
Then why are you...?

98
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,450
I’m jealous.

99
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,420
Oh, I see.

100
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,420
That’s your problem.

101
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,630
Work it out yourselves.

102
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,180
Here’s a friendly reminder.

103
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,060
The thesis meeting is in half an hour.

104
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,060
Better hurry up or you’ll be late.

105
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,220
Say that to yourself.

106
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,570
Again you’re throwing me to the wolves?

107
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,790
Boss,

108
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,060
I can’t do it alone.

109
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,620
You again!

110
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,690
Well, she’s mad at me, too.

111
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,340
Good job.

112
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,130
I shouldn’t have asked for leave.

113
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,740
Why bother?

114
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,820
(Mr. Shangguan)

115
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,580
(Mr. Shangguan, I don’t need a day off.)

116
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,780
(I can go back to work now.)

117
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,530
Mr. Shangguan.

118
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,460
Have a seat.

119
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,780
Is a client gonna join us?

120
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,060
I’ll get prepared.

121
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,220
Calm down.

122
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,690
We’re having a meal together.

123
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,060
Just you and me?

124
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,340
I owe you one

125
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,410
and I happen to be free,

126
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,620
so today is the day.

127
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,660
Try it.

128
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,460
I can do it myself.

129
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,090
Let me.

130
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,570
Thanks.

131
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:36,940
What do you think?

132
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,470
Is it good?

133
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,030
Yeah.

134
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,740
Not bad.

135
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,220
Are you expecting a call?

136
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,300
No.

137
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,020
I’m not.

138
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,180
By the way,

139
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,390
may I ask you a few questions

140
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,810
regarding the online loan case?

141
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,250
Shoot.

142
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,500
(Professional Butcher)

143
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,050
Ignore it.

144
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,010
Just a robocall.

145
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,420
Here’s what I think about the case.

146
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,350
There are two things...

147
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,220
Let’s eat.

148
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,210
We can chat after the meal.

149
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,210
Sure.

150
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,540
(Guilty of fraud in financing)

151
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,740

152
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,010
Thanks.

153
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,370
What brings you here?

154
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,180
You came all the way to ask him out?

155
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,180
Mr. Shangguan isn’t in his office.

156
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,460
I’m not here for dating.

157
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,890
It’s something more serious.

158
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,060
Today is my first day of work.

159
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,260
Surprise!

160
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,980
We’re co-workers now.

161
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,370
Let me see.

162
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,940
What?

163
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,420
The file.

164
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,180
Aren’t you putting together
online loan case files?

165
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,580
I heard

166
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,300
you got Mr. Shangguan a case

167
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,370
when he was still sick.

168
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,790
As it’s kinda high-profile,

169
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,010
I’d let that one slide.

170
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,180
Hmm?

171
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,370
Thank you.

243

244
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,810
you and my cousin
haven’t made up, have you?

245

You’re a terrible liar.

250
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,610
Would she cry in front of you?

you’ve never done that, right?

Don’t worry.

259
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,850

260
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,020

On my shift last night,

263
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,810
I told those nurses

264
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,810
ghost stories.

265
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,060
They were so scared that they cuddled.

266
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,860
Do you mean Ghost in the Morgue

267
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,090
and Pen Fairy in the Autopsy Room?

They’re my trump cards.

270
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,380
I made them up.

271
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,180
Why?

272
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,180
It was hot in summer.

273
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,060
AC in the morgue was on full throttle,

274
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,380
so interns were always there,

275
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,230
leaving me no space to read theses.

276
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,700
Then I made up stories

277
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,810
to drive them away.

278
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,380
What’s that look?

279
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,980
Nothing.

280
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,970
It’s just that you’re secretive

281
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,420
and crafty.

282
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,260
It occurred to me that

283
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,980
if you get stuck writing your thesis,

284
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,570
try doing it in the morgue.

285
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,020
It’s cool and quiet there.

286
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,020
No, thanks.

287
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,780
Boss,

288
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,140
get her back quickly.

289
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,690
I hate

290
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,300
being caught in the middle.

291
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,270
If you’re so good
at telling ghost stories,

292
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,690
just try it on her.

293
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,180
Maybe she’ll get scared

294
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,810
and throw herself into your arms.

295
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,210
Girls are afraid of ghosts.

296
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,690
Cong Rong isn’t one of them.

297
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,810
Lawyers

298
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,940
only believe in facts.

299
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,540
Things like ghosts

300
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,210
can’t scare her.

301
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,970
Enough of your PDA.

302
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,650
How is that a relationship crisis?

303
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,210
Show-off!

304
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,570

305
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,060
if there’s nothing else,

306
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,060
I’m off.

307
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,420
Wait.

308
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,380
Your exam is coming, right?

309
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,850
Would you like to know the key points?

310
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,850
Can I?

311
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,210
Yes

312
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,380
if you call your cousin.

313
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,810
Sure.

314
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:27,820
Hello.

315
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,300
It’s me,

316
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,110
Rong.

317
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,060
What’s up?

318
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,790
My birthday is tomorrow.

319
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,850
Let’s eat out together.

320
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,020
I’m busy with my cases.

321
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,780
Isn’t your birthday next week?

322
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,730
What’s with the rush?

323
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,610
It is next week,

324
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,660
(Exam)
but...

325
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,410
But it overlaps my exam.

326
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,420
I’ll be occupied.

327
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,380
Fine.

328
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,810
What do you want to eat?

329
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,730
My treat.

330
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,540
Thanks.

331
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,610
It’s a deal then.

332
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,100
See you tomorrow at noon.

333
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,940
I’ll decide on the menu and text you.

334
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,210
Hang on.

335
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,940
(Cousin)
Is your boss next to you?

336
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,540
No.

337
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,570
Why?

338
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,220
Is it his idea

339
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,210
to move up your birthday?

340
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,300
Of course not!

341
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,990
I’m a manly man.

342
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,300
Couldn’t I pick a day to celebrate it?

343
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,300
Alright.

344
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
See you tomorrow.

345
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:23,820
OK.

346
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,540
See you then.

347
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,140
(Cousin)

348
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,330
Dear cousin-in-law,

349
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,030
may I have

350
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,020
the exam outline with key points?

351
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,970
Will people get sick accordingly?

352
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,850
Study hard.

353
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,730
How could you?

354
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,330
You’re a liar,

355
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,140
a traitor,

356
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,610
a fraud!

357
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,850
You’re untrustworthy!

358
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,570
Do you trust that I can kill you?

359
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,450
Yes.

360
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,850
Zhong Zhen.

361
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,300
It’s just the two of us.

362
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,820
Isn’t this place too fancy?

363
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,050
Not just us.

364
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,540
There will be other trainees

365
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:31,910
and...

366
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,420
That’s a lot.

367
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,260
You got enough money?

368
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,910
Rong,

369
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,420
is that all you care about?

370
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,420
Don’t you wanna know
who else will be here?

371
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,340
It’s your birthday.

372
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,380
You can invite anyone you like.

373
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,140
My boss will come, too.

374
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,300
Yeah, so?

375
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,460
What does that have to do with me?

376
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,570
What’s that attitude?

377
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,210
Aren’t you two seeing each other?

378
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,090
Even if we are,

379
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,450
it doesn’t mean anything.

380
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,730
Relationships can be on and off.

381
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,260
We don’t have to be together forever.

382
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,540
If not me,

383
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,490
who else would you rather be with?

384
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,030
Hello, Dr. Wen.

385
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,090
Dr. Wen... You said?

386
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,220
Zhong Zhen,

387
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,180
your friends are outside.

388
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,060
Go get them.

389
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,910
Zhong Zhen,

390
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,820
happy birthday!

391
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,230
Happy birthday!

392
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,450
Happy birthday!

393
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,060
Thank you. Thanks.

394
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,540
Hello, Dr. Wen,

395
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,220
Mrs. Wen.

396
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,090
Dr. Wen.

397
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,870
Mrs. Wen.

398
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,490
Mrs. Wen.

399
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,700
Call me Cong Rong

400
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,180
or Rong as Zhong Zhen does.

401
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,420
Make yourselves comfortable.

402
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:28,940
Grab a seat.

403
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,230
Yeah.

404
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,970
Have a seat.

405
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,660
Zhong Zhen,

406
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,490
sit here.

407
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,730
Me?

408
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,810
Is there a problem?

409
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,690
No.

410
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,850
What would you like to eat?

411
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,970
Rong,

412
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,390
did you pick up this hazelnut cake?

413
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,690
It’s my boss’s favorite.

414
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,790
Pardon?

415
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,610
I didn’t get that.

416
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,300
I said hazelnut cake is my favorite.

417
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,140
Thanks.

418
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,900
You’re welcome.

419
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:04,990
Hello.

420
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,020
Would you like to order now?

421
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,450
Yes, sure.

422
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,380
Sautéed sliced pork liver.

423
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,210
My cousin said it’s good.

424
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,260
Make it ten.

425
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,260
Boss,

426
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,810
that’s too much.

427
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,380
One is enough.

428
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,570
Doesn’t she like it?

429
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,340
She can have as much as she wants.

430
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,450
Liver is good for the eyes.

431
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,210
Eat more to see things clearly.

432
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,410
Thanks.

433
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,980
I’d like ten spicy hearts and lungs.

434
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,910
For those who’re heartless,

435
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,620
those foods are just what they need.

436
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,490
Rong,

437
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,300
that’s way too much

438
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,290
for us to eat.

439
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,770
Take the leftovers to go.

440
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,820
So sautéed sliced pork liver

441
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,940
and spicy hearts and lungs, ten of each.

442
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,190
Anything else?

443
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,470
That’ll be all.

444
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,180
That’ll be all.

445
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,250
Why bother celebrating my birthday?

446
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,420
I shouldn’t have been born.

447
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,860
Excuse me.

448
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,730
Gotta take this.

449
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,380
Hello.

450
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
Mr. Shangguan.

451
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,030
OK.

452
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,380
I’m on my way to the court.

453
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,180
Yeah.

454
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,380
Sorry,

455
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,940
duty calls. Gotta run.

456
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,290
Wait.

457
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,530
This meal is on me.

458
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,690
Rong... Rong.

459
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,010
Boss,

460
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:23,990
should I get her back?

461
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,620
Forget it.

462
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,420
Let’s eat without her.

463
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,730
Yes, Boss?

464
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Call Cong Rong

465
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,970
and ask her where she is.

466
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,190
What did she say?

467
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,990
Boss, she said

468
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,580
she’d be staying at a hotel
with Chengcheng.

469
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,060
A hotel?

470
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,970
Yeah.

471
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,450
She wouldn’t come back tonight?

472
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,380
I suppose.

473
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
Also, they’re having a girls’ night

474
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,210
and don’t wanna be disturbed.

475
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,530
I’m hanging up.

476
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,620
She doesn’t mean you.

477
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,050
She doesn’t want me to disturb her.

478
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,140
Are you a lawyer or a slave?

479
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,790
I thought you asked me

480
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,180
to hang out with you,

481
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,730
not to sit here watching you work.

482
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,230
Entertain yourself first.

483
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,180
I’m almost done.

484
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,380
Then I’ll give you a full body massage.

485
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,420
Hello.

486
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,380
It’s me, Wen Shaoqing.

487
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,900
Is Cong Rong there?

488
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,580
Wen...

489
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,290
Shower, shower.

490
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,230
She’s in the shower

491
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,750
and can’t answer the phone.

492
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,380
That’s fine.

493
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,340
I’ll hold.

494
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,690
Hello.

495
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,180
What’s up?

496
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,010
You left in a rush this morning.

497
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,970
Is there anything wrong?

498
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,010
No.

499
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,690
I left for the court to register a case.

500
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,820
Is there anything else?

501
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,860
Cong Rong.

502
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,140
Yeah?

503
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:47,900
Never mind.

504
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,420
I’m glad everything is fine.

505
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,820
Get some sleep.

506
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,450
We can talk things out

507
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,530
tomorrow night once you get back.

508
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,750
We’ll see.

509
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,490
My schedule is tight.

510
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,380
No wonder you got a hotel room for us.

511
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,690
You two had a fight?

512
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,450
What’s this?

513
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,450
Did she leave it

514
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,580
when she stayed here after you hit her?

515
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,860
What’s the use of having it now?

516
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,860
She isn’t here.

517
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,180
I don’t even get to apologize to her.

518
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,580
Almost identical to the owner.

519
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,970
That’s it?

520
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,290
What more do you want?

521
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,580
I mean,

522
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,290
could he be jealous?

523
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,050
He’s getting on my nerves on purpose.

524
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,180
Check his Moments.

525
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,100
Does he care about me at all?

526
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,340
There’s nothing other than theses

527
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,530
and drugs.

528
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,050
Febuxostat.

529
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,340
Is that also a drug?

530
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,580
Febuxostat.

531
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,820
Its homophone in Chinese means

532
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,140
“I’m not saying I don’t miss her”.

533
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,970
Clearly, he implies that he misses you.

534
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,030
I hate seeing myself like this.

535
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,140
That I get sensitive

536
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:49,100
when it comes to him.

537
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,490
I wasn’t like this before.

538
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,530
I know

539
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,220
he mistook me and Mr. Shangguan

540
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,660
and I could explain it to him.

541
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,010
But you see how childish he is!

542
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,250
He’s trying to piss me off.

543
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,820
So I’d rather say nothing.

544
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,290
Enough!

545
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,730
If you ask me,

546
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,010
both of you are childish.

547
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,060
But, sweetie,

548
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,490
relationships

549
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,490
aren’t lawsuits.

550
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,420
You can be spoiled,

551
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,380
cute,

552
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,450
sensitive

553
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,490
and needy.

554
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,860
All that is common.

555
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,530
Oh.

556
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,100
Love does

557
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,690
change you to someone you are not.

558
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,470
Don’t you

559
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,900
want him to comfort you?

560
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,620
Not at all!

561
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,030
I don’t think

562
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,980
Dr. Wen is being jealous for no reason.

563
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,970
Do you know

564
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,690
what it means

565
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,250
when a man gives a woman a scarf?

566
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,380
That means he’s scarfing you up

567
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,450
for the rest of his life.

568
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,210
Knock it off.

569
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,210
Back to business.

570
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,420
There’s one problem.

571
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,180
Shangguan Yi didn’t make it clear

572
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,860
and he’s your boss.

573
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,230
Why don’t you think up a way

574
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,970
to return the scarf?

575
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,230
When the time is right,

576
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,380
let him know
you already have a boyfriend.

577
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,940
Good idea.

578
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,270
Let me see

579
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,690
how to return it.

580
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,860
(East Gate)

581
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,050
Can’t you say something nice to me?

582
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,710
Xiong Jingjing,

583
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,970
why didn’t you make a sound?

584
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,430
You look hot-tempered.

585
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,940
Is it about your relationship?

586
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,210
Of course not!

587
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,770
Stop denying it.

588
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,230
We all saw

589
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,770
your post yesterday.

590
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,970
You still haven’t patched things up?

591
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,380
I can give you a few tips.

592
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,010
You?

593
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,470
Do you have a boyfriend?

594
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,940
You do and look what happened!

595
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,940
You know what?

596
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,860
If I’m in love with someone,

597
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,010
he will eventually be mine.

598
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,820
Mr. Shangguan.

599
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,450
Morning, Mr. Shangguan.

600
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,050
Mind your own business.

601
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,010
Stop worrying about me.

602
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,010
Come in.

603
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,940
Mr. Shangguan,

604
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,820
these are the files I put together

605
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,180
for Cong Rong about online loan cases.

606
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,010
Let me know if there’s anything missing.

607
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,820
(Students’ Loans)

608
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:50,900
Good.

609
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,010
They’re detailed.

610
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,340
Anything else?

611
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,770
Mr. Shangguan, don’t get me wrong.

612
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,380
I’m still single.

613
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,180
But Cong Rong seemed to have argued
with her boyfriend.

614
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,140
I was simply teasing her just now.

615
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,900
She has a boyfriend?

616
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,730
Yes.

617
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,700
You don’t know?

618
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,620
It’s that doctor at Yun Ji hospital.

619
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,220
I see.

620
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,050
You may leave.

621
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,970
Yes.

622
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,030
What...? What are you doing here?

623
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,900
Where’s Wen Shaoqing?

624
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,460
He pricked his hand during surgery,

625
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,540
so he’s kept in quarantine

626
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,230
in case of infection.

627
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,950
Quarantine?

628
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,940
Is it serious?

629
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,900
I’m not sure.

630
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,380
He asked me to take care of his dog.

631
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,580
Are you free tonight?

632
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,770
Can you feed it?

633
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,300
One of my friends back in college

634
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,250
is getting married.

635
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,190
His bachelor party is tonight

636
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,250
and he insists that I come over.

637
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,220
I might be back late.

638
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,900
No worries.

639
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,050
I’ll feed it

640
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,220
to spare you the trip.

641
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,790
OK.

642
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,530
Thanks.

643
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,210
One more thing.

644
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,770
Is it about Zhou Chengcheng?

645
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,050
She hasn’t been in the store

646
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,140
and the storage room is sealed.

647
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,140
Is she OK?

648
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,380
What’s she doing lately?

649
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,420
She’s working with a friend’s hotel

650
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,730
on outdoor parties.

651
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,100
and helping with the barbecue.

652
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,970
Do you need to see her?

653
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,140
No, no.

654
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,190
I just need to know she’s fine.

655
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,940
Bye.

656
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,540
You know Zhou Chengcheng

657
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,100
couldn’t keep anything to herself,

658
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,140
but not this time.

659
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,250
Quarantine?

660
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,290
Come in.

661
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,100
Rong.

662
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,050
Zhong Zhen,

663
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,210
how come your boss is in quarantine?

664
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,580
Is he OK?

665
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,620
He didn’t know the patient carries

666
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,250
chronic virus until the surgery is done.

667
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,380
He has been vaccinated against it.

668
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,100
But it takes time to know

669
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,730
if he’s infected.

670
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,580
I understand.

671
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,620
Didn’t you always brag about his skills?

672
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,140
How did he get pricked?

673
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,290
Rong,

674
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,230
doctors can barely
keep their hands steady

675
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,770
after working for over ten hours.

676
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,820
It’s common to get pricked or cut.

677
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,340
Not to mention...

678
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,490
What?

679
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,050
Not to mention he’s in a bad mood.

680
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,620
So...

681
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,530
You know the cause.

682
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,530
I’m hanging up.

683
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,060
(Bachelor Party)

684
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,450
Chengcheng.

685
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,230
My place has just opened.

686
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,190
Everything is still a mess.

687
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,380
Thanks for helping me out.

688
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,470
Don’t mention it.

689
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,380
We’re friends.

690
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,900
What’s the event?

691
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,420
A bachelor party.

692
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,380
They’re gonna drink most of the time.

693
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,670
You don’t need to prepare too much.

694
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,340
OK.

695
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,060
I gotta go.

696
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,820
Go ahead.

697
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,180
You gotta be kidding me!

698
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,690
He’s here, too?

699
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,940
I knew it!

700
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,730
It couldn’t be a coincidence.

701
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,890
I’m sorry. My bad.

702
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,620
I... I... I didn’t mean to...

703
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,340
It’s me.

704
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,530
Have you been avoiding me?

705
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,580
No.

706
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,010
Why would I?

707
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,210
I’ve forgotten about that day.

708
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,380
Wen Rang.

709
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,710
There you are.

710
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,710
Come here.

711
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,180
Drink with us.

712
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,100
Guys,

713
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,180
look who’s here!

714
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,580
Here comes the lady killer!

715
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,710
Wen Rang, right?

716
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,140
It’s been a while.

717
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,180
Long time no see.

718
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,140
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

719
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,210
This is my last night as a bachelor.

720
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,820
After the wedding,

721
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,990
I’ll be kept on a short leash

722
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,290
without any freedom.

723
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,460
If your fiancée hears that,

724
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,770
she’ll take away your bank cards.

725
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,740
Only Wen Rang is still single

726
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,450
among us, right?

727
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,210
Back in college,

728
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,820
when you settled down
with your girlfriend,

729
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,580
we were still single.

730
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,470
He already moved in with her.

731
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,340
I know.

732
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,970
How come you guys broke up?

733
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,190
I heard

734
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,180
she’s back

735
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,290
and she’s asked about you.

736
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,300
Let’s drink.

737
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,900
Stop talking and start drinking.

738
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:16,580
Cheers!

739
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,100
Isn’t that Jiang Yao?

740
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,730
Hi.

741
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,860
It’s been a while.

742
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,220
I’ve cut my hair short.

743
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,860
I was with the bride

744
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,220
and I thought I should come over

745
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,530
and drink with you guys.

746
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,790
Congratulations!

747
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,380
Thanks.

748
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,790
Where are you going?

749
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,490
What’s wrong?

750
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,690
Let’s drink.

751
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,940
For old times’ sake.

752
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,620
Yeah.

753
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,380
Cheers!

754
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,340
Drink.

755
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,050
Jiang Yao,

756
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,970
how’s the foreign land treating you?

757
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,210
I heard you’re doing fantastic.

758
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,750
I miss the old days

759
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,380
when you guys had your own band.

760
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,580
Why don’t you...?

761
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,900
What’s on your mind?

762
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,490
Didn’t you hear our heartfelt words?

763
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,380
“Heartfelt words” means
to feel them with hearts.

764
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,380
How could I hear them?

765
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,980
They want us to perform together

766
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,380
just like we did at the college.

767
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,530
-That’s right.
-That’s right.

768
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,900
I’ll sing to your instrument.

769
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,580
I no longer play it.

770
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,470
I haven’t done it for ages.

771
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,100
I’m rusty.

772
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,050
You two make a perfect couple.

773
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,140
We’ve finally gotten together.

774
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,270
You can’t leave without playing a song.

775
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,140
I agree.

776
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,710
Do it for us.

777
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,100
Play it.

778
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,990
-Don’t be a buzzkill.
-Please.

779
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,430
Go ahead.

780
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,030
Go. Come with me.

781
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,790
Come on.

782
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,340
Let’s go.

783
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:32,940
Do it!

784
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,180
Guys,

785
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,790
guys,

786
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,820
a big hand, please!

787
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,900
Do it!

788
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,420
Do it!

789
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,380
Do it!

790
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,740
Do it!

791
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,090
Do it!

792
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,230
Thank you, guys.

793
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:47,980
Do it!

794
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,670
Do it!

795
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,300
Thanks.

796
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,940
This isn’t a good idea.

797
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:56,670
Come on!

798
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,130

807

(Rang Kai Bookstore)
without money.

814
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
All I do was writing lousy poems

815
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,490
and cheap songs.

816
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,860
Why would she waste time on me?

817
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,830

What do you see in that mule Wen Rang?

820
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,900
He looks arrogant

821
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,860
but he cares about others.

822
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,330
He seems to
keep a distance from everyone,

823
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,420
but no one is more warmhearted than him.

Why don’t you be honest with her?

You can’t

tell you what you want to hear.

840
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,090
You put down bait

841
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,530
to tempt me to rise to it.

842
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,490
You bought my book
and put your name on it

843

to draw me to you.

844

You played me like a fool

845
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,730
to satisfy your ego.

846
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,160
You could choose not to come,

847
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,490
but you came anyway.

848
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,640
That shows you still love me.

849
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,000

Seven years ago,

857
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,570
I made a mistake.

858
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,410
Now,

859
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,380
I wish to redeem myself.

860
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,530

861
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,900

864
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,170
I was wrong.

865

Jiang Yao,

866
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,780

00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,940
It’s melted

869
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,740
over the years.

870
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,050
But it matters to me.

871
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,610
I was wrong.

872
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,170
I admit that, OK?

873
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,970
I shouldn’t have left
without telling you.

874
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,460
I was young

875
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,380
and ignorant.

876
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,860
I couldn’t sleep night after night.

877
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,780
Then I could only say to myself,

878
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,230
“Don’t regret it.

879
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,260
You can’t regret it”.

880
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,420
But I do.

881
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,220
Jiang Yao,

882
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,970
you’re successful

883
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,220
as you wished.

884
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,550
You should be happy.

885
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,450
I’m not.

886
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,900
I don’t want to be successful.

887
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,940
I shouldn’t have given you up.

888
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:31,570
Wen Rang,

889
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,860
could you forgive me?

890
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,780
Let’s drink together.

891
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,700
Cheers!

892
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,220
Cheers!

893
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,820
I wish you a happy marriage

894
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,260
and all of you everlasting friendship!

895
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,380
Cheers!

896
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,610
Zhou Chengcheng!
