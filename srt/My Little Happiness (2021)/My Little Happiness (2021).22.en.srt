(Wen Shaoqing)

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,150
Are you busy now?

33
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,070
Yes.

34
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,860
Save it.

35
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,990
What’s there for you to be busy with?

36
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,430
Don’t you want to try the cakes I made?

37
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,000
Take it as an obligation
of being an uncle.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Save me from being boring.

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,510
Not available.

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,030
You sound cold.

41
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,950
What is it?

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,990
Anything that makes you unhappy?

43
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,730
Tell me.

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,330
I love gossip.

45
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,240
Nothing!

46
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,410
So cranky.

47
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,610
He’s been dumped?

48
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,200
How is those kids’

49
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,540
craftsmanship?

50
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,790
Without my supervision,

51
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,790
it must’ve retrogressed.

52
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,550
Boss.

53
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,310
What is it?

54
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,280
Are you off work?

55
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,030
Not yet.

56
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,010
Just right.

57
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,130
Tell me

58
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,930
the clinical symptoms of
acute epidural hematoma.

59
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,290
Usually accompanied by
temporal bone fracture,

60
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,060
disturbance of consciousness,
and increased intracranial pressure.

61
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,850
Boss, aren’t you on a break?

62
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,020
Why are you suddenly testing me?

63
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,410
Zhong Zhen,

64
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:24,970
what are you doing?

65
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,560
Hurry!

66
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,290
I’ve been on break for only a few days.

67
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,460
But you guys are slacking off, right?

68
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,170
I’m busy here.

69
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:30,770
Talk later.

70
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,610
I’ll hang up.

71
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,320
You must be lying.

72
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,480
I’ll teach you a lesson when I’m back.

73
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,020
(Zhong Zhen)

74
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,480
Now you’ve realized your mistake.

75
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,290
What is it?

76
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,930
Boss?

77
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,290
Why is that you?

78
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,700
It’s all because
you called me for nothing earlier.

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
I made the wrong call.

80
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,680
I’ll hang up.

81
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,560
Wait a sec.

82
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,000
Repeat what you just said to me.

83
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,130
Sorry, Boss.

84
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,330
It’s just we’re so occupied right now.

85
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,400
There was a chain collision
on the highway.

86
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,610
The injured have all been sent here.

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,470
I gotta go now.

88
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,680
I must find Dr. Chen immediately.

89
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,480
Okay.

90
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,360
Fine.

91
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,360
You have work to do.

92
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,440
So do I.

93
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,970
Sleeping so early?

94
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,560
Zhong Zhen.

95
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,520
Rong,

96
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,970
what’s Boss doing now?

97
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,770
You’re asking me?

98
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,850
Tell me, have you made mistakes

99
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,760
while your Boss is on a break?

100
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,850
How come? I don’t want to be killed.

101
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,260
I called you to warn you that

102
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,090
you’ve got to care more about
your strange boyfriend.

103
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,170
What’s wrong with him?

104
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,530
I think he acts a little strange.

105
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,680
You need to lead him to a brighter road.

106
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,800
Make it clear.

107
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,520
Rong,

108
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,800
according to my observation these days,

109
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,460
I think my poor and lonely Boss

110
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,380
is really becoming more and more

111
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,610
like a weirdo.

112
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,530
You have to save him!

113
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,140
Okay.

114
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,850
I get it.

115
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,650
I’ll hang up.

116
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,820
Hello, Mom?

117
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,810
Dear, your Dad Jiang
wants to meet Shaoqing.

118
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,900
I told you I’ve been busy.

119
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,580
I can’t go back.

120
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,290
Save it.

121
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,970
If you don’t come back,
he and I will go to you.

122
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,130
Okay!

123
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,020
I’ll go back in a few days.

124
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,900
Don’t play tricks.
Take Shaoqing with you.

125
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,820
Okay, okay.

126
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,880
I will take him with me.

127
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,210
I’ll hang up.

128
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,440
You are back.

129
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,480
Remember we agreed to go for an outing?

130
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,100
I’ve figured out the destination.

131
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,020
(Domestic Departure Information)

132
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,050
Cong Rong.

133
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,730
Is the destination your...?

134
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,440
Yeah.

135
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,650
Right guess.

136
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,850
My home.

137
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,210
Let me show you

138
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,920
our family photos.

139
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,090
This was taken when I was at college.

140
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,730
This one is my favorite.

141
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,880
Look, the three of us all have
the same expression.

142
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,480
This is a picture
of my parents on their trip.

143
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,500
Mom loves travelling.

144
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,850
So, Dad Jiang travels with her.

145
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,210
The two of you seem to get along well.

146
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:14,970
That’s right.

147
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,360
Dad Jiang treats me
just as his natural child.

148
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,820
Scolds me when I do wrong.

149
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,730
Praises me when I do right.

150
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,290
There’s no barrier between us.

151
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,880
Knowing that you were a naughty kid,

152
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,650
I didn’t expect that
you accepted him so smoothly.

153
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,010
Of course not.

154
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,650
I excluded him a lot at first.

155
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,970
Guess what I used to do to him?

156
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,720
I spat out watermelon seeds at him.

157
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,560
He was unwilling to be outdone.

158
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,130
So, he fought back in the same way.

159
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,960
But every time he would
win me by one more seed.

160
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,680
Later, melon vines grew out
in the flowerpot.

161
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,340
Your mom didn’t scold you?

162
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,250
She did.

163
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,010
I don’t know when exactly but gradually,

164
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,010
Dad Jiang and I were no longer
hostile to each other.

165
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,010
We became concerned about each other.

166
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,530
Are you happy?

167
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,650
Yes,

168
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,800
I am.

169
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,200
Dad Jiang takes infinite care of my mom.

170
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,080
They live very happily.

171
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,220
I told you,

172
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,680
it’s only a casual dinner.

173
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,490
If I knew you would buy so many gifts,

174
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,650
I should’ve told you about it
till we get to the door.

175
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,530
This is my first formal visit.

176
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,920
Of course I must prepare
as many gifts as possible.

177
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,370
What if my father-in-law
considered me inconsiderate

178
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,410
and didn’t want to marry you to me?

179
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,650
Father-in-law?

180
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,530
Don’t call him that when you meet.

181
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,200
So, your family live inside the school.

182
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,260
Dad Jiang is a professor of philosophy.

183
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,840
Of course we live inside the school.

184
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,650
We are already near your home.

185
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,920
We don’t need to hurry.

186
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,680
Show me around your Alma Mater.

187
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,500
I’m quite curious of
your school environment.

188
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
No. You’re curious of what happened here

189
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,840
when you and I
were separated, aren’t you?

190
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:52,740
Let’s go.

191
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,340
I’ll take you to a place.

192
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:53,920
Okay.

193
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,050
That is the administrative building.

194
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,380
Every time I went there,

195
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,050
the security
would give me a candy.

196
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,440
That building

197
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,490
is the gym.

198
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,730
It’s super huge.

199
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,960
There’s even a pool in it.

200
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,860
Are these the girls’ dormitories?

201
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,440
Yep.

202
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,010
Which room did you live in?

203
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,370
That one.

204
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,440
But my roommates and I were not close.

205
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,320
My home is in the school, you know.

206
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,290
I spent much time at home.

207
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,130
Is that it?

208
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,410
But I guess there must be other reasons.

209
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,800
It’s just I received more love letters.

210
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,440
And?

211
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,380
And... Sometimes, someone
gave me meals,

212
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,320
tea,

213
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,290
gifts.

214
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,200
And?

215
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,010
And...

216
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,320
Maybe someone liked to block my way.

217
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,440
I understand that.

218
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,380
I also had that kind of trouble.

219
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,650
Headache.

220
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,530
-Then how many love letters?
-Then how many love letters?

221
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:54,920
Not many.

222
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,200
So-so.

223
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,170
Did you take them?

224
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,200
What do you think?

225
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,250
Wait for me!

226
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,200
Wait for me.

227
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,200
Are you still in touch
with some of those people?

228
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,900
What about you?

229
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,290
I wasn’t even in touch with
any of them ever.

230
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,010
I didn’t even take
any of the letters ever.

231
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,560
Dad Jiang?

232
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,250
Dad Jiang is over there.

233
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,720
Dad Jiang,

234
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,130
what are you doing?

235
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,320
You are back.

236
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,200
This must be Shaoqing.

237
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,920
Really handsome.

238
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,170
Even handsomer
than the one on the photo.

239
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:39,960
Nice to meet you, Uncle.

240
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,650
You look even younger
than the one on the photo.

241
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,650
That’s sweet.

242
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,900
No wonder her mom

243
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,560
always speaks highly of you.

244
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,490
Cong Rong always tells me
how much she admires you.

245
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,730
I can even recite all your

246
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,860
heroic deeds backwards fluently.

247
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,570
Heroic deeds? No.

248
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,720
You’re flattering me.

249
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,490
When will you stop
flattering each other?

250
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,290
Dad Jiang,

251
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,440
you even ignored me
after you met him.

252
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,800
We often meet,

253
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,530
don’t we?

254
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,410
But this is my first time
to meet my son-in-law.

255
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,290
-We have a lot to talk.
-Yeah.

256
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,720
I agree with you, my father-in-law.

257
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,920
Dad Jiang.

258
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,840
What were you busy with?

259
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,800
When your mom and I married, I buried
two jars of Chinese liquor here.

260
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,340
Today, Shaoqing came.

261
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,410
I want to dig out one jar,

262
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,130
and drink with him at dinner.

263
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,440
But I couldn’t find it.

264
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,050
Buried under this tree or that tree?

265
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,730
Well, I... I’ll continue.

266
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,680
Wait for me.

267
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,560
Why did you bury the liquor
under a tree?

268
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,370
These are osmanthus trees.

269
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,440
So?

270
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,960
The liquor buried under
an osmanthus tree must be Nyu Er Hong.

271
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,650
In ancient China,
a father brew some Chinese liquor

272
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,530
when his daughter
was entering the marriageable age.

273
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,210
When his daughter was getting married,

274
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,570
he dug out the liquor underground

275
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,500
to treat the guests.

276
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,440
The taste was extraordinary.

277
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,680
Your father is digging it out,

278
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,890
which means his daughter
is going to get married.

279
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,530
Don’t gloat only because

280
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,530
he called you son-in-law.

281
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,840
I haven’t said yes.

282
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,250
You will soon.

283
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,290
I found it! I found it!

284
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,890
Great! I found it.

285
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,400
I found it. I found it.

286
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,080
No rush.

287
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,320
Take a look.

288
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,490
This liquor is amazing.

289
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,210
One jar of it will do for today.

290
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,290
The other jar of it

291
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,290
will be drunk at a more important event.

292
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,290
Let’s go.

293
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:15,770
Let’s go home for dinner.

294
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,560
Let’s go home for dinner.

295
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,680
Let’s have a good drink tonight.

296
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,450
Look at Shaoqing’s
cutting and slicing skill.

297
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,220
Impressive.

298
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,900
You’re flattering me.

299
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,960
Skill comes from practice.

300
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,140
I just use knives
more often than others.

301
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,380
I get too familiar with them.

302
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,210
That’s right.

303
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,490
He’s a professional butcher.

304
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,970
He’s only good at using knives.

305
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,860
How could you say that?

306
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,800
Impolite.

307
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,900
What did I tell you?

308
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,680
You can find no one

309
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,220
that has better
cutting and slicing skills than him.

310
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,930
I thought

311
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,410
you were the luckiest woman
for marrying me.

312
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,370
But check this.

313
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,290
Well,

314
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,290
our daughter

315
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,490
is even luckier than you.

316
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,810
Do you think we should be jealous

317
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,080
or relieved?

318
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,490
Relieved, of course.

319
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,130
However, I still think

320
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,320
my husband is the best man in the world.

321
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,280
Of course!

322
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,320
Be restrained, okay?

323
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,900
This sweet couple always
ignore my feelings.

324
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,650
I’m so miserable.

325
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,800
We’re setting a good example for you.

326
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,840
Come on, sit, sit.

327
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,370
I’ll do it.

328
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,290
Food coming.

329
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,920
Uncle, Aunt,

330
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,250
have a check.

331
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,860
Are you satisfied with
Cong Rong’s daily meal standard?

332
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,170
Can’t be more satisfied!

333
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,050
Right?

334
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,450
Come on.

335
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,440
Sit, sit.

336
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,280
Now I see,

337
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,260
these two kids are trying to
make us jealous, right?

338
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,340
Considering your performance today,

339
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,680
I’ll give you a score of 120!

340
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,530
Hurry, let’s eat.

341
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,220
I’m starving.

342
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,570
Okay, okay.

343
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,450
Let’s eat.

344
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,250
Wait!

345
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,170
Wait a sec.

346
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,290
Shaoqing.

347
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:41,960
Here.

348
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,770
From now on, this pair of chopsticks

349
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,770
belongs to you.

350
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,440
Let’s welcome our new family member.

351
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,010
Thanks, Uncle, Aunt.

352
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,170
What are you waiting for?

353
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:50,570
Come on, applaud!

354
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,170
Welcome, welcome!

355
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,570
All right.

356
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,290
Sit, sit.

357
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,600
Come on.

358
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,290
Guys, cheers.

359
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,920
Cheers.

360
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,600
Hey, you.

361
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,380
Cheers!

362
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

363
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,200
Shaoqing, a good name,

364
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,930
more importantly, a good person.

365
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,380
He’s not only humble and gentle,

366
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,650
but also talented in cooking.

367
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,890
You’ve seen countless people,

368
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,340
but you’re wrong
about a person this time.

369
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,170
Why?

370
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,600
He’s not humble or gentle.

371
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,100
He’s tactful and sharp-tongued.

372
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,090
A man

373
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,340
needs not only wisdom

374
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,320
but also tactics

375
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,370
to protect the one he loves.

376
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,410
I think Shaoqing

377
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,260
can totally handle it.

378
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,690
Yes, that’s right.

379
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,440
I agree.

380
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,530
Your dad is the same kind.

381
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,600
Of course.

382
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Thanks for your appreciation,
Uncle, Aunt.

383
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,810
Let’s have a toast.

384
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,410
A toast to you two.

385
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:32,860
Cheers.

386
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,440
Okay, okay.

387
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,980
Cheers.

388
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,010
We have confidence in you.

389
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,570
Come on.

390
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,140
Another drink.

391
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,130
Fill it up. Come on.

392
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,220
Dad,

393
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,860
don’t drink too much.

394
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,860
You still have work to do tomorrow.

395
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,290
That’s no big deal.

396
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,290
Are you...? Protecting me

397
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,890
or him?

398
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,140
A man

399
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,290
can’t drink too little.

400
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,290
What’s big deal of getting drunk?

401
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,980
The way a man drinks
reflects his character.

402
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,920
Right?

403
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,570
Shaoqing is a good man.

404
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,020
Huh?

405
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,970
Of course!

406
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,260
Look how happy your dad is.

407
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:58,770
Cheers.

408
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,600
A toast on his behalf!

409
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,920
That’s better.

410
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,410
Let me fill your cup up.

411
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,290
Your cup.

412
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,170
Let me fill it up.

413
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,200
Dad!

414
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,130
Mom!

415
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,770
What?

416
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,440
He’s fine.

417
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:13,860
He can still drink.

418
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,290
Be good.

419
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,490
Be good, dear.

420
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,160
Look how happy your dad is.

421
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,840
Right?

422
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,200
Shaoqing,

423
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,680
do you know why I brew the Nyu Er Hong?

424
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,410
I’m from Shaoxing,
that liquor’s hometown.

425
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,080
As the saying goes in Shaoxing,

426
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,800
“The liquor brewed by using
the water from the local lake

427
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,960
can even be smelled
by people from another town.”

428
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,330
When my younger sister was born,

429
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,330
my father brewed a few jars
of Nyu Er Hong.

430
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,170
I was too young

431
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,800
to understand my father.

432
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,320
Until later, Rong came into my life,

433
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,320
I understood him.

434
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,200
You know her life experience, right?

435
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,130
I know.

436
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,290
For these years,

437
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,010
we didn’t give birth to another child.

438
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,840
Because in our heart,

439
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,690
Rong is our only beloved daughter.

440
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:13,930
So,

441
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,690
I wouldn’t allow you to hurt her.

442
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,840
Actually, the bond between me and her

443
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,010
began much earlier
than Aunt and you know.

444
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,210
Holding her hand again

445
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,560
is really a blessing for me.

446
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,730
After so many years,

447
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,010
we met again.

448
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,050
I will never hurt her.

449
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,690
Being by her side

450
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,010
is happy, right?

451
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:48,930
Yeah.

452
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,730
It’s hard to describe,

453
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,970
but I feel each day
is given a different meaning.

454
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,230
Cong Rong is like...

455
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,760
A clock pendulum.

456
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,210
Every day, she takes me
with her, swinging.

457
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,360
Every second is different.

458
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,490
Uncle,

459
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,930
it feels amazing.

460
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,730
I know, I know.

461
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,720
I was young once.
I’ve been through this.

462
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,360
Couldn’t help loving.

463
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,930
Still the same now.

464
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,800
If I may,

465
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,970
I want to hold her hand forever,

466
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,450
never letting go.

467
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,530
Uncle.

468
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,930
I don’t know what could happen
in the future,

469
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,080
but please trust me,

470
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,970
Cong Rong is the first priority
of my life.

471
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,970
I hope you can feel at ease
letting her be with me.

472
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,160
I will protect her well.

473
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,640
You are her choice.

474
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,880
I respect her choice.

475
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,160
As parents, we don’t want much.

476
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,730
We only want you

477
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,490
to be happy.

478
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,120
I’ll take a walk,

479
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,360
and enjoy the breeze.

480
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,140
Careful.

481
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,930
Sure.

482
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,820
How could my dad

483
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,880
let you drink so much?

484
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,320
Are you clear-headed?

485
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,450
Yes!

486
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,930
Careful.

487
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,600
Careful.

488
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,930
Lift your feet.

489
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,970
You drank too much.

490
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,210
I want to sleep there.

491
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,160
You passed the guest room.

492
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,930
Wait, this is my bedroom.

493
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,290
You’d better go sleep in the guest room.

494
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,970
My parents will come back soon.

495
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,560
Why are you laughing?

496
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,600
What are you afraid of?

497
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,730
Drunkenness is medically called
alcoholic intoxication,

498
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,930
which can cause
nervous system abnormalities

499
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,640
and blood circulation disturbance.

500
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,490
And loss of ability to commit crimes.

501
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,320
I’m really drunk.

502
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,320
That’s yellow rice wine.

503
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,010
It has a strong delayed effect.

504
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,840
I told you to drink less.

505
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,450
He was testing his son-in-law’s
drinking capacity.

506
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,530
I had to drink.

00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,200

♪Only if I’m with you♪

518
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,540
Let’s go check Shaoqing

519
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,640
to see if he’s recovered from the drink.

520
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,780
His drinking capacity is not bad.

521
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,450
It’s your fault.

522
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,010
Now we can’t explain it.

523
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,730
Calm down.

524
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,880
I need your collaboration.

525
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,820
Where are the kids?

526
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,530
I also wanna know.

527
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,770
You are back, Uncle, Aunt.

528
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,130
Well, Cong Rong felt uncomfortable.

529
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,160
So, I brought her here to take a rest.

530
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,820
Something must be wrong
with your liquor.

531
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,850
Let me see.

532
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,440
Nothing can be wrong with my liquor.

533
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,100
Shaoqing,

534
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,010
are you all right?

535
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,860
I also have a headache.

536
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,530
Why is it red here?

537
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,530
Are you allergic to the liquor?

538
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,620
Yes, yes, yes.

539
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,370
Yeah.

540
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,690
That... That sounds right.

541
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,690
Sounds right.

542
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,380
Yes, yes, yes.

543
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,290
She’s allergic.

544
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,930
I’ll get you some water then.

545
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,210
Something must be wrong

546
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,290
with your liquor!

547
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,200
Liquor?

548
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,880
Nothing can be wrong with my liquor.

549
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,210
Liquor...

550
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,330
Dad.

551
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,200
Don’t worry.

552
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,160
I’ll take a walk with him.

553
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:20,930
Yeah.

554
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,320
Liquor?

555
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,530
What’s this place?

556
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,360
Looks a little romantic.

557
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,730
Every school has this kind of place

558
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,490
for young lovers.

559
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,210
So, you came here before
with your adorers?

560
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,290
Impossible.

561
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,690
This is my first time to come here.

562
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,610
Really?

563
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,450
What a coincidence.

564
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,800
This is also my first time.

565
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,610
Do you know what I told your dad?

566
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,400
Huh?

567
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,250
Finally, I found you.

568
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,690
I don’t want to be separated
from you for a second.

569
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,120
Okay.

570
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,450
Go in.

571
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,380
Go in.

572
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,530
It’s loading.

573
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,450
I couldn’t hit him.

574
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,290
Let me do it.

00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,880
We’ve landed.

593
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,210
What time is it?

594
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,420
(Zhong Zhen)

595
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,530
Zhong Zhen?

596
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,450
Rong,

597
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,800
are you with Boss?

598
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,160
Looking for him again.

599
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:58,900
What is it?

600
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,640
Speak.

601
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,860
Terrible news!

602
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,770
The family of the patient in Bed Three
has sued the hospital

603
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,340
and... Boss!

604
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,360
What?

605
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,260
(Grandma)

606
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,120
Seems I’m going to be scolded.

607
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,120
You’re here.

608
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,050
Why are you also here?

609
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,640
Your grandma misses me.

610
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,250
She called me back to have dinner.

611
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,210
They have known that I’ve been sued

612
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,880
and are going to interrogate me?

613
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,490
I’m afraid you have to
transcribe a book.

614
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,300
I’ve prepared it for you.

615
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,400
Compendium of Materia Medica.

616
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,970
After you’re done,
give them back to me within a month.

617
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:00,880
Good.

618
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,320
Speed up your speaking speed.

619
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,010
Use long sentences
instead of short ones.

620
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,570
Don’t act like a parent

621
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,440
in front of me.

622
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,380
Yes,

623
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,450
Father.

624
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,300
He’s educating his own son.

625
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,130
Why do you have to set foot in?

626
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,090
What?

627
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,450
I’m also a dad here.

628
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,360
I can’t educate my own son?

629
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,410
Daddy,

630
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,120
eat.

631
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,370
Come play chess with your younger son!

632
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,250
Let’s go!

633
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,410
Come on, let’s go.

634
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,320
You naughty kid.

635
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,010
Dad.

636
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,290
The director has told you?

637
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,450
Yes.

638
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,640
Did you get hurt?

639
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:41,930
Just a little.

640
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,290
I’m all right now.

641
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,800
What’s the punishment?

642
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,930
I’m suspended.

643
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,530
For how long?

644
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,690
It depends.

645
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,560
I heard this incident is huge.

646
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,640
Some reports are unfair.

647
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,800
Adjust your mentality well

648
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,050
and be cooperative with
the hospital’s investigation.

649
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,290
I don’t care about those reports.

650
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,800
There’s just a disorderly crowd.

651
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,450
They’re just venting their emotions.

652
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,530
Good to know you understand that.

653
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,380
Dad,

654
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,450
aren’t you going to blame me?

655
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,600
As a father,

656
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,120
I won’t encourage my son to fight.

657
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,120
As a senior,

658
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,640
I won’t encourage a junior
to fight, either.

659
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,120
But as a doctor,

660
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,400
I don’t think you made a big mistake.

661
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,320
However, you must remember

662
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,800
that you are from the Wen family.

663
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,250
Many people are observing.

664
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,120
I can’t be biased in your favor.

665
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,160
I was being impulsive.

666
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,100
I won’t make the same mistake again.

667
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,490
Have a good rest then.

668
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,160
Take it as an opportunity
to improve yourself.

669
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,690
Improve what?

670
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,250
Shaoqing has been good enough.

671
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,970
He doesn’t make me worried like you do.

672
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,380
Don’t give the kid too much pressure.

673
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,050
He’s still got dinner to have.

674
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,640
Mom,

675
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,060
I wasn’t scolding him.

676
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,360
I was just educating him.

677
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,300
Anyway, I’m so far away now.

678
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,690
I can’t do anything to him.

679
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,210
It’s good you know.

680
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,170
I’ll hang up.

681
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:10,490
Mom.

682
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,050
You...

683
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,250
Your dad is old.

684
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,450
Likes nagging.

685
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,450
Grandma,

686
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,160
let me give you a hand.

687
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:19,970
Take it.

688
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,140
What do you mean by this, Grandma?

689
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,010
I’m not short of money.

690
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,530
I know you’re not.

691
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,970
This is your... Travelling fund.

692
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,140
You rarely have a chance
to take a long rest.

693
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,160
Don’t just stay at home.

694
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,970
Go travelling the world.

695
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,930
Take your girlfriend with you.

696
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,210
She has to go to work.

697
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,880
Grandma,

698
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,400
I know you feel sorry for me.

699
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,530
It’s okay.

700
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,530
The suspension won’t be long.

701
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,560
Shaoqing,

702
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,320
as an old woman,

703
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,780
when I look back what I’ve been through,

704
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,730
I find most difficulties
no longer difficult.

705
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,210
Don’t be too hard on yourself.

706
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,050
Enjoy the pleasures life affords.

707
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,120
Also, enjoy the bitterness life affords.

708
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,160
Understand?

709
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,640
Understand.

710
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,800
These strawberries smell really good.

711
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,140
I grew them in our yard.

712
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,050
Just eat.

713
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,930
It’s dirty.

714
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,970
It’s sweet.

715
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,300
Do you like the dishes I cooked?

716
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,060
Of course!

717
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,560
I love the food you cook the most.

718
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,100
Good.

719
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,730
Come to eat more often then.

720
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,250
Sure.

721
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,530
Here’s some sesame paste.

722
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,210
It’s for my future granddaughter-in-law.

723
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,160
Thanks, Grandma.

724
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,930
I promise I will marry her.

725
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,600
I can’t let her taste your food
for nothing.

726
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,210
We’re both waiting for that.

727
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:37,880
Sure.

728
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,820
These are

729
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,930
a few dishes Chengcheng loves.

730
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,300
I won’t take them.

731
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,290
They would be a waste.

732
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,290
You...

733
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:47,820
Dad!

734
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,840
You brat.

735
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,930
Have you quarreled with Chengcheng?

736
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,530
Take them.

737
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,250
Use them as an apology.

738
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,100
That’s right.

739
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,580
Take them.

740
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,060
Hurry, take them.

741
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,900
You know nothing

742
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,300
but still want me to apologize.

743
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,730
It must be your fault.

744
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:02,840
That’s right.

745
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,530
Be good to her.

746
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,890
You’ve finally got a girl
that likes you.

747
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,250
Cherish her.

748
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,360
I know.

749
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,930
I’m leaving, Mom.

750
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,080
Just leave.

751
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:12,930
Grandpa, Grandma,

752
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,730
I’ll visit you another day.

753
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,300
Be safe on the way.

754
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,050
Bye, Mom.

755
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,720
You’re grow-up
but still make us worried.

756
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,450
You...

757
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,530
What?

758
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,560
You were dumped?

759
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,080
Why don’t you take them?

760
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,970
Sure.

761
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,930
No way.

762
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,290
I...!

763
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,690
Haven’t taught you a lesson lately.

764
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,290
Now you’re this bold?

765
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,730
Fine, fine.

766
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,010
Do you think I’m stupid?

767
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,560
Honestly speaking,

768
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,210
very stupid.

769
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,730
You wanna die?

770
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,300
Are you done?

771
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,120
Enough.

772
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:06,820
Is it good?

773
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,450
Yeah!

774
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,450
My grandma made it by herself.

775
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,140
It’s made of walnut,

776
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,880
Chinese date,

777
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,690
and...

778
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,880
And she said in particular that

779
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,400
it’s for her granddaughter-in-law.

780
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,400
I shouldn’t have been worried about you.

781
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,440
Seems you didn’t get scolded at home.

782
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,160
I thought your whole family
was so strict on you.

783
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,800
Grandparents spoil grandkids,
don’t you know?

784
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,890
Not to mention I’ve been
well-behaved since little.

785
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,080
My grandparents really spoil me.

786
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,800
Convey my thanks to Grandma.

787
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,290
I’ve got gourmet’s luck.

788
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,400
Eat more if you like it.

789
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,320
I think the color of your hair
is a bit of strange.

790
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,680
I dyed it specially, alright?

791
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,800
It cost much.

792
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,120
And you often lose your hair.

793
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,780
Every time after you left

794
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,580
my place,

795
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,080
your hair would be everywhere.

796
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,880
I once thought Rangyirang’s hair
turned dark.

797
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,400
You’re a dog!

798
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,600
Don’t move.

799
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,450
Don’t move.

800
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,400
Done.

801
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,050
How about letting my law firm take up

802
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,840
your case?

803
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,400
Good.

804
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,730
Let me get this straight.

805
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,730
You and I are going to be
lawyer and party soon.

806
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,930
You must watch every manner of yours.

807
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,970
You can’t let me
violate my professional ethics.

808
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,640
That complicated?

809
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,840
What about after the case?

810
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:01,930
After?

811
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,050
Who knows?

812
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,560
What do you mean?

813
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,820
When you are my party,

814
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,700
I must treat you fairly.

815
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,890
But when you’re not,
I won’t have to do that anymore.

816
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,340
Is there really a law against

817
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,010
the romantic relationship
between a lawyer and a party?

818
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,810
Article 60 of Chapter VI of the Law
of the People’s Republic of China

819
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,810
on Lawyers stipulates that

820
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,970
any person who has
an improper relationship

821
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,300
with a party by providing legal services

822
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,730
shall be warned by
the judicial administrative department.

823
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,930
If the circumstances are serious,

824
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,120
he shall be suspended
from practicing for three months.

825
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,660
Really?

826
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,410
Yeah.

827
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,850
Miss Cong,

828
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,680
you made up that law, right?

829
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,850
You’re bullying an ignorant citizen.

830
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,480
Yes!

831
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,930
I’m bullying you ignorant of laws.

832
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,580
(Chen Cu)

833
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,410
Bro,

834
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,120
I just attended a meeting
with the leaderships.

835
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,200
Call me back when you have time.

836
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,820
Let me get you another bowl of it.

837
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,810
I still have some at my place.

838
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:41,810
Wait here.

839
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,370
Bro.

840
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,530
I’m sorry.

841
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,370
I didn’t expect you would be involved.

842
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,120
That’s my patient.

843
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,720
Don’t say that.

844
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,200
I didn’t do it for you.

845
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,260
Director Yan wants you to come
to the hospital when you have time.

846
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,850
He’ll tell you the details.

847
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:25,850
I get it.

848
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,640
Did...?

849
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,530
Did they mention the reinstatement
at the meeting?

850
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,010
No, they didn’t.

851
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,450
Let’s first settle the problems at hand.

852
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,050
Okay.

853
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,280
I get it.

854
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,080
What?

855
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,850
You can’t wait to eat?

856
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,280
Even for a minute?

857
