Go, go, go. Don’t look.

175
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,650
I wanted to go back

176
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,770
and find another chance to tell you.

177
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,410
Now that you’re here, I won’t wait.

178
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,960
What are these?

179
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,010
There are nothing on them.

00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,740
(Disaster Relief Supplies)

182
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,170
Three love letters for you.

183
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,080
(Hello, Cong Rong from Class 11,
I’m Wen Shaoqing from Class 9.)

184
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,860
(Can I like you?)

185
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,800
Pink.

186
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,050
The little girls

187
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,130
all like this color, right?

188
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,890
The little boys

189
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,050
all wrote love letters like this, right?

190
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,130
I studied regular script at that time.

191
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,010
You said you were Cong Rong
from Class 11.

192
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,650
But before I could tell you that

193
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,680
I was Wen Shaoqing in Class 9,

194
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,010
you transferred to another school.

195
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,770
White.

196
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,680
The college girls

197
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,010
all like this color, right?

198
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,490
Girls’ white skirts, boys’ white shirts.

199
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,890
When I was in college,
I studied running script.

200
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,130
If we met in college,

201
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,340
(Cong, the book says gentle and calm,
years of quietness.)

202
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,440
I would be your senior.

203
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,500
(We’re the perfect couple.)

204
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,010
There’s love in school.

205
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,800
In college, I read a few books,

206
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:21,080
so even my confession is full of books.

207
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,440
Silver gray.

208
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,840
Mature and stable.

209
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,610
As a doctor, I wrote too many cases,

210
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,490
(Frown, smile, glance, a couple always.)
so I used the doctors’ usual font, cursive script.

211
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,140
(Frown, smile, glance, a couple always.)

212
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,680
At this age,

213
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,200
if I write love letters,

214
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,410
I won’t

215
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,530
write about love.

216
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,080
A responsible man should

217
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,010
give a woman a lifetime commitment.

I used to think that

a love letter from the boy I like

224

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,300
for your grandma

345
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,840
when New Year comes.

346
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,730
Why don’t we start with the cake?

347
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,360
What?

348
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,810
I just think it’s so great that

349
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,690
we can live and die together,

350
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,140
and be so close

351
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,050
even if we can’t see each other.

352
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,010
I guess this is what you’d call

353
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,320
a romantic love. Right?

354
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,400
You’re jealous?

355
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,450
Well, do you know

356
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,930
the point of a romantic love?

357
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,690
Never give up?

358
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,290
It’s two people, one pair.

359
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,930
And we’re special.

360
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,730
We’re just two people.

361
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,010
Oh, I see.

362
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,320
You mean I haven’t said yes, right?

363
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,120
So much nonsense.

364
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,250
So?

365
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,250
I thought I’d already say yes.

366
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,920
That’s in your heart. I don’t know.

367
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,050
I didn’t know you cared so much.

368
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,880
You like me so much?

369
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,690
Yeah, of course.

370
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,250
So when are we going out?

371
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,360
My boyfriend.

372
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,770
What?

373
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,820
You promised me last time.

374
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,170
I wrote it all down on my phone.

375
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,620
Where did I promise to go?

376
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,340
I have proof.

377
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,730
Street Park, right?

378
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,210
Zhou Chengcheng made many dishes.

379
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,560
She’s so sweet.

380
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,540
I haven’t had a good meal
for a long time.

381
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,120
I’m sick of crunchy crackers.

382
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,320
Why aren’t you eating?

383
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,450
I can be full watching you eat.

384
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,290
Cong Rong.

385
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,820
Come to my house for the New Year.

386
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,340
My parents are coming back this year.

387
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,770
You can meet my parents.

388
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,010
What did you say?

389
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,400
I’m serious.

390
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,050
All of a sudden?

391
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,780
But can I?

392
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,450
Of course, you’re the girl I like.

393
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,060
I mean, am I their type?

394
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,560
How is my hair?

395
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,380
How are my clothes?

396
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,100
Should I change my look?

397
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,210
No, they like everything about you.

398
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
I’ll take that as a yes.

399
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,490
I want to say...

400
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,490
No?

401
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,730
No, my shirt got grease on it.

402
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,090
It won’t come out.

403
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,880
Leave it to me.

404
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,400
You just leave yourself to me.

405
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,880
Mom, I have some bad news.

406
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,770
No, you’re scaring me.

407
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,340
Is everything okay?

408
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,480
I’m fine.

409
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,400
I can’t go home for New Year this year.

410
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,850
Will you spend the New Year at Shaoqing’s?

411
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,970
That’s great.

412
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,800
That’s good news, not bad news.

413
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,880
You won’t see your lovely daughter.

414
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,970
That’s okay.

415
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,900
After you get married,

416
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,290
you go home together for the New Year.

417
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,240
I’ll be so happy.

418
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,400
So, what’s the plan?

419
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,360
Not yet.

420
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,120
Why?

421
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,120
Then why are you blushing?

422
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,250
Come on, tell me.

423
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,250
How’s it going? How far have you gone?

424
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,050
Has he asked you to marry him?

425
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,120
So, when can I have a grandchild?

426
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,800
Oh.

427
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,800
You have so much free time.
Take good care of Dad Jiang,

428
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,290
and cook delicious meals for him.

429
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,660
(Meet Parents)

430
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,860
(Blessing)

431
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,490
Happy New Year!

432
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,840
Happy New Year!

433
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,970
Let’s go.

434
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,900
(Happy New Year)

435
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,450
This...

436
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,320
Is this the Phalaenopsis
that Grandma likes?

437
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,010
Yeah.

438
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,730
Are you nervous?

439
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,530
I’m fine.

440
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,930
Deep breathing is

441
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,170
a subconscious activation of

442
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,930
the parasympathetic nervous system
to release pressure.

443
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,560
What should I do? I’m so nervous that
I can’t walk well.

444
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,400
It’s okay. Just do as usual.

445
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,840
We’ll just have dinner.

446
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,880
My family is very easygoing.

447
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,080
We’re almost there.

448
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,850
Here, hold your bonus items.

449
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:22,600
Okay.

450
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,860
Grandma.

451
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,850
Grandma.

452
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,400
Take your time. Slow down.

453
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,730
Hello, Grandma, I’m Cong Rong.

454
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,060
Grandma.

455
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,300
This is the girl

456
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,210
I was telling you about.

457
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,400
Good. You are pretty.

458
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,330
Better than the picture.

459
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,360
You look good, too.

460
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,800
I’m what you call

461
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,690
a fashion old lady.

462
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,690
Oh, I almost forgot.

463
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,050
This is a gift for you.

464
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,680
Yeah. Grandma.

465
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,200
She knows you like Phalaenopsis.

466
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,290
So she found it specially.

467
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,810
That’s very kind of you.

468
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,450
The color is rare.

469
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,930
His grandpa asked me to look for it
for a long time,

470
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,060
but I couldn’t find it.

471
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,100
Thank you so much.

472
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,080
You’re welcome.

473
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,770
So nice.

474
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,320
She’s usually better,
but she’s a little nervous today.

475
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,320
That’s good.
It means she cares about you.

476
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,770
Come on. Come on in.

477
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,400
Let’s go.

478
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,490
I’ll prepare some dumpling stuffing.

479
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,530
You take her to meet Grandpa.

480
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,290
Where’s he?

481
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,080
He’s doing municipal construction.

482
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,320
Municipal construction?

483
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,880
It’s a good spot. I’ll take it.

484
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,400
Let me get the floor for you.

485
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,400
Okay, your turn.

486
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,250
3,500 points.

487
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,530
Here you are.

488
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,840
Not enough.

489
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:47,800
Five.

490
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,010
I told you.

491
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,120
I’ll stay in the jail today.

492
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,490
What’s the fun in that?

493
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,490
It teaches you to buy houses and land

494
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,380
when you have money.

495
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,050
-That’s interesting.
-That’s interesting.

496
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,450
Grandpa, just ignore him.

497
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,610
He’s envious of your young mentality.

498
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,680
Rong, you’re here.

499
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,340
Uncle, this is Cong Rong.

500
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,060
I told you.

501
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,560
This is my best friend.

502
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,050
Uncle…

503
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,480
Grandpa. Happy New Year!

504
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,600
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

505
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,080
Sit down.

506
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,400
Wen Rang, make some tea.

507
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,120
Go.

508
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,250
Okay, I’ll go.

509
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,400
Sit down.

510
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,120
Grandpa, let me introduce her for you.

511
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,010
Cong Rong.

512
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,770
Your girlfriend, a lawyer.

513
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,490
She fought a lawsuit for you and
just got back from the rescue with you.

514
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,490
You were after her, right?

515
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,360
Grandpa, you’re the Oracle.

516
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,610
Chengcheng muttered from time to time,

517
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,160
so I remembered that.

518
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,360
You’re always bragging about me.

519
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,680
Uncle, we’ve got a live one.

520
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,210
What do you think of her?

521
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,770
Good.

522
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,320
She’s just too skinny.

523
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,290
Come on, show me.

524
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,360
Smell it. Is it okay?

525
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,800
What did you say?

526
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,800
That’s not enough for you?

527
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,620
You can’t drink strong tea.

528
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,690
Smell it. Is it okay?

529
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:17,730
Okay.

530
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,010
All right. You said it’s okay.

531
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,010
Learn from her. Eat and drink well.

532
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,530
I don’t eat that much.

533
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,650
Don’t you?

534
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,490
You’re the No.1 omnivore.

535
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,130
Drink tea.

536
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,900
Drink tea.

537
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,560
Rangyirang made the tea.

538
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,250
Rangyirang can make the tea?

539
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,400
Yeah, it can bite you.

540
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,250
Get away from my seat.

541
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,120
Be good. Pour the tea, Rangyirang.

542
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,930
We never interfere

543
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,290
with these kids.

544
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,000
But Shaoqing

545
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,320
never brought girls home.

546
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,210
It’s different this time.

547
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,480
He brings you to our home.

548
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,290
And he must be serious.

549
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,050
We talked it over with his parents and

550
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,530
we got you a welcome gift.

551
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,780
Grandpa, it’s too much.

552
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,810
I can’t take it.

553
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,970
Take it.

554
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,530
It’s a gift from the elders. Take it.

555
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,640
Take it.

556
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,310
Open it.

557
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,800
This looks like blue amber,

558
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,290
a kind of amber.

559
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,250
I don’t know what the print is.

560
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,360
Pi Xiu?

561
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,400
Bi An.

562
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,320
It’s the seventh son of the Dragon.

563
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,880
It’s on the gate of Yamen.

564
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,100
It’s said to judge cases impartially.

565
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,640
Good point.

566
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,210
Then it’s for you.

567
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,290
Thanks, Grandpa. I’ll collect it well.

568
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,640
Great.

569
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,120
Dragon has nine sons.

570
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,640
Does he love the youngest the most?

571
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,490
You like it?

572
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,490
I’ll give one to you.
It’s perfect for you.

573
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,640
Okay.

574
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,640
Let’s make dumplings.

575
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,140
Dumplings. Go.

576
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,970
Help Grandma make dumplings.

577
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,540
Okay.

578
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,320
Coming, Mom.

579
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,780
Let’s go help, too.

580
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,490
Go.

581
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:23,730
Grandpa, we’re going.

582
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,690
Go, go.

583
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,970
Darling. Slow down.

584
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,690
It’s good to be at home.

585
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,400
Professor Wen, Professor Lin.

586
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,840
May I help you with your luggage?

587
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,490
No, we’ll do it ourselves.

588
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,290
The Dean arranged everything well.

589
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,300
Thank him for us.

590
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,650
Yes.

591
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,250
Okay.

592
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,690
It’s our appreciation. Take it.

593
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,450
You don’t have to do this. It’s my job.

594
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,770
Take it.

595
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,880
It’s New Year today.

596
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,540
You’ve worked so hard to pick us up.

597
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,380
Just take it.

598
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,410
Take it.

599
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,120
I wish you a happy new year
and a happy family.

600
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,300
Thank you, thank you.

601
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:26,730
Thank you.

602
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,600
Bye.

603
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,860
Mom, Dad.

604
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,690
Let’s go.

605
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:31,770
Son.

606
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,050
Son.

607
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,400
You must be tired after
flying for over ten hours.

608
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,250
I’m not tired when I see you.

609
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,800
This is Cong Rong, right?

610
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,010
Hello, Uncle and Aunt, I’m Cong Rong.

611
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,490
Come into the room. It’s cold outside.

612
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,400
I’ll get the luggage.

613
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,730
No, no, no. Go.

614
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,380
I’ll take it.

615
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,450
Come on, son.

616
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,860
Grandma and Grandpa are waiting for you.
The food is ready.

617
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,880
All right. Come on.

618
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,120
It must be hard on you, Aunt.

619
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:53,690
Are you okay?

620
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,250
I’m okay.

621
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,210
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

622
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,650
-Good health to Mom and Dad.
-Happy New Year.

623
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,650
-Good health to Grandma and Grandpa.
-Good health to Grandma and Grandpa.

624
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,780
Thank you. Good luck to the kids.

625
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,450
Happy New Year, Aunt and Uncle.

626
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,410
All right, drink.

627
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,600
Drink.

628
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,130
Eat. Don’t wait for us.

629
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,050
-Come on.
-Eat.

630
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,760
You have a good appetite, so eat more.

631
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,160
Wen Rang. Shaoqing.

632
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,640
Take care of your girlfriends.

633
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,970
Did you hear that?

634
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,090
Aunt asked you to take care of me.

635
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,120
Yeah. I heard it.

636
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,220
It’s not the time yet.

637
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,010
I’ll get you some pepto-bismol
after dinner.

638
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,080
I can do it myself.

639
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,260
It’s the mission Grandma gave us.

640
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,280
Thank you.

641
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,130
How long can you stay here?

642
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,370
We’re not

643
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,960
going anywhere.

644
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,660
That’s right.

645
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,650
Really?

646
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,520
Yeah.

647
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,300
After all, that’s not our home abroad.

648
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,250
There is a sense of wandering.

649
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,920
So it’s better to go home.

650
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,410
That’s nice.

651
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,850
Chinese medical technology is good,

652
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,860
and investment funds are sufficient.

653
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,040
So we discussed it carefully and

654
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,130
transferred the personnel relationship

655
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,330
back to Yun Ji Hospital.

656
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,380
Dad, you’re back in Neurosurgery?

657
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,290
Yeah.

658
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:01,700
Yeah.

659
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,680
Your mom’s back in Thoracic Surgery.

660
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,850
Next year,

661
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,920
we

662
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,370
can meet at the hospital.

663
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,560
Don’t you welcome us?

664
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,640
Come on.

665
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,450
Congratulations.

666
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,220
Congratulations.

667
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,080
Dr. Wen, you’ve made it this far.

668
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,850
You’re not young,

669
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,810
so you’d better go home.

670
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,530
Nothing is important

671
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,640
but family.

672
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,970
Family’s good.

673
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,260
-Poverty doesn’t matter.
-Poverty doesn’t matter.

674
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,410
That’s true.

675
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,450
Yeah, I agree with old...

676
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,220
No old.

677
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,810
Dad’s words.

678
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,330
Congratulations.
Brother and sister-in-law.

679
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,340
From now on, your father watches you.

680
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,560
And mine watches me.

681
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,560
That’s a lot of balance right there.

682
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,410
Welcome home.

683
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,370
Thank you.

684
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,220
Eat the dishes.

685
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,330
Dumplings.

686
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,610
Eat.

687
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,090
Just eat your food.

688
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:03,530
Food’s getting cold.

689
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,720
Who made the dumpling? Eat it.

690
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,820
This one, this pig-like one is mine.

691
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,680
I know it.

692
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,180
Oh, it’s leaking.

693
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,760
It’s leaking.

694
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,680
It’s leaking.

695
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,490
The pig’s alive.

696
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,220
Try my mom’s egg dumplings.

697
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:17,700
Dad, eat.

698
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,930
Okay. Let me eat.

699
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:19,450
Cong Rong.

700
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,010
Thank you, Aunt.

701
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,610
Eat more.

702
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,450
You eat more.

703
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,330
Okay, Dad.

704
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,930
This is good.

705
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,380
Come on.

706
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,260
Stop talking and eat.

707
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,930
Eat this.

708
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,050
This is good.

709
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,000
This is you, not obedient at all.

710
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,220
What?!

711
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,370
How obedient I am.

712
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,810
That bets I made with you.

713
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,400
Open my own bookstore

714
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,810
and get a girlfriend.

715
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,120
I’ve done them all.

716
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:42,680
Go and play.

717
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,130
Go, go.

718
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:44,890
Go play.

719
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,600
Look at that. Three stars.

720
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,610
On the left is the Longevity Star,

721
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,130
the middle is the Prosperity star,
and the right is the Luck Star.

722
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,010
Good, huh?

723
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,850
Yeah.

724
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:06,660
Aunt, I thought it was Wen Shaoqing.

725
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,850
Put this on.

726
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,010
You put it on. I wear more.

727
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,680
How is it? Are you used to it?

728
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,160
Good. It’s a good family.

729
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,640
Is this your first time outside
on New Year?

730
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,720
Yes.

731
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,050
But I do video chat with them.

732
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,330
I don’t want them to think
they’re empty nesters.

733
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,440
Shaoqing told me

734
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,600
the story of you two

735
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,610
about a banyan tree.

736
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,120
He told you that?

737
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,760
He loved school so much

738
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,530
because he was waiting for you.

739
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:44,410
He really likes you.

740
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,010
You like him a lot, too?

741
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,330
I like him as a boyfriend,

742
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,530
and

743
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,160
as a doctor.

744
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,560
His integrity, detachment,

745
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,850
discipline and empathy

746
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,810
are all good.

747
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,480
Aunt, look.

748
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,760
That’s a lot of fireworks.

749
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,260
Look, come here.

750
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,260

00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,370
So big.

754
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,780
Dad, look at that. Look at that.

755
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,340
That’s beautiful.

756
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,600
Here. Here.

757

Come on, I’ll take you somewhere.

760
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,490
It’s beautiful.

761
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,810
Beautiful, isn’t it?

762
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,930
What about over there?

763
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,160
It was this lantern last year.

764
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,520
Can you see clearly from here?

765
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,970
It’s a nice view.

766

00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,890
