Thanks, bro.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,550
When will I attend your wedding, huh?

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,830
Happy wedding.

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,710
I’ll take my leave.

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,430
Catch you later.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,910
Wen Rang!

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,070
You’re leaving so soon?

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,100
Won’t you join the following activities?

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,660
Not today.

39
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,230
Several major booksellers

40
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,590
are also present at the wedding.

41
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,560
There’s still time.

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,710
I can introduce you to them,

43
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,310
so that your poems can

44
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,670
be on the bookshelves
at major bookstores.

45
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,900
We can discuss that another day.

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,780
Wen Rang.

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,780
This is a rare opportunity.

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,180
If your poems are seen by more people,

49
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,360
so will be your literary talent.

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,990
Don’t you expect that to happen?

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,510
Thanks for your concern.

52
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,950
But I don’t expect that to happen.

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,990
Wen Rang.

54
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,740
Now you’re cold to me

55
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,270
because of her?

56
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,580
Jiang Yao.

57
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,230
You always think yourself in the right.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,310
Take a picture of me.

59
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,620
My friends are gonna like it.

60
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,990
No problem. Go ahead.

61
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,110
I’ll take more pictures.

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,670
Pose over here.

63
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,150
I keep recording your everyday life

64
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,560
and posting the videos on WeSee.

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,740
Now you have
several hundred thousand followers.

66
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,120
Look, guys.

67
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,270
I specially cooked it for him.

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,230
Do you think after he tastes it,

69
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,180
he’ll ask me to be his girlfriend?

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,580
The world even seems smaller.

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,230
I didn’t know he could do rock climbing.

72
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,800
We both have 24 hours a day.

73
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,310
But the things he can do in 24 hours

74
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,460
are even more than
what I can do in 48 hours.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,190
Really admire him.

76
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,260
How industrious he is!

77
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,950
Do you think if I go

78
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,350
help him with the cleaning,

79
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,150
he’ll ask me to be his girlfriend?

80
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,350
He’s cleaning the bookshelves.

81
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,510
Don’t walk away.

82
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,470
Look here.

83
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,540
Let me interview you.

84
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,660
How many times a day do you clean them?

85
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,030
Once is enough if you’re not here.

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,940
How many times is it if I’m here?

87
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,870
Four or five.

88
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,160
But why?

89
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,310
I never give you more trouble.

90
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,510
Don’t try to run!

91
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,270
Chickens.

92
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,460
Bear. Bear.

93
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,540
I wanna play with you.

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,030
Sure.

95
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,560
Do you want to see bubbles,

96
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,430
kids?

97
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,910
Yes!

98
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,070
Still so carefree.

99
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,710
Her sorrow never lasts
longer than a day.

100
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,390
That’s good.

101
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,540
I don’t need to be worried.

102
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:43,830
Be careful. Don’t burst them.

103
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,710
Be careful. Don’t burst them.

104
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,430
Mommy,

105
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,540
I wanna fly a kite.

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,910
It’s run out.

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,830
How about this?

108
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,440
Fly a kite in the park tomorrow, okay?

109
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,150
Okay.

110
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,860
Okay.

111
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,390
Why did you stop?

112
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,200
The bubble water has run out.

113
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,240
I’ll go get some.

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,860
You guys go play over there, okay?

115
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,270
-Okay.
-Okay.

116
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,920
I’m running.

117
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,320
Hey, let go of the kite.

118
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,120
I’m doing it. I’m doing it.

119
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,390
Let go when the wind blows.

120
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,350
Three, two…

121
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,000

Thanks,

my private driver.

125
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,950
How are you feeling

126
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,420
about having your girlfriend
drive you to work?

127
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,660
Feeling great.

128
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,780
Hope we can do this every day.

129
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,740
Does it still hurt?

130
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,870
Having your tender care,

131
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,830
I recovered long ago.

132
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,420
Don’t push yourself too hard.

133
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,360
Those families of that patient

134
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,540
must still be at the hospital.

135
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,350
I worry they may give you a hard time.

136
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,030
(Legal Assistant Cong Rong)
If they badger with you,

137
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,180
let them come to me.

138
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,350
I get it.

139
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,070
I can feel your strong desire
to protect me.

140
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,430
All right.

141
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,300
I gotta go to work.

142
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,470
Careful on the road.

143
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,390
Please don’t stand here

144
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,340
and affect our work.

145
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,120
Is Wen Shaoqing a doctor
in your hospital?

146
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,470
It’s said that
he hit the patient’s family yesterday.

147
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,680
Is that true?

148
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Do you support his deed?

149
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,710
We want to interview him.

150
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,030
Can you ask Wen Shaoqing to come here?

151
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,470
Can you ask him…?

152
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,040
-Boss, don’t go there.
-To tell us the details?

153
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,200
Why are there so many journalists?

154
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,880
Don’t bring it up.

155
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,980
It’s a total mess now.

156
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,780
That patient’s families
contacted several media.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,150
They all want to interview you.

158
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,270
Look how eager they are.

159
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,830
You mustn’t give them the chance.

160
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,420
The problem must be solved.

161
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,030
I can’t escape all the time.

162
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,070
Forget about the things here for now.

163
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,740
Think about
how to deal with the Director.

164
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,710
Sorry.

165
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,350
We aren’t available for an interview
right now.

166
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,590
I told you, we aren’t available…
It’s you.

167
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,590
You must stop them, understand?

168
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,710
Tell them

169
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,200
that the hospital will give them
an explanation soon.

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,950
Director.

171
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,710
You know what?

172
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,870
I’ve been busy with nothing

173
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,030
but the calls.

174
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,350
How could you get involved in a fight?

175
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,640
If in any case you got your hand hurt

176
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,560
and couldn’t operate anymore,

177
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,830
your career and future
would both be ruined, right?

178
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,430
It’s never easy for a hospital

179
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,030
to train a good doctor.

180
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,790
If you are a responsible man,

181
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,750
the first thing you should do
is to protect yourself.

182
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,830
I just didn’t want to let those kids down.

183
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,430
Well,

184
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,220
this is my fault.

185
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,100
I hope you won’t punish them.

186
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,470
This is no big deal.

187
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,670
The hospital will
deal with them accordingly.

188
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,220
Then be simple

189
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,310
and tell me the punishment for me.

190
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,710
Go home and rest for a few days.

191
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,430
The hospital will deal with
the patient in Bed Three and the media.

192
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,950
Wait till this is over.

193
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,950
How many days exactly?

194
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,140
At least a month.

195
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,310
Boss,

196
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,790
what’s their decision?

197
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,200
Dr. Wen,

198
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,230
the patient in Bed 15 doesn’t feel good.

199
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,670
Please have a check.

200
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,520
I’m on suspension.

201
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,880
I can’t see a patient.

202
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,920
Chen Cu.

203
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,490
Please take over my job.

204
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,210
I should’ve been the one
to take the responsibility.

205
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,330
Don’t say that.

206
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,250
This is my fault.

207
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,040
The one deserving punishment is me.

208
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,250
I won’t be there with you
on the night shifts lately.

209
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,880
Don’t miss me too much.

210
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,890
Go.

211
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,970
The patient is waiting.

212
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,520
Okay.

213
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,490
Let’s go.

214
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,120
What?

215
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,370
Don’t give me those sad faces.

216
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,330
I’m just suspended, not fired.

217
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,640
I’ll be back.

218
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,920
All get back to your work.

219
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,930
Or the director will scold you again.

220
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,330
We were all involved.

221
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,250
Why did you take all the punishment?

222
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,120
You’re still young.

223
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,800
You’ll understand in the future.

224
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,690
By the way,

225
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,610
I’ve made a call to your teacher.

226
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,690
Write a self-criticism later.

227
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,280
The school won’t be hard on you.

228
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,250
One more thing.

229
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,370
I’m writing down
all the important matters

230
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,370
needing attention

231
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,610
of several patients.

232
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,650
Director,

233
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,250
don’t punish those interns, please.

234
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,210
With more and more doctors getting old,

235
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,340
we need more and more

236
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,850
young doctors to become pillars.

237
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,850
(Matters needing attention of patients)

238
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,090
Do as I have written down.

239
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,120
Don’t make any mistakes.

240
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,490
Why are you still standing there?

241
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,730
Get back to what you should do!

242
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,170
When in that white coat,

243
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,970
you’re entrusted with

244
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,920
the patient’s health and life.

245
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,280
Bear it in mind.

246
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,040
You may leave.

247
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,920
I also should…

248
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,570
Leave for home.

249
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,840
Boss,

250
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,850
we’ll wait for you to come back.

251
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,210
You came back early today.

252
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,490
Zhong Zhen told me that you’re…

253
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,250
On suspension.

254
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,120
You look like you’re going to a war.

255
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,450
Let’s take it as a vacation,

256
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,730
to which I’ve been looking forward.

257
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,520
Come on.

258
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,450
Let’s eat.

259
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,520
Are you sure?

260
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,370
Are you sure you’re not worried at all?

261
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,850
Why should I be worried?

262
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,730
My life has been so boring.

263
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,370
Most of my time has been taken up
by the patients and the hospital.

264
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,040
Only a little belongs to myself.

265
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,640
Now is good.

266
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,930
I finally have time to enjoy my life

267
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,940
and finish my list.

268
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,000
You have a list?

269
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,920
Of course I have things I wanna do.

270
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,700
Are they weird things like
carving patterns on chopsticks

271
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,420
or working on the best way
to kill a chicken

272
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,760
for the best taste, etc.?

273
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,090
Working on a recipe
is interesting indeed.

274
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,640
But I have a more important thing to do.

275
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,090
Being with you.

276
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,160
But now,

277
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,890
what you should do is to taste

278
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,120
the meal cooked by a weird chef.

279
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:26,970
This one.

280
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,650
Newly developed by me.

281
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,280
Delicious!

282
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:30,970
You too have a bite.

283
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,280
Chengcheng.

284
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,100
I didn’t expect it to be so popular.

285
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,960
You must be tired.

286
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,730
I’m fine.

287
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,450
Here are your wages.

288
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,490
These are your due.

289
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,770
Thanks a lot.

290
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,530
Sir.

291
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,690

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,640
I thought if only I gave out light,

297
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,450
the lonely boat would come to me.

298
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,800
But the truth is some boat
already had its destination long ago.

299
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,920
Since I’m not your destination,

more stories of us

301
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,280

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,330

(Cong Rong:
How have you been, Chengcheng?)

322
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,930
(I’ve been good.
I just finished the work at the hotel.)

323
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,500
(I’m on my way home. Focus on your job.
Don’t worry about me.)

324
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,740
(Cong Rong:
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?)

325
00:17:52,740 --> 00:18:10,260
(I’ll go to the restaurant.
The remaining stuffs…)

326
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,980
(I’ll go to the restaurant.
The remaining stuffs need to be cleared…)

327
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,000
It’s okay.

328
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,730
As long as you’re back.

329
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,690
You won’t even ask
why I suddenly came back?

330
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,360
No need to ask.

331
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,930
I know you’ve been
suffering a lot outside.

332
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,970
Home is good, isn’t it?

333
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,930
I’m such a failure, don’t you think?

334
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,040
I just want to run my own small business

335
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,650
and earn my own bread.

336
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,130
Why does it have to be so hard?

337
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,020
You want to be
independent and self-reliant.

338
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,280
There’s nothing wrong about that.

339
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,450
Your mom and I support you.

340
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,490
But some things in life
just don’t suit you.

341
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,210
Don’t suit me?

342
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,250
Right.

343
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,840
He and I are not from the same world.

344
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,970
How can we suit each other?

345
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,930
Chengcheng,

346
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,970
what’re you talking about?

347
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,360
Did someone hurt you?

348
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,130
No.

349
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,170
It was my fault

350
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,840
to let you and Mom down.

351
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,450
In fact, sometimes it’s our fault.

352
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,320
From now on, as long as you’re happy,

353
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,930
you’ll have our full support.

354
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,970
There’s no big deal.

355
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,560
Let’s take our time.

356
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,490
Yeah.

357
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,610
Rangyirang,

358
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,800
your breakfast.

359
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,020
What a hearty breakfast!

360
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,970
Nutritionally speaking,

361
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,410
a healthy breakfast should have

362
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,130
four to five hundred calories.

363
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,210
There should be an appropriate
amount of carbohydrate,

364
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,760
protein, vitamin and mineral substance.

365
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,280
So that you can have enough energy
for the whole morning.

366
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,320
You got up early

367
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,650
only to make me breakfast?

368
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,730
That’s not the whole truth.

369
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,320
I also made you lunch, dinner
and night snack.

370
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,760
Don’t forget to take them.

371
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,160
Are you going to be a full-time chef?

372
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,010
You lawyers often skip meals
when being busy

373
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,280
and casually order takeout

374
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,560
which contains little nutrition.

375
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,580
Now is good.

376
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,360
I have plenty of time

377
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,280
to cook for you.

378
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,410
Lately, you’ve been busy with
that online loan case

379
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,570
and always work overtime.

380
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,520
You may get hungry at night,

381
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,320
so I’ve prepared more food for you.

382
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,050
You’re so good to me

383
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,040
that I don’t even know how to repay you.

384
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,650
You can marry me.

385
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,060
Time for work.

386
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,890
I gotta go.

387
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,980
Go on enjoying your retire life.

388
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,930
I’m leaving for work.

389
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,650
I’ll walk you out.

390
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,810
Stay at home and have a good rest.

391
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,690
No need to walk me out.

392
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,800
Then I won’t walk you downstairs.

393
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,730
I’m off.

394
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,450
You lied.

395
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,320
I pushed the button for you.

396
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,650
Don’t thank me.

397
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,250
A walk after eating helps digestion.

398
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,800
I’ll walk you to the bus station.

399
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,560
Let’s have an outing when I’m less busy.

400
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,600
Good.

401
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,650
Where do you want to go?

402
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,080
How about going to see animals?

403
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,490
Elephant.

404
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,760
Goat.

405
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:46,970
Swallow.

406
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,690
Look.

407
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,740
Looks like a swallow?

408
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,360
Yeah.

409
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,170
A rabbit?

410
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,650
A rabbit.

411
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,360
It doesn’t look like a rabbit.

412
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,730
A rabbit should look like this.

413
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,280
Huh?

414
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,490
Right?

415
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:00,760
Right indeed.

416
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,360
You should go back.

417
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,440
I’ve been too busy lately.

418
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,610
You should go to bed early.

419
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,520
Don’t wait for me.

420
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,650
How about walking me farther?

421
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,650
Sure.

422
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,000
Last time,

423
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,210
you were on purpose, right?

424
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,210
What last time?

425
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,250
I don’t remember a thing.

426
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,980
(East)

427
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:04,980
That’s it.

428
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,730
You should go back.

429
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,450
You agreed to walk me
only to the front of the building.

430
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,000
Then I’ll go back.

431
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,730
Remember to eat on time.

432
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,800
Eight. Still early.

433
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,440
Wen Rang.

434
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,520
I can see that

435
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,170
you’re going against yourself.

436
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,250
You have an interesting soul.

437
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,040
You have great talents as well.

438
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,540
What’s more, I think you are

439
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,000
a very, very good person.

440
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,890
Don’t deny yourself

441
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,000
because she doesn’t understand you.

442
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,680
Hello?

443
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,410
Hello.

444
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,050
Am I speaking to Mr. Wen Rang?

445
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,370
Yes,

446
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,020
you are.

447
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,970
What can I do for you?

448
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,100
The venue for your book sharing session
has been settled.

449
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,280
What book sharing session?

450
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,780
About the book A Castle in the Clouds.

451
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,650
Miss Jiang Yao told me to contact you.

452
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,600
So, when are you available this week?

453
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:30,850
Okay,

454
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,890
I’ll call you when I confirm.

455
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,280
Okay.

456
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,900
(Rang Kai Bookstore)

457
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,730
Cheers.

458
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,840
I didn’t expect the performance
to be so successful

459
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,050
and us to be so appreciated.

460
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,970
I’m so happy.

461
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,170
It’s because that our female vocal
looks beautiful

462
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,250
and sings well.

463
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,360
Isn’t because that our guitar player

464
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,040
is handsome and talented?

465
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,130
Eat.

466
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,730
I gotta say

467
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,890
time really flies.

468
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,320
It’s been two years.

469
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,130
Do you still remember how we met?

470
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,280
Of course I do.

471
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,570
I remember that you were

472
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,020
wearing similar clothes.

473
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,850
You were playing the guitar
near the school garden

474
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,130
with so many girls surrounding

475
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,650
and admiring you.

476
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,410
I remember you began to sing

477
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,970
while I was playing the guitar.

478
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,740
You were wearing a red dress

479
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,000
and being eye-catching in the crowd.

480
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,610
So, I was wondering

481
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,930
who

482
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,520
this proud girl was.

483
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,600
But she sang really well.

484
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:05,560
So, you lost your heart to me
at that moment?

485
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,040
Yes.

486
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:10,930
Fine.

487
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,970
To celebrate the second anniversary
of your losing your heart to me,

488
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,850
I have a gift for you.

489
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,690
Close your eyes.

490
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,690
Don’t peek.

491
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,490
I won’t.

492
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,280
Hurry.

493
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,650
Open your eyes.

494
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,930
Is it for me?

495
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,320
Open it.

496
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,130
Come on, open it.

497
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,210
This brand is expensive!

498
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,250
Where did you get the money?

499
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,130
Tell me, where did you get the money?

500
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,280
I worked part-time for months!

501
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,130
Wen Rang.

502
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,840
Do you like it or not?

503
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,610
I… I’m telling you.

504
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,170
It… It is not an ordinary guitar.

505
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,170
It is special.

506
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:09,690
Look.

507
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,520
Look here.

508
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,600
My surname’s initial is here.

509
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,320
This guitar represents me.

510
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,740
Having it by your side

511
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,450
roughly equals having me by your side.

512
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,540
Do you have to leave?

513
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,360
I can’t give up a bigger world

514
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,360
because of one person, right?

515
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,840
What bigger world?

516
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,080
We’ve been together for years.

517
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,170
You always tell me that
you like the way

518
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,170
I’m being stubborn

519
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,360
and retaining my dignity instead of
succumbing to a temptation.

520
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,930
I’ve been grateful to you.

521
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,930
Grateful to that girl

522
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,020
who worked hard for months

523
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,640
just to buy me a nice guitar.

524
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,210
Just tell yourself that girl is dead.

525
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,560
I was young and ignorant.

526
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,520
In my eyes, there was only the guitar,

527
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,650
the songs

528
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,970
and you.

529
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,450
Now I’ve changed.

530
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,490
I want more,

531
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,000
which you can’t give me.

532
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:13,650
Turn on the lights!

533
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,650
What’s going on?

534
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,130
Be careful.

535
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,040
Check the lights over there.

536
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,930
Why are you here?

537
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,760
Jiang Yao.

538
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,890
I’m here to return the guitar.

539
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,320
Don’t you remember the meaning of it?

540
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,280
Just because I remember it clearly,

541
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,760
I have to return it to you.

542
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,540
You don’t want to sell your books
by string-pulling.

543
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,130
That’s fine.

544
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,490
I’m holding this book fair for you,

545
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,450
to give your work a chance
to win others’ favor.

546
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,970
Are you still not satisfied?

547
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,890
Do you have to use this book fair as…?

548
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,970
Jiang Yao, you know
it’s not about the book fair.

549
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,320
It’s time for us to
end this and move on.

550
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,080
I was wishing you to come back
to me while hating you.

551
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,600
That’s a stupid thing I did
when I was young.

552
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,410
I had been doing that stupid thing

553
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,000
till I saw you again.

554
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,800
I regretted

555
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,520
and rued.

556
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,000
However, I eventually realized that

557
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,800
my emotions for you
were just my obsession.

558
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,280
Obsession with the past

559
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,250
is meaningless.

560
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,080
Isn’t our past your everything?

561
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,040
You once said

562
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,740
that you would always remember
that girl in a red dress

563
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,600
singing in the crowd.

564
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,690
You once said

565
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,280
that’s your fleeting glimpse
of an enchanting beauty.

566
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,540
You got excited
every time you talked about that.

567
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,740
You forgot all of that?

568
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,820
That’s all meaningless to you?

569
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,690
Jiang Yao!

570
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,520
You are no longer the girl
you used to be.

571
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,930
Even I, who always believe that

572
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,360
I would never be changed by this world,

573
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,450
have unknowingly

574
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,490
changed.

575
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,970
I’ve been asking myself

576
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,800
if I came back too late.

577
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,280
If I came back earlier,

578
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,970
we could’ve made it up,

579
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,250
we could’ve gone back…

580
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,930
I asked myself the similar question.

581
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,130
If we did it all over again,

582
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,970
would it be different?

583
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,360
Maybe yes.

584
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,170
But people are stubborn

585
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,360
when they are young.

586
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,840
No one would change for the other.

587
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,210
We have only one chance
to make a choice.

588
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,250
We both made the wrong choice.

589
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:19,930
Thank you.

590
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,540
Madam.

591
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,810
I want to buy that glass fish

592
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,520
I saw last time.

593
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,500
These are all I have.

594
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,250
Take your pick.

595
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,060
This one?

596
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,890
You sure?

597
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,730
Yeah.

598
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,970
I won’t make the wrong choice this time.

599
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,730
What?

600
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,690
Still reading the court records?

601
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,050
Yeah.

602
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,740
I’m learning about the trial procedures

603
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,840
of these two presiding judges.

604
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,360
I’ve got to be prepared.

605
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,450
Good.

606
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,600
As a trainee of Mr. Shangguan,

607
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,010
you have good thoughts.

608
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,050
She’s forced me to watch it
for three times.

609
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,250
Now you’ve watched the video
for so many times.

610
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,170
Have you learned anything particular?

611
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,480
In this contract dispute case,

612
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,290
maybe we shouldn’t
bring all the evidence

613
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,930
to the court.

614
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:21,970
According to the claim of the defendant,

615
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,650
the acceptance list
provided by the plaintiff

616
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,970
could be easily challenged.

617
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,320
I’m afraid it wouldn’t be wise

618
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,760
to provide such evidence.

619
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,210
The counterattack

620
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,490
is in favor of the plaintiff.

621
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,930
Mr. Shangguan also taught me that

622
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:36,090
we should arrange the evidence
according to its strength.

623
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,050
Is that right?

624
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,610
Am I wrong?

625
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,730
Good thinking.

626
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:48,760
Yeah.

627
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,130
Keeping trying.

628
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,900
I’ll go ask Mr. Shangguan to look over
the cross-examination views.

629
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,530
Okay.

630
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,880
She’s more mature.

631
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,300
(Cross-Examination Views)

632
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,250
Well written.

633
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,320
But a few problems still.

634
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,730
Come over here.

635
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,050
This sentence.

636
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,010
The relevance of Exhibit 5

637
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,730
needs to be enumerated in this way.

638
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,800
These sentences.

639
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,250
Here.

640
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,840
Revise them and it’ll be fine.

641
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,420
Okay.

642
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,210
I get it.

643
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,480
I’m going to revise them now.

644
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,050
One more thing.

645
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,920
The trial is due in a few weeks.

646
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,010
Rest well.

647
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,320
Stay in good state.

648
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,730
I will.

649
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,840
Thanks, Mr. Shangguan.

650
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,480
How are you doing there?

651
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,400
Need my help?

652
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,570
It’s fine.

653
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,840
Don’t worry about me.

654
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,050
There aren’t a lot of things.

655
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,380
It won’t take me long to pack them.

656
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,730
Go on with your work.

657

(Cong Rong)

658
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,130
By the way,

659
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,020
don’t tell or ask

660
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,360
Wen Shaoqing anything.

661
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,530
I can adjust myself well.

662
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,320
I’ll get better soon.

663
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,610
Way to go, Chengcheng.

664
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,580
When I’m free, let’s go shopping,

665
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,690
hang out and have fun.

666

(A Castle in the Clouds)

667
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,440
Even there was no Jiang Yao,

668
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,610
he and I still wouldn’t
be together, right?

669
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,900
(A Castle in the Clouds)

670
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,960
How did you get in here?

671
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,130
I won’t go home!

672
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,530
Let go of me!

673
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,440
Give me pepper powder.

674

(Cumin)

675
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,770
What’s wrong with you today?

676
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,800
Are you blind?

677
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,800
I gave you the wrong one?

678
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,200
What are you doing?

679
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,280
You got hurt.

680
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,360
I can’t succeed in anything in life.

681
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,210
I’d rather be a vegetable.

682
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,360
Nonsense!

683
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,210
Spit it out.

00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,260
(Burang Barbeque)

685
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,060
(For Rent)

686
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,130
Why are you renting it out suddenly?

687
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,360
Your business is good, isn’t it?

688
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,570
This is just a small business.

689
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,840
Is it good?

690
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,570
Not even close.

691
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,130
It’s not like that.

692
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,210
You said that

693
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,440
the scale of the business
doesn’t matter,

694
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,900
nor the profit.

695
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,610
What matters is to find the true self.

696
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:13,050
I think I was being childish then.

697
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,650
People can’t live in
their own fantasy forever.

698
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,530
We should get out of our comfort zone.

699
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,170
Look at those friends of mine,

700
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,100
they all have made achievements

701
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,960
on their own.

702
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,130
While I…

703
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,760
I seem to have wasted
too much time here.

704
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,800
Why did you suddenly
change your thought?

705
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,250
Are you in trouble or something?

706
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,880
No.

707
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,840
I just… Walked on a wrong path
for some time.

708
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,090
Now I should get back to the right path.

709
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,730
I have a gift…

710
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,360
Oh, right.

711
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,760
Take this.

(A Castle in the Clouds)

713
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,570
It wasn’t until I sorted out
the restaurant that I realized

714
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,210
there was nothing worth staying for.

715
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:11,570
My boyfriend is here to pick me up.

716
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,060
I gotta go.

717
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,960
Bye.
