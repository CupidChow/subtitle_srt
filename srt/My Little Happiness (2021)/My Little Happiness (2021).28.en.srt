(Happy New Year)

32
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,670
Luckily, I didn’t get up too late.

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,180
Can the oil on the shirt be washed off?

34
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,020
Just leave the shirt to me.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,020
And you.

36
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,180
Just trust me and leave yourself to me.

37
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,620
You’re up.

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,580
I thought to wake you up.

39
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,020
I tend to wake up early in a new place.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,180
You look good in it.

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,860
Your skill is good, too.

42
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,680
But the shirt is too small for you

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,620
to embroider.

44
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,740
I’ll tell Grandpa you’d like to embroider

45
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,590
Along the River During
the Qingming Festival for him.

46
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,830
Don’t you dare.

47
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,860
I’m kidding.

48
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,380
What’s the name of the flower?

49
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,310
Forget the flower’s name.

50
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,110
Go to pay New Year’s call

51
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,590
to Grandparents in this.

52
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,260
I’m sure they’ll be very happy.

53
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,980
What’s the name on earth?

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,100
Chinese cinnamon.

55
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,190
Chinese cinnamon?

56
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,420
Isn’t it seasoning?

57
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,470
You can say so.

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,310
Cinnamon twig is
a traditional Chinese medicine.

59
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,160
Cassia twig. Cassia twig is good.

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,600
In the Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases
compiled by Zhang Zhongjing,

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,660
the cinnamon twig soup
is the first prescription,

62
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,310
known as the Top Prescription.

63
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,420
Got it?

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,660
Cinnamon? The Top Prescription?

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,380
It’s interesting.

66
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,510
Hold on.

67
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,230
You are misleading me.

68
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,030
I don’t mean it’s bad.

69
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,540
But, why will Grandparents be happy

70
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,230
seeing me wear it?

71
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,750
Cinnamon blooms and then bears fruits.

72
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,030
The fruits are called “cassia seeds”.

73
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,070
It’s auspicious.

74
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,580
Are “cassia seeds” auspicious?

75
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,170
Cassia seeds mean “have babies soon”.

76
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,340
I’m gonna get it changed.

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,190
Isn’t it good? Why changing it?

78
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,430
What do you think?

79
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,510
Wen Rang! Stop there!

80
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,790
Let’s talk!

81
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,390
I’m not a flower.

82
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,030
Why watering me?

83
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,670
You knew the ninth son of dragon
is called Chiwen,

84
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,480
and you gave me that.
I’ve checked online.

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,750
What’s wrong with Chiwen?

86
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,430
Chiwen means a fool!

87
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,110
Alright. Alright. Alright.

88
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,100
I’m not making fun of you.

89
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,070
Go get changed.

90
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,220
We’ll pay New Year’s call
for red packets.

91
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,110
Red packets?

92
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,990
Yes.

93
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,460
Big red packets.

94
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,190
But in my family,

95
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,110
you’ll have to say auspicious words.

96
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,990
Can you do it?

97
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,070
Father. Mother. Happy New Year.

98
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,700
May you have longevity.

99
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,470
A couplet for you.

100
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,550
“By reading thousands of scrolls,

101
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,630
spring comes beyond the walls”.

102
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,190
-Good.
-Good.

103
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,390
Wish you good luck

104
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,750
and great success.

105
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,380
(Bliss)

106
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,780
Thanks.

107
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,310
Grandpa. Grandma.

108
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,990
Cong Rong and I have a couplet for you.

109
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,340
“Mediate in mountain
with peace in mind.”

110
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,310
“Enjoy leisure free from worries.”

111
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,960
Good. Good.

112
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,990
You are a good match.

113
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,700
We like it.

114
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,230
Here. Red packets.

115
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,430
-Thank you, Grandpa, Grandma.
-Thank you, Grandpa, Grandma.

116
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,510
You’re good.

117
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,260
Big red packets, aren’t they?

118
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,310
Your turn.

119
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,140
It’s easy-peasy to say auspicious words.

120
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,150
Dad and Mom.

121
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,160
“Eat and drink as you please.

122
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,830
Never mind any annoyances.”

123
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,750
It...

124
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,790
“Raise flowers and have pet birds.

125
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,380
Live happily for every second”.

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,150
A perfect match.

127
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,840
You buffoons.

128
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,310
Dad, Mom. Red packets!

129
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,670
Wish you good fortune.

130
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,870
Red packets, please!

131
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,550
Here! Red packets!

132
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,870
You two buffoons.

133
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,310
(Bliss)

134
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,510
It’s really a big red packet.

135
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,720
I haven’t been so happy

136
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,220
on Spring Festival for long.

137
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Any other events in your family?

138
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,140
Take mine.

139
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,950
That’s a hard job.

140
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,580
You are indeed in a medical family.

141
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,430
We change medicine cards every year.

142
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,520
(Cortex Ailanthi)

143
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,110
Five hundred cards with regular script.

144
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,630
Be seated all the afternoon.

145
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,390
Will you get bored?

146
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,350
No.

147
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,720
These names are interesting.

148
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,670
I’ve never heard of them.

149
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,580
“Sandy Moon.” An elegant name.

150
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,550
For eye diseases and detoxification.

151
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,510
Is it herbal medicine?

152
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:50,990
No.

153
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,220
What is it?

154
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,780
Hare dung.

155
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,480
“Luminous Night Sand” (bat’s droppings)

156
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,870
couldn’t be something good.

157
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,020
No. No.

158
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,030
“White Lilac” is good.

159
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,140
Is it lilac?

160
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,310
Take it out and smell it.

161
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,220
How is it?

162
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,550
Smells bad.

163
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,020
Sparrow droppings.

164
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,190
All the medicines here

165
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,820
are droppings?

166
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,460
Not really.

167
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,140
The first row at the top.

168
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,380
The first cell.

169
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,630
Rou Cong Rong (Desertliving Cistanche).

170
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,190
The same name as mine. Not droppings.

171
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,270
I’m glad for it.

172
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,660
What does it cure?

173
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,950
Invigorate organs.

174
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,870
Replenish Qi. Good to have babies.

175
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,550
Go back to babies again.

176
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,630
Would you like to write?

177
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,510
I don’t write well.

178
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,550
It’s fine. I can teach you.

179
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,430
Like this? Right?

180
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,990
The ancients said, “study with a lady”.

181
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,700
It’s like this, I guess.

182
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,040
(Cong Rong)

183
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,950
You write it wrong.

184
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,020
You’ve missed a character.

185
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,460
It’s right.

186
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,020
These two characters are better.

187
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,030
Wen Shaoqing! Shame on you!

188
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,400
You’ve written Cong Rong
in the family tree

189
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,540
before you marry her.

190
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,980
Don’t you feel ashamed of it?

191
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,980
What is he talking about?

192
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,390
I don’t know.

193
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,950
Please sit, Uncle.

194
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,040
You may sit.

195
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,100
One chair for each person.

196
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,100
You’re dead.

197
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,340
Only this time. Never do it again.

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,550
Grandpa, I’ll only marry once.

199
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,740
There won’t be a next time.

200
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,220
There is Cong Rong on it.

201
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,700
Are Wen Qing and Wen Gu some big names?

202
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,640
(Wen Qing, Wen Gu)
Yeah.

203
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,950
(Wen Qing, Wen Gu)
Not big names.

204
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,390
My son and daughter to be born.

205
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,350
So soon?

206
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,820
No! It’s not true!

207
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,220
Shaoqing. Don’t talk nonsense.

208
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,460
Yeah. You startled Cong Rong.

209
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,430
I mean it.

210
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,430
Grandpa. Grandma. Dad. Mom.

211
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,580
Uncle.

212
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,220
On this New Year,

213
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,550
I’m back with Cong Rong

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,430
to tell you something.

215
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,740
We mean to have babies.

216
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,590
Wen Shaoqing.

217
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,310
Stop blabbering!

218
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,820
She hasn’t agreed, though.

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,390
As per the law, we need to get married

220
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,270
before having babies.

221
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,950
I agree.

222
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,590
It’s good.

223
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,860
Great! Great!

224
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,580
We’ll have four generations in our family.

225
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,310
Hurry and set the date.

226
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,670
Book good hotels as soon as possible.

227
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,550
Yeah, list the guests to be invited.

228
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,070
Roughly, over 20 tables

229
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,280
should be booked just for Yun Ji Hospital.

230

I come to have a check.

258
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,460
You’ve reviewed my thesis for long.

It depends on whose it’s compared with.

Have some water.

310
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,390
Thank you, Mrs. Wen.

311
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,270
What can I do for you?

312
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,430
No, thanks.

313
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,820
Mrs. Wen, we can take care of these.

314

Girls put candies in and tie ribbons.

317
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,980
I’ll seal the lids.

319
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,310
I have a question.

320
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,700
Make a bowknot or a surgical knot?

321
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,280
My foot.

322
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,000
A surgical knot?

323
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,180
You must be crazy. A surgical knot...

324
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,390
Come on. Hurry up.

325
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,820
Get started,

326
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,950
or candies will be eaten up.

327
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,860
What should I do, Zhong Zhen?

328
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,390
Go away.

329
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,550
How dare you?

330
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,310
My boss doesn’t allow you to work.

331
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,220
Or he’ll beat me up.

332
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,550
Go away.

333
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,670
Don’t ruin my bright future.

334
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,580
Go. Go. Go.

335
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,340
Are you writing wedding invitations?

336
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,070
What’s up?

337
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,180
They drove me here,

338
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,550
not allowing me to do anything.

339
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,190
What is the bride supposed to do?

340
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,340
Wait for the wedding, perhaps.

341
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,710
The couple, Xiao Ziyuan and Sui Yi.

342
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,740
Sounds familiar.

343
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,220
I told you about them,

344
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,710
my cousin and cousin-in-law.

345
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,590
I wrapped candies for them

346
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,860
when they got married.

347
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,460
I remember.

348
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,920
The bride who cried her eyes out

349
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,040
at the wedding.

350
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,740
Yeah.

351
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,280
Few brides don’t cry

352
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,310
on their weddings.

353
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,550
It must be because

354
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,470
they are too happy.

355
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,220
What about you?

356
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,820
Will you cry on our wedding?

357
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,310
I will not.

358
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,190
A sweet fragrance on you.

359
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,220
You stole and ate candies?

360
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,190
You want some?
I’m stealing one for you.

361
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,740
You are my sweetest candy.

362
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:19,540

Come on. To the center, please.

Three, two, one. OK. Nice.

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,500
This way, please.

400
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,470
To the center, please.

401
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,000

Great.

It’s not in court.

406
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,950
Come on.

407
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,510
Ready. Three, two, one.

408
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,070
Cheese!

409
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,590
Nice! Good!

410
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,350
The wedding is so tiring.

411
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,820
My feet are swollen.

412
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,460
I told you to wear flatties.
You didn’t listen.

413
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,300
Come here.

414
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,780
Take off your shoes.

415
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,740
Let me give you a massage.

416
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,670
Thanks.

417
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,780
Excuse me, Sir, Miss.

418
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,060
Ten minutes to go.

419
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,200
Take a break now.

420
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,950
We’ll start at 6:18 PM.

421
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,790
When it gets started,

422
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,710
the door will open.

423
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,040
You may go in

424
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,680
when the light is on.

425
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,280
OK.

426
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,070
OK.

427
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,790
Sir.

428
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,200
Please go in now and wait.

429
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,480
You’ll go to the stage from there.

430
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,150
OK. Got it.

431
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,670
OK. I’m going for it.

432
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,740
I’m going there.

433
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,390
See you.

434
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,310
Rong, are you here alone?

435
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,310
Where is Wen Shaoqing?

436
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,070
He just went in.

437
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,960
I saw him run out

438
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,110
from the backstage in a hurry.

439
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,500
I thought he came to you.

440
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,630
He didn’t.

441
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,430
I’m gonna have a look.

442
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,500
Look. He isn’t here.

443
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,460
He didn’t answer the call.

444
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:14,980
Rong.

445
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,230
Are you looking for me? What’s up?

446
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,300
Where is your boss?

447
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,590
I don’t know.

448
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,740
I really don’t.

449
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,430
Tell me or you’re dead.

450
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,300
Rong. Don’t make it hard on me.

451
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,200
Remember.

452
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,040
My boss doesn’t mean to

453
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,430
leave any regret on your wedding.

454
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,190
A double meaning in your words?

455
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,440
Did he go to the hospital

456
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,310
for an emergency?

457
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,260
Was he afraid to irritate me?

458
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,980
I didn’t say that.

459
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,110
Should we put off the wedding?

460
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,540
Nothing good comes easy.

461
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,620
Distinguished guests, friends,

462
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,280
the wedding ceremony is about to begin.

463
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,310
Ladies and gentlemen,

464
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,780
please be patient.

465
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,830
Let’s wait for this happy
and sweet moment

466
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,980
of these two lovebirds.

467
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,440
Here she is.

468
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,240
Look, the bride is out.

469
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,790
Is the procedure right?

470
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,260
Let’s see.

471
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,470
What’s going on? Why is Cong Rong alone?

472
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,150
I... I don’t know.

473
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,870
Where is Shaoqing?

474
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,060
Why is she out alone?

475
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,240
Why you came out earlier?

476
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,710
It’s not the time yet.

477
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,910
The groom went to the hospital
for an emergency.

478
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,720
What?

479
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,590
Give me the microphone.

480
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,870
Hello, everyone.

481
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,700
Thank you for coming to my wedding.

482
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,980
There are some unexpected situations.

483
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,430
I’d like to explain to you.

484
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,220
My love, Wen Shaoqing, is a surgeon.

485
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,430
Being with him,

486
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,700
I can’t remember how many times

487
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,630
he’s gone back to hospital late at night.

488
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,740
It’s the routine of his life.

489
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,780
I used to ask myself

490
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,980
if I’d blame him.

491
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,590
No.

492
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,020
Not even today.

493
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,060
Between the patient
whose life is on the line,

494
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,110
and my wedding,

495
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,700
I choose to back him up.

496
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,430
I admire him. I’m proud of him.

497
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,500
I know,

498
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,950
he’s ready for his lancet at any time.

499
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,870
His every brief parting with me

500
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,590
is to help patients on the operating table

501
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,630
so that they can see their families soon.

502
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,980
In fact, I almost missed him.

503
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,430
You’re finally here.

504
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,220
I’ve been long waiting for you.

505
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,710
I’m in danger. What is it to do with you?

506
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,070
Who am I to you?

507
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,440
I’ve had a crush on her for decades.

508
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,680
She might not even know I like her.

509
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,870
I said I’ve loved someone for long.

510
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,670
It is you,

511
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,500
the one I’ve been waiting for,

512
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,870
the Swordswoman I’ve been longing for.

513
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,350
I’m Cong Rong in Class 11.

514
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,390
You can call me Swordswoman.

515
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,390
Yet I haven’t told you

516
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,830
I’m Wen Shaoqing from Class 9.

517
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,670
See you next term. I’m waiting for you!

518
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,430
A dependable man

519
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,190
shall promise her a lifetime commitment.

520
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,590
Luckily, he’s been waiting for me.

521
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,670
Today is our wedding.

522
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,540
I don’t mind standing here
and waiting for him.

523
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,060
Since I decided to
live the rest of my life with him,

524
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,540
I’ve been wishing

525
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,350
to back him up all my life.

526
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,110
Wish I’d never break my word.

527
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,540
I’m doomed. A big mistake.

528
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,870
Boss.

529
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,020
Sorry. Boss.

530
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,480
You said I must not reveal the surprise

531
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,310
to Cong Rong.

532
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:39,980
So I...

533
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,390
It turned out to be
a big misunderstanding.

534
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,060
You may hit me.

535
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,500
Thanks.

536
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,670
Or I couldn’t have heard these.

537
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,740
Cong Rong.

538
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,830
My apology.

539
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,430
Sorry.

540
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,020
I’ve prepared you a surprise.

541
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,870
I didn’t even tell Zhou Chengcheng.

542
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,060
Don’t be angry with me.

543
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,060
I wrote a song for you,

544
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,720
my very first song.

545
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,740
Don’t know.

546
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,700
I’ve been practicing,

547
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,300
but I still feel nervous.

548
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,190
Pardon me

549
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,350
if I don’t sing it well. Alright?

550
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,060

We are childhood sweethearts.

561
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,260
I’ve had a crush on her for decades.

562
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,060
Badly, I can’t have her.

563
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,740
Why are you bullying him?

564
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,390
What are you doing? It hurts! Be gentle.

565
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,590
If you pass,

566
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,870
be my girlfriend.

567
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,790
What if I fail?

568
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,830
Then you win.

569
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,980
I’ll lose myself to you,

570
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,540
and be your boyfriend.

571
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,540
If I lose the lawsuit,

572
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,540
I can no longer be a doctor.

573
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,390
Will you still be with me?

574
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,390
I want to protect what is right,

575
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,150
and the ones I care about.

576
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,740
Please protect me then, Miss Cong.

577
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,540
Rest assured.

578
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,220
I won’t allow anything to happen to you.

579
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,700
You are so special.

580
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,020
The man I love glows with light,

581
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,190
shiny but not divine.

582
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,070
The happiest thing is that

583
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,760
the one you’ve been waiting for

584
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,300
is also waiting for you.

585
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,220
You lied to me.

586
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,460
Do you know the consequence
of lying to a lawyer?

587
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,540
I’m your man anyway.

588
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,980
You can do anything to me.

589
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,820
Wen Shaoqing.

590
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,720
The Marriage Law only protects
your property,

591
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,150
not your love.

592
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,700
My love has me

593
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,870
to protect it.

594
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,910
You wake up.

595
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,590
What would you like to eat?

596
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,740
Yogurt ice cream?

597
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,460
OK.

598
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,260
Where did you get it?

599
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:10,780
By magic.

600
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,150
How about going to Iceland
for honeymoon?

601
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,590
No worries about visas and luggage.

602
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,150
You’d like to see Aurora, right?

603
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,780
Wen Shaoqing.

604
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,060
I once saw you as a dream, not an ideal.

605
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,110
An ideal can be achieved by hard work,

606
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,630
but a dream is a gift from Heaven.

607
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,220
So lucky I am to have you.

608
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,500
Honey.

609
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,060
I love you.

610
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,000
(After a few years)

611
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,390
About the Daren Law Firm,

612
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,950
I believe you’ve heard a lot about it.

613
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,860
To stay here,
you have to pass the internship.

614
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,390
You’ll draw the lot to decide

615
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,760
which company you will be assigned to.

616
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,020
Thank you, Ms. Cong.

617
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,590
It gives me confidence

618
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,670
that you’ll take this case.

619
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,910
I’m flattered. I’ll go all out for it.

620
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,190
My assistant will talk with you
about contract details.

621
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,110
Keep in touch.

622
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,500
OK. I’ll take my leave.

623
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,630
Morning.

624
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,140
Ms. Lucy.

625
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,060
Which company did Ms. Cong go
for internship?

626
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,700
Yun Ji Hospital.

627
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,350
You’re drinking coffee again.

628
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,950
Why can’t I?

629
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,870
You have a poor stomach, don’t you?

630
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,790
You’d better have some milk.

631
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,670
Give it to me.

632
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,630
Do you really like me?

633
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,700
Um.

634
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,980
Let’s have dinner tonight.

635
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,390
I said,

636
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,590
let’s have dinner tonight.

637
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,940
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

638
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,260
Cong Rong. The result is out.

639
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,780
An unexpected result.

640
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,740
Get mentally prepared.

641
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,220
I’m back.

642
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,590
Go wash your hands.

643
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,620
We have goodies for dinner.

644
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,460
What goodies?

645
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,660
How is it?

646
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,500
You are so kind to me.

647
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,230
You just knew it?

648
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,830
Given your good performance all the time,

649
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,590
I have a big gift for you.

650
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,390
OK.

651
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,750
Gift accepted.

652
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,790
What is it?

653
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,790
Wen Qing, Wen Gu.

654
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:42,830
Do you like the gift?

655
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,710
Yes, I like it.

656
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,430
I see.

657
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,600
What’s wrong? What happened at home?

658
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,590
Big news.

659
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,910
I’m gonna be Grandpa.

660
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,870
What?

661
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,390
Wen Shaoqing called me that

662
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,750
Cong Rong is carrying a twin.

663
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,080
Really?

664
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,980
Well... Will I be Grandma?

665
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Not yet,

666
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,350
you haven’t married me.

667
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,310
You’re right.

668
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,860
Zhou Chengcheng.

669
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,500
How long have we been traveling?

670
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,390
Two years?

671
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,180
I’m tired somewhat.

672
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,230
How about we make do and get married?

673
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,020
Make do?

674
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,790
What do you mean by that?

675
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,430
You neither propose to me

676
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,230
nor give me a reason to marry you.

677
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,870
A reason? Let me think now.

678
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,500
Got it.

679
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,180
When we are old,
we may sit freely in the yard.

680
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,430
Among the flowers, we listen to the rain.

681
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,660
Under the starry sky, we enjoy the moon.

682
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,910
Cloudy or cloudless,
