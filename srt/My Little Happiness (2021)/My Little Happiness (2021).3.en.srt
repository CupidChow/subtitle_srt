Hello.

90
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,580
When did you become so close that

91
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,090
you’re having dinner together?

92
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,120
What drink do you want?

93
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,330
Water, please.

94
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,650
I haven’t interrogated you yet.

95
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,880
Now you’re turning yourself in?

96
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,700
What happened?

97
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,810
What?

98
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,180
He’s just finished an operation

99
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,290
and came here for dinner.

100
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,410
Don’t overthink.

101
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,680
Rong.

102
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,580
Don’t you think he’s the type

103
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,620
who’s cold on the outside
but passionate on the inside?

104
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,970
Zhou Chengcheng.

105
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,800
He can’t hear us.

106
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,970
If it weren’t for my Lulu

107
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,640
who treats me like a queen,

108
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,650
I’ll pursue him myself.

109
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,770
Stop. Stop. Stop.

110
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,560
Did you see that?

111
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:28,500
Fine.

112
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,330
Go, go, go.

113
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,060
Forget about me.

114
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,800
Go ahead.

115
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,560
It’s raining.

116
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,530
Why are you sitting outside?

117
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,770
Don’t you feel cold?

118
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,020
This is a very trendy restaurant

119
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,040
where people have to
wait in lines all night.

120
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,620
It’s fortunate that we can find a seat.

121
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,210
Others would beg for our seats.

122
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,170
Really?

123
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,140
You spend most of your time
with the patients.

124
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,170
This information is
beyond your field of expertise.

125
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,410
You’re right.

126
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,440
So, in the future, when you’re free,

127
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,370
you can find time to educate me more.

128
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,040
We can teach each other.

129
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,240
Does an operation really take so long?

130
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,410
Some may take even longer.

131
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,440
Have you seen an operation
that takes 24 hours?

132
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,890
Does it really take that long?

133
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,050
What if you want to use the restroom?

134
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,090
What if you’re tired?

135
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,770
Brain surgeries are complicated.

136
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,600
They often require group cooperation.

137
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,210
So when the other surgeons
are operating,

138
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,530
I can adjust myself.

139
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,040
Come on.

140
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,330
This is our original
Sichuan style steak.

141
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,260
Have a try.

142
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,040
Thank you.

143
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,170
Take your time.

144
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,330
Do you know how to cut through
a person’s skull?

145
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,730
How?

146
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,170
First, you have to shave his hair.

147
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,800
Then you use a fretsaw

148
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,000
to cut through the skull

149
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,290
and remove the bone flap.

150
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,330
Cut the dura.

151
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,600
Find the location of the tumor.

152
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,360
And remove it.

153
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,120
Then the operation is completed.

154
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,480
You did this on purpose?

155
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,290
But, unfortunately,

156
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,890
this won’t affect my appetite.

157
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,240
Don’t throw up.

158
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,290
It’ll be embarrassing
if your friend sees.

159
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,210
This is too spicy.

160
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,210
Aren’t you good at eating spicy food?

161
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,330
Who said that?

162
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,090
I never eat spicy food.

163
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,050
Doughnut.

164
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,480
You’re not full again?

165
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,680
Great.

166
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,090
I can’t finish mine.

167
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,120
You can have mine.

168
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,290
You lied to me.

169
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,850
Doughnut.

170
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,080
You’re a fat spinning top

171
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,260
that can’t spin

172
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,440
because you’re too big.

173
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,920
Why are you bullying him?

174
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,600
It’s none of your business.

175
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,560
I’m the swordswoman.

176
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,770
At the sight of injustice,

177
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,130
I shall draw a sword and help.

178
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,720
Let me eat it for you.

179
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,490
Is spicy food really that scary?

180
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,650
You really can’t eat spicy food?

181
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,200
Dr. Wen,

182
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,170
are you obsessed with eating spicy food?

183
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,920
Or,

184
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,740
your standard for friendship

185
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,040
is evaluated by one’s ability
to eat spicy food?

186
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,920
If you’re not scared of them,

187
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,960
they can’t bully you.

188
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,530
Okay.

189
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,200
All right.

190
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,370
If they bully you again,

191
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,560
come to me for help.

192
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,800
Thank you.

193
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,920
Where can I find you?

194
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,010
Class Eleven.

195
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,960
My name is Cong Rong.

196
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,130
You can also call me swordswoman.

197
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,770
I have a friend.

198
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,450
She lied to me.

199
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,170
I see.

200
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,170
It seems that you’re really
holding a grudge.

201
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,960
I really want to figure out
what’s in her head.

202
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,060
(Western cuisine)

203
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,080
Don’t catch a cold.

204
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,680
Let’s go see Mr. Lin later.

205
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,860
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

206
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,010
Mr. Lin?

207
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,530
So he actually eats.

208
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,920
If he really has been fasting for days,

209
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,290
he would be receiving glucose now.

210
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,890
How do you know he’s eating here?

211
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,560
Did you send food to him?

212
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,290
It was Zhong Zhen.

213
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,220
Zhong Zhen is so simple.

214
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,860
If you hadn’t said anything,

215
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,250
how was he supposed to think of this?

216
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,130
I thought you were so rational
that you became indifferent.

217
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,220
Mr. Lin’s brain tumor

218
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,560
is now oppressing his brain stem.

219
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,250
It’s a time bomb

220
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,890
that might explode at any time.

221
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,770
Rather than letting him go home,

222
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,040
it’s better to keep him supervised.

223
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,130
If that’s the case,

224
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,130
why did you allow him to leave?

225
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,920
I’m a neurosurgeon.

226
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,720
I’m not the god.

227
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,080
My job is to cure their body.

228
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,400
But I can’t change the way they think,

229
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,040
nor can I change their life’s path.

230
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,010
I can only respect their choice.

231

(Cong Rong)

240
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,940
(Well done. I’ve given you
a few comments. You can submit it.)

241
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,580
(Thank you.)

242

(You had a tough day.
Go to bed earlier.)

243
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,060
(Good night.)

244
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,900
(You too. Good night.)

245
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,770
See you tomorrow.

She’s the girl in the photo?

254
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,170
Yes, she is.

255
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,890
Director Yan.

256
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,260
Yes?

257
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,220
This is the briefing
Dr. Wen wrote overnight

258
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,840
and the responsibility
confirmation report I wrote.

259
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,890
After I’ve communicated it with Dr. Wen,

260
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,490
I can discuss it in details
with Mr. Lin.

261

(Briefing on

262
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,090
Great.

263
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,170
This is very detailed.

Cong.

265
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,610
Dr. Wen is pretty nice, right?

266
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,770
In which aspect?

267
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,720
Personality or professional competence?

268
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,800
Nothing.

269
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,490
Go talk to Dr. Wen.

270
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,290
Cong Rong.

271
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,530
She is the new legal intern.

272
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
Really?

273
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,490
She just arrived a few days ago.

274
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,860
This happened so fast?

275
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,620
Romance

276
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,370
is about feelings.

277
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,080
If time is all that matters,

278
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,890
the kid of Dr. Wen and me
would be over 3 years old

279
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,170
because I’ve been here

280
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,530
since Dr. Wen was an intern.

281
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,130
In your dreams.

282
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,170
What is that?

283
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,810
I heard a rumor.

284
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,570
What?

285
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,500
The one in the photo is not Cong Rong.

286
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,100
Who is it then?

287
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,320
It’s Dr. Qin.

288
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,840
I said so.

289
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,640
It must be Dr. Qin.

290
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,220
Dr. Wen and Dr. Qin
are supposed to be together.

291
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,200
No.

292
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,920
I don’t agree with that.

293
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,240
I think Dr. Qin and Zhong Zhen
are meant to be.

294
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,780
That’s more acceptable to me.

295
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,750
One vote for Zhong Zhen.

296
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,550
He posted that photo.

297
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,070
Why did you vote for him?

298
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,510
Speak of the devil.

299
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,220
Dr. Zhong,

300
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,310
you dropped your casebook.

301
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,620
You dropped your integrity as well.

302
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,390
Cousin.

303
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,040
Tell me.

304
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,150
What have you done?

305
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,070
I didn’t mean to leak it.

306
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,610
Last night after work,

307
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,170
I helped Boss deliver food to Mr. Lin.

308
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,200
Boss told me that

309
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,840
I must not be found.

310
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,250
But a nurse happened to pass by.

311
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,370
So, in the panic...

312
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,440
Zhong Zhen,

313
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,980
why don’t you go home after work?

314
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,040
What are you here for?

315
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,490
What did you just put there?

316
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,080
I...

317
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,490
Isn’t this the time for our daily routine
of worshiping Dr. Wen’s beauty?

318
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,850
Look.

319
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,140
I’ve taken enough photos.

320
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,530
I have over nine photos.

321
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,100
Really?

322
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,170
Then send them right now.

323
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,690
Sure.

324
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,680
Remember to send in full sizes.

325
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,900
Done.

326
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,890
Take your time and enjoy.

327
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,050
That’s it.

328
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,240
(Yun Ji Dr. Wen’s fan group)
That’s how the photo was leaked.

329
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,450
(What’s going on?)
I didn’t mean to send it.

330
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,500
(I’m jealous.)
But I was afraid that Boss’s plan

331
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,480
(I want to lean on his shoulders.)
will fail if people find out

332
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,000
(I can’t believe this is true.)
that we’re delivering food to Mr. Lin.

333
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,710
The heaven and earth

334
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,900
can testify for my integrity.

335
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,230
It was an accident.

336
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,860
I almost believed you.

337
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,270
Did you take the photo or not?

338
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,910
Photo? What photo?

339
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,510
Everything you say now

340

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,580
I confess.

343
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,830
I took the photo.

344
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,820
But when I took it,
I didn’t know it was you.

345
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,860
Besides, I didn’t mean to send it.

346
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,180
When I realized it,

347
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,620
it was too late to recall.

348
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,270
It was just a mistake?

349
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,950
Wait for me!

350
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,070
Wait for me!

351
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,660
What are you planning again?

352
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,660
Come in.

353
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,120
I’ve reviewed Mr. Lin’s case.

354
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,620
I think it wasn’t
the hospital’s responsibility.

355
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,140
From today on, I’ll try to persuade
Mr. Lin to leave the hospital.

356
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,860
According to the hospital’s
customary practice,

357
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,190
the patient and the doctor

358
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,310
will meet at
the general reception office.

359
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,590
When will you have time?

360
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,750
I need to see him anyway.

361
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,590
Why don’t you arrange a time?

362
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,710
How about 3:30 this afternoon?

363
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,380
OK.

364
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,340
I’ll go see him now.

365
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,140
Wait.

366
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,820
Is the general reception office so busy

367
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,100
that people can’t have a chat?

368
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,030
What else do you need?

369
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,070
Are you free at 6 or 7 o’clock?

370
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,310
Do you have to work on the cases
during your free time?

371
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,340
Aren’t you gonna educate me
on the trendy restaurants?

372
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,660
I’m still waiting.

373
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,360
Are you trying to create more rumors?

374
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,310
Dr. Wen.

375
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,230
What rumors?

376
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,030
Haven’t you heard it this morning?

377
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,510
It’s been spreading all over
the hospital.

378
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,230
Should we clear that up?

379
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,100
Well.

380
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,270
Rumors are like neural paralysis.

381
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,820
They spread quickly
but go away quickly as well.

382
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,230
Don’t mind it.

383
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,870
Don’t you think it’s like a tumor?

384
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,600
If you don’t get rid of it,

385
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,550
won’t you be afraid
that it might mutate?

386
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,750
Well done.

387
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,070
You can now make examples
with medical terminologies?

388
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,550
I’m not kidding.

389
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,990
I’m new here.

390
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,750
It’s not right to let others
mistake our relationship.

391
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,880
Shouldn’t you clear up the rumors

392
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,430
and keep your distance with me?

393
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,380
I don’t think we need
to keep a distance.

394
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,180
I don’t agree.

395
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,950
But...

396
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,420
But if you insist,

397
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,140
I can help you out this time.

398
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,180
I can help you clear up the rumors.

399
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,270
Really?

400
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,550
But you’ll owe me one.

401
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,430
Well,

402
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,340
(Nurse Station)
there are three choices. A, B, and C.

403
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,310
Let’s bet.

404
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,950
Losers have to pay for
the afternoon tea.

405
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,900
Great.

406
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,120
Let’s have afternoon tea.

407
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,310
Why don’t I make a bet too?

408
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,270
Dr. Wen.

409
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,580
The rumors are getting more outrageous.

410
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,380
Let me clear that up.

411
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,190
So, is it really Cong Rong?

412
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,080
No, no, no.

413
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,950
No.

414
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,900
You’re right.

415
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,270
That’s her.

416
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,470
What are you talking about?

417
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,580
What’s your relationship?

418
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,030
We...

419
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,180
We are childhood sweethearts.

420
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,790
I’ve been secretly having a crush
on her for decades.

421
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,950
Unfortunately,

422
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,750
my love hasn’t been reciprocated.

423
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,920
Wait.

424
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,150
Secretly having a crush for decades?

425
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:06,640
Dr. Wen.

426
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,030
May I ask how old are you?

427
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,150
Well done. Dr. Wen.

428
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,750
You have such a creative way
to clear up rumors.

429
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,460
That’s it.

430
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:14,880
That’s it.

431
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,860
That’s it.

432
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,510
Are you crazy?

433
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,920
The rumors have been cleared up.

434
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,990
Are you serious?

435
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,340
How do you think?

436
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,380
Does he have a grudge against me?

437
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,990
He’s always like that.

438
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,070
He’s so evil inside.

439
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,510
Really?

440
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,400
When he was in university,

441
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,950
a person used to copy his answers.

442
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,550
So he intentionally filled in the wrong
answers with the multiple choices.

443
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,500
That person copied
all the wrong answers.

444
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,990
And their teacher was furious.

445
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,950
He’s a recidivist.

446
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,630
No wonder!

447
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,160
His smile conceals his ill-intentions.

448
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,860
You really don’t know
what he’s thinking about.

449
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,340
I thought you’re getting along well.

450
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,940
What?

451
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,900
He’s teasing me for fun.

452
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,470
Fine.

453
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,470
I’ll scold him for you.

Please, no.

460
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,030
What?

461
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,270
I’ll do it myself.

No, no, no!

he won’t do it again.)

465
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,070
if you put this up?

466
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,270

467
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,860
there’s really no need for this?

Yes.

Are you in a good mood?

470
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,030
Can I have a few more days
with the dissertation?

471
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,270
Why do you think so?

472
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,710
I figured it out the moment I saw it.

473
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,750
Who am I?

474
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,910
I can read your mind.

475
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,820
Then guess the reason.

476
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,030
What happened today?

477
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,070
Because of the rumors?

478
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,580
Fine.

479
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,180
The deadline for the dissertation
is deferred to next Friday.

480

00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,980
My head.

512
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,320
They hurt like hell.

513
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,550
Don’t worry.

514
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,590
I’m here today

515
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,470
because I have some good news for you.

516
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,950
Our company

517
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,710
has a new bed.

518
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,710
A European one.

519
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,180
Just one.

520
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,670
Of course,

521
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,900
it’s a bit pricey.

522
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,870
You have no idea

523
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,550
how the other directors
are trying to rob me of the bed.

524
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,340
Pricey? How pricey is it?

525
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,400
I might not have enough money.

526
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,600
Well. That’s fine.

527
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,260
You don’t have to pay right away.

528
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,990
Well.

529
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,270
We have a public lecture today.

530
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,310
And there’s a chance to try it for free.

531
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,990
How about I take you there?

532
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,980
You can try the bed.

533
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,140
If it’s comfortable,

534
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,470
you can find ways to pay for it.

535
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:05,430
Let’s go.

536
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,940
Great.

537
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,740
Get in the car.

538
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,160
Let’s go.

539
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,950
Let’s go.

540
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,430
Come.

541
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,120
Well.

542
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,910
This way.

543
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,900
Be careful.

544
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,100
After you.

545
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,340
Go back to the company.

546
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:44,950
Okay.

547
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,550
I see.

548
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,600
Okay.

549
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,470
Don’t worry.

550
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,820
Okay.

551
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,380
Come home earlier.

552
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,750
Okay.

553
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,420
Bye-bye.

554
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,140
Listen.

555
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,900
I’d rather die than going there

556
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,340
the next time they ask me to.

557
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,800
I’d rather just be a walker-on.

558
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,420
Right!

559
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,470
That’s disgusting.

560
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,590
The steak almost had me

561
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,710
lose my teeth.

562
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,860
And the spaghetti

563
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,220
is too spicy.

564
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,710
Did they cook it with hot pot seasoning?

565
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,260
You know what?

566
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,030
It’s better if we just
eat instant noodles here.

567
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,030
Yes.

568
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,470
If it weren’t for
the commission of 100 yuan,

569
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,900
I wouldn’t go there.

570
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,990
What are you talking about?

571
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,380
What 100 yuan?

572
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,900
Who gave you 100 yuan?

573
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,990
Make it clear.

574
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,670
We’ve signed
a confidentiality agreement.

575
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,340
Right.

576
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,070
What confidentiality agreement?

577
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,080
I’ll give you 500 yuan.

578
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,900
Are you telling me or not?

579
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,750
Isn’t this clear enough?

580
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,310
Why are you here?

581
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,630
The fool of the rich doesn’t know
where rice comes from.

582
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,710
Now, I’ve seen a modern version.

583
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,620
What do you mean?

584
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,180
Can’t you just be straightforward?

585
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,950
Let me translate it out of kindness.

586
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,510
Who else, besides your parents,

587
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,900
will pay for the grandiosity
of your restaurant?

588
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,420
We didn’t say anything.

589
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,990
We didn’t.

590
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,820
Nothing.

591
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,560
Hello.

592
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,270
Dad.

593
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,120
Where are you?

594
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,470
We need to talk.

595
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,660
(Treasures fill the home.)

596
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,420
(Xihuantong Medical Equipment Co., Ltd)

597
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,470
The importance of sleep is obvious.

598
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,510
(Xihuantong Medical Equipment Co., Ltd)

599
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,030
Our physiotherapy bed

600
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,710
can help cure sleep problems

601
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,880
for all of you.

602
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,820
When you get older,

603
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,900
your sleep becomes lighter.

604
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,030
Sleeping in this bed is helpful.

605
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,140
You can read the instructions

606
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,550
to learn more about the product.

607
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,860
What are you doing?

608
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,380
Who?

609
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,710
What are you doing here?

610
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,710
I... I... I’m...

611
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,310
Give me your phone.

612
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,030
Give it to me.

613
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,030
Give it to me.

614
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,180
Give it to me.

615
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,070
We said we would meet at 3:30 pm.

616
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,160
Honey.

617
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,380
You’re on the first floor.

618
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,270
I went to the wrong place.

619
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,080
Fine.

620
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,070
I’m coming down now.

621
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,670
(Western cuisine)

622
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,230
Next one. No. 32.

623
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,660
Come in.

624
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,800
This way, please.

625
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,710
Wait a second, please.

626
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,950
Here.

627
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,320
Check out the menu.
What do you want?

628
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,670
What have you accomplished?

629
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,030
If it weren’t for me,

630
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,140
your restaurant
would’ve closed long ago.

631
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,920
You’re a girl.

632
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,790
Why do you have to work so hard?

633
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,710
Do you want to be a woman entrepreneur?

634
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,320
Opening the restaurant is just for fun.

635
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,360
As long as you’re happy,

636
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,460
you can take our family’s money
as what you’ve earned.

637
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,430
Your father can still

638
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,980
afford this.

639
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,560
This is our love for you.

640
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,940
Let’s go.

641
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,230
We’re closed today.

642
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,750
Go home.

643
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,750
We’ve been waiting for quite a while.

644
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,430
We’re closed.

645
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:57,990
We haven’t started yet.

646
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,430
We’re closed.

647
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,470
What’s going on?

648
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,430
Bye.

649
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:00,800
We’re very sorry.

650
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,160
We’re very sorry.

651
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,070
We’re very sorry.

652
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,900
Let’s go.

653
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:04,910
We’re very sorry.

654
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,430
We’re very sorry.

655
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,070
We’re very sorry.

656
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:08,950
We’re closed.

657
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,710
Let’s go.

658
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,160
Come again next time.

659
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,860
We’re very sorry.

660
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,750
Go home, you two.

661
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,030
We’re closed today.

(Lulu)

663
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,110
Hello.

664
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,070
Lulu.

665
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,750
Where are you?

666
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,180
Come back.

667
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,840
Haven’t I told you that

668
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,310
I went out for a business conversation?

669
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,860
I don’t care.

670
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,990
Come back right now to console me.

671
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,220
Listen.

672
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,790
I argued with my dad.

673
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,190
I want to cut off my relationship
with him.

674
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,820
So, I have to depend on you recently.

675
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,360
You won’t turn your back on me, right?

676
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,860
You won’t leave me, right?

677
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,380
Hello.

678
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,820
What did you just say?

679
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,140
It’s a bit noisy around me.

680
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,360
Hello.

681
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,140
Hello.

682
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,310
Hello.

683
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,120
Stop at the roots of a cabbage.

684
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,600
Hold on to one of it with the fingers.

685
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,160
Take your time.

686
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,990
We’re not closing soon.

687
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,560
Thank you.

688
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,470
This book is quite interesting.

689
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,950
It’s boring.

690
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,900
It’s boring to be alive.

691
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,710
If you buy it and read it
thoroughly at home,

692
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,220
you’ll have a different experience.

693
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,030
Right.

694
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,230
Nonsense!

695
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,790
All nonsense!

696
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,160
I’m sorry.

697
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,230
How about this?
You can sit here and read.

698
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,820
Right.

699
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,510
No one cares for me.

700
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,580
No one understands me.

701
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,070
You don’t even know what I want.

702
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,340
I’d rather just disappear!

703
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,820
I think the noise won’t die down here.

704
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,470
Bye.

705
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,360
I’m sorry.

706
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,230
I’m really sorry.

707
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,950
Goodbye.

708
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,950
You’re welcome to come by next time.

709
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,180
Why is there a new room?

710
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,180
How did you get in?

711
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,590
How did you get in?

712
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,630
Who are you?

713
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,100
Why are you breaking into my restaurant?

714
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,590
That is your restaurant.

715
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,680
And this is my place.

716
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,660
Nonsense!

717
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,070
This is my place.

718
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,430
I see.

719
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,830
This is Platform 9-3/4.

720
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,920
You’re drunk.

721
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,510
Go home.

722
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,030
Go.

723
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,840
I won’t go home.

724
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,950
I don’t have a home.

725
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:31,990
Let go of me!

726
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,700
No one cares about me in my family.

727
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,030
No one acknowledges me.

728
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,390
They only use money
to force me to give up.

729
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,390
Am I, Zhou Chengcheng, the type
of person who gives in to money?

730
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:02,430
I’m a loser.

731
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,280
You’re pathetic.

732
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,220
I’m pathetic too.

733
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,350
But you still have to go home.

734
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,030
Rise.

735
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,720
Come on.

736
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,320
One, two, three.

737
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,430
I’m not going home.

738
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,800
Let me go.

739
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,830
Let go of me!

740
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,790
What was dropped?

741
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,110
My career.

742
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,620
My romance.

743
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,830
Romance.

744
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,350
I want to...

745
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,550
I want to prove myself.

746
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,510
This is my bed.

747
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,700
This is uncomfortable.

748
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,310
It’s uncomfortable.

749
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,510
If you don’t move,
I’ll have to make you move.

750
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,220
This is uncomfortable.

751
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,510
Get up.

752
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,030
One.

753
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,070
I’m not moving.

754
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,030
Get up!

755
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,900
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

756
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,460
I suspect that there’s another reason
behind his request for refund.

757
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,660
This company doesn’t seem
to be a decent one.

758
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,020
It’s located at the food market
behind the hospital.

759
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,670
And it’s hidden in the abandoned house.

760
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,310
It’s so desolate.

761
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,240
When I start to film,

762
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,070
two men came out of nowhere
and tried to stop me.

763
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,880
What happened next?

764
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,200
You called right on time.

765
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,360
And I was smart.

766
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,470
I used it as an excuse and got away.

767
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,950
Next time...

768
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:17,870
Next time?

769
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,220
Are you really courageous enough
to do it again?

770
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,030
Don’t you think about the consequences?

771
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,580
I haven’t thought too much.

772
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,550
I just think I should not
leave Mr. Lin alone.

773
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,990
You have no idea

774
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,580
how shocked I was

775
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,990
when I heard about this.

776
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,780
Just do well in your job.

777
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,390
Those are the patients’
personal matters.

778
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,660
They have nothing to do with you.

779
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,990
Don’t get involved.

780
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,940
(Wife)

781
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,470
You’re her husband.

782
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,830
Come and pick her up.

783
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
You finally came.

784
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,470
Take her away.

785
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,030
She is about to eat me alive.

786
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,800
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

787
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,980
I’ll take her away right now.

788
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,990
What happened?

789
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,800
Why did you drink so much?

790
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,700
Where’s Lu?

791
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,180
Why are you here?

792
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,470
Your place isn’t the morgue after all.

793
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,750
Besides me,

794
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,180
you still have some visitors.

795
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,870
How come you know each other?

796
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,150
Who are you?

797
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,470
Don’t touch me!

798
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,620
I’m Cong Rong.

799
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,510
Rong.

800
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,660
There you are.

801
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,550
I’m not going home.

802
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:41,880
Fine.

803
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,800
Fine. Fine.

804
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,260
I’ll take you to my home, okay?

805
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,720
What do you mean?

806
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,830
You found her so quickly?

807
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,300
As you can see.

808
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,990
Great.

809
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,780
Things finally work out for you.

810
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,140
Does she still recognize you?

811
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,580
It’s natural that
she can’t recognize you.

812
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,760
No one’s like you

813
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,390
who can remember what happened
in your fourth grade.

814
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,470
She’s an average person.

815
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,390
You’re not.

816
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,390
So when will you tell her?

817
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,830
I may not.

818
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,070
It doesn’t matter
if she recognizes me or not.

819
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,990
What’s most important is
to keep her by my side.

820
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,670
You’re so cunning.

821
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,830
I admire you.

822
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,300
I’m flattered.

823
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,840
How about you?

824
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,220
So you’ll continue to go against
the wishes of your family.

825
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,550
What else can I do?

826
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,630
But now you’re in the same trench
with me,

827
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,620
I’m free.

828
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,460
From this point onward,

829
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,200
I’ll drink on my own.

830
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,880
I’ll hang out with my shadow.

831
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,990
I’ll bury myself in books.

832
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,180
Bye.

833
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,780
Slow down. Watch out.

834
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,590
She’s so wasted.

835
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,950
This way. This way.

836
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,150
Wen Shaoqing.

837
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,620
Yes?

838
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,240
Help me handle her for a moment.

839
00:38:59,240 --> 00:38:59,630
Okay.

840
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,550
I’ll get the shoes.

841
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,830
Cong Rong.

842
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,740
It seems that...

843
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,580
She threw up.

844
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,270
This is the biggest robe I can find.

845
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,190
Wear this for now.

846
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,870
I’ll ask Zhong Zhen to
send some men’s clothes.

847
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,460
(Settle Mr. Lin’s dispute)

848
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:19,620
(Dispute settlement)

849
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,840
Understanding the patients

850
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,950
is the first step to
successful dispute settlement.

851
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,180
Wen Shaoqing.

852
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,470
When I go over this humiliation,

853
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,300
I can conquer Mount Everest.

854
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,700
(Mount Everest 8848M
Yellow Mountain 1865M)

855
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,740
I’m a piece of junk.

856
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,060
A big piece of junk.

857
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,470
Nonsense.

858
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,030
I’ve never succeeded at anything.

859
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,910
Why did my dad say that to me?

860
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,070
But I couldn’t refute him.

861
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,100
Rong.

862
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,070
I don’t want to work hard anymore.

863
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,830
It’s so tiring.

864
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,670
You’re still young.

865
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,260
What do you expect to achieve?

866
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,070
If you don’t want to work hard,

867
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,760
you can stop for a moment.

868
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,030
Take some rest.

869
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,430
Go to sleep.

870
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,880
I just asked you to follow me

871
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,510
and experience the daily life
of a doctor.

872
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,910
You’re really good at improvising.

873
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,990
Isn’t that a good thing?

874
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,070
I didn’t graduate from a law school.

875
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,920
So this internship is
a hard-earned chance

876
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,030
for me.

877
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,620
I can only improvise.

878
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,260
If I don’t work harder than others,

879
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,220
I can’t catch up.

880
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,550
You corrected most parts of

881
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,950
the briefing I wrote.

882
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,140
I didn’t do well in my work.

883
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,550
And I was involved in rumors.

884
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,180
And my improvising

885
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,100
wasted your time.

886
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,140
Sometimes, I wonder.

887
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,030
Am I really that awful?

888
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,140
Do you want to hear the truth?

889
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,780
Tell me.

890
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,660
I’m prepared for the truth.

891
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,470
Actually, not many interns
can adjust themselves to

892
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,910
the hospital’s environment.

893
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,390
You did pretty well.

894
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,660
You’re special.

895
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,110
At that moment,

896
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,030
I’m a drop of water
that finally finds the wind.

897
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,070
I fall freely from the sky.

898
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,110
This is the acknowledgment
I’ve been looking forward to.

899
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,300
It makes me feel that

900
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,230
the 20 years of persistence,

901
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,380
4 years of betrayal,

902
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,070
and 12 hours of waiting

903
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,150
are all worthy.
