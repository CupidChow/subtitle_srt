He’d never be anywhere near me.

He’s right here.

You’re up.

46
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,660
Why did you drink so much?

47
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,860
I had to carry you upstairs.

48
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,260
What time is it?

49
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,190
3 AM.

Hey,

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,530
I made soup to sober you up.

52
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,160
Have some.

53
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,090
Hold it.

Rong,

55
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,480
I had a dream

56
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,930
that Wen Rang kissed me.

57
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,560
Your eyes are as red as rabbits’.

58
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,320
Do you really love him that much?

59
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,480
That doesn’t matter anymore.

60
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,800
Wen Rang has made it.

61
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,450
She’s back for him.

62
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,240
What a happy ending!

63
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,690
Just like you and Wen Shaoqing.

64
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,530
What about you?

65
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,410
What will you do?

66
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,040
Remember I once told you

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,010
he was good at singing?

68
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,700
Yeah.

69
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,480
I do.

70
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,240
Turns out he was singing their song.

71
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,500
I’ve never been part of their story

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,800
since the very beginning.

73
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,570
It’s OK.

74
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,650

75

79

81
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,970

It’s you?

86
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,480
What happened to your boss?

87
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,780
His condition... Isn’t too well.

88
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,680
You’d better come over.

89
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,850
We didn’t expect
he’d develop complications.

90
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,140
He’s suffering from a lingering fever

91
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,320
(ETA: 10 minutes)
and using respirators.

You aren’t wearing your suit.

98
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,210
I’ll make a quick call.

Zhong Zhen...

100
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,970
Where is he?

101
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,700
Dr. Qin, I...

102
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,500
He isn’t here.

103
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,210
Follow me.

104
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,240
Is it serious?

105
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,090
You should be prepared.

106
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,450
Go in.

107
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,480
Is he asleep?

108
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,570
He just drifted off.

109
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,970
How did he develop complications?

110
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,250
He had a fever a few days ago

111
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,570
which had weakened his immune system.

112

After you two fought,

113
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,450
he hardly went back to rest

114
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,040
but worked all day,

115
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,210
and took up all emergency surgeries.

Don’t be sad.

120
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,300
Look at me.

121
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,090
I’m fine.

122
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,860

what the hell is wrong with you?

126
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,410
I’m off.

129
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,240
Good for you.

130
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,240
I’m sorry.

131
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,480
I shouldn’t have lashed out at you.

132
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,890
Nothing happened
between me and Mr. Shangguan.

133
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,330
I know.

134
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,530
Do you know how worried I was?

135
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,670
Even Dr. Qin lied for you, too.

136
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,530
Please don’t be mad.

137
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,090
I’m sorry.

138
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,650
But you didn’t answer my calls

139
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,450
or messages.

140
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,040
I wasn’t sure if I could see you

141
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,700
or if you’d come.

142
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,450
So...

143
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,970
Hey,

144
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,120
I know I made a mistake,

145
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,330
but I couldn’t wait to see you.

146
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,680
Don’t do this ever again.

147
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,050
So are there complications or not?

148
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,810
There’s one.

151
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,240
It can be fatal.

152
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,050
That severe?

153
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,360
But what is it?

154
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,720
Lovesickness, in layman’s terms.

155
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,330
Are you messing with me again?

156
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,290
Can’t you stop?

157
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,330
Come off it!

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,210
and asked me to return the card to you.

161

Good boy.

162
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,050
Didn’t you use the money in it?

163
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,090
Only a little bit

164
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,850
to modify my new bike.

165
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,120
New bike?

166
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,600
You bought another one?

167
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,090
Would money burn a hole in your pocket?

Boss got it for me

169
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,240
because he broke my old one.

170
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,940
To ride with you on New Year’s Eve
as he promised,

171
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,700

00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,370
Hurry!

175
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,050
I’m waiting for you.

176
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,600
Let’s go.

177
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,020
Have I ever said “I love you”?

178
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,450
You can say it now.

179
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,560
I love you.

180
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,290
What?

181
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,660
Say that again.

182
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:06,970
One more time.

183
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,130
I didn’t get it.

184
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,610
No.

185
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,730
I’ve said it already.

186
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,370
Wait for me.

187
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,040
Say it again.

188
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,880
Aren’t we supposed to
have breakfast together?

189
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,090
Where is he?

190
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,810
Why are you half-naked?

191
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,570
Why would I shower

192
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,890
in my clothes at home?

193
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,400
You’re a lawyer.

194
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,240
Should I sue you for trespassing?

195
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,000
Cover yourself first.

196
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,410
I’ll come later.

197
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,050
Hold on.

198
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,720
Pass me that jacket.

199
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,850
I said to pass me that jacket,

200
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,880
not to ask you to leave.

201
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,090
You smell nice.

202
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,360
Do you want it?

203
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,090
What?

204
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,120
I mean my body wash.

205
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,530
Better change your password

206
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,850
in case I rush in next time

207
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,090
and see things I shouldn’t.

208
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,120
That’ll be awkward.

209
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,170
Stay as it is.

210
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,360
Although we’re only two doors away,

211
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,050
they can be barriers between us

212
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,000
sometimes.

213
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,330
Rather than seeing you sleep in a rage

214
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,330
and wake up regretting for

215
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,240
the hurtful words you said,

216
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,210
I prefer

217
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,720
that you burst in

218
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,970
and vent your anger on me.

219
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,840
Then I can hold you and cheer you up.

220
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,880
Leave all our unhappiness

221
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,360
in the past,

222
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,720
OK?

223
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,360
Don’t I get any response

224
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,360
after all that I’ve said?

225
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,880
Oh.

226
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,670
That’s it?

227
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,270
I won’t let it slide

228
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,030
next time.

229
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,030
My security password is your birthday.

230
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,570
But text me before you come.

231
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,700
I’m not open to unannounced visits

232
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,640
as you are.

233
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,360
Sorry,

234
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,170
did I disturb you?

235
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,170
I... I... I guess

236
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,240
I hit the frame by accident.

237
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,000
I’m only half awake.

238
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,930
You’re up early.

239
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,450
Didn’t you sleep well last night?

240
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,370
You could’ve slept in.

241
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,330
I’m fine.

242
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,640
The hotel still needs me.

243
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:26,480
I’m healthy enough to go to work.

244
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,000
Don’t worry about me.

245
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,850
I’m taking the breakfast to go.

246
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,050
See you.

247
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,450
Call me if you need anything.

248
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,880
She must’ve

249
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,880
been sad all night.

250
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,730
When her previous relationships failed,

251
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,450
she’d cry and make a fuss

252
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,000
but soon get over them.

253
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,450
This time,

254
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,050
she’s forcing herself to look happy.

255
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,810
Apparently, she can’t get over Wen Rang.

256
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,970
If he has no feelings for her,

257
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,170
could he keep a distance from her?

258
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:04,970
OK.

259
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,640
I’ll talk to him.

260
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,700
(One Palace Home)

261
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,020
Pull yourself together

262
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,520
or Cong Rong will be worried.

263
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,940
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

264
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,720
Guys,

265
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,330
those four patients came in last night.

266
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,760
Their conditions are critical.

267
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,670
There’s a long day

268
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,980
ahead of us.

269
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,190
Are you clear about everything?

270
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,580
Treat them according to our discussion.

271
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,500
Dismissed.

272
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,980
Chen,

273
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,700
go get some rest.

274
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,820
You look pale.

275
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,740
Thank you, Director.

276
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,820
I’ve almost reached my limit.

277
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,100
One more shift,

278
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,640
I’d end up in ER.

279
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,700
You must’ve been cursed

280
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,670
with night shifts.

281
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,860
You’re such a jinx!

282
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,980
That look of yours

283
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,510
is never good.

284
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,910
You’re wise, Boss.

285
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,390
It’s the patient in Bed 3.

286
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,100
His children insist that he can eat food

287
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,270
and refuse to put him on TPN.

288
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,880
Eat food?

289
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,400
Look,

290
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,070
Zhong Zhen,

291
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,110
tell them

292
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,120
those liquid he takes

293
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,390
is hardly food.

294
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,460
There’s not enough nutrition.

295
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,500
He’s a senior

296
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,710
and he needs to build up his resistance

297
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,190
to postoperative infection.

298
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,790
I believe TPN is necessary.

299
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,740
Are your feet itchy?

300
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,270
I said so,

301
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,390
but they wouldn’t listen

302
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,590
and claimed TPN is a waste of money.

303
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,430
They kept arguing with me.

304
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,500
Zhong Zhen,

305
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,950
you’re a doctor-to-be.

306
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,870
Why didn’t you

307
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,430
explain the consequence to the patient?

308
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,110
Communication

309
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,550
is also part of our job

310
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,750
and a must-have skill.

311
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,670
Boss,

312
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,590
you should see

313
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,350
how bulging their eyes were.

314
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,670
They were scary

315
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,390
as if they’d whack me anytime.

316
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,200
You...

317
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,960
Give him a break.

318
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,500
Those people are a problem.

319
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,500
I’ll talk to them.

320
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,870
Follow me.

321
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,260
Watch and learn.

Mr. Shangguan,

here’s the preliminary evidence
regarding the online loan case.

This afternoon,

327
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,950
I’ll brief Miss Zhang on the progress.

328
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,540
At what time?

329
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,350
2 PM.

330
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:16,960
OK.

331
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,670
Got it.

332
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,630
What’s wrong?

333
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,150
Anything else?

334
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,630
Thank you for giving me

335
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,270
such an expensive scarf,

336
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,110
but I can’t take it.

337
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,460
I got yours dirty last time.

338
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,860
Take it as compensation from the firm.

339
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,980
In that case,

340
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,190
you can send me a red packet.

341
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,860
An Hermès scarf for spilling porridge

342
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,020
is just too much.

343
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,910
Fine.

344
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,910
You’ll get a red packet.

345
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,980
Thank you, Mr. Shangguan.

346
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,700
You’re a wonderful boss.

347
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,910

It’s just a scarf.

349
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,180
(Thanks. From Shangguan Yi)

350
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,830
Why couldn’t you take it?

351
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,110
This case

352
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,950
has become a criminal one.

353
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,670
Although it’s filed by the police,

354
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,350
during the trial,

355
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,760
the judge and the defense lawyer

356
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,720
will ask you questions
relevant to the facts.

357
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,780
I’ve made a list of the possible ones

358
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
for you to look at.

359
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,590
(Possible Questions)
Here’s a summary.

360
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,670
Miss Zhang.

361
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,780
Miss Zhang?

362
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,830
Are you with me?

363
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,460
Mr. Shangguan,

364
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,950
do I still have to pay them back?

365
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,700
Are you afraid that you’ll lose?

366
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,550
It’s common

367
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,950
to have pre-court jitters,

368
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,260
but trust yourself, OK?

369
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,070
Here you have

370
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,700
the best lawyer in town.

371
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,110
You should trust him, too.

372
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,110
I’m afraid I’ll mess up the hearing.

373
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,060
There’s no time to be afraid

374
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,220
and there’s no turning back.

375
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,110
If you back down,

376
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,480
what about the others?

377
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,220
Look,

378
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,390
this boy killed himself
because of the loan.

379
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,020
He had been through the same thing.

380
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,220
(20-year-old Failed to Pay the Loan)
Our case is high-profile.

381
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,350
You’ll be helping other victims.

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,910
Relax.

383
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,060
Be brave.

384
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,460
One more thing.

385
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,590
Shoot.

386
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,670
Will Miss Cong go to the court with us?

387
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,240
Miss Cong,

388
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,110
Mr. Shangguan,

389
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,190
if there’s nothing, I should leave.

390
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,870
Thanks for everything.

391
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,830
Mr. Shangguan,

392
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,020
may I join you in court?

393
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,070
Normally,

394
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,950
you can’t.

395
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,070
I understand.

396
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,020
I’ll work harder for it.

397
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,960
Are you eager to be in the courtroom?

398
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,780
I am.

399
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,310
This is my first case

400
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,540
since I was hired.

401
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,950
I’m not able to work independently yet

402
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,070
but I’ve seen this case

403
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,750
as my own

404
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,780
and I expect victory.

405
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,440
Are you sure we’ll win?

406
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,220
Of course.

407
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,390
That’s all about the trademark case.

408
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,700
Tang will take care of the rest.

409
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,110
OK.

410
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,020
We’ll call it a day.

411
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,220
Hold on.

412
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,430
There’s something else.

413
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,110
I recommend Cong Rong

414
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,580
to be the first chair
for the online loan case.

415
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,390
Me?

416
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,870
She’s been working on it
since the beginning

417
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,720
and she’s gained the client’s trust.

418
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,980
I believe she’s the best choice.

419
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,630
Any objections?

420
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,740
No.

421
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,190
Mr. Shangguan,

422
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,630
your apprentice is a quick learner.

423
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,910
It’s settled then.

424
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,980
Dismissed.

425
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,780
Keep up the good work.

426
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,700
Cong Rong,

427
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,870
Mr. Shangguan treats you so well.

428
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,220
Are you guys...

429
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,590
Enough. Let’s go.

430
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:28,910
Cong Rong,

431
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,980
you’re lucky.

432
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,750
Bring your A-game

433
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,150
and don’t fail Mr. Shangguan.

434
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,910
Or I’ll replace you anytime.

435
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,630
Just give up.

436
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,980
That’ll never happen.

437
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,190
Mr. Shangguan.

438
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,340
Mr. Shangguan,

439
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,020
are you sure I can be the first chair?

440
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,110
Didn’t you say...?

441
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,700
Yes,

442
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,950
if you’re with me.

443
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,830
Lawyers can go to court with assistants

444
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,910
after application.

445
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,110
So you can be there with me.

446
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,950
Thank you for giving me this chance.

447
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,630
I’ll give it my all.

448
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,870
Make me proud.

449
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,000
Excuse me,

450
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,830
Mr. Shangguan.

451
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,390
Hello.

452
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,020
Have you had your meal?

453
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,550
I don’t have time

454
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,950
for food.

455
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,960
Why?

456
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,680
I,

457
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,110
a legal assistant,

458
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,150
is going to court!

459
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,060
Really?

460
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,150
Yes!

461
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,260
Mr. Shangguan just said it
in the meeting.

462
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,200
You know how rare that is

463
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,630
for an intern?

464
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,190
They say the first year is stressful,

465
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,910
but I can be in the courtroom!

466
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,540
I’m literally over the moon!

467
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,670
Congratulations!

468
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,500
Would you like to sit in on the trial

469
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,870
to witness how I crush the others?

470
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,870
That’ll remind you not to hurt me again.

471
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,220
You’re a lawyer.

472
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,240
I wouldn’t dare to offend you.

473
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,190
I wouldn’t.

474
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,870
Let’s eat out tonight to celebrate.

475
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,270
I don’t wanna eat out.

476
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,070
So you want me to cook for you?

477
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,910
Fire away.

478
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,630
What would you like to eat?

479
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,980
Li Hongzhang Stew.

480
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,260
What’s the good news?

481
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,720
Share it with us.

482
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,280
Yes.

483
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,760
That’s right.

484
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,390
What’s going on?

485
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,350
Rong,

486
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,310
Boss,

487
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,590
sautéed pork liver you ordered last time

488
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,430
gave us nightmares.

489
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,310
Shouldn’t you

490
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,980
make it up to us?

491
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,150
Dr. Wen.

492
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,870
Today is a good day.

493
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,900
Why don’t we get together?

494
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,190
You two can be all lovey-dovey

495
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,620
and pretend we aren’t there.

496
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,740
It’s win-win.

497
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,020
You hear that?

498
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,870
Zhong Zhen has quite an appetite.

499
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,950
Tell him to bring lunchboxes

500
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,540
for leftovers.

501
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,020
Happy now?

502
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,700
Yes. Of course.

503
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,780
Absolutely.

504
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,390
She’s something!

505
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,910
Mr. Shangguan,

506
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,870
cut down on coffee.

507
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,630
It’s bad for your stomach.

508
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,500
Have some porridge instead.

509
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,430
Thank you for giving me

510
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,700
such an expensive scarf,

511
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,950
but I can’t take it.

512
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,220
Should I go on

513
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,930
or give up?

514
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,020
(Discharge Summary)

515
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,830
Boss,

516
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,060
it’s time.

517
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,860
I know.

518
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,630
Well,

519
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,860
I can eat later

520
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,060
but if possible,

521
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,520
they wonder...

522
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,630
I have two case reports to complete.

523
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,980
You guys go ahead.

524
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,260
I’ve booked the table.

525
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,390
OK.

526
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,760
Who’d know

527
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,220
we’d get free meals

528
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,460
whether Dr. Wen is happy and upset?

529
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,720
Zhong Zhen,

530
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,680
you’re good!

531
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,780
You guys enjoy yourselves.

532
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,500
Unlike you,

533
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,020
this is probably

534
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,620
my last meal.

535
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,960
Cheer up.

536
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,590
Let’s empty his pocket today.

537
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,780
Eat as much as we can.

538
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,630
Come on.

539
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,980
If we have no night shifts,

540
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,280
let’s play mahjong again.

541
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,200
Again?

542
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,280
You cheat every time.

543
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,670
I’ll join you if you stop cheating.

544
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,590
My dad is still in the ICU

545
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,870
and here you are having fun!

546
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,480
Who is he?

547
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:34,800
He’s...

548
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,520
That hot potato

549
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,110
Bed 3’s son.

550
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,870
He was sent to the ICU
this afternoon for infection.

551
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,830
It’s dinner time,

552
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,240
so we...

553
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,870
My dad’s life is on the line!

554
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,480
Step back. Calm down, sir.

555
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,830
You still have time to eat?

556
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,190
Don’t be mad.

557
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:44,680
Let’s talk.

558
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,310
You prescribed my dad

559
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,550
that expensive TPN

560
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,870
and said he’d be fine.

561
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,720
He had it this morning,
and now, he’s dying!

562
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,240
Stop!

563
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,680
Stop it!

564
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,440
Calm down!

565
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,390
Is that all you can do?

566
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,910
Listen.

567
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,750
Listen to me.

568
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,540
We can talk it out.

569
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,110
-No need to be rough.
-Yes.

570
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,550
Don’t pick a fight.

571
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:55,950
Yeah.

572
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,390
Let’s go!

573
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,760
Go back to the hospital!

574
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,990
So what if I beat you?

575
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,760
My dad is still...

576
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,110
Go!

577
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,800
Go to the hospital now!

578
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,760
Please control yourself.

579
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,260
I understand you’re worried

580
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,070
but we’re just interns.

581
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,040
There’s nothing much we can do.

582
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,070
Doctors are responsible for treatments.

583
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,910
Cut the crap!

584
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,300
Go!

585
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,960
Go to the hospital!

586
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,390
Go!

587
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,070
Go to the hospital!

588
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,020
I’m not responsible for it.

589
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,760
Look...

590
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,630
Come with us!

591
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,310
Stop it!

592
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,680
Go!

593
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,000
Let’s go!

594
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,460
What are you doing?

595
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,440
Let’s go!

596
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,540
Go to the Medical Association!

597
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,740
Go there now!

598
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:21,540
Let’s go!

599
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,550
Let’s go!

600
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,390
What are you doing?

601
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,060
Who are you?

602
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,590
Please

603
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,280
calm down.

604
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,070
Control yourselves.

605
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,980
Who the hell are you?

606
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,500
I’m their teacher.

607
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,960
You can talk to me.

608
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,870
You’re a doctor?

609
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,590
You people

610
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,020
look gentle,

611
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,540
but you broke my hand.

612
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,670
I demand compensation and an apology

613
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,540
or I’ll report you to
the Medical Association!

614
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:41,870
Yes.

615
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,520
We’ll report you!

616
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,110
Boss,

617
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,500
they’re Bed 3’s family.

618
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,020
It’s my fault.

619
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,780
I did shove them.

620
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,870
I’ll apologize.

621
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,460
Look,

622
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,790
the doctor talked to you before surgery

623
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,060
and informed you of all the risks.

624
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,060
You signed the paper yourself.

625
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,870
If you suspect malpractice,

626
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,110
just check with
the Medical Association.

627
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,830
Don’t pick a fight with those kids

628
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,030
before the result comes out.

629
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,960
You doctors

630
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,820
have all sorts of excuses.

631
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,960
Don’t waste breath on them.

632
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,590
Yeah!

633
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,680
I’ll sue you!

634
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,590
I’ll go to the Medical Association!

635
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,190
Please

636
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:20,960
stop making a scene.

637
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,440
Calm down!

638
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:21,870
Stop it!

639
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,440
Break it off!

640
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,060
I’ll sue you!

641
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,750
Stop!

642
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,700
I’ll sue you!

643
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,350
I’ll sue your ass off!

644
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,460
What are you doing?

645
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,950
I’m sorry, Dr. Wen.

646
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,740
Without us,

647
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,720
you wouldn’t have injured your hand.

648
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,590
Don’t worry.

649
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,590
Nothing serious.

650
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,460
Rong.

651
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,630
What happened?

652
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,020
Does it hurt?

653
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,630
I’m fine,

654
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,430
but Boss... His hand...

655
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,390
Are you in pain?

656
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,540
Are you his family?

657
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:15,950
Officer,

658
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,390
(Legal Assistant Cong Rong)
I’m a lawyer.

659
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,630
Lawyer?

660
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,390
I’m hiring you

661
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,390
to sue them,

662
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,280
their hospital

663
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,910
and him!

664
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,680
He hit me!

665
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,540
Stop yelling!

666
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,020
Being loud doesn’t make you right.

667
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,110
Try that in court. I dare you!

668
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,950
They look worse than you.

669
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,590
Didn’t you hit them?

670
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,550
It’s their fault!

671
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,460
And

672
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,060
I won’t represent you.

673
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,910
Feel free to file a complaint
to the Bar Association.

674
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,390
My name is Cong Rong.

675
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,500
What’s that attitude?

676
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,150
What are you doing?

677
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,110
Look around.

678
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,220
This is a police station.

679
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,150
Miss Cong,

680
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,260
come.

681
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,350
This is

682
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,000
an affray case at most.

683
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,220
Fill out the paperwork

684
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,460
and pay the fine,

685
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,430
then

686
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,220
they can leave.

687
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,390
OK.

688
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,380
Zhong Zhen,

689
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,510
your cousin is awesome!

690
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,000
You bet.

691
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,540
They’re ridiculous.

692
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,950
Even if they do make a complaint,

693
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,240
the Bar Association

694
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,540
won’t do anything to my cousin soon.

695
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,540
It’s late.

696
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,190
Go back and get something to eat.

697
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,060
We can talk at work tomorrow.

698
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,150
Let’s go eat at my place.

699
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,190
The paperwork is done.

700
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,590
You should join us.

701
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,860
How’s your hand?

702
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,670
Let me see.

703
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,780
Does it still hurt?

704
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,590
It looks bad.

705
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,910
Ow!

706
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,040
Your hospital is nearby.

707
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,060
Let’s go get you checked again

708
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,100
for fractures.

709
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,260
Move your hand for me.

710
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,630
Why is it still bleeding?

711
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,870
Let’s go home.

712
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,980
Here you are.

713
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,520
Clean your wounds

714
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,060
before your family see them.

715
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,020
Be gentle!

716
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,680
Nice and easy!

717
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,390
Hand me a swab.

718
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,150
Swab?

719
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,110
Give me one.

720
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,870
Thank you, Miss Cong.

721
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,500
Just now, Dr. Wen was so cool.

722
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,100
He protected us

723
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,230
against those three.

724
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,390
He’s my hero!

725
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,590
Super cool!

726
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,200
Yes!

727
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,780
Yeah!

728
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,820
Dr. Wen seems less sporty

729
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,550
but he has abs.

730
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:25,960
Really?

731
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,240
Yeah!

732
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,480
You found time to peek during the fight?

733
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,510
Yeah!

734
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,630
Hey,

735
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,480
isn’t he always calm?

736
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,260
How come he lost it today?

737
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,830
Actually, he’s under a lot of stress.

738
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,740
As gentle and kind as he is,

739
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,910
he can get edgy sometimes

740
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,780
even though he hides it well.

741
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,540
Is it because
he faces life and death every day?

742
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,500
Not just that.

743
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,950
Other than surgery,
he has to do research,

744
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,060
treat patients

745
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,150
and work on his thesis.

746
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,700
On top of that,

747
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,910
he needs to
explain everything to patients.

748
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,430
Being a doctor

749
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,980
is hard.

750
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,060
That’s hard?

751
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,900
Other than doctors,

752
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,980
try being patients

753
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,990
and their family.

754
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,070
I wish

755
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,670
I could just be a doctor.

756
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,740
Hey,

757
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,710
food is ready.

758
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,520
Let’s eat.

759
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,000
Let’s go.

760
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,980
Time to eat.

761
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:17,960
This is a lot!

762
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,740
What a feast!

763
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,910
Why didn’t you talk to me

764
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,220
when you were stressed out?

765
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,590
I feel much better with you around.

766
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,980
You cooked for us with an injured hand.

767
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,220
Did you get it wet?

768
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,900
I’m fine.

769
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,830
Let’s eat.

770
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,590
Eat up.

771
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,070
What do you think?

772
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,590
Do you like it?

773
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,350
Tastes good, yeah?

774
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,280
There’s one more dish.

775
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,870
I’ll go get it.

776
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,430
Boss,

777
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,110
have a seat.

778
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,040
I’ll go.

779
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,830
Let me do it.

780
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,390
Quite a fancy dinner!

781
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,000
Wow!

782
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,760
What is this?

783
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,950
It looks amazing!

784
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,870
You made Li Hongzhang Stew!

785
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,270
It’s long overdue.

786
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,220
I didn’t get to cook it for you

787
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,540
until today.

788
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,870
Try it

789
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,980
and see if it’s as good as your mom’s.

790
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,460
Taste it

791
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,700
or they’ll clean all the plates.

792
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,540
Cousin,

793
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,510
he made this for you despite his injury.

794
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,230
Look

795
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,020
how well he treats you.

796
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,910
Shut up and eat.

797
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,540
It’s tasty.

798
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,540
Boss,

799
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,060
you were like a superhero earlier.

800
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,070
I agree.

801
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,720
Super hot!

802
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,760
Starting from today,

803
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,460
I’ll work out regularly.

804
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,280
Not just that.

805
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,200
I’ll work on my speech.

806
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,020
If I can’t beat them up,

807
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,020
I can still win by persuasion.

808
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,350
Give it a rest.

809
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,020
Not bad, actually.

810
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,870
Right?

811
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,460
Persuasion can be useful,

812
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,270
but don’t engage in

813
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,390
unnecessary fight.

814
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,660
Or what would our workplace be?

815
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,910
A boxing ring or a debate club?

816
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,460
Understand?

817
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,430
Yes.

818
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,030
For some reason,

819
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,910
fewer and fewer people
choose to be doctors.

820
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,020
I also know

821
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,870
you might be one of them

822
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,460
after graduation.

823
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,140
But a world without doctors is sad.

824
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,620
No one wants to see that happen.

825
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:37,980
The right amount of resistance

826
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,750
is to give hope to the hopeless.

827
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,580
Intensifying contradictions
won’t solve the problem.

828
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:44,620
On the contrary,

829
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,820
the moment people start to fight,

830
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,270
they’re already on the wrong path.

831
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:51,350
Forget about what happened today.

832
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,750
Tomorrow, when you put on your uniform,

833
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,390
you must still adhere to the oath

834
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,660
that you’ll abide by medical ethics,

835
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,870
respect your teachers,
observe disciplines

836
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,710
and save lives at all costs.

837
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,830
Yes.

838
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,540
Boss,

839
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,560
rest assured.

840
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,830
We’ll study hard

841
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,640
and become good doctors.

842
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,750
-That’s right.
-Yeah.

843
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,900
Really?

844
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,910
Then why haven’t I

845
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,390
received your thesis?

846
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,600
I’m probably sick

847
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,790
that my laziness is worsening.

848
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,830
Laziness?

849
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,790
That’s still incurable, isn’t it?

850
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,720
Better dig your own grave

851
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,750
and bury yourself in it.

852
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,600
Go ahead.

853
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,270
Do it.

854
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:24,980
Zhong Zhen.

855
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,500
Xia,

856
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,870
let me peel an orange for you.

857
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,540
Sure.

858
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,580
I’m surprised that you think of me.

859
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,710
I’m thinking of you all the time.

860
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,800
It’s late.

861
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,720
Dr. Wen, Miss Cong,

862
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,800
we should leave.

863
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,640
Good night. Bye.

864
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,310
-Bye.
-See you.

865
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,020
Are you mad at me?

866
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,180
For what?

867
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,870
Zhong Zhen’s injury.

868
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,710
Not at all.

869
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,750
A man’s life without injures

870
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,350
is incomplete.

871
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,620
He grew up with me.

872
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,800
Sometimes, I wish I’d be a boy

873
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,660
so that I wouldn’t influence him
in a negative way.

874
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,070
Are you afraid...

875
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,620
I’m afraid he’d be... A sissy.

876
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,230
You’re worrying too much.

877
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,180
Why did you agree to teach Zhong Zhen?

878
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,580
I don’t think he fits
into your category.

879
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,430
What is my category?

880
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,460
The brainy, I guess?

881
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,710
I value characters and manners

882
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,460
more than talent and knowledge.

883
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,230
Doctors are normal and special.

884
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,910
I want my students to study medicine

885
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,060
because they love it,

886
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,580
not because of something else.

887
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,910
And Zhong Zhen ticks all the boxes.

888
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,270
He wants to be a doctor

889
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,580
because of your grandma, right?

890
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,060
How did you know?

891
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,230
When you made
Li Hongzhang stew a while back,

892
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,910
I got curious

893
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,910
and asked Zhong Zhen about it.

894
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,910
He said

895
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,750
when your grandma died of illness,

896
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,750
you were abroad and unable to see her.

897
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,760
Only she could make that dish,

898
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,620
so to you, that’s something
to remember her by.

899
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,540
Zhong Zhen is such a blabbermouth!

900
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,100
He chose this career out of passion,

901
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,830
not because of my grandma.

902
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,800
What about you?

903
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,830
Why do you wanna be a doctor?

904
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,460
You know why I’m named “Shaoqing”?

905
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,590
The ancients said

906
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,580
to either be a good official

907
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,750
or a good physician.

908
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,230
My parents were always abroad
doing research,

909
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,750
so my grandpa practically raised me.

910
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,020
He practiced
traditional Chinese medicine,

911
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,950
but made me read
all kinds of medical books.

912
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,100
I know how hard it is to be a doctor.

913
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,870
If people could choose,

914
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,870
I bet nobody would be it.

915
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,100
But someone has to do it.

916
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,020
My grandpa said
to always do the right thing

917
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,270
no matter how hard it is.

918
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,830
“Physician” is another word
for “doctor”.

919
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,910
It’s given to officials
in ancient times

920
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,830
who served the state and the public,

921
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,390
just like my name suggests.

922
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,390
That’s probably my fate.

923
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,980
“Do the right thing

924
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,230
no matter how hard it is”.

925
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,070
My dad used to say

926
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,230
something similar to me.

927
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,500
I bet he doesn’t know the next line.

928
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,350
What is it?

929
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,710
“I’ll always love you and miss you

930
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,020
no matter how far we are”.
