Rong, are you gonna finish that?

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,150
You can have it.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,270
Thanks.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,710
Zhong Zhen,

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,630
are you a pig?

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,700
She hasn’t had any.

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,150
She wouldn’t eat it,

37
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,300
so I’m doing her a favor.

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,390
Have some soup then.

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,580
Thanks.

40
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,860
Boss,

41
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,620
I want it, too.

42
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,310
It’s in the kitchen.

43
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,020
Go get it yourself.

44
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,740
OK.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,110
So, my place or yours for tonight?

46
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,280
It’s just a fracture.

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
I’m not disabled.

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,030
Zhong Zhen

49
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,360
can stay and look after me.

50
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,830
He needs to study for his exam.

51
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,860
Don’t waste his time.

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,030
Zhong Zhen.

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,580
Yeah?

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,990
What’s the Epsilon Wave?

55
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,900
How does it show on ECG?

56
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,830
It’s

57
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,620
a blip buried in the end
of the QRS complex.

58
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,460
RV...

59
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,550
Boss, is this really necessary?

60
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,670
You don’t know?

61
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,780
Then what are you still doing here?

62
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,300
Got it.

63
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,390
I’m going back to study.

64
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,960
Rong,

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,590
I’m off.

66
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,860
See you tomorrow.

67
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,110
Zhong Zhen,

68
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,640
don’t you dare move!

69
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,960
Is one night enough to pass the exam?

70
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,920
I mean,

71
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,530
isn’t it wrong

72
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,650
for you to leave but make your boss

73
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,480
stay and look after me?

74
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,410
How is it wrong?

75
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,700
It’s a man’s duty

76
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,610
to take care of his girlfriend.

77
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,020
Everyone at work knows he’s decent.

78
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,860
Zhong Zhen,

79
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,140
it’s 6:57 PM.

80
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,580
If you don’t get out by 7:00 PM...

81
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,450
On it.

82
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,650
Rong,

83
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,610
sorry.

84
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,010
I’ll come by tomorrow.

85
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,520
Come here and finish your soup.

86
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,890
What’s your decision?

87
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,960
Wen Shaoqing,

88
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,690
I can take care of myself.

89
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,290
Unlike last time,

90
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,240
this little fracture

91
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,690
won’t put me in a coma, right?

92
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,240
Medically speaking, no.

93
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,880
But personally speaking,

94
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,480
I suggest you get help.

95
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,650
See?

96
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,770
I have another hand.

97
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,920
I’m perfectly fine on my own.

98
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,320
What’s taking you so long?

99
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,920
Do you need a hand?

100
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,650
No.

101
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,730
I’m almost done.

102
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,800
Don’t wet your hand.

103
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,480
I know.

104
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,090
Does your stomach hurt?

105
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,000
No.

106
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,170
Then why are covering it?

107
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,320
Nothing.

108
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:03,620
Hey,

109
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,500
I can tie it for you.

110
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,360
No need.

111
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,000
I’m going to bed anyway.

112
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,970
Don’t be shy.

113
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,880
Come on.

114
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,560
All done?

115
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,290
What are you doing?

116
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,210
Making a hard knot.

117
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,650
This is insane!

118
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,970
How am I supposed to
untie it and take off my robe?

119
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,680
Give me a shout.

120
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,480
I’ll untie the knot I tied.

121
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,450
Are you gonna take it off now?

122
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,920
Oh, shut up!

123
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,770
Your shadow and the moonlight

124
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,680
remind me of a poem.

125
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,110
What is it?

126
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,750
“In the clear moonlight,

127
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,710
spring flowers are quiet.

128
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,560
The moon seems to be within reach.

129
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,110
But the moon goddess can’t be found”.

130
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,720
I’m surprised that you’ve read

131
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,660
Romance of the Western Chamber.

132
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,270
There’s more.

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,900
I’m all ears.

134
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,910
“Dancer’s waist...”

135
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,750
God, make it stop!

136
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,950
I’ve heard enough.

137
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,750
It’s dirty.

138
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,580
Done.

139
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,710
It’s dry.

140
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,780
You can go to sleep.

141
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,560
What about you?

142
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,090
I’ll be right outside.

143
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,770
You can take

144
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,890
the guest room.

145
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,080
I can’t hear you there.

146
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,250
Don’t worry about me.

147
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,260
Last time, while I slept in the bedroom,

148
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,490
you were outside, too.

149
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,800
Hope that won’t happen again.

150
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,050
Knock it off!

151
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,050
Get out!

152
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,980
Are you sure you don’t need company?

153
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,840
No, no, no.

154
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,770
Out!

155
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,900

158
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,560
May I come in?

159
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,890
The door’s open.

160
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,680
It hurts, doesn’t it?

161
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,200
Yeah, a little bit.

162
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,650
The cast looks fine.

163
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,530
It’s normal to feel the pain.

164
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,140
Why are you still up

165
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,370
this late?

166
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,980
I guess it’s about time

167
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,860
for the painkiller to wear off.

168
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,050
If it’s really bad,

169
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,320
take another one.

170
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,600
I’ll go get water.

171
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,690
It’s hot.

172
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,560
Hold on a sec.

173
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,290
OK.

174
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,130
Has anyone called you old-school?

175
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,890
Is that good or bad?

176
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,890
Neither.

177
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,530
Sometimes, I feel as if
I were reliving the past.

178
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,220
Did someone else do the same to you?

179
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,130
Yeah.

180
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,890
My dad.

181
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,170
Are you aware of a psychological theory

182
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,770
that if you and your father are close,

183
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,200
you’ll tend to marry someone like him?

184
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,840
You are like him.

185
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
Take the pill

186
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,290
before it melts.

187
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,320
Aren’t you gonna
sue them for injuring you?

188
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,640
It’s hard

189
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,770
to identify the motive

190
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,410
that whether it’s intentional or not.

191
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,770
My words against theirs.

192
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,200
No one wins in the end.

193
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,490
Better let it slide.

194
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,250
What happened to your hand?

195
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,560
I got burned.

196
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,290
Nothing serious.

197
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,260
What happened?

198
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,290
Did you put on the ointment?

199
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,770
I panicked this afternoon

200
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,890
when I heard you were injured.

201
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,840
I was nervous

202
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,650
when putting you in a cast.

203
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,800
That was the first time in years.

204
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,440
Cong Rong.

205
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,600
Yeah?

206
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,490
When you hit your head,

207
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,010
my heart almost stopped.

208
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,370
Here?

209
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,370
The longer we’re together,

210
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,800
the more fear I have.

211
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,320
All I’m asking for

212
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,800
is to see the love of my life

213
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,440
healthy

214
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,770
and safe.

215
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,410
Rong,

216
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,960
what happened to your hand?

217
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,890
It’s really no big deal.

218
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,280
The cast can be removed
in three to four weeks.

219
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,050
Relax.

220
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,720
That’s not the point.

221
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,720
What is it then?

222
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,500
When I called your phone
early this morning,

223
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,770
Wen Shaoqing answered it.

224
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,600
Here are the highlights:

225
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,920
“early this morning”,

226
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,440
“your phone”,

227
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,250
“Wen Shaoqing answered it”.

228
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,890
You two slept together last night?

229
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,130
What are you talking about?

230
00:14:59,130 --> 00:14:59,810
Be honest with me.

231
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,770
The sooner the better.

232
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,930
Hey,

233
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,170
untie it for me.

234
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,800
That’s...

235
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,170
Quite a complicated knot.

236
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,440
How could you manage it?

237
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,600
I just did.

238
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,200
It looks familiar, though.

239
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,890
Isn’t it the Surgeon’s Knot?

240
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,140
Wen Shaoqing did it, didn’t he?

241
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:27,860
You two must’ve...

242
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,530
No.

243
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,530
Nothing happened between us.

244
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,050
OK?

245
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,600
How did you know that knot?

246
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,800
I see stuff.

247
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,080
Oh, save it.

248
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,260
I’ve been watching a medical drama

249
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,560
and got it from there.

250
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,730
It also features a male surgeon.

251
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,680
He’s hot!

252
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,130
I suddenly get it.

253
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,010
Get what?

254
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,560
I get why girls love dating doctors.

255
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,530
They’re professional and charming.

256
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,490
Of course the look matters, too.

257
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,650
Here’s my hubby,

258
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,970
Dr. Romantic, Kang Dong-Joo.

259
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,890
And this is our
marriage certificate photo.

260
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,520
You’re a hardcore fan.

261
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,440
I wish you a happy marriage!

262
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,570
Hey,

263
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:05,930
come

264
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,840
and untie the knot now.

265
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,050
Rong,

266
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,340
listen,

267
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,410
a man’s head and a woman’s waist

268
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,410
are private.

269
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,140
Did anything happen

270
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,170
when Wen Shaoqing made this knot?

271
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,330
Are you done?

272
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:31,960
Thanks.

273
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,920
I’ll go get changed.

274
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,080
You can tell me anything.

275
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,250
Besides,

276
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,600
you two have settled down, right?

277
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,890
Even if you guys did it,

278
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,170
I’m totally fine with it.

279
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,440
Enough about me.

280
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,490
I can ask Zhong Zhen
to set you up with a doctor.

281
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,680
Sounds good,

282
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,960
but no.

283
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,130
I’m already in love with my new hubby.

284
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,920
I don’t need another date.

285
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,800
Where...? Where are you going?

286
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,080
Why are you wearing a suit?

287
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,320
I’m going to work.

288
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,050
What?

289
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,580
Your hand is broken.

290
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,730
Forget about work.

291
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,340
Just take a few days off.

292
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,080
The online loan case
is going to court soon.

293
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,410
Files for the cross-examination
are yet to be submitted.

294
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,450
I can’t afford

295
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,400
to rest at the moment.

296
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,080
Can you even work like this?

297
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,920
Oh, no.

298
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,640
The cast is stuck into my sleeve.

299
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,010
Roll it up.

300
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,970
I can never say no to you.

301
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,900
Sorry, sorry.

302
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,840
Easy, easy.

303
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,490
I’ll be gentle.

304
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,400
Ouch!

305
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,640
So clumsy.

306
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,050
Rong,

307
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,370
did you sell yourself?

308
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,160
What do you mean?

309
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,240
Look,

310
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,160
(Wen Shaoqing)
here’s your master’s signature.

311
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,360
When...? When did he do that?

312
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,930
When you were asleep, of course.

313
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,640
Let me see.

314
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,880
This is him.

315
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,210
And this is you.

316
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,730
Here’s his dog.

317
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,250
The three of you make a happy family.

318
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,450
How could I go out with this on my arm?

319
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,930
Simple.

320
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,570
Get me a marker.

321
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,210
I’ll blacken it.

322
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,640
No!

323
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,320
Despite what you said,

324
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,050
you’re overjoyed, aren’t you?

325
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,120
Shaoqing,

326
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,250
thanks for coming

327
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,530
to the consultation,

328
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,360
regarding this special case.

329
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,210
Don’t mention it, Director.

330
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,530
I’ve been suspended

331
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,200
but if you need me,

332
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,840
I can assist with the treatment anytime.

333
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,290
By the way,

334
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,290
how’s Bed 3?

335
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,560
Still in a coma

336
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,320
under continuous observation.

337
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,730
If there’s anything new,

338
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,360
I’ll let you know.

339
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,360
Thanks.

340
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,530
How about you?

341
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,010
How’s your vacation?

342
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,360
Look,

343
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,880
my hand is numb.

344
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,250
Be patient.

345
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,530
We’re cooperating with the investigation

346
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,010
and expecting your return.

347
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,080
Those troublemakers

348
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,690
are still your responsibility.

349

(Inpatient Department)

350
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,400
Would you join me for coffee?

351
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,530
Just cut to the chase.

352
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,770
Your lawyer knows our demand, right?

(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)
Diagnosis of Cong Rong’s fracture,

354
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,730
her medical report

355
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,770
and injury identification application.

(Hand X-ray)

357
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,560
We... We barely touched her.

358
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,690
She fell down herself.

359
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,010
That wasn’t our fault.

360
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,400
What do you want?

361
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,640
Are you gonna sue us?

362
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,050
Never would I intend to,

363
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,770
nor would I win.

364
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,770
I’m here to talk to you

365
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,050
as a doctor.

366
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,600
You might think
we’re used to life and death.

367
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,010
We’re cold

368
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,560
and we don’t care about patients.

369
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,770
But that’s not true.

370
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,780
I’ve seen tons of my coworkers

371
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,290
shed tears in secret

372
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,970
when they lost their patients.

373
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,930
I understand you’re concerned
about your family...

374
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,640
Save that for the judge.

375
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,120
I’m not asking you
to withdraw the lawsuit.

376
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,400
You can sue me

377
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,290
and misunderstand me

378
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,490
but leave others out of it.

379
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,450
Cong Rong only tries to speak for me.

380
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,400
I hope you can be kind to her

381
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,970
and don’t hurt her.

382
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,050
Because, to me,

383
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,360
she’s also as important as a family.

384
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,970
Please.

(EAST)

386
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,320
OK.

387
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,620
I’m leaving.

388
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,120
Yeah.

389
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,210
Be careful.

390
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,400
Slowly.

391
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,730
Don’t work yourself to death,

392
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,690
Superwoman!

393
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,730
Got it.

394
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,100
See you.

395
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,450
See you.

397
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,290
I rolled off the stairs myself.

398
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,210
Nothing serious.

399
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,290
I can still work.

focus on the hearing
of the online loan case.

402
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,600
I’ll ask Xiong Jingjing

403
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,600
to work on Dr. Wen’s case.

404
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,640
Why?

405
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,780
Look, Mr. Shangguan,

406
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,340
I can do it.

407
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,640
You don’t trust her

408
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,730
or you don’t trust me?

409
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,530
I do.

410
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,530
I trust you.

411
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,640
It’s settled then.

412
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,730
You may leave.

413
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,600
Take care of yourself.

414
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,250
What’s your meeting
with Mr. Shangguan about?

415
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,250
Is there a new case?

416
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,690
He benched me in Dr. Wen’s case.

417
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,770
Why?

418
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,050
I need your help.

419
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,690
He’ll ask you

420
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,480
to help him with that case.

421
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,290
So,

422
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,900
keep me updated

423
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,400
on the status.

424
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,360
Really?

425
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,880
We’ll be handling a case together?

426
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,450
Finally!

427
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:44,730
Xiong Jingjing,

428
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:45,900
you won’t say no to me,

429
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,730
will you?

430
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,210
You’ve asked nicely,

431
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,050
so I’ll see what I can do.

432
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,160

Not even a single message.

433

Hello.

434
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:18,860
Sorry,

435
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,090
I might’ve sent it to you by mistake.

436
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,780
OK.

437
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,530
Bye.

438
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,160
Could he do that?

439
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,650
Come this afternoon
to pick up the books.

440
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,640
I’ll be there.

441

(Recall a message.)

442
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,410
Sorry.

443
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,640
I sent that one by mistake.

444
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,980
(Oh.)

445
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,800
“Oh”?

446
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,080
Have you had breakfast?

(Zhou Chengcheng)

448
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,450
Not even the “Typing” sign.

449
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,250
What’s gotten into me?

450
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,490
Thanks.

Who are you to judge? You aren’t his match.)

Wen Shaoqing.

What’s up?

461
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,640
You sound mad.

462
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,770
You know Zhou Chengcheng
is getting married?

463
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,880
Yeah.

464
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,730
You do?

465
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,970
You know him?

466
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,400
I do.

467
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,610
Also a doctor.

468
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,490
So the whole world knows

469
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,800
except me?

470

Wen Rang,

471
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,840
you should get treated.

472
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,380
You’re sick

473
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,540
from inside out

474
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,970
and you have an anger issue.

475
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,160
Hurry up

476
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,750
and ask Grandpa to prescribe you herbs

477
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,850
to help blow off your steam.

478
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,730
Don’t give me that crap.

479
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,580
If you guys already know everything,

480
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,840
why keep me in the dark?

481
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,730
Whose fault is that?

482
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,320
You don’t care about her, do you?

483
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,800
Seeing her find a better man

484
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,210
with good looks,

485
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,600
you get jealous?

How is he better?

487
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,210
Isn’t he just a doctor?

488
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,400
And what good looks?

489
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Aren’t you just a bookstore owner,

490
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,450
who, by the way, is still in denial?

491
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,970
Listen,

492
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,140
if it were me,

493
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,240
I’d choose him over you, too.

494
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,400
Reflect on yourself.

(Dr. Romantic)

496
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,690
Hey, man,

497
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,770
have you had breakfast?

498
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,690
It’s almost noon.

499
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,120
So what’s for lunch?

500
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,050
Why ask?

501
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,530
Will you order takeout?

502
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,410
Sure.

503
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,450
What do you want?

504
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,620
Why are you taking away the bricks

505
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,690
when talking to me?

506
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,010
What’s wrong with them?

507
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,770
I haven’t recovered from the last fight.

508
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,000
Are you trying to start another one?

509
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,880
Are you insane?

510
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,730
You’re absolutely right.

511
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,640
I am insane.

512
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,010
Whatever.

513
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,380
You can’t cancel the lease.

514
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,780
Please reconsider it.

515
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,640
No need.

516
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,080
I’m scared, OK?

517
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,250
I didn’t take the surroundings
into consideration

518
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,620
when renting this store.

519
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,450
I can’t stand staying next to a lunatic.

520
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,690
It’s dangerous.

521
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:23,820
I can explain.

522
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,340
He isn’t always like that.

523
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,860
I’ll talk to him.

524
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,380
Don’t bother.

525
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,370
It’s useless.

526
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,010
I relapse into insanity

527
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:29,970
irregularly

528
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,540
and unexpectedly.

529
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,930
I can’t control myself.

530
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:33,730
See?

531
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,440
Look at him!

532
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,400
He’s sick!

533
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,360
Wen Rang!

534
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,160
Hey,

535
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,100
you know what,

536
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,860
this area

537
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,090
is cursed.

538
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:42,780
It’s bad for business.

539
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,300
No...

540
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,380
My store is a perfect example.

541
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,840
You won’t break even.

542
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,100
I...

543
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,810
Miss,

544
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,380
I’m serious.

545
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,640
I don’t want this place anymore.

546
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,410
Look,

547
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,380
I haven’t done anything.

548
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,650
You have nothing to lose.

549
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,730
Just give me the money back.

550
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,820
How about this?

551
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,780
Keep the changes to yourself,

552
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,170
OK?

553
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,320
Just let me go.

554
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,650
You can’t do this.

555
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,380
We’ve signed the contract.

556
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,650
You’ve redecorated the place

557
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,100
and removed walls.

558
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,450
I can’t return your money.

559
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,610
I can.

560
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:06,930
How much is it?

561
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,880
I’ll pay.

562
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,890
Please excuse me.

563
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,410
Sorry.

564
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,050
Hold on.

565
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,050
What did I do to you?

566
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,010
Nothing.

567
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,620
Why did you make me come over and over?

568
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,640
Because I miss you.

569
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,320
That again?

570
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,920
Do you think I’m so stupid

571
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,340
that I’ll fall for your sweet talk,

572
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,650
and my heart will race for you

573
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,730
to satisfy your ego?

574
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,160
I mean it.

575
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,880
I heard you’re getting married.

576
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,730
So?

577
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,290
Is there a problem?

578
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,880
Zhou Chengcheng,

579
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,930
do you think love is a game

580
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,060
that you can play

581
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,410
or quit any time you want?

582
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,620
You start

583
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,010
and end everything as you please.

584
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,080
How could you do this?

585
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,080
In your eyes,

586
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,450
I’m nothing

587
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,490
but a joke,

588
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,140
yeah?

589
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,900
What do you think?

590
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,930
You’re marrying

591
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,060
a so-called perfect match in haste.

592
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,490
Who else would do that?

593
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,210
Excuse me?

594
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,170
What do you mean?

595
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,490
What perfect match?

596
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,450
You posted it on Moments, didn’t you?

597
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,690
I... I photoshopped it.

598
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,360
Yes, I’m ridiculous.

599
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,540
The most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done

600
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,840
is to have fallen in love with you.

601
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,160
I knew you’d never love me back

602
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,880
but I stayed and listened to your crap.

603
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,080
Will you be my girlfriend?

604
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,210
I was a jerk.

605
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,360
I didn’t mean anything I said.

606
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,730
Zhou Chengcheng,

607
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,930
be my girlfriend.

610

611
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,540
Thanks to you,

612

Tagore’s poems finally speak to me.

613
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,820
“When I stand before thee

614
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,250
at the day’s end,

615
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,400
thou shalt see my scars

616
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,360
and know that I had my wounds
and also my healing”.

617
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,820
Love can be a battle

618
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,640
in which we break each other’s shells.

619
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,600
Stray birds can keep flying
without landing.

(Selected Poems of Tagore)

621
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,050
Wen Rang!

622
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,080
We’re home.

623
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,290
One page to go.

624
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,810
This package came for you.

625
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,210
How did you get it?

626
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,160
And it’s open.

627
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,700
It got my address on it

628
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,080
without a recipient.

629
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,610
I assumed it was mine

630
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,410
and opened it.

631
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,240
Apparently, it wasn’t.

632
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,330
Zhou Chengcheng’s name
is on the voucher.

633
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,890
So she must’ve bought something for you.

634
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,760
Why was it sent to you?

635
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,600
This might be a mistake.

636
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,040
I don’t think it’s for me.

637
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,930
Maybe she put the address wrong.

638
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,810
I’m in a rush.

639
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:48,890
Gotta go.

640
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,850
My phone.

641
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,500
(Zhou Chengcheng)

642
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,680
Why did you send me a robe?

643
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:21,810
You got it?

644
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,780
What do you think?

645
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,160
It’s your size.

646
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,680
Do put it on.

647
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,280
It’s got lace!

648
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,700
Your old ones

649
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,250
are too safe.

650
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,820
So I chose a lace robe

651
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,960
made of silk.

652
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,780
You’ll look super sexy in it.

653
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,380
Sorry,

654
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,260
“super sexy”

655
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,490
is way beyond my level.

656
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,810
Don’t hold yourself back.

657
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,930
Miss Zhou,

658
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,090
Wen Shaoqing is only looking after me.

659
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,450
We aren’t moving in together.

660
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,720
What about that knot he made?

661
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,300
You could’ve sent it to me.

662
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,850
Why him?

663
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,680
He saw it?

664
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,120
Just as I expected.

665
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,240
That was to give him
something to imagine.

666
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,570
No, thanks.

667
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,240
We don’t need it.

668
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,450
You’ve passed that stage?

669
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,260
Zhou Chengcheng,

670
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,560
get your mind out of the gutter!

671
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,560
It’s got more than one belts

672
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,050
to make Surgeon’s Knots.

673
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,610
They’ll keep his skills

674
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,660
from getting rusty in suspension,

675
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,200
right?

676
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,370
Zhou Chengcheng,

677
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,340
you’re beaming with joy.

678
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,000
What’s the good news?

679
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,970
The thing is

680
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,280
I have an admirer.

681
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,380
Who is it?

682
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,260
Do I know him?

683
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:28,900
That can wait

684
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,200
until next time.

685
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,050
Put on the robe,

686
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,930
Miss Cong.

687
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,130
Bye.

688
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:35,850
Go away.

689
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,690
What’s up?

690
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,850
I’ve made night snacks.

691
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,200
Would you like some before bed?

692
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,720
I... I’m not hungry.

693
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,080
I had a big dinner.

694
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,850
These contain vitamins.

695
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,530
Is it the poorly chosen orange
from yesterday?

696
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,560
It’s too sour,

697
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,810
making my teeth sensitive.

698
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:11,760
Taste it.

699
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,240
How come it’s sweet?

700
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,780
Microwaved it

701
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,760
with medium power for a few seconds.

702
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,370
This is for you.

703
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,240
Too late.

704
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,810
What’s wrong?

705
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,560
I didn’t touch it.

706
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,680
Besides,

707
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,180
don’t you know the phrase
“Bitten Peach”?

708
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,530
So you adore me?

709
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,050
I mean you’re a magician

710
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,490
who can make

711
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,330
anything taste good.

712
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,200
Cong Rong,

713
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,680
I love you

714
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,410
not because of your look.

715
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,160
You’ve passed that stage?

716
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,970
I need to send an email.

717
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,900
My router is down.

718
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,200
May I use your Wi-Fi?

719
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:31,850
Let me.

720
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,490
What do those numbers mean?

721
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,450
You’re using 10-key?

722
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,450
Cheesy pick-up lines.

723
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,180
(Wi-Fi “2664766464926926744952676”)

724
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:58,180
(Cong Rong, you’ll marry me eventually.)

725
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,600
Wen Shaoqing,

726
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,560
what’s your Wi-Fi password again?

727
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,280
42633.

728
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,580
(Cong Rong, you’ll marry me eventually.)

729
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,160
You can stop typing.

730
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,540
It’s “yes”.

731
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,260
(Cong Rong, you’ll marry me eventually.
Yes.)
