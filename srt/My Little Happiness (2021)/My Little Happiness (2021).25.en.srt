If not me,

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,230
who else would you rather be with?

You know Zhou Chengcheng

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,430
couldn’t keep anything to herself,

but not this time.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,230
You’re breaking my heart.

41
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,560
I’ve never been part of their story

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,950
since the very beginning.

43
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,710
I’m sorry,

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,310
but I couldn’t wait to see you.

45
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,870
Leave all our unhappiness

47
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,280
Thank you for giving me this scarf.

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,030
I recommend Cong Rong

49
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,630
to be the first chair
for the online loan case.

50
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,240
If you’re with me.

51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,120
The right amount of resistance

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,190
is to give hope to the hopeless.

53
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,560
When in that white coat,

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,310
you’re entrusted
with the patient’s health and life.

55
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,840
It’s time for us to
end this and move on.

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,430
Obsession with the past

57
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,540
is meaningless.

People can’t live in
their own fantasy forever.

61
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,430
Finally, I found you.

62
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,910
I don’t want to be separated
from you for a second.

63
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,750
I will help you out.

64
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,840
I’ll take care of this.

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,080
But I’m willing to protect what is right,

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
and those I care about.

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,630
I didn’t protect you well.

68
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,750
You used to keep me out by a chain.

69
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,560
The most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done

70
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,750
is to have fallen in love with you.

71
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,630
Will you be my girlfriend?

72
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,840
I’ve found the love of my life.

73
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,030
Cong Rong only tries to speak for me.

74
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,960
Don’t hurt her.

75
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,000
Because, to me,

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,840
she’s also as important as a family.

Dr. Wen,

128
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,130
let me tell you,

129
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,100
there is no such saying as “wife” in law.

130
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,930
The correct title should be “spouse”.

131
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,810
In another word,

132
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,640
wife is not protected by law.

133
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,960
Well, I got it.

134
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,080
But my wife should be protected by me.

135
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,610
Hello,

136
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,320

140

a car was stopping outside the restaurant

141
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,080
and its data recorder may record the site.

142
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,570

173
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,720
Hello.

174
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,570
Are you Mr. Gu, the owner of the car
with the tail number 092?

175
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,170
Yes.

176
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:10,690
Who’s that?

177
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,340
Here is the situation.

178
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,920
I’m a lawyer with Daren Law Firm.

179
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,930
Your data recorder

180
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,900
may capture critical evidence.

181
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,760
Could you...?

182
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,450
I’ve seen tons of your tricks.

183
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,200
Then, you’ll ask for my ATM PIN, right?

184
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,220
You got me wrong.

185
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,320
I’m not a swindler.

186
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,810
If you don’t believe me,

187
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,810
I could provide my valid certificates.

188
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,890
ID card or work permit.

189
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,970
Identity information can be fake.

190
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,220
I’m in Shanghai.

191
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,130
If what you said is true,

192
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,890
come to meet me in Shanghai tomorrow.

193
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,540
I’ll go abroad tomorrow night.

194
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,930
I can’t make it, tomorrow.

195
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,130
(Schedule: A case of online loans
comes to trial. Submit materials to court.)

196
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,660
(Attend a meeting.
Meet with clients.)

197
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,050
An ice cream and a cake.

198
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,570
Thank you.

199
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,200
Okay.

200
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,050
Here.

201
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,050
You treat me pizza

202
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,370
in return for my help?

203
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,570
Next time, it’s up to you.

204
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,320
I’m dying to see you

205
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,520
because I’m helpless.

206
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,690
What’s up?

207
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,760
I found the car owner.

208
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,090
But he’s in Shanghai,

209
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,010
and will go abroad tomorrow night.

210
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,220
To get the evidence,

211
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,160
I have to go to Shanghai.

212
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,640
But tomorrow, the case of online loans
comes to trial.

213
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,520
What a bad luck.

214
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,530
Here is a solution.

215
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,520
What?

216
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,610
You go to Shanghai

217
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,690
and I go to the court for you.

218
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,160
Can this be okay?

219
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,340
Why not?

220
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,490
I work on this case from A to Z.

221
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,690
Besides,

222
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,640
I’m a professional.

223
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,890
I do not doubt your ability.

224
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,450
Mr. Shangguan will not agree.

225
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,090
Cong Rong.

226
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,480
This is your first case.

227
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,860
We know how important it is to you.

228
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,610
But you should make clear one thing.

229
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,130
Would you like to give up the chance

230
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,370
for Wen Shaoqing?

231
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,220
(Daren Law Firm)

232
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,250
Where’s Cong Rong?

233
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,770
She’s gone to do checkup.

234
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,160
The case of online loans disputes
will be heard this afternoon.

235
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,370
Tell her to review

236
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,160
the case.

237
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,800
Mr. Shangguan,

238
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,770
as for the case,

239
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,760
I’ve communicated with Cong Rong.

240
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,820
I also work on this case from A to Z.

241
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,800
I know the case well.

242
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,210
So, I’ll replace Cong Rong to appear
in the court.

243
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,570
Besides,

244
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,210
we also talked to the clients.

245
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,060
They also agreed.

246
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,850
Nonsense.

247
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,680
How dare you regard such important work
as a trifling matter?

248
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,490
Where on earth has Cong Rong gone?

249
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,210
She went to Shanghai for evidence.

250
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,380
(Cong Rong)

251
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,530
You two are good friends.

252
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,210
Go call her back.

253
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,850
Hello,

254
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,250
what do you want for dinner?

255
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,250
I’ll hold a victory party for you.

256
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,640
I’m at the supermarket now.

257
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,250
Bad luck,

258
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,460
after the session is ended,

259
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,400
I’ll go to Shanghai with Mr. Shangguan.

260
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,850
I won’t come back until tomorrow.

261
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,010
It’s so sudden.

262
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,130
Mr. Shangguan

263
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,560
does not sympathize with you at all.

264
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,010
It’s me who insists on going to Shanghai

265
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,490
not Mr. Shangguan.

266
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,850
This is not the first time for me.

267
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,730
Relax.

268
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,560
OK.

269
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,040
Take good care of yourself.

270
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,940
Send me your flight number.

271
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,040
I’ll go to pick you up.

272
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,420
(Mr. Shangguan)

273
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,160
Why did you make the decision privately?

274
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,520
Why not discuss with me?

275
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,680
Do you still treat me as your senior?

276
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,120
I know you won’t agree

277
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,410
if I told you.

278
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,920
So you made the decision
before telling me.

279
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,740
Making statement is a hard-won

280
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,930
opportunity for interns.

281
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,490
You just gave it up with ease.

282
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,100
I’m sorry.

283
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,920
Mr. Shangguan.

284
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,100
During the case investigation,

285
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,490
I learned a lot.

286
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,040
You gave me step-by-step directions.

287
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,370
That’s the most precious for me.

288
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,920
So, even if I can’t make the statement,

289
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,920
I won’t feel sorry.

290
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,800
You give up your future

291
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,040
for Wen Shaoqing like that?

292
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:03,860
You and he

293
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,700
are two individuals.

294
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,530
As a newbie, you shall be a lawyer first.

295
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,060
Then,

296
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,040
you’re his girlfriend.

297
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,160
Mr. Shangguan.

298
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,370
I know what you did is for my good.

299
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,330
But you’re wrong for one thing.

300
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,730
I’m an individual.

301
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,970
But he

302
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,850
is the one I want to protect.

303
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Sorry, Mr. Shangguan.

304
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,560
I let you down.

305
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,330
Shangguan Yi,

306
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:41,890
why are you here?

307
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,330
You know?

308
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,010
She gave up her first court appearance
in her career

309
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,760
just to collect evidence for you.

310
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,090
How could you be so incompetent?

311
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,330
What?

312
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,560
Don’t you know

313
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,970
what an important chance it is for her?

314
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,130
If I were you,

315
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,090
I won’t let her give up the chance for me.

316
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,160
Follow me.

317
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,090
Why are you...?

318
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,610
Where to go?

319
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:26,820
Stop it.

320
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,730
Return my luggage.

321
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,010
Why are you here?

322
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,040
Cong Rong.

323
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,370
Drop my case.

324
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,850
Let’s settle out of court.

325
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,160
What are you talking about?

326
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,160
I know the whole truth.

327
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,160
You gave up your first court appearance

328
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,970
just to collect evidence for me.

329
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,800
I’ll pay the money

330
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,160
no matter how much it is.

331
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,370
You mean it?

332
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,210
I mean it.

333
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,370
Why drop the lawsuit?

334
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,410
I don’t get it.

335
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,800
There is no need to waste time.

336
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,280
It isn’t worth it.

337
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,730
How could it be not worth it?

338
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,090
If you drop the lawsuit,

339
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,340
the people who are unaware of the truth

340
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,000
will think you’re in the wrong.

341
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,890
You admit mistakes.

342
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,160
You’re wrong.

343
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,920
I’m a doctor.

344
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,090
As long as I don’t feel ashamed
before patients

345
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,610
and have a clear conscience,

346
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,010
that’s enough for me.

347
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,920
Wen Shaoqing,

348
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,330
what’s wrong with you?

349
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,760
You ignore obvious matters

350
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,460
and pretend they don’t exist.

351
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,490
Even they’ve wronged you,

352
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,880
you’ll accept it?

353
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,520
It’s not that I accept it.

354
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,520
I could ignore it.

355
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,760
But I couldn’t.

356
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,090
What did you tell me
when we first met each other?

357
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,040
You said, a doctor has his own dignity.

358
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,100
As long as you did nothing wrong,

359
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,210
you’d not yield regardless of pressure.

360
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,740
You said, you studied diligently

361
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,760
and cherished your reputation

362
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,090
just to be a good doctor.

363
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,890
Even when you get old,

364
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,130
you’d try to treat patients.

365
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,160
Isn’t it your principle?

366
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,280
I will not let you be treated wrongly.

367
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,970
Even if I’m a stranger to you,

368
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,130
as long as you could get justice,

369
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,210
I would do it.

370
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,280
But I don’t want you to give up
your chance for me.

371
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,160
This is not why I’m with you.

372
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,520
I wouldn’t allow you to give up
your principle either,

373
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,560
even for me.

374
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,620
(Agent)

375
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,730
Relax.

376
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,520
Take it easy.

377
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,040
Mr. Shangguan,

378
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,640
I feel a little giddy.

379
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,010
Thank you, Mr. Shangguan.

380
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,370
(Clerk)
All rise.

381
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,920
Welcome Chief Judge to his seat.

382
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,850
Be seated.

383
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,850
This court is now in session.

384
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,770
Plaintiff lawyer,

385
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,580
is your claim consistent with
the written indictment?

386
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,800
Is there any change or supplement
to the facts and reasons?

387
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,490
It’s consistent with the indictment.

388
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,090
No change or supplement.

389
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,250
Now, the plaintiff presents evidence,

390
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,280
stating the name of evidence
and all supporting facts.

391
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,640
Your honorable Chief Judge and judges.

392
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,890
I, entrusted by the plaintiff of the case,

393
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,640
act as agent ad litem of Zhang, Li, Yang,

394
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,770
Zhao, Du and Jiang,

395
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,440
and attend the case trial by law.

396
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,900
Now, as for the focus of dispute,

397
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,130
I present the following opinions
based on facts.

398
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,610
You gave up your first court appearance

399
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,660
just to collect evidence for me.

400
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,770
It isn’t worth it.

401
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,680
I will not let you be treated wrongly.

402
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,410
Even if I’m a stranger to you,

403
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,090
as long as you could get justice,

404
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,480
I would do it.

405
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,850
The defendant, Shen,

406
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,700
from August to November 2018,

407
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,090
in the name of doing business together,

408
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,930
used ID card from Zhang,

409
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,160
and borrowed money from multiple lenders,

410
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,960
causing our client to owe
a huge amount of money.

411
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,960
The borrower registered and
uploaded certification materials

412
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,770
for loan application.

413
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,640
In November 2018,

414
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,810
Li submitted the loan application

415
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,000
for RMB 400,000 to the lender.

416
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,660
The lender issued the loan contract.

417
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,890
We claim against the defendant

418
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,800
for returning the principal and interest,

419
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,770
totaling RMB 400,000 to our client.

420
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,740
(Futian District People’s Court)

421
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,530
Dr. Wen.

422
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,290
Congratulations.

423
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,530
Thank you.

424
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,160
Why are you here?

425
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,240
This is Cong Rong’s first case.

426
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,160
She can’t make the statement in person,

427
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,370
but she must like to

428
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,890
know the result immediately.

429
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,680
If Cong Rong could be here today,

430
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,480
she would be happier.

431
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,480
Because she’s worked hard for the case.

432
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,160
(File cover)
And me, Mr. Shangguan.

433
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,520
I also gave a lot to the case.

434
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,160
Yes.

435
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,160
You did a great job today.

436
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,720
I’m off.

437
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,810
Cong’s boyfriend is so considerate.

438
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,160
Mr. Shangguan,

439
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,770
shall we go to have a meal?

440
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,090
There’s a lot work to do.

441
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,130
Let’s go back.

442

(Febuxostat: Won. Congratulations, Miss Cong)

443

Yes.

444
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,570
My dad is critically ill,

445
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,420
while you two enjoy a big meal.

446
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,850
Calm down. Stop it.

447
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,940
He was fine in the morning
but is critically ill now.

448
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,740
Calm down.

449
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,570
Aren’t you a quack?

450
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,090
Stop it.

451
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,170
I’ll submit the evidence to the court.

452
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,200
The video is complete,

453
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,760
showing the whole process.

454
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,960
What would happen
if it’s ruled by the court?

455
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,330
Mr. Yao should know it clearly.

456
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,850
So we strongly disagree on

457
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,200
your claim.

458
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,220
We accept proper compensation.

459
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,050
But there’s no doubt that

460
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,890
your client caused harm to mine.

461
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,370
So we’re entitled to
hold you accountable.

462
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,480
Well, we’ll also reserve
the right to prosecute.

463
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,160
I met with you

464
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,160
not to apply pressure on you.

465
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,570
I sincerely hope we could make a deal.

466
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,460
Today’s situation is unexpected,

467
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,890
which is caused by momentary impulse

468
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,480
rather than grudge.

469
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,480
I understand you,

470
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,850
because I’ve been there.

471
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,570
I’ve never thought

472
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,810
I will look at

473
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,770
the occupation of doctor

474
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,160
from another angle.

475
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,720
I would like to tell you
in a responsible manner

476
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,970
there is no doctor in the world

477
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,570
who will give up treatment on a patient.

478
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,770
Till now,

479
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,160
the hospital’s trying to rescue the patient.

480
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,810
I hope you could calm down,

481
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,000
focus on doctors’ efforts

482
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,530
and show basic respect for doctors

483
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,890

comes out.

Yes.

Do proper hand exercise.

Avoid lifting heavy stuff.

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,090
Avoid energetic exercise.

512
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,850
Be gentle.

513
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,810
Thank you,

514
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,420
Rong and Boss.

515
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,160
I’m off.

516
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,770
Where are you going?

517
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,620
Return it to me.

518
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,380
It’s useless for you.

519
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,050
And it’s not yours.

520
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,090
It’s removed from my arm.

521
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,850
It’s not yours, either.

522
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,330
Besides,

523
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,130
what do you use it for?

524
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,330
For the prosperity and stability
of the hospital.

525
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,490
Seems he’s weirder than before.

526
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,480
It’s easy to make him normal.

527
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,020
(Wen Shaoqing)

528
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,220
(Wen Shaoqing)

529
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,720
Wait a minute,
I go get the case report.

530
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,130
Zhong Zhen,

531
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,530
what are you doing?

532
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,450
I finally got the signature.

533
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,370
Neither earlier

534
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,640
nor a bit too late,

535
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,890
you’ve timed it, right?

536
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,900
You took away my plaster

537
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,490
just for showing off Wen’s signature.

538
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,220
Of course not.

539
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,480
It’s for selling.

540
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,050
Boss’s peripherals

541
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,840
are so popular in the group

542
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,480
that many bid high prices.

543
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,650
You really have a head for business.

544
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,370
Exactly.

545
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,180
I’m talent.

546
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,000
Zhong Zhen,

547
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,480
don’t you use nine-grid keyboard?

548
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,680
Yes, I do.

549
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,900
What’s up?

550
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,410
How could you not know

551
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,330
which word has the same input sequence
as the word of “talent”?

552
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,640
You’re free, right?

553
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,610
Follow me.

554
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,660
(Talent=SB)

555
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,320
Why are we here?

556
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,240
I don’t need new clothing.

557
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,240
Yes, you do.

558
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,970
As a professional lawyer,

559
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,530
you should have decent clothes.

560
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,770
But, I have no idea

561
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,640
when I have a chance to wear them.

562
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,920
To celebrate on your removal of plaster,

563
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,090
I need to buy something for you.

564
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:05,940
Hello.

565
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,490
Welcome to our shop.

566
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,530
We have many new arrivals.

567
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,440
Have a look.

568
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:23,960
Cong Rong.

569
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,240
These are all nice.

570
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,460
Yes, they are wonderful.

571
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,200
But…

572
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,330
Miss,

573
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,570
get some white skirts for us.

574
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,290
But, what?

575
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:43,200
But we need to wear gown at the court.

576
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,370
I’ll be happier

577
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,480
if you wear the clothes I bought.

578
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,290
Thank you.

579
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,660
All right.

580
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,160
Go and try them on.

581
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,000
What do you think?

582
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,090
Does it fit?

583
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,610
Nice.

584
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,890
What do you think?

585
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,440
Very nice.

586
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,440
It’s tight on the shoulders, I think.

587
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,050
Doesn’t it fit?

588
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,960
Yes, it fits well.

589
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,720
Miss,

590
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,920
package all these, please.

591
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,160
Come.

592
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,160
Let me carry some.

593
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
I’m afraid you’re tired.

594
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,290
How could you deprive me
of the pleasure?

595
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,290
Why does carrying my bags
become your pleasure?

596
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,720
It’s the pleasure for your boyfriend.

597
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,240
When I studied abroad,

598
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,570
I teamed with a girl

599
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,770
in a research,

600
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,720
and I had a problem with her

601
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,010
for some reason.

602
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:11,570
Her boyfriend apologized to me,

603
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,210
saying she was spoiled

604
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,090
and had no manners.

605
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,680
I’m envious.

606
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,330
You were envious of a spoiled girl?

607
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,200
No.

608
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,570
I was envious of her boyfriend.

609
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,570
He could spoil his girlfriend

610
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,920
that much.

611
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,440
I wondered

612
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,920
if I met you earlier,

613
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,570
I would spoil you

614
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,530
and would not be envious of others.

615
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,130
Well,

616
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,240
you’re touched by me.

617
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,960
Not at all.

618
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,130
Cong Rong is totally a different girl
after falling in love.

619
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,410
Mr. Shangguan,

620
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,530
look at them.

621
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,050
When will I meet my Mr. Right?

622
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,480
Mr. Shangguan,

623
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,610
do you admire them?

624
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,610
Get off.

625
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,810
I’m gonna park the car.

626
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,700
You asked for leave to remove the plaster

627
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,000
but in fact to go dating.

628
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,290
I just dropped by.

629
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,330
Envy me?

630
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,570
Not at all.

631
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,560
Actually, I win the case the first time
I went to the court.

632
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,530
Do you envy me?

633
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,200
Indeed, I do.

634
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,160
Xiong Jingjing,

635
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,160
thank you for helping me.

636
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,570
You’re so polite

637
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,770
that I could not get used to it.

638
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,530
I know.

639
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,740
We win the case

640
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,280
mainly because of you.

641
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,800
But don’t look down upon me.

642
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,640
I’ll score a success on my own next time.

643
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,690
Great.

644
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,810
I’ll wait and see.

645
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,570
If you lose…

646
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,480
No way.

647
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,420
If I lose, I’ll treat you to a big meal.

648
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
That’s the deal.

649
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,170
OK.

650
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:22,920
Let’s go.

651
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,960
In January 2019,

652
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,370
though I missed the first chance
to go to court,

653
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,040
I do not regret.

654
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,740
There’s probably a long way to go

655
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,480
to become a good lawyer

656
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,680
but I’m grateful

657
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,050
that I took a step forward.

658
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,260
(Mr. Shangguan)

659
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,490
Mr. Shangguan,

660
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,200
what’s up?

661
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,890
Good news for you.

662
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,330
The case is officially withdrawn.

663
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,290
Is it true?

664
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,130
Great.

665
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,180
Director Yan,

666
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,220
your punishment is canceled.

667
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,010
Really?

668
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,560
Then I can restore my work tomorrow.

669
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,660
If your colleagues know your return,

670
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,730
they’ll be over the moon.

671
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,090
No, they should be the other way around.

672
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,930
What about the hospital?

673
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,090
Based on the investigation result,

674
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,290
Yun Ji did nothing illegal.

675
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,640
Luckily, the patient regained
consciousness.

676
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,640
His family also came to
realize the truth.

677
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,740
That’s great.

678
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,690
It’s a good day.

679
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,000
When you come back,

680
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,380
we’ll throw you a welcome party.

681
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,530
Thank you, Director Yan.

682
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,580
(Good News)

683
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,460
(Girlfriend)

684
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,920
You knew it.

685
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,050
Of course.

686
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,090
I got the first-hand news.

687
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,770
Thank you,

688
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,960
Miss Cong.

689
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,570
You’re welcome,

690
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,530
Dr. Wen.

691
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,610
Let’s bring everyone together
and celebrate tonight.

692
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,480
OK.

693
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,090
Rong.

694
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:26,460
Rong.

695
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,370
Hello, everyone.

696
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,090
What are we going to eat?

697
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:29,900
How about hot pot?

698
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,570
OK.

699
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:31,480
Fine with me.

700
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,920
To enjoy the big meal,

701
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,050
I’ll be a couple with Chengcheng.

702
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,930
So none of us are a third wheel.

703
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,720
Perfect.

704
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,570
Leave me alone.

705
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,810
Go to get someone else.

706
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,700
There are crowds of guys pursuing me.

707
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,000
You have no chance.

708
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,610
Let’s go.

709
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,770
Wait a minute.

710
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,200
There is another person.

711
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,130
Who?

712
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,130
Isn’t he the Boss’s uncle?

713
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,680
What brings you here?

714
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,660
You go back to work.

715
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,460
As your uncle,

716
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,890
I should come to celebrate it.

717
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:04,850
Uncle,

718
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,680
no matter why you are here,

719
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,740
in a world featuring
public display of affection,

720
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,240
we can team up to enjoy hot pot.

721
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,010
Sorry,

722
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,890
I have a teammate.

723
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,050
He’s pursuing me

724
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,050
but I haven’t said yes.

725
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,890
The world is so crazy.

726
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,810
Blood curd.

727
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,440
OK.

728
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,290
What kind?

729
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,010
Pig or ox?

730
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:34,570
Pig.

731
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,890
No.

732
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,200
Crab sticks for Chengcheng.

733
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,370
Beef and mutton.

734
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,220
I wanna...

735
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,570
Both beef and mutton.

736
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,370
Special beef.

737
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:45,850
OK.

738
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,380
Order me a...

739
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:46,900
How much should I order?

740
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,810
One for each.

741
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:48,530
People like you

742
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,890
are not clever.

743
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,240
Miss,

744
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,810
bring me a bear.

745
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,560
Wait a minute.

746
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,660
Sugar-coated haws for each.

747
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,050
Strawberry hawthorn.

748
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,840
Two dishes of thousand-layered tripe.

749
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,330
I noticed

750
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,380
there is no plain broth.

751
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,620
Hello, here is the bear.

752
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,160
Thank you.

753
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,520
Only the double-flavor hot pot
is available.

754
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,090
Tofu sheet slices.

755
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,240
Your perfect matching

756
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,330
leaves no space for me.

757
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,290
You need no space.

758
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,480
Lettuce, potato, yam, white gourd;
one dish for each.

759
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,530
Well.

760
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,380
Thank you.

761
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,560
Seems you’re recovered mentally.

762
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,610
I need to thank you for your tricks.

763
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,980
It’s you who fooled me.

764
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,800
Obviously, you’re anxious

765
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,200
and saw nothing.

766
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,960
Fortunately, adopting the right trick
is my strength.

767
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,440
So, you’re welcome.

768
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,890
What are you talking about?

769
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,650
I mean,

770
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,960
the four of us could play cards.

771
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,040
Four?

772
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,330
Four of us?

773
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,440
I haven’t said yes.

774
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:48,000
But you will soon.

775
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,050
Do you think I’m nobody?

776
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,200
I’ll go get sauce.

777
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,090
Sit down.

778
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,770
Let me do it.

779
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,890
I go get it as well.

780
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,610
Well, let me get one for you.

781
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,320
Uncle,

782
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,010
take this.

783
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,180
OK.

784
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,920
Thank you.

785
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,330
I can’t call you uncle anymore.

786
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,290
Chengcheng is a sister to me.

787
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,440
So you’re my brother.

788
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,620
Boss is also my brother.

789
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:20,940
Wen Rang.

790
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,480
Chili.

791
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,890
They you two will be brothers.

792
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,200
But that’s wrong.

793
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,000
Boss,

794
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,650
Wen Rang is your uncle,

795
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,610
so Chengcheng is your aunt-in-law.

796
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,720
Boss.

797
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,130
In this way,

798
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,640
you need to call me uncle.

799
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,170
If I call you like that,
do you have the gut to say “yes”?

800
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:52,930
You like him so much.

801
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,280
Why don’t you accept him?

802
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,440
Why do you keep him guessing?

803
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,690
It’s not true.

804
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,690
What is not true?

805
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,210
Our affection.

806
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,960
Although I like him,

807
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,810
I never expected him to like me.

808
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,370
You pursued him hardly

809
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,850
to be with him, didn’t you?

810
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,500
Well,

811
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,810
now you start to doubt your affection?

812
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,490
Do you think

813
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,650
he and I are cut from the same cloth?

814
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,050
Even now I still have no idea

815
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,090
why he chose me but not Jiang Yao.

816
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,330
Have you told what you thought to him?

817
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,570
You were not indecisive before.

818
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:28,500
Even a specialist needs to inquire
before making a diagnosis.

819
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:28,930
Well,

820
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,010
you need to make it clear

821
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,210
but not guessing without ground.

822
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:33,810
Thank you.

823
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,890
Try mine

824
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:36,850
to see which one is better.

825
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,850
What are you going to do?

826
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,650
Isn’t it for me?

827
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,210
No.

828
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,730
Seasoning platform is over there.

829
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,330
Shouldn’t you prepare the sauce

830
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,770
and bring it to me?

831
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,810
I don’t know your taste.

832
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,290
You’d better prepare it by yourself.

833
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,000
Pass me the oyster sauce.

834
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:08,770
It’s boiling.

835
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,580
It’s boiling. Come.

836
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,440
Enjoy it.

837
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,600
Enjoy it.

838
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,330
Try mine?

839
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,330
No need.

840
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,440
I didn’t prefer green onion.

841
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,600
Make way. I’ll go get the sauce.

842
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,170
Seems you’re not recovered totally.

843
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:23,890
That’s right.

844
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,140
Try the lettuce.

845
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,400
Since when, she didn’t eat green onion?

846
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,730
Not yet done.

847
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,290
Well,

848
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,020
take a look.

849
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,220
This is my favorite sauce.

850
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,210
Prepare it for me like this.

851
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,560
Stand up.

852
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,770
Not bad.

853
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,330
How to prepare it?

854
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:56,650
Shouldn’t you figure it out?

855
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,810
Do you expect me to tell you?

856
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:58,930
OK.

857
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,810
Anyway, I’m literate.

858
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,890
Cong Rong.

859
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,140
This beverage seems delicious.

860
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,170
Let me pour you some.

861
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,250
OK.

862
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,080
OK.

863
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,850
I want some too.

864
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,060
You can’t.

865
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,700
You have stomach trouble.

866
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,330
Drink tea.

867
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,180
You’ve finally finished.

868
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,020
They went away.

869
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,890
If you don’t come out,
I’ll go to find you.

870
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:30,970
Well,

871
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,170
my sauce recipe.

872
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,120
No ghost words.

873
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,920
Wen Rang,

874
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,690
is it true that you want to be with me?

875
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,960
Does it seem that I’m teasing you?

876
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,170
Yes, it does.

877
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,020
And I can’t feel your affection to me.

878
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,690
How could you feel it?

879
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,450
I’m in my 30s.

880
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,810
I have no idea what you like or dislike.

881
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,170
How about making a list for me,
like this one?

882
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,000
OK.

883
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,770
Well…

884
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,620
(Tips for pursuing me. Keep them in mind.
Follow it strictly.)

885
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,770
Let me have a look.

886
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,650
1. Everyday morning call.

887
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,770
2. A bunch of flowers every week.

888
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,920
3. At least 2hrs phone talks every day.

889
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:34,700
4. Shopping, dating and dining.
What are these?

890
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,740
So many rules.

891
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,520
What?

892
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,010
You don’t want to follow them?

893
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,170
Never mind.

894
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,000
Bye.

895
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,970
Wen Rang is indeed

896
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,890
a straight man.

897
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,920
Zhou Chengcheng will suffer greatly.

898
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,600
You don’t understand.

899
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,370
Wen Rang is a sly old fox.

900
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,960
He’s just playing dumb.

901
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,120
Maybe Zhou Chengcheng can’t
stop being teased.

902
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,480
Really?

903
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,210
Why do you like such thing?

904
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,360
Totally girlish.

905
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:08,970
Right.

906
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,060
I’m shallow.

907
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,770
I’m a shadow girl,

908
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,580
so stop liking me.

909
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,480
Stop following me.

910
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,890
No way.

911
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,090
Although it’s hard for me,

912
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,810
I can fulfill the last one.

913
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,210
What’s the last one?

914
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,170
Why don’t you follow the sequence?

915
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,890
I wrote so many.

916
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:48,770
Some more?

917
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,920
OK.

918
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,250
I mean these instructions.

919
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,770
How could you treat me like this?

920
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,000
A cunning fox.

921
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,280
Then, I’m off.

922
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,100
Wait, you’re pursuing me,

923
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,610
so won’t you send me home?

924
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,920
I haven’t accepted you.
