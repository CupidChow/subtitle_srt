Correct.

75
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,640
But he’s only harsh on me.

76
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,680

173
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,550
These are

174
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
the five offers from the three firms.

175
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,390
It depends on your luck

176
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,550
that which firm you will be in.

177
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,150
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

178
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,360
Who got Yun Ji Hospital?

179
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,200
Me.

180
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,200
OK.

181
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,240
Go to check in tomorrow morning.

182
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,840
Last but not least,

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,510
one out of five during the internship,

184
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,030
which means

185
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,840
the four of you will be eliminated.

186
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,720
Good luck.

187
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,840
Ms. Lucy.

188
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,750
Thanks for your help.

189
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,080
No need. Mr. Tan has notified me.

190
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,480
That girl is really out of luck.

191
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,560
Doing an internship in Yun Ji Hospital

192
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,140
means working like a handyman.

193
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,080
Yes.

194
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,480
Dealing with medical disputes.

195
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,870
That’s hard.

196
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,030
It’s not me, luckily.

197
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,360
The last intern in Yun Ji Hospital

198
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,320
only worked less than a month.

199
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,480
The sooner, the better.

200
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,710
She isn’t a law student.

201
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,560
She’ll be eliminated anyway.

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,960
She didn’t hear it, did she?

203
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,030
(Nurse Station)

204
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,600
Gosh... My back...

205
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,600
I can’t stand any longer.

206
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,990
My back...

207
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,080
Hurry. Give my back a thump. Come on.

208
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,080
OK. How badly do you wanna be injured?

209
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,390
We can rarely have a day off.

210
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,630
Now you are back with a patient.

211
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,990
Were you picking up a girl or a patient?

212
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,990
You hurt my tendon!

213
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,390
Crap! Pick up the girl!.

214
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,270
901.

215
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,620
Good.

216
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,870
Surprisingly,

217
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,750
he can get such a nice apartment.

218
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,550
Hello. This is Zhong Zhen.

219
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,810
If I don’t pick your call...

220
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,300
Zhong Zhen.

221
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,350
Cousin. I’m so sorry.

222
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,960
I just called my boss

223
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,440
and taught him a good lesson.

224
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,510
He may stand me up.

225
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,390
But how can he stand you up?

226
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,030
Cut it. I know you wanna survive this.

227
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,320
I’m not calling to blame you.

228
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,400
I’m contented with the apartment
you got me.

229
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,480
So, some good news for you.

230
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,630
I’ll soon be your colleague.

231
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,600
I’m startled.

232
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,000
To be my colleague?

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,150
Can you use a syringe or a scalpel?

234
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,790
I’m not kidding.

235
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,480
I’ve checked in at the general reception office.

236
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,200
My life is so miserable!

237
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,900
Hey...

238
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,220
Hello, Rong. I’m downstairs.

239
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,980
Give me a hug in a minute.

240
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,860
Chengcheng!

241
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,620
Rong. Come! Come!

242
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,790
I miss you so much.

243
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,860
I miss you so much. You’re finally back.

244
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,580
I miss you so much.

245
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,310
Enough. Save it.

246
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,790
You’re getting me suffocated.

247
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,670
Oh, right.

248
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,670
Look.

249
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,460
I’ve got you many daily necessities.

250
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,430
Pots and pans.

251
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,620
Toilet paper, hangers, shoehorn.

252
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,430
Back scratcher!

253
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,860
Have a scratch when it itches.

254
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,180
What’s this? A bath mate?

255
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,790
Let me introduce.

256
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,900
This is a Courage Duck.

257
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,950
I took it from my home.

258
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,990
The other one is for me.

259
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,950
Be sure to think of me when you bathe.

260
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,030
Yes.

261
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,910
Are you ready?

262
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,660
What?

263
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,450
What?

264
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,620
Let’s hang out.

265
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,950
My sweetie, you are finally back!

266
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,270
Due to the emergency today,

267
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,820
I couldn’t be with you again.

268
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,950
My bad.

269
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,270
Take the food as an apology. Alright?

270
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,230
Dig in.

271
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,180
Rangyirang.

272
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,950
I’ll be busy tomorrow night.

273
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,990
You’ll have to go to Wen Rang’s place.

274
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,270
Now?

275
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,380
You are a vulture, aren’t you?

276
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,270
Go.

277
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,990
Cheers.

278
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,180
It’s stunning!

279
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,950
Oh, right.

280
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,070
It’s for you.

281
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,030
What?

282
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,900
A crystal I prayed for you.

283
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,580
For love. I have one, too.

284
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,710
I come for work, not for love.

285
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,900
That’s not a conflict with your work.

286
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,030
Isn’t it good to be taken care of?

287
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,100
Look at me.

288
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,820
I’ve got gifts and flowers.

289
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,770
He says good night to me every day.

290
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,550
Instead of being taken care of,

291
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,990
I prefer someone who knows me

292
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,420
and deserves my love.

293
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,380
I won’t start a relationship casually.

294
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,030
Is love that complicated?

295
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,180
You like each other
and you fall in love.

296
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,270
Haven’t you ever had a crush?

297
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,820
Have you never loved someone

298
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,270
at the first sight?

299
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,710
You are thinking.

300
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,920
Who is it?

301
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,530
Is he handsome? What does he do?

302
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,970
Let me meet him. I’ll give you advice.

303
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,340
Just a passerby.

304
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,180
A passerby?

305
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,940
We can never meet again, I think.

306
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,510
Rong. Are you hungry?

307
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,030
Yes.

308
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,360
Shall we?

309
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,860
You came out with an empty stomach.

310
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,120
You’re hungry now, huh?

311
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,750
Come.

312
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,230
Wait for me here. Don’t move.

313
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,990
Is it the so-called feast?

314
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,860
Where did the dog come from?

315
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,080
Are you alright? Are you scalded?

316
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,750
What are you doing? Make away.

317
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,620
Get out of my way.

318
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,710
I’m ordering you! Get away right now!

319
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,710
Rangyirang. Get down.

320
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,030
Sorry. You must be scared.

321
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,670
It thought you were calling it.

322
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,920
His look is so...

323
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,560
It’s my fault.

324
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,670
I’ll pay you for it.

325
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,310
OK.

326
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,840
No.

327
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:52,960
What?

328
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,840
It’s worth little.
Do you want him to pay?

329
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,750
I’m not asking him for money.

330
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,270
It’s fate. Don’t miss this chance.

331
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,120
The phone.

332
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,350
My phone?

333
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,360
Or what?

334
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,720
I already have a boyfriend.

335
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,470
Or I’ll have him myself. You’re lucky.

336
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,680
You’re welcome.

337
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,630
Zhou Chengcheng. Zhou Chengcheng.

338
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,100
Give it to me.

339
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,920
What are you doing?

340
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
8.2 yuan in total.

341
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,080
Pay by WeChat. Let me friend you.

342
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,950
No. I have cash.

343
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,190
He still uses cash nowadays?

344
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,150
No. Pay by WeChat.

345
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,150
There’s a change.

346
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,150
How...How will you get the change?

347
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,560
This is 8.2 yuan. Keep the change.

Hey, is my makeup bad?

350
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,840
I got rejected for the first time.

351
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,510
Alright. Let’s go.

352
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,510
I’m clearing it up. After you.

353
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,670
I’m gonna throw this away.

Get familiar with it when you are free.

362

OK. Got it.

Director Yan. What is my duty?

364
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,270
Three points mainly.

365
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,310
First,

366
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,310
the legal education for the staff here.

367

if any.

371

At this moment,

372
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,840
there’s a tough case to deal with.

373

(Administrative Building)
Medical disputes are hard to deal with.

376
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,830
We need to make a balance

377
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,230
between the patients and doctors.

378
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,750
This patient is Mr. Lin.

379
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,140
-He’s been there for two days.
-Apology and refund!

380
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,230
He said the doctor misdiagnosed

381
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
and ripped him off

382
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,640
by hospitalizing him.

383
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,480
He refuses to eat and drink,

00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,470
making a scene

385
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,320
for an apology from the doctor.

386
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,470
-Did the doctor really misdiagnose?
-Sir.

387
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,560
Is he unwilling to apologize?

388
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,270
Have some water. Please calm down.

389
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,310
I claim an apology and a refund!

390
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,190
Disputes are not so simple as they seem.

391
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,640
And the doctors

392
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,120
have their own unique tempers.

393

Today,

395
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,510
go to the doctor for details,

396
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,310
and make a summary.

397
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,800
OK. Consider it done.

398

Sorry.

I didn’t say no.

I just said he was out.

430
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,590
Why are you hiding from me?

431
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,230
Not hiding, but avoiding you.

432
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,120
OK. Avoiding me.

433
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,040
Tell me about the patient Mr. Lin,

434
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,550
his information
and cause of the dispute.

435

You can get all the information

436
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,830
from the hospital office.

437
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,430
I’ve checked,

only about hospitalization
and medication.

439
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,520
I need to check the details with you.

Patient No.6 is still unconscious.

445

His family requests a blood transfusion.

446
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,190
That’s risky and unnecessary.

447
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,120
Go try to convince them again.

448
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,800

How about five minutes?

457

One minute.

458
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,230
Deal.

459
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,400
Mr. Lin complained that

460
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,830
it’s a misdiagnose of tinnitus,

461
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,070
but you got him to take CT

462
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,150
and hospitalized.

463
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,110
Miss.

464
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,160
It’s not like removing a bad part
from the whole.

465
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,240
He has tinnitus

466
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,100
because his brain tumor oppresses
the auditory nerves.

467
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,040
He wanted to be discharged and you said no.

468
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,920
Not really.

469
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,750
I didn’t agree at that moment.

470
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,670
Before he’s discharged,

471
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,270
I’m obliged to tell him the risk.

472
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,030
He said you had a bad attitude.

473
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,510
Given my limited experience
being with you,

474
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,800
that’s likely to happen.

475

Time is up.

476
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,070
Sorry, but I’d like to ask...

477
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,110
No question since you feel sorry.

478
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,840
That’s a courtesy.

479
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,230
I still have to ask.

480
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,630
Mr. Lin wants an apology from you.

481
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,430
No.

482
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,910
Dr. Wen.

483
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,990
Could you please assist with my work?

484
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,870
I’m here to mediate,

485
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,040
not looking for troubles.

486
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,310
He doesn’t eat,

487
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,440
and you don’t explain it.

488
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,710
How can I settle it?

489
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,470
Mediation is not like a handshake.

490
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,470
If it is that easy,

491
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,430
your work will be meaningless.

492
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,030
Thanks for knowing the value of my work.

493
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,880
I didn’t mean that.

494
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,300
I have a summary for you to write.

Can I come when you’re off work?

496

You can’t.

497
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,540
How can I come to you?

498
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,100

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,740
Are you threatening me?

516
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,900
No, I didn’t mean that.

517
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,980
I just want you to write a briefing.

518
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,460
You’d better know that

519
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,180
you’re getting a doctor occupied.

520
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,420
The outpatient service
is about to be over.

521
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,510
If not you,

522
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,780
I could’ve had one more patient.

523
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,980
I’ve registered and paid

524
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,990
for your time to talk with me.

525
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,100
I’m sorry.

526
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,270
No personal affairs during my work,

527
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,030
unless your brain has a problem.

528
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,660
(Medical casebook)

529
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,070
I’m pissed off.

530
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,950
Look at that cloud.

531
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,100
Isn’t it like a pig?

532
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,950
Sorry.

533
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,230
That’s not me just now.

534
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,470
Today, I’m just a little bit

535
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,380
crazy.

536
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,620
I’m not laughing at you.

537
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,860
It’s that one.

538
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,670
Medical casebook?

539
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,510
Um.

540
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,700
What’s funny?

541
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,350
This medicine is special,

542
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,860
not available in drugstores.

543
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,260
What is it?

544
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,750
Idiotic pills.

545
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,970
Can I have the casebook?

546
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,190
I wanna collect it.

547
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,620
Take it. You’re welcome.

548
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,710
Thanks.

549
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,990
Are you new here?

550
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,970
Actually, Dr. Wen is

551
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,740
the ideal boyfriend voted by nurses.

552
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,710
No.1.

553
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,510
Many girls like him.

554
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,380
For his good look?

555
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,820
Certainly not.

556
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,350
He graduated from a top medical school,

557
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,710
but he doesn’t pull rank at all.

558
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,470
He’s really responsible for patients.

559
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,060
I’ve seen many times that

560
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,260
he worked overtime voluntarily

561
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,030
to look after the patients.

562
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,230
Are we talking about the same guy?

563
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,070
Do you have a grudge against him?

564
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,620
How did you know it?

565
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,590
From the medicines he prescribed
for you.

566
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,990
He must be furious.

567
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,210
Doctors are the busiest
on outpatient days.

568
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,220
They can’t even

569
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,500
have a sip of water all day

570
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,420
so as to serve more patients.

571
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,300
Yet you came to him.

572
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,420
That’s a taboo.

573
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,860
Is it so?

574
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,950
He even refused his acquaintances

575
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,500
to cut in.

576
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,580
Let alone you were not sick.

577
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,380
Crap.

578
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,180
Should I apologize to him now?

579
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,660
I’m leaving.

580
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,310
He’s off work.

581
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,180
Do you know where he went?

582
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,340
Are you off work?

583
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,510
Wen Rang.

584
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,790
What brings you here?

585
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,380
I’m your uncle. Remember the hierarchy.

586
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,750
Don’t take advantage of me.

587
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,230
You’re only a few years elder than me.

588
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,790
Where is the dog?

589
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,990
At home.

590
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,380
Have a drink with me.

591
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,420
I will drive. No.

592
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,950
Scolded by my grandpa again?

593
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,420
I suppose he is living this long

594
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,140
just to scold me.

595
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,550
You asked for it.

596
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,380
If you don’t wanna be scolded,

597
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,140
then don’t be against him.

598
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,620
Start a business and get married.

599
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,380
Do as he pleases. That’s it.

600
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,260
I have a bookstore and sell poems.

601
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,190
What else should I do?

602
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,350
Only two books were sold,

603
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,820
which are paid by me for my colleagues.

604
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,140
I’ve told him today.

605
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,670
If I can’t sell 3,000 books
in half a year,

606
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,510
I’ll be at his disposal.

607
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,230
I’m in dire straits.

608
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,510
Why having wine then?

609
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,500
Go back for some tea

610
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,820
and think about how to sell books.

611
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,260
Won’t you drink with me?

612
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,140
No.

613
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,860
Why are you so stubborn?

614
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,860
As if she could come here.

615
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,540
You’ll stand here for hours

616
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,310
and then come to me for a drink.

617
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,510
It’s been years.

618
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,390
Think about it.

619
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,070
What if she would never turn up?

620
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,910
You... You are really leaving?

621
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,740
Why are you crying?

622
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,990
You are my best friend.

623
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:37,300
I... I don’t want you to leave.

624
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,830
Alright. Don’t cry.

625
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,430
My mom said

626
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,420
I’d stay with my grandma for a few days.

627
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,710
I’ll be back soon,

628
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,740
before the school starts.

629
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,740
Really?

630
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,380
You have my word.

631
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,990
I’ll marry you once I’m back.

632
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,390
You’re a girl.

633
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,660
I’ll propose to marry you.

634
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,180
Alright.

635
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,070
Cong Rong, time to go.

636
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,070
I’m leaving.

637
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,740
Let’s go.

638
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,140
OK.

639
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,550
See you next term! I’m waiting for you!

640
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,780
I’ll wait for you here when I’m back!

641
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,550
Even before you left,

642
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,580
I hadn’t told you

643
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,910
I was Wen Shaoqing from Class 9.

644
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,910
I’ll wait for you here when I’m back!

645
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,510
Your clothes are wet.

646
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,180
Dr. Wen. Sorry if I disturbed you.

647
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,770
It’s you.

648
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,330
I’m here to apologize.

649
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,540
I took the liberty to meet you.

650
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
I’ve reflected on it.

651
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,500
I was too impulsive.

652
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,210
I didn’t blame you for standing me up.

653
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,730
Whoever has the sense of responsibility

654
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:26,620
would do the same.

655
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,020
And, yesterday,

656
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,370
you left the pen at the airport.

657
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,290
Here it is.

658
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,250
I wanna turn a new leaf by this chance.

659
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,690
I’m an intern here from Daren Law Firm.

660
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,580
Nice to meet you.

661
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,660
My name is Cong Rong.

662
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,400
What’s your name again?

663
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,620
Cong Rong!

664
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,020
You’re finally here.

665
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,730
I’ve been waiting for you.

666
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,980
I thought he hugged me mistakenly.

667
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,330
Actually not.

668
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,940
He just came a long way here

669
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,660
and reached the destination

670
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,580
one step ahead before me.

671
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,470
To meet again

672
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,180
is nothing incidental.

673
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,390
It’s because

674
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,620
someone has been waiting there

675
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,260
all the time.
