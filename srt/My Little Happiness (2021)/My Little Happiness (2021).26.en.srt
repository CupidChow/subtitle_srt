What’s the laugh about?

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,850
Wen Rang is indeed

32
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,920
a straight man.

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,000
Zhou Chengcheng

34
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,170
will suffer greatly.

35
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,120
You don’t understand.

36
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,970
Wen Rang is a sly old fox.

37
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,480
He’s just playing dumb.

38
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,250
Maybe Zhou Chengcheng can’t

39
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,610
stop being teased.

40
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,920
Really?

41
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,130
The truth of relationship is

42
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,130
that it’s like playing games.

43
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,480
Beating the game too easily

44
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,520
means less fun.

45
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,050
I’d say three days at most.

46
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,810
That’s why you are flirting with me

47
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,170
but not confessing.

48
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,490
Tell me then.

49
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,920
How much longer will you play the game?

50
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,460
It’s been over three days.

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,850
Now we’re heading towards three months.

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,730
The biggest virtue of my family is

53
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,450
that we’re blessed with the best genes.

54
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,640
Do you know what

55
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,730
the best of the best is?

56
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,080
Is it flirting?

57
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,520
To start carefully for a happy ending.

58
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,610
The beauty of love is that

59
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,610
it withstands the test of reality.

60
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,570
After I was suspended,

61
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,640
you didn’t hesitate to protect me.

62
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,850
I was moved.

63
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,730
I wish we could hold hands together

64
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,640
till our hair turns grey.

65
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,680
The best virtue of our family is

66
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,680
that we start carefully for a happy ending.

67
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,170
I wish we could hold hands together

68
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,680
till our hair turns grey.

69
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,340
(Wen Shaoqing)

70
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,500
(Let me give you a ride tomorrow.)

71
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,460
(Wen Shaoqing: I’ll give you a ride,
Miss Cong.)

72
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:05,300
(No, let me. You’ve been off work for long.)
(I didn’t have the fun of giving a ride.)

73
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,460
(Wen Shaoqing: All right.)

74
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,260
(Go sleep. See you tomorrow.
No, in seven hours. Good night.)

75
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,420
(Your babe goes to sleep now)

76
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,970
It’s just 11 PM.

77
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,850
Not too late.

78
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,170
Aren’t we going to meet in seven hours?

79
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,730
Miss Cong, you knocked the door

80
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,930
of a single man in pajamas at midnight.

81
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,920
What do you want?

82
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,500
Can I send you my attorney’s letter

83
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,000
for harassment?

84
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,290
I’m here for medical advice.

85
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,210
Can you prescribe some sleeping pills?

86
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,800
I can’t fall asleep.

87
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,800
Sleeping problem.

88
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,170
It’s about the storage of Yang energy.

89
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,530
What is that?

90
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,400
Huangdi Neijing says, in the cold days

91
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,010
when water freezes, one needs to

92
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,460
sleep early and get up late

93
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,560
after sunrise to store Yang energy and

94
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,850
stay calm. To put it simply,

95
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,200
Yang energy is stored in your body.

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,460
Your mind is affected due to mood changes.

97
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,770
So what is my problem?

98
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,650
Tell me!

99
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,240
I mean…

100
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,530
I have to warn you. Don’t seduce me.

101
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,200
I didn’t.

102
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,610
I just can’t fall asleep.

103
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,610
You pervert.

104
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,620
You’re here for my medical advice.

105
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,000
How can I walk away?

106
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,850
Come on in.

107
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,240
Lie down.

108
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,560
Close your eyes.

109
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,210
What’s this?

110
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,170
ASMR for white noise.

111
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,000
ASMR means
the autonomous sensory meridian response.

112
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,680
It’s visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory

113
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,800
or sensory stimulation which

114
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,920
induces a special and pleasing sensation

115
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,000
inside your head,

116
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,970
on your scalp or

117
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,360
other parts of body

118
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,290
to help you sleep better.

119
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,410
You worked too hard and

120
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,120
didn’t get enough sleep.

121
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,800
That’s why your cortex
was too stretched.

122
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,290
So when you’re relaxed,

123
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,240
you find it difficult to sleep.

124
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,880
After we get married,

125
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,090
I’ll give you head massage every night.

126
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,650
Who’s going to marry you?

127
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,090
Why did I sleep here?

128
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,240
Are you awake?

129
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,770
Go brush your teeth

130
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,320
and have some breakfast.

131
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,560
-Welcome back, Boss!
-Welcome back, Boss!

132
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,170
-Good morning, Mrs. Wen!
-Good morning, Mrs. Wen!

133
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,930
Zhong Zhen,

134
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,020
what’re you doing here so early?

135
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,680
To welcome Boss back for work.

136
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,800
Rong,

137
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,440
don’t tell me you’re wounded again.

138
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,650
Nope.

139
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,290
When I was brushing teeth,

140
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,290
the water was off.

141
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,290
So I came to ask him,

142
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,080
and found it only happened to me.

143
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,220
I might have accidentally switched it off.

144
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,490
I need to go back and check.

145
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,620
Are you looking for Wen Shaoqing?

146
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,500
He’s there.

147
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,050
Go ahead.

148
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,960
Are they going to gossip at hospital?

149
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,650
Come on in.

150
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,050
Bye, Boss.

151
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,410
See you.

152
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:39,960
All right.

153
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,370
Bye.

154
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,720
You did it on purpose.

155
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,840
How come?

156
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,650
They came here to welcome me back.

157
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,920
I knew it just now.

158
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,840
I don’t buy it.

159
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,560
Do you have any evidence to prove

160
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,530
I did it on purpose?

161
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,290
I don’t.

162
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,220
So be it.

163
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,250
You always talked about

164
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,210
the principle of “burden of proof”.

165
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,450
I did talk about that.

166
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,860
But there’s an exception “reverse onus”.

167
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,740
That is to say,

168
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,050
if I think you’re the suspect,

169
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,650
but you can’t prove you didn’t do it,

170
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,620
then it’s assumed

171
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,140
my claim is justified.

172
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,260
How rational you are!

173
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,440
I’m always rational.

174
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,770
It doesn’t work.

175
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,530
Everybody saw it.

176
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,900
We’re all grown-ups.

177
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,050
They can understand.

178
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,380
You… You did it on purpose.

179
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:33,860
You did it

180
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,380
on purpose,

181
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,980
on purpose…

182
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,220
Calm down.

183
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,530
Do you need CPZ?

184
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,800
What’s that?

185
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,900
It’s a kind of sedative drug

186
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,570
for schizophrenics and other psychos.

187
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,570
You’re crazy.

188
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,600
Craziness isn’t mental disorder.

189
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,290
I… I’m fine.

190
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,340
Go on.

191
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,200
I need to go.

192
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,170
Bye, Rong.

193
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,650
I’ve never seen her like this.

194
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,800
You’ve never seen many sides of her.

195
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,530
I grew up with her.

196
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,010
You’ve never seen lots of sides, either.

197
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,500
I left my phone at your home.

198
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,170
I’m here to get it back.

199
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,680
Since you know so much,

200
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,770
let’s go talk about your paper.

201
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,290
Oh, please. Boss, I’m busy.

202
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,460
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

203
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,170
Dr. Wen, you’re back!

204
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,370
I miss you so much.

205
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,490
It’s just a few days.

206
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,530
Stop exaggerating.

207
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,850
By the way,

208
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,720
there’s a fruit basket on your table.

209
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,100
All right.

210
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,730
Thank you.

211
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,010
Give me some if you can’t finish.

212
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:43,980
Sure thing.

213
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,340
OK.

214
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,040
Bye.

215
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,770
Bye.

216
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,980
(Apologies to Dr. Wen.
Family of the patient in Bed Three)

217
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,380
Look at you.

218
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,530
You look pretty well.

219
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,530
What about you?

220
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,800
Seems you’re blessed with night shifts.

221
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,770
Let’s go.

222
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,450
There’s a mess

223
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,490
for you to clean up.

224
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,530
(Rang Kai Bookstore)

225
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,200
Good morning!

226
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,440
What’s the emergency so early?

227
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,320
Sandwich for you!

228
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,130
And flowers!

229
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,130
Oh, wow, finally!

230
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,650
Are you happy?

231
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,410
Yes.

232
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,170
I am.

233
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,680
There’s more.

234
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,330
Are we hanging out?

235
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,100
Let’s go.

236
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,800
Go!

237
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,720
Having fun?

238
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,080
Having fun?

239
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,650
It’s not fun at all.

240
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,080
If I knew it’s so tiring,

241
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,320
I would have thrown it away.

242
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,810
Are you all right?

243
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,330
Don’t talk to me.

244
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,570
Why did you bring me here?

245
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,770
What do you want?

246
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,600
If you think I’m over weighted,

247
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,490
tell me directly.

248
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,690
Do you want a piggyback?

249
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,440
No.

250
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,050
Then hold my hand.

251
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,370
No.

252
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,200
I can walk.

253
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,020
You’re annoying.

254
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,290
It’s scary.

255
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,080
I’m worn out.

256
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,840
I’m also tired.

257
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,720
You…

258
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,720
Why did you bring me all the way here?

259
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,500
What’s it for?

260
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,490
To sit here.

261
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,600
To sit here?

262
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,770
We drove a long way,

263
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,840
and walked so far

264
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,440
just to sit here?

265
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,290
Yeah.

266
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,530
To sit here.

267
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,200
Do you often come here

268
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,370
for hiking when you’re free?

269
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,250
Sometimes.

270
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,560
With whom?

271
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,890
Flowers, grasses, birds, insects,

272
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,080
mountain breezes and clouds.

273
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,720
Did you get

274
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,250
your poetry inspiration here?

275
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,960
Try it.

276
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,990
It tastes so good.

277
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,590
That’s the tea from mountains.

278
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,350
Is it sweet?

279
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,060
It’s mountain dew.

280
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,080
Does it take so much time?

281
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,870
The Classic of Tea says,

282
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,830
spring water is the best, river water

283
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,110
is the second,
and well water is the worst.

284
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,940
So I collected the dew at 3 AM,

285
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,670
put it in a jar

286
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,510
and buried it three feet
under the ground.

287
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,390
It took you so much effort.

288
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,150
I need to take small sips.

289
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,820
I’m kidding.

290
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,910
I always wanted to do this,

291
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,180
but I haven’t tried yet.

292
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,140
It’s the tea from mountains,

293
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,320
but the water is

294
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,230
just mineral water.

295
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,320
But

296
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,620
if you’re in a different mood,

297
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,150
the tea tastes different as well.

298
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,540
It’s just like the views here.

299
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,300
They’re not great mountains.

300
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,750
But the unique views are something

301
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,940
I want to share with you.

302
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,350
Wen Rang.

303
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,060
What?

304
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,990
Look, we’re totally different.

305
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,900
You’re gentle, while I’m restless.

306
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,180
You’re calm, while I’m short-tempered.

307
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,590
You think about the state of mind.

308
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,350
I follow the nose.

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,230
About us being together,

310
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,510
have you really thought about it?

311
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,270
You and I are quite different.

312
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,350
You’re very spontaneous.

313
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,670
You go all out for the things you like,

314
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,470
and stay far away from the things

315
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,590
you dislike.

316
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,230
You’re a free spirit.

317
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,480
So you don’t judge or

318
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,540
restrain others.

319
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,960
I feel quite relaxed

320
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,870
when I’m with you.

321
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,660
That’s it?

322
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,630
There’s another big reason.

323
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,180
For me,

324
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,780
you’re who you are.

325
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,230
The one and only.

326
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,180
It’s all done?

327
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,630
Did you drink?

328
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,700
Yeah.

329
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,660
I was happy.

330
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,740
Zhang and others gave us gifts.

331
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,700
What gift?

332
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,980
A love letter.

333
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,980
(Miss Cong, we love you.)
You’ve got so many confessions.

334
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,790
I can’t compete with you.

335
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,590
I used to think

336
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,590
it must be romantic if

337
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,350
I get a love letter from the boy I love.

338
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,740
What about now?

339
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,790
Now?

340
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,400
Now everyone uses internet.

341
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,700
Who would write a love letter by hand?

342
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,940
Stop looking at it.

343
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,390
Let’s go watch a movie.

344
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,310
We haven’t dated for long.

345
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,550
Let’s go.

346
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,590
Hello?

347
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:28,920
OK.

348
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,590
I got it.

349
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,150
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)
(According to the latest news,)

350
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,300
(there’re numerous aftershocks
in Dijing.)

351
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,240
(The roads to the epicenter,
Jinghe County,)

352
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,060
(have been clogged by collapsed rocks.)

353
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,870
(The injured are sent to hospital.)

354
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,910
(It’s estimated the death toll
will rise.)

355
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,660
(National rescue team
has arrived on site.)

356
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,660
You’re all clear about the situation.

357
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,420
It’s very critical.

358
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,550
As a key provincial hospital,

359
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,460
we need to send a rescue team there.

360
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,790
We don’t have much time.

361
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,500
Let’s get a list.

362
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,180
I’ll go.

363
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,960
I’ll go.

364
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,510
Me too.

365
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,420
Count me in.

366
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,550
Director,

367
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,790
let me go there.

368
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,420
Dr. Li has two severe cases.

369
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,180
Dr. Zhao is too old

370
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,070
to travel around.

371
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,260
I’m young.

372
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,740
I just came back. I’m not occupied.

373
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,980
So leave it to me.

374
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,740
I’ll go, too.

375
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,700
Director,

376
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,790
can I also go there?

377
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,740
All right.

378
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,790
Our young doctors are so active.

379
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,150
Let them take the lead.

380
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,940
Wen Shaoqing will be the leader

381
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,830
of our special neurosurgical team.

382
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,940
Let’s have a meeting.

383
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,790
All right.

384
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,700
Come on!

385
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,030
Take care!

386
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,740
Come on!

387
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,540
(It’s noted the medical team will gather
at the airport of disaster area…)

388
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,620
(Zhong Zhen)

389
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,220
Hello?

390
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,630
Rong.

391
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,940
Are you sleeping?

392
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,300
I’m about to.

393
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,150
What’s wrong?

394
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,220
We just had a meeting at the hospital.

395
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,350
A medical team will be sent for rescue.

396
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,830
I signed up for it.

397
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,430
And, well…

398
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,630
Is Wen Shaoqing also going?

399
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,590
Yes.

400
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,900
He’ll lead the team.

401
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,590
He’s still having a meeting.

402
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,070
When will you leave?

403
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,980
It might be in a minute.

404
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,550
In a minute.

405
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,900
Rong.

406
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,070
Let me get his stuff

407
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,150
and bring it to the hospital.

408
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:50,980
All right.

409
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,420
You won’t see him for quite a while.

410
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,980
Are you going to miss him too?

411
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,180
Hurry up.

412
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,630
Sanbao.

413
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Your clothes.

414
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,750
I’ve checked.

415
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,100
No red clothes in there.

416
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,790
I also packed your favorite snacks.

417
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,220
Don’t eat too much.

418
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,390
Save lives.

419
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,700
Don’t miss me too much.

420
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,350
What are you looking at?

421
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,630
Nothing.

422
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,630
Here you are.

423
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,500
Zhong Zhen told you already?

424
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,310
Where is he?

425
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,110
He doesn’t want you to see him off.

426
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,870
So he won’t say goodbye to your face.

427
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,630
When you’re free,

428
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,590
please take care of Rangyirang.

429
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,260
When will you come back?

430
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,550
It’s hard to say.

431
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,460
Take care.

432
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,180
If you don’t want Zhong Zhen

433
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,390
to take the risk,

434
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,260
I can talk to the Director.

435
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,220
He’s not a kid anymore.

436
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,940
He can decide his own life.

437
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,030
I wish he could be someone like you,

438
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,180
to be a responsible doctor.

439
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,460
Let him go there.

440
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,420
All right.

441
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,220
Don’t worry about him.

442
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,830
I’ll look after him.

443
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,590
I’m more worried about you.

444
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,740
I’ll also look after myself.

445
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,220
It’s not that serious this time.

446
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,110
You need to send me messages every day.

447
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,350
Just wait for me to come back.

448
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,420
I have news for you.

449
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,700
Take care of yourself.

450
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,220
OK.

451
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,540
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

452
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,500
(Together with Yun Ji,
we conquer the disaster)

453
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,420
Chengcheng!

454
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,030
Chengcheng!

455
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,420
Chengcheng!

456
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,460
(Wen Rang)

457
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,460
It’s so early. Where is she?

458
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,260
Zhou Chengcheng!

459
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,790
Why are you here?

460
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,180
Be quiet!

461
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,500
I learnt that dew is affected by

462
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,440
atmosphere, wind, temperature,
and humidity.

463
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,400
You were too loud.

464
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,420
It would make it less tasty.

465
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,300
You were even louder.

466
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,830
I wanted to make it taste

467
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,350
the best.

468
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,980
Or why did I pay such effort?

469
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,780
Does it work?

470
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,260
How do you know if you don’t try?

471
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,550
What are you doing?

472
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,700
I want you to finish your task soon.

473
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,180
You… So insensitive.

474
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,110
You have dark circles under your eyes.

475
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,670
I guess you didn’t sleep well.

476
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,940
Go back and take a rest.

477
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,870
OK.

478
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,740
Why did I fall asleep?

479
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,870
Where is my jar?

480
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,310
Looks like you don’t remember at all.

481
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,260
Come here and have some tea.

482
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,350
I didn’t want to tell you.

483
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,510
But look at you now,

484
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,870
I don’t want to hide it.

485
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,680
Dew is not drinkable because

486
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,260
our environment is polluted.

487
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,710
You didn’t say it last time.

488
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,190
I was just talking.

489
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,030
How could I know you took it seriously?

490
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,790
Please finish your sentence next time.

491
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,480
But because of it,

492
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,200
I came to know

493
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,350
you’re so serious about what I said.

494
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,710
Do you care about me so much?

495
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,260
I don’t care about you.

496
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,390
Really?

497
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,440
I wanted to bring you to some places

498
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,870
without pollution.

499
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,480
But since you say you don’t care,

500
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,550
never mind.

501
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,830
I do care about you!

502
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,480
Where are we going?

503
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,260
I want to go there.

504
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,070
For example, Kamchatka in Siberia,

505
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,180
Svalbard in Norway,

506
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,420
and La Rinconada in Peru.

507
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,980
(Note)

508
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,510
What are you doing?

509
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,820
Put them down on my phone,

510
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,580
and print out for your signature,

511
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,270
in case you deny it

512
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,550
and let me down.

513
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,790
I’m ready.

514
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,630
Give me the names.

515
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,870
Give me…

516

When can I get the result?

526
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,550
I learned about first aid at hospital,

527

Although they’re skiing goggles,

676

they can protect you from dust.

677

With the protection of all these stuffs,

682

you will surely make it through.

No, no.

00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,280
They’re not useful for me.

688
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,220
And I can’t bring them along.

689
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,030
These are all

690
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,990
my luggage.

691
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,380
Rong,

692
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,260
I’m worried about you.

693
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,780
I’m worried about Wen Shaoqing.

694
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,110
Are you sure you will find him?

695
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,380
It’s a big area.

696
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,280
I may not be able to find him, but

697
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,960
when I think we’re at the same place,

698
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,320
doing the same things,

699
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,660
I feel safe and assured.

700
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,070
As long as I can help him a little bit,

701
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,700
I’ll be satisfied.

702
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,030
You’re so deeply in love with him.

703
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,630
I really miss him.

704
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,590
I was cleaning the room the other day,

705
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,910
I saw all the memories about us.

706
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,470
But now I don’t hear anything about him.

707
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,030
I don’t know what to do

708
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,860
if anything bad happens to him.

709
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,590
Think about it.

710
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,830
Wen Shaoqing is such a smart guy.

711
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,000
Even if anything happens,

712
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,360
he will protect himself

713
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,950
and make it through.

714
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,030
Let me stay here with you

715
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,920
to pack your luggage together.

716
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,630
OK.

717
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,960
But you have to take it.

718
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,840
I spent so much time to prepare.

719
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,910
Put my clothes in my bag first.
