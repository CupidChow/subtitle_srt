30
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,220
Mr. Shangguan.

31
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:49,920
Can you take the case

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,500
about Yun Ji Hospital?

33
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,190
No, I can’t take that case.

34
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,070
Why?

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,660
Lawyers have their own
strength and weakness,

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,940
and their own majors.

37
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,660
Intentional injury cases
are not my strong suit,

38
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,390
let alone it concerns medical disputes.

39
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,110
I won’t take cases that I’m not sure of.

40
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,470
You’ve cooperated with Yun Ji for years

41
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,740
and won all the medical dispute cases

42
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,590
that you took.

43
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,960
Your capability is proved.

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,340
Please reconsider it.

45
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,340
Cong Rong.

46
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,390
You want me to take it
for the case’s sake

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,950
or for your selfish purpose?

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,830
The online loan case
will be opened soon.

49
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,580
Put your mind to that case.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,460
Don’t let me down.

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,580
What have you done exactly?

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,870
Even an unemotional man like him got mad

53
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,110
and raised his voice so loud.

54
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,620
I just want him to take a case.

55
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,240
Cong Rong.

56
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,330
Come here.

57
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,850
Um.

58
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,010
Come in.

59
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,130
Sorry, Mr. Shangguan.

60
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,080
I was too anxious just now.

61
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,850
I shouldn’t trouble you.

62
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,730
Is Wen Shaoqing your boyfriend?

63
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,330
Um.

64
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,050
Yes.

65
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,570
That’s why

66
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,680
you help him with the lawsuit?

67
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,520
I admit that

68
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,610
I have a selfish purpose,

69
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,130
but that’s not all the reason.

70
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,700
I had an internship in the hospital,

71
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,460
and know doctor-patient relationship
is tense.

72
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,260
It’ll incur disputes
if not handled well.

73
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,640
We can understand
patients and their families,

74
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,200
but doctors shall also
be respected by patients.

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,170
As for this case,

76
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,800
from a fair standpoint,

77
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,290
I don’t think Shaoqing is wrong.

78
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,810
That’s why I’ll help him

79
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,920
and clarify the truth to people.

80
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,800
OK.

81
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,120
Prepare for the trial
of online loan case first.

82
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,290
I’ll take care of this case.

83
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,730
Really?

84
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,090
Thank you, Mr. Shangguan.

85
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,820
For more details,

86
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,970
I need to talk with my client.

87
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,640
Let him come here when he’s free.

88
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,330
OK.

89
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,560
I’ll call him here right now.

90
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,530
By the way,

91
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,370
you must go all out
for the online loan case.

92
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,250
Rest assured.

93
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,290
I’ll be well-prepared.

94
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,610
(Civil Case Indictment)
It’s my first time to get an indictment.

95
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,130
It’s intriguing.

96
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,090
You brat.

97
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,410
You’re in great trouble,

98
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,680
and still have the mood to joke?

99
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,920
Sit.

100
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,970
Here is the situation.

101
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,320
The patient’s family
sued the hospital and you.

102
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,920
It’s fine for the hospital to go through

103
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,560
medical malpractice identification
by the Medical Association

104
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,200
and cope with relevant issues.

105
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,770
Chen Cu has briefed it to me.

106
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,210
There should be no problem, right?

107
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,240
In the meeting,

108
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,120
we had the same judgement,

109
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,680
but it would be a trouble for you.

110
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,730
I know.

111
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,210
The hospital is under great pressure.

112
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,050
I respect the hospital’s decision.

113
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,730
But I’m itching

114
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,170
to come back for work.

115
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,120
I know you wanna be back for surgeries.

116
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,480
The seniors here watched you grow up.

117
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,770
They all care about you,

118
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,210
and don’t hope anything goes wrong
with your career.

119
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,170
How about the hospital hires
a good lawyer for you?

120
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,770
Sir, have you forgotten Cong Rong’s job?

121
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,120
I’ve really forgotten it.

122
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,260
Alright.

123
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,970
Director Yan,

124
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,210
see you around.

125
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:19,800
OK.

126
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,210
Take care these days.

127
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,000
OK.

128
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,260
See you.

129
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,680
OK.

130
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,480
Boss.

131
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:37,920
Here!

132
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,290
What are you doing?

133
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,760
You should be on duty.

134
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,130
Chen Cu is performing a surgery.

135
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,090
He knew you’d come,

136
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,380
and asked me to bring you

137
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,410
the breakfast he prepared.

138
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,560
Anything else?

139
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,260
Boss,

140
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,480
when will you come back?

141
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,480
What?

142
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,410
You wanna be punished to copy books?

143
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,360
Truth to be told,

144
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,240
not being urged to learn,

145
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,000
I’ve been perturbed all day.

146
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,090
Please come back.

147
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,880
Dr. Wen.

148
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,730
Even if you won’t be a doctor,

149
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,090
you can give us lectures.

150
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,210
What nonsense is that?

151
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,890
It’s his fate to be a doctor.

152
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,290
He will still be back as a doctor.

153
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:21,850
Yes.

154
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,050
Yes.

155
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,970
Boss,

156
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,730
we’re waiting for you.

157
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,460
Me too.

158
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,210
We’re all waiting for you.

159
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,090
You brat.

160
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,730
Rest assured.

161
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,970
I promise I will.

162
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,210
But before that,

163
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,090
go back now for your work.

164
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,850
Yes, sir!

165
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,900
Go.

166
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,210
Go back to work.

167
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,460
Go.

168
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,530
Go.

169
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,480
Go. Go.

170
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,610
Bye-bye, boss.

171
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,210
Boss.

172
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:41,820
I’m waiting for you.

173
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,480
Bye-bye.

174
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,180
(Come to the Law Firm this afternoon
to sign the commission contract)

175
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,500
(Daren Law Firm)

176
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,020
Hello.

177
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,090
Do you have an appointment?

178
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:06,770
Yes.

179
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,730
The lawyer, Miss Cong Rong.

180
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,850
Wait a second, please.

181
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,650
Let me have a check.

182
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,610
No need.

183
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,290
He’s Mr. Shangguan’s client.

184
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,560
Mr. Shangguan is waiting
in the reception room.

185
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,210
Can’t you get another guy?

186
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,140
You are in luck to have him, OK?

187
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,050
You’re picky.

188
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,980
I bear a grudge with him,

189
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,290
remember?

190
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,330
This is the golden lawyer of our firm,

191
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,490
Mr. Shangguan Yi.

192
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,500
I’ve heard a lot about you.

193
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,900
The outstanding young doctor
in Yun Ji Hospital,

194
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,530
Wen Shaoqing.

195
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,920
We’ve met several times.

196
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,410
Cong Rong.

197
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,170
Yes?

198
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,130
Although Dr. Wen isn’t a stranger,

199
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,290
you should still serve him water.

200
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,020
Sorry.

201
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,080
I’m gonna get it.

202
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,320
She said you could handle the case well.

203
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,890
I count on you then.

204
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,960
I’m flattered.

205
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,650
Litigation comes with risks.

206
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,680
Before it’s ruled by the court,

207
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,250
no one can surely win it.

208
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,080
I usually say these to patients’ family.

209
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,170
Surgery comes with risks.

210
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,290
The success is not guaranteed.

211
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,840
I’m not used to putting myself
in others’ shoes,

212
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,840
but I can understand you.

213
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,490
To be frank,

214
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,470
I didn’t hope you’d come to me.

215
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,560
Nor do I hope to see you
on my operating table.

216
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,050
From now on,

217
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,970
I’m your attorney.

218
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,720
Tell me what happened in detail.

219
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,720
When

220
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,770
and where.

221
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,020
The cause.

222
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,810
The process.

223
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,560
And the result.

224
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,650
The more details, the better.

225
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,920
Here’s the story.

226
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,840
The patient in Bed 3

227
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,840
had been in bad condition.

228
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,600
We provided him ANH by IV,

229
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,600
but his family didn’t agree anyway.

230
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,920
I’ve mostly learned about it.

231
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,410
Let’s call it a day.

232
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,530
Be seated for a while.

233
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,220
Excuse me.

234
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,010
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

235
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,800
Mr. Shangguan.

236
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
We count on you for our company’s case.

237
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,410
Is it over?

238
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,040
I’ve mostly learned about it.

239
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,410
You may talk with him

240
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,320
about contract details.

241
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,170
Um.

242
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,100
This way, please.

243
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,560
OK.

244
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,200
Why was it so soon?

245
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,720
Because I was eager to see you.

246
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,290
Is it fun to tease me?

247
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,410
Nope.

248
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,800
Sign it.

249
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:23,770
The commission contract.

250
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,020
(Shall pay Party A _ yuan
for the law service)

251
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,890
Why is the fee item blank?

252
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,890
I’ll fill it out after you sign it.

253
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,400
If you offend me,

254
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,600
you’ll pay with everything you own.

255
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,440
I don’t need to read it then.

256
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,650
I can’t tell

257
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,920
if you mean to trick me.

258
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,980
So, stop struggling.

259
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,740
Just fill it out

260
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,770
and sign it.

261
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,100
(Wen)

262
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,530
What?

263
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:55,960
Signed it wrong?

264
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:56,740
It’s fine.

265
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,340
I’ll go get a copy.

266
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,010
No.

267
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,010
I usually use a blue-black pen
for medical cases.

268
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,200
I’m not used to this color suddenly.

269
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,130
I’m going to fetch another one.

270
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,370
No, thanks.

271
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,720
I’ll make do with it.

272
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,490
You don’t have to.

273
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,050
Bite your finger and write with blood.

274
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,380
(Wen Shaoqing)

275
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,410
Make a fingerprint.

276
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,770
Can I not do it?

277
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,900
I wanna keep the first...

278
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
Fingerprint isn’t needed
for wedding now.

279
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,170
It’ll be recorded electronically.

280
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,050
How did you know I’d say this?

281
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,050
Come on.

282
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,820
(Client: Wen Shaoqing)

283
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,960
What’s wrong?

284
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,290
If...

285
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,010
I mean,

286
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,250
if I lose the case

287
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,320
and can’t be a doctor,

288
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,290
will you still be with me?

289
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,720
I’ve studied law for so many years.

290
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,650
Do you know the influence on me?

291
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,410
What influence?

292
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,560
Be indifferent to the world.

293
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,200
But I’m willing to protect
what is right,

294
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,170
and those I care about.

295
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,130
I promise you will still be a doctor.

296
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,290
Thanks for your protection, Miss Cong.

297
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,700
(Wen Rang)

298
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,220
(Darling)

299
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,530
Chengcheng.

300
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,290
What’s the matter?

301
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,200
Wen Rang.

302
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,650
You called me at a wrong time,
understand?

303
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,040
Here we go.

304
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,600
It’s already up.

305
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,600
Almost.

306
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,410
Honey.

307
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,860
Are you really happy

308
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,320
or just being lovesick?

309
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,380
Wasn’t I like this

310
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,490
when you just knew me?

311
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,600
But you haven’t been like this for long.

312
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,090
What was wrong with me?

313
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,530
Was I being haunted?

314
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,090
I was so spoony

315
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,320
and sentimental.

316
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,370
Now this is the right way to live.

317
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,650
Do you not miss Wen Rang anymore?

318
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,340
I don’t miss him at all.

319
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,840
That’s a lie.

320
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,060
I’ve figured it out.

321
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,860
Look.

322
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,960
Wen Shaoqing and you

323
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,440
have your own work to do.

324
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,680
That won’t change.

325
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,260
Love shouldn’t be
the full part of my life either,

326
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,050
right?

327
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,170
Are you really gonna forget him?

328
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,840
I’m trying.

329
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,370
Love should be finely matched.

330
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,600
If I’m always the one pursuing him,

331
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,080
wouldn’t I be a simp?

332
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,970
Good girl.

333
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,410
Come.

334
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,170
Let’s have some goodies.

335
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,860
Let me play it again.

336
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,530
Let’s go. Hurry.

337
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,050
Let me try again.

338
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:43,410
Go. Go. Go.

339
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,530
One more time, please.

340
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,960
Boring.

341
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,490
The building has burned out.

342
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,410
No way to go back.

343
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,170
Is that a pun?

344
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,170
Are there more beers?

345
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,050
Get me another one.

346
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,840
Tell her if you love her.

347
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,890
She already has a boyfriend.

348
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,490
So soon?

349
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,290
How come

350
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,320
I screwed things up suddenly?

351
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,960
Suddenly?

352
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,050
I don’t think it’s sudden at all.

353
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,490
Look at you.

354
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,290
You believe all things are fated,

355
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,220
but you never strive for it.

356
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,170
Piss off.

357
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,410
Don’t you want to hear?

358
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,200
So be it.

359
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,400
Haven’t I taken initiative in love?

360
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,260
I tried to chase Jiang Yao
when she left.

361
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,980
You were madly in love with her.

362
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,210
Shouldn’t you go with her?

363
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,360
You’ve never changed for anyone,

364
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,930
neither for Jiang Yao,

365
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,560
nor for

366
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,840
Zhou Chengcheng.

367
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,080
Am I that mean?

368
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,160
Aren’t you?

369
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,730
You said,

370
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,060
“I shall not change
and go with the flow.”

371
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,770
You just can’t let go of your pride.

372
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,210
You are lofty.

373
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,250
Alright.

374
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,770
I’m making some food.

375
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,780
You are insightful.

376
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,490
Um.

377
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,260
(Exit the mission)

378
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,340
(Are you sure to reset
the Paris Simulation Mode)

379
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,840
I’m leaving.

380
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,730
Won’t you eat?

381
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,530
Nope.

382
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:01,880
Wen Rang!

383
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,810
You said I didn’t take initiative.

384
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,490
Play the game again.

385
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,450
Text me when you get home.

386
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:20,780
Um.

387
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,640
Go home now.

388
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,250
Uncle?

389
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,800
Uncle.

390
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,970
Are you calling me?

391
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,600
Cong Rong and I are peers.

392
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,800
Her boyfriend is your nephew.

393
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,690
So, I should call you Uncle, right?

394
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,640
Yeah.

395
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,250
Is your bicycle broken?

396
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,010
Yes, a thief stole the front wheel.

397
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,140
Get in the car.

398
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,160
I’ll give you a ride.

399
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,290
Thanks.

400
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,930
Am I good-looking?

401
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,880
Not bad.

402
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,490
How... How have you been?

403
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,290
I’m good.

404
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,690
You look good as well.

405
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,770
Right?

406
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,840
Me?

407
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,010
I’m pretty good.

408
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,560
I made up with my dad.

409
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,600
He said I’ve got much more mature.

410
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,930
Do you have a boyfriend now?

411
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,210
Yes.

412
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,730
Be careful this time.

413
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,140
Don’t find a man
like your last boyfriend

414
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,820
who cheated on you

415
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,930
and left you alone crying in the lobby.

416
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,120
He won’t.

417
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,800
He is the son of my father’s friend.

418
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,210
I know him well.

419
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,080
Look at you.

420
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,370
You believe all things are fated,

421
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,010
but you never strive for it.

422
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,290
Zhou Chengcheng.

423
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,970
The light is green.

424
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,880
I nearly missed it.

425
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,410
Zhou Chengcheng,

426
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,210
I didn’t finish my words.

427
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:32,820
By the way,

428
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,530
back then,

429
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,050
I misunderstood Jiang Yao.

430
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,480
Please say sorry to her for me.

431
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,320
Also,

432
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,930
my dad is doing antique business.

433
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,880
He may cooperate with Jiang Yao on it.

434
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,360
Please introduce her to my father.

435
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,640
Pull over.

436
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,970
We... We haven’t arrived.

437
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,400
It’s stuffy in the car.

438
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,600
I’m gonna take a walk alone.

439
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,970
I’ll send her profile to you.

440
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,210
To tell her,
I have to put in words first.

441
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,820
(Burang Barbecue)

442
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,210
Buddy!

443
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,640
Buddy!

444
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,210
What’s the matter?

445
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,290
Can you keep the noise down?

446
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,210
Sorry.

447
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,690
I’m in a hurry to open my store.

448
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,730
Please understand it.

449
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,380
Renovation is not allowed after 7 PM.

450
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,100
Now it’s almost 10 PM.

451
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,250
How can I sleep with the noise?

452
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,250
You must mistake it.

453
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,320
That’s the rule for residential area.

454
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,840
This is the business district.

455
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,880
Go sleep at home if it’s noisy.

456
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,050
Come on!

457
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,640
Keep working!

458
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,930
Why there’s a door here?

459
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,490
I’m gonna mend up the wall with sand.

460
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,250
I’ll let you know.

461
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,160
You can’t!

462
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,250
What do you mean?

463
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,250
You can’t mend up the wall.

464
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,120
Buddy.

465
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,210
My store is next to yours.

466
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,860
It’s not safe.

467
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,540
Install an anti-theft door then.

468
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,250
It’s on me.

469
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,450
Who are you?

470
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:24,970
None of your business.

471
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,490
I said you can’t make a wall here.

472
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,400
Are you making a trouble?

473
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,100
I don’t have to let you know.

474
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,490
I can just build it.

475
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,410
Are you hitting me?

476
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,410
I’ll call the police!

477
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,170
Do it then.

478
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:42,650
I’ve got time.

479
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,170
Do it!

480
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,060
Are you crazy?

481
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,010
Then what?

482
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,080
Wait here.

483
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,800
Wait and see.

484
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,380

(Delete the contact)

486
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,120
Hello?

487
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,640
Who is the guy next to your store?

488
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,640
The bookstore owner is ridiculous.

489
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,210
What happened?

490
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,490
Is he crazy?

491
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,860
Come here and settle it right now.

492
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,450
Or I won’t rent your store.

493
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,080
Are... Are you alright?

494
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,840
You drank again?

495
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,640
Yeah, with my friends in a bar.

496
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,320
Where is he?

497
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,490
He went to hospital for medicine,

498
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,560
and let me talk with you.

499
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,340
You got injured, too.

500
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,650
Why didn’t you go for medicine?

501
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,600
No need.

502
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,620
Get up.

503
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,490
You need some medicine.

504
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,930
You make people worry about you.

505
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,690
My family doesn’t know.

506
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,810
Who will worry about me?

507
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,600
I...

508
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,410
I’m afraid to pay both his medical bills

509
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,600
and yours.

510
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,970
On your feet.

511
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,600
You better break up with your boyfriend.

512
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,210
He’s so unreliable.

513
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,640
It’s rainy and he allowed you
to go out alone at midnight.

514
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,600
You have poor eyes for a boyfriend.

515
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,050
I do have poor eyes.

516
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,560
Never get better.

(A Castle in the Clouds)

518
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,530
Is he good to you?

519
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,640
Yes, he’s kind.

520
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,320
You all said I’m immature.

521
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,880
I’m trying to get mature,

522
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,010
not to bother others
when I can handle it.

523
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,690
It’s late.

524
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,010
I didn’t ask him to send me,

525
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,010
because I wanted him

526
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,930
to have some more sleep.

527
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,290
Dress it up by yourself,

528
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,250
or go to the clinic nearby.

529
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,930
Let him do it

530
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,730
if he wants to mend up the wall.

531
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,690
Really?

532
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,560
Does the door mean nothing to you?

533
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,050
You used to keep me out by a chain.

534
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,050
Isn’t it good to mend it up?

535
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,380
OK.

536
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,490
Mend it up then.

537
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,930
I’ll talk to him about his renovation

538
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:05,530
in the middle of night.

539
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,160
I’m leaving.

540
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,770
We meet again.

541
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
We are Wen Shaoqing’s attorneys.

542
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,450
This is the lawyer, Mr. Shangguan.

543
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,340
I’m Cong Rong.

544
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,120
Ms. Cong.

545
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,330
We ask you out

546
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,400
just to talk about the case frankly.

547
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,930
We demand a compensation
of 600 thousand.

548
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,850
600 thousand?

549
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,170
You think it’s too much?

550
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,490
My family is still in ICU.

551
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,960
We also need money.

552
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,690
Wait.

553
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,860
These are two things.

554
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,010
Don’t confuse them.

555
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,930
Many witnesses could prove that

556
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,320
you stirred up the fight.

557
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,320
Your claim is unreasonable.

558
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,210
Mr. Shangguan.

559
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,440
You need evidence to prove it.

560
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,970
The doctors on the scene

561
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,560
all sided with him.

562
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,490
I think they colluded to slander us.

563
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,560
As you see,

564
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,050
we have support from netizens.

565
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,530
He is a doctor.

566
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,080
Whatever the reason is,

567
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,580
doctors shouldn’t fight back.

568
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,250
You did hit him.

569
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,360
Any intentional assault is illegal,

570
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,490
regardless of status and occupation.

571
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,530
To affect justice with public opinion

572
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,730
is impossible.

573
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,360
You...

574
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,650
We can

575
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,080
drop the charge.

576
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,650
And we can talk about the compensation.

577
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,720
It’s nothing about the compensation.

578
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,240
The truth is what we want.

579
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,770
Dr. Wen did nothing wrong...!

580
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,320
I’ve learned about your demand.

581
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,320
We’ll respond to the complaint.

582
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,780
I’m sure your unreasonable demands

583
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,050
won’t be backed up by the court.

584
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,450
If nothing else,

585
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,360
I’ll take my leave.

586
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,530
I’m leaving

587
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,640
to meet another client.

588
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,010
They are really hard to deal with.

589
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,000
We may talk at the firm later.

590
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,410
OK.

591
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,640
I’ll wait for you at the firm.

592
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,640
Ms. Cong.

593
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,050
Anything else?

594
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,160
Why don’t you reconsider it?

595
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,970
You know that doctor.

596
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,140
You may convince him.

597
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,560
He doesn’t want to lose his job

598
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,530
for some money, does he?

599
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,640
Cong Rong!

600
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,400
Are you alright?

601
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,770
I’m fine.

602
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,170
My hand got hurt.

603
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:56,540
What happened?

604
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:56,900
Are you alright?

605
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,640
Let me see.

606
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,120
We need to go to the Orthopedics.

607
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,600
A fracture, I guess.

608
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,840
Let’s go.

609
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,020
(Qin Chu)

610
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,610
Hello, Qin Chu.

611
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,360
What’s up?

612
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,730
Cong Rong’s hand fractured.

613
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,050
She looks pale.

614
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,300
We’re now in the Orthopedics.

615
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,490
Come here now.

616
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,780
(Shenzhen Yun Ji Hospital)

617
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,250
Have a cast

618
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,530
and you’ll recover soon.

619
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:44,930
Boss is here.

620
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,010
What happened?

621
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,050
Show me your hand.

622
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,080
What brings you here?

623
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,440
It’s fine.

624
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,360
I fell when going downstairs

625
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,160
and hit the ground with my hand.

626
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,060
You’re no kid,

627
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,050
but still so worrisome.

628
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,600
For fear that you’d be worried,

629
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,120
she didn’t tell you
she met the patient’s family.

630
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,050
This is the CT.

631
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:12,820
I have things to do.

632
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,640
I’m leaving.

633
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,530
Thanks.

634
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,560
Distal radius fracture.

635
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,370
It’s not very serious,

636
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,010
but you still need a cast.

637
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,600
OK.

638
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,560
I know this, too.

639
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,200
Zhong Zhen.

640
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:32,820
Yes?

641
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,680
What are you waiting for?

642
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,490
Go to the doctor for a cast list.

643
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,850
Be careful. Be careful. Be careful.

644
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,680
Blow it.

645
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,970
Don’t move.

646
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,560
Sit here.

647
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,810
Take a seat.

648
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,600
I’m gonna see how many people are ahead.

649
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,200
Don’t touch it.

650
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,530
Rong.

651
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,170
You two lovebirds are so pathetic.

652
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,050
One is suspended.

653
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,970
The other has a fracture.

654
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,380
Are you two being cursed?

655
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,010
I...

656
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,370
Boss.

657
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,260
Cong Rong says it hurts badly.

658
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,120
Come and have a look.

659
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,010
Take it.

660
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,370
How do you feel?

661
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,410
I’m fine.

662
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,240
He is lying.

663
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,010
Rong.

664
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,570
How come

665
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,200
you suddenly fell and had a fracture?

666
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,930
My boss is suspended.

667
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,810
So, you got upset

668
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,040
and fell down in a trance?

669
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,930
Shut up.

670
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:31,760
Come with me.

671
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,640
Not to line up?

672
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,490
Slowly.

673
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,560
Take a seat here.

674
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:54,930
Too many people are ahead.

675
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,640
We won’t wait.

676
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,680
I’ll do it myself.

677
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,370
You?

678
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,890
You are not an orthopedic surgeon.

679
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,080
I’ve learned it.

680
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,970
You said a Jack of all trades
is a master of none.

681
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,810
It’s just a cast.

682
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,920
I... I’d rather wait.

683
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,200
Don’t you trust me?

684
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:50,720
Boss.

685
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,120
Haven’t you finished?

686
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,010
Zip it.

687
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,180
Dr. Wen is applying a cast!

688
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,410
Come and see!

689
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,370
I come here twice,

690
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,890
and get watched twice.

691
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,600
Last time to pull a tooth.

692
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,560
Now to apply a cast.

693
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,810
I’ll never come again.

694
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:15,850
Boss.

695
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,600
You applied it well,

696
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,890
but I still have to blame you.

697
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,680
Since my cousin was with you,

698
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,640
she’s got hurt many times.

699
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,280
I feel bad for it. OK?

700
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,660
If I have a girlfriend,

701
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,160
I’ll wrap her in cotton

702
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,050
and take her with me in my pocket.

703
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,330
Do you mean a Barbie doll?

704
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,930
It’s a metaphor.

705
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,720
I’ll take good care of her, anyway.

706
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,810
She won’t get any harm.

707
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:43,200
Am I right?

708
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,160
Shut up and no one sees you as a dumb.

709
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,970
Go out, guys.

710
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,160
Right.

711
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,370
This is my family affair.

712
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,860
You guys go out.

713
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,570
Outsiders shouldn’t be here.

714
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,530
And you.

715
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,530
Go out.

716
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,640
Is the height OK?

717
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,680
It’s fine.

718
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,560
That was about my work.

719
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,760
It has nothing to do with you.

720
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,160
Don’t blame yourself.

721
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,050
He is right.

722
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,680
I didn’t protect you well.

723
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,160
We’ll quit the lawsuit.

724
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,890
No.

725
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,370
You have to pay me for the service.

726
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,850
Cong Rong.

727
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:01,810
Thanks.

728
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,640
