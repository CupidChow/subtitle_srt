You don't even remember your own face.

3
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,600
Me.

4
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,190
You.

5
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,440
Xiaoxue.

6
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,560
There are two of me.

7
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,320
(Anyone can live this kind of life.)

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,220

(One year ago)

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,060
(Xia Qingyang)

22
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,750
Come take a look.

23
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,080
Scottish Highlands silver-plated roses.

24
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,960
Isn't it beautiful?

25
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,710
It is beautiful, but...

26
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,000
How much does it cost?

27
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,520
What do you know?

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,310
Those who can buy this for others

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,470
don't care about the money.

30
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,840
What matters is the sentiment.

31
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,560
This kind of sentiment

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,910
could feed me for months.

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,030
Superficial, so superficial.

34
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,430
Can profoundness feed you?

35
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,560
This one, extra charges.

36
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,470
That's more like it. Thanks.

37
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,590
Let me tell you,

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,590
the flower sender asked a lot.

39
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,630
Be careful with it.

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,870
Really?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
Look.

42
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,750
He asked a girl to deliver it,

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,960
with conditions attached.

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
What conditions?

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,220
What?

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,080
Can't be prettier than his girlfriend, huh?

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,030
Look, aged 22 to 24,

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
female,

49
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,080
local,

50
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,990
and she can't be

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,000
too ugly.

52
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,890
So picky.

53
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,080
But I'm actually a good fit.

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,030
Slow down, be careful.

55
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,960
Don't get cocky.

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,710
You're the only female courier around.

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,870
Ugly or not, it's you.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
This is so heavy.

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,190
Hope his girlfriend can carry it later.

60
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,590
Hey, slow down a bit.

61
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,800
It's really hard to
ride a motorcycle with it.

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,560
I'll just walk there.

63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,520
Take a look yourself.

64
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,470
Hello, here are your flowers.

65
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,190
Hee.

66
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,270
Hee.

67
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,150
Yuxian.

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,870
Look, the flowers
in the garden are blooming.

69
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,160
Hee.

70
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,920
I want to go out for a meal now.

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,630
Right now?

72
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,140
(1 PM, piano practice)

73
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,720
But you have piano practice this afternoon.

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
What piano practice?

75
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,800
I forgot all about it. How can I practice?

76
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,190
Mr. Xia asked you to
start from the basics.

77
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,310
You'll remember eventually.

78
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,800
Can you play the piano?

79
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,750
No, I can't.

80
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,310
You can't?

81
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,590
I can't either.

82
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
How are we supposed to practice?

83
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,920
Index finger.

84
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,360
No, that's the ring finger.

85
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,440
This...

86
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,270
This is way too hard.

87
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,040
How about just using one finger to play?

88
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,720
No wonder Mr. Xia said
results didn't matter.

89
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,040
As long as you practice.

90
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,680
If he expects results,

91
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,360
why doesn't he try it himself?

92
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,430
What kind of result does he want?

93
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,240
How can we achieve it?

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,510
For example, eating.

95
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,830
Mr. Xia wants you to eat a bowl of rice,

96
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,480
and half of the meat dish,

97
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,310
then drink a bowl of bird's nest porridge.

98
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,950
What if we can't achieve it?

99
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,600
Just report it honestly.

100
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,320
Report it?

101
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,630
Don't worry,
Mr. Xia won't get mad at me.

102
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,560
(Afternoon tea)
Time for the tea.

103
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,480
I'll go down and bring it up.

104
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,470
No need.

105
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,800
Let's go upstairs to eat.

106
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,240
Don't make a mess here.

107
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,480
