13

Qingyang, sit down.

14
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,600
Did you need something?

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,280
Yuxian had a miscarriage, right?

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
Yes, it's been hard on me too.

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,280
Her health hasn't been great.

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,150
I think we should wait
before trying again.

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,790
I called you here today

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,880
to talk about this.

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
Yuxian went for a checkup.

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,590
She...

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,870
Her uterus is underdeveloped.

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,280
Even if she conceives,
she can't keep the baby.

25
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,350
So...

26
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,430
I discussed it with her mother.

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,510
You should get a sterilization surgery.

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,480
Dad, I...

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,320
Wait.

30
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,870
When the time comes...

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,950
You could just adopt another child.

32
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,350
Wouldn't that work?

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,070
Her mom and I

34
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,070
don't want to see her suffer anymore.

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,920
I'm sure you feel the same.

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,400
Just have a minor procedure.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,640
It won't affect your married life.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,840
Then you and Yuxian can live peacefully.

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,590
She's our only daughter.

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,280
The family property in the future...

41
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,950
Just sign it.

42
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,420
(Party A, Party B)

43
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,060
(Party B, Xia Qing…)

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,520
For the sake of their daughter,
they forced me

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,360
(Party B, Xia Qingyang)
to undergo sterilization.

46
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,120
You don't believe it, do you?

47
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,190
Such a kind-looking person.

48
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,470
A benevolent and charitable man.

49
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,000
How could he do such a thing?

50
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,400
I can't believe it either.

51
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,100
Whenever I get the chance, I go out of town,

52
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,720
or even abroad.

53
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,030
But all the doctors told me

54
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,850
I can no longer have children.

55
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,910
- They won't...
- Tell me.

56
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,310
They can only offer their lives

57
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,590
as compensation for me.

58
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,800

61
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,680
I can hear you clearly.

Still think you're in control?

66
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,030
Tell me.

67

I should go.
