Xiaoxue's birthday is...

Could it be my birthday?

Hello, this is Zhou Xiaoxue.

21
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,840
Hello, this is Song Yuxian.

22
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,270
Don't be nervous.

23
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,120
They know you just recovered.

24
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,310
Just stay close to me.

25
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,310
Would you like a drink to relax?

26
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,010
Here you go.

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
Thank you.

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,470
Miss Song, long time no see.

29
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,590
Miss Song, this is for you.

30
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,610
- Let's go.
- Enjoy yourselves.

31
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,360
Let's get drunk.

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,150
- Alright, alright.
- Come on, come on.

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,710
I'll go say hello.

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,000
Come on, come on.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,910
Long time no see.

36
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,920
Long time no see.

37
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,430
What are you chatting about?

38
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,360
Why are you so scared?

39
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,560
You weren't like this before.

40
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,030
Uh, I don't remember anything.

41
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,520
Seeing so many people
makes me a bit nervous.

42
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,190
Then I'll stay with you.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,430
I swear I will take good care of you.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,560
In good times and bad,

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,720
in sickness and in poverty,

46
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,160
I will always take care of you,

47
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,310
protect you,

48
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,080
and cherish you.

49
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,230
Mind your step.

50
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,680
Take it slow.

51
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,920
If the shoes make you uncomfortable,

52
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,480
go try others in the cloakroom.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,190
Don't just go for looks.

54
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,710
Okay?

55
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,640
Hey.

56
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,040
Hey, Lu Yuan.

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,190
Why running? Why so cowardly?

58
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,240
I'm not cowardly.

59
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,340
Too cowardly to even answer my call.

60
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,190
You asked for my help and I helped,

61
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,720
for my cooperation and I cooperated,

62
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,190
to take care of her, and I did.

63
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,630
What else are you unhappy about?

64
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,310
Did you forget who you are?

65
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,390
You're my boyfriend.

66
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,510
I thought you forgot.

67
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,480
Well, I thought you forgot too.

68
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,820
You two look so similar.

69
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,270
Let's head back then.

70
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,190
She still needs us.

71
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,240
Let's go.

72
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,680
How's the wedding at your home going?

73
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,120
It's all settled.

74
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,290
My brother's getting married next month.

75
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,240
Sir, about this money...

76
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,630
Don't worry about the money.

77
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,360
Later on...

78
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,870
(file folder)

79
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,920
Give this to Yuxian.

80
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,390
(file folder)
But you worked so hard on this.

81
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,680
Why not give it to her yourself?

82
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,180
You wouldn't understand.

83
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,190
Sometimes,

84
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,390
the truth can be hurtful.

85
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,190
Those close to us can cause deep pain.

86
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,920
Those who are less close
actually hurt us less.

87
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,510
You treat your wife so well.
