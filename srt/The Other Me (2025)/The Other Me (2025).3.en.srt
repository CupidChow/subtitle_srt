00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,870
Yuxian, these are the latest designs.

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,230
Mr. Xia wants to see if you like them.

17
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,040
They're all... all quite nice.

18
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,040
Let me help you try them on.

19
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,800
Is this still me?

20
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,750
I'll take that as a compliment.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,680
This is the ring you usually wear.

22
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,470
On your ring finger.

23
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,680
Your phone was broken.

24
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
Mr. Xia got you a new one.

25
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,520
Red, huh?

26
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,310
Mr. Xia said red suits you.

27
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,400
He asked you to put on this to go out.

28
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,560
Does he even control what I wear?

29
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,750
Yuxian...

30
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,120
Sorry.

31
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,360
I've been feeling down lately.

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,870
No, it's good that you're like this.

34
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,400
If you're upset, just say it.

35
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,800
You used to bottle it up.

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,080
I'm afraid it would hurt you.

37
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,030
How could it be worse
than a vegetative state?

38
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,840
Yuxian.

39
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,900
(To therapy; Calendar)

40
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,400
We should head out now.

41
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,400
Oh no, I forgot the follow-up form.

42
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
Yuxian, wait for me.

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,280
I'll be right back.

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
Oh, okay.

45
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,070
Have you really forgotten everything?

46
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,800
I can't remember anything.

47
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,240
You once told me

48
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,750
to help you investigate your parents' death.

49
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,390
Parents? Didn't they die in an accident?

50
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,040
You just said you wanted
to know the details,

51
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,870
and didn't tell us anything else.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,190
Have you found anything yet?

53
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,950
Before we started investigating,

54
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
you had an accident.

55
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,720
Sorry, sorry.

56
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,240
Let's go.

(Renai Clinic of Song's International Group)

58
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,150
Miss Song.

59
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
Good morning.

60
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,920
It's a lovely day today.

61
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,320
Hello.

62
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,920
Actually,

63
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,120
I don't know how to restore your memory.

64
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,390
But what I can do

65
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,070
is to tell you about your past.

66
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,160
My past?

67
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,630
You probably don't remember

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
that I was your therapist before.

69
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,750
Not really.

70
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,800
It was around the end of last year.

71
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,680
It's your first time here.

72
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,680
The Song family owns half of this hospital.

73
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,600
You, the heiress, came for counseling.

74
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,560
Our director was so excited.

75
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,240
He almost made me prepare formally.

76
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,560
Why did I come to you?

77
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,630
You're confused.

78
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,240
So much confusion.

79
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,120
What kind of confusion?

80
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,600
Do you know who you were before?

81
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
I know.

82
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,000
There's a wall at home,

83
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,870
lined with my trophies and certificates.

84
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,910
Yes.

85
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,160
You're outstanding.

86
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,200

your family has put
endless effort into you.

88
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,120
But...

89
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,070
