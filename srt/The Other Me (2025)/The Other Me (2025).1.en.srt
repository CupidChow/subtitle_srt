00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,620
(The beauty of living things)

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,020

5
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,560
(While delivering food,)

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,030
(I met another version of myself.)

7
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,640
(But soon after,)

8
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,530
(strange things began to happen.)

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,230
Yuxian told me
she felt something bad was coming.

10
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,870
Now it's really happened.

11
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,350
It can't be a coincidence.

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,840
Come back early, okay?

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,590
It's just a month or two.

14
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,430
What's wrong? Something urgent?

15
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,200
It's not that urgent.

16
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,230
I just feel like
something might happen to me.

17
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,620
This matter

18
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,280
must be related to Xia Qingyang.

19
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,000
He's definitely involved.

20
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,460
Let's get her out of there.

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,430
If it's related to Xia Qingyang,

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,400
Yuxian will be in greater danger.

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,990
Mmm.

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,790
First, the hair.

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,920
Her hair is this long now.

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,400
It's brown.

27
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,840
Then, the scar.

28
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,680
She has a scar

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,510
on her forehead from a fall.

30
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,350
It's still very noticeable.

31
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,400
Next is the muscles.

32
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,320
Muscles?

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,710
My muscles are great.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,280
That's the problem.

35
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,030
At the muscle's highest point.

36
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,030
At the muscle's highest point.

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,960
How are you doing?

38
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,280
I did all three things you asked.

39
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,270
What else?

40
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,360
How to get in.

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,150
Do you have any opportunity

42
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,120
to bring in larger items?

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,400
Get in the suitcase,
and I can bring you in.

44
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,280
Won't such a big suitcase be suspicious?

45
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,030
Don't worry, I'm Miss Song's caregiver.

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,120
No one will give me trouble.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,230
Once we enter,

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,460
there's a storeroom.

49
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,360
I'll switch to a medical cart there.

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,630
Hide inside to avoid
the surveillance system.

51
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,550
After the facial recognition is done,

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,480
you'll smoothly enter the room.

53
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,230
Remember, you're here
to investigate Yuxian's injury.

54
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,190
Don't get too into the role.

55
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,140
(MAIN CAM Channel 1)

56
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,430
Are you ready?

57
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,800
Song Yuxian,

58
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,270
this is what I owe you.

59
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,590
Come on.

60
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,200
Don't be nervous.

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,000
Try to swallow.

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,320
Is that okay?

63
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,430
It has to be.

64
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,830
After this shot,

65
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,160
I don't know when you'll wake up.

66
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,950
I'm not a doctor, after all.

67
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,510
- What if...
- Enough.

68
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,270
Cut the crap.

69
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,700
I'm ready.

70
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,240
One.

71
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,310
Two.

72
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,240
Three.

73
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,360
New memories will replace the old.

74
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
Her memory of Song Yuxian's body

75
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,360
will be replaced by yours.

76
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,160
With her around,

77
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,510
it's easy for you to slip by.

78
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,630
Who is Song Yuxian?

79
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,560

please take good care of her.

Don't worry.

Xia Qingyang's flight is in four days.
