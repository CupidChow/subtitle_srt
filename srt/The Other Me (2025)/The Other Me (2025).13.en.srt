1
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:14,560
Come here.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,840
Yes, Mr. Xia.

3
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,800
Who is she?

4
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,510
That's Chen Hee's mom.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,830
She says she can't find Chen Hee.

6
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,230
Tell her to go elsewhere.

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,920
She's in my way.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,280
Hey, hey, you, you.

9
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,790
Go look for her somewhere else.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,200
Chen Hee hasn't been here lately.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,480
That can't be.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,200
She came to the villa for work.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,030
I told you she didn't come.

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,100
(I think I knew from the start.)
Would I lie to you?

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,190
(I think I know)
Go on, leave. Or I'll call security.

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,390
(we'd never succeed.)
Just go.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,030
(John Steinbeck)
Chen Hee. Hee.

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,870
Please leave.

How much longer will you torment me?

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,410
I always dream about
Yuxian and Xiaoxue seeking revenge.

32
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,920
Every time I close my eyes,

33
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,230
all I see is...

34
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,480
What is it?

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,230
Wasn't it you who made them meet?

36
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,590
If you hadn't gone crazy at the villa,

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,870
Chen Hee wouldn't have died.

38
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,280
And about the chandelier falling...

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,800
I haven't settled that with you yet.

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,430
What about me? What else could I do?

41
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,470
I've arranged everything.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,030
Just follow my lead.

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,560
Everything will go smoothly.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,560
I'll do as you say.

45
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,150
I'll listen well.

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,680
I'll listen well.

47
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,960
The real one is back.

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,360
We need a better approach for her.

49
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,470
It requires a small sacrifice from you.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
I'll follow your lead.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,710
I'll be obedient.

52
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,310
Long time no see.

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,590
About to cry? How embarrassing.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,640
Well...

55
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,920
Here's your phone back.

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,590
I saw a ring at Tian Miao's place.

57
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,870
It's exactly like yours.

58
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,960
Really?

59
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,600
You...

60
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,800
Still can't reach Chen Hee?

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
I can't.

62
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,600
Her mom came looking for her too.

63
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
Next time you see her mom,

64
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
tell her to call the police.

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,560
I'm sure Chen Hee was killed.

66
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,830
And about your parents' death,

67
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,070
Wang Ya is looking into it.

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,070
It was an accident.

69
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,680
There's nothing to investigate.

70
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,160
My parents were in Hai County.

71
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,800
They died in a rip current.

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,120
Hai County? When?

73
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,360
Last year, August 17th.

74
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,510
August 17th...

75
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,240
Promise me one thing.

76
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,160
- What?
- Trust me.

77
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,040
I've always trusted you.

78
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,950
No matter what you hear or see,

79
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,160
you have to trust me.

80
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
I trust you.

81
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
Let's go home.

82
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,530
What's wrong? Is something up?

83
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,240
Miss Song, here's what you asked me
to look into.

84
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,480
Do you remember

85
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,430
when I asked you to look into it?

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,160
Yes, before you got sick.

87
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,950
You and Mr. Song attended an event.

88
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,120
Alright, alright.

89
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Just sit down for a bit.

90
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,750
You're making me dizzy.

91
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,720
I need to tell you something.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
Just spit it out already.

93
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,310
About a year ago,

94
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,360
Song Yuxian's parents passed away.

95
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,560
I already know that.

96
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
Their deaths might be my fault.

97
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,270
Dad.

98
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,510
