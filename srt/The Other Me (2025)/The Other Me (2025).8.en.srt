00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,040
I swear I'll take good care of you.

2
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,200
So today, I'll say it again.

3
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,790
In good times and bad,

4
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,950
in sickness and poverty,

5
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,400
I'll always care for you,

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,560
protect you,

7
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,320
and cherish you.

8
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,940
(They paused only because of
some sort of lapse)

Can you let go of me?

22
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,590
No.

23
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,910
I have a girlfriend.

24
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,750
Water.

25
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
Are you seasick?

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,520
No, water.

27
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,870
Still not feeling well?

28
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,550
Eh?

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,310
What's wrong with you?

30
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,430
Is this better?

31
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,920
Mmm.

32
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,240
What brings you here?

33
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,590
Hand.

34
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,190
What's this for?

35
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,240
What does this mean?

36
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,360
Sell these things.

37
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,710
They should be worth something.

38
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,680
Then buy a car.

39
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,300
You stole these from the Song Family.

40
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,560
What if you get caught?

41
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,590
Who stole it?

42
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,360
I took it from her closet.

43
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,280
Then what do you call it?

44
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,310
It's not stealing, okay?

45
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,000
After selling these things,

46
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,950
go buy her some new clothes.

47
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,720
My clothes are all old.

48
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,630
She loves looking good.

49
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,680
Don't let her wear them.

50
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,750
Fine. Money's tight these days.

51
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,240
She really doesn't remember anything.

52
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,160
She only recalls fragments

53
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,350
when she is emotional.

54
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,310
- Xiaoxue.
- Yes?

55
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,870
Have you thought about

56
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,430
how it will end?

57
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,630
The driver is still waiting.

58
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,240
I have to go now.

59
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,670
Ah!

60
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,180
- What's wrong?
- A cockroach.

61
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
What's up?

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,600
Sir, give me a price for these.

63
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,680
Alright, let me take a look.

64
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,870
This one's fake, right?

65
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,070
What?

66
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,600
All my stuff is genuine.

67
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,560
Stop talking nonsense.

68
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,270
Oh dear.

69
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,600
Don't touch it.

70
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,070
This bag never came in this style.

71
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,110
My lady.

72
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,720
How about going for a walk?

73
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,000
Umm.

74
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,290
Please.

75
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,930
(Open)

76
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,190
She's talking nonsense.

77
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,630
Please keep watching.

78
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,160
Hey, Hee.

79
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,920
How's Yuxian been lately?

80
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,240
You mean her memory?

81
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,180
She hasn't fully recovered.

82
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,140
She is still recovering from illness.

83
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,120
Keep an eye out for her.

84
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,830
If anything seems off,

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
let me know immediately.

86
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,520
Nothing so far.

87
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,480
Alright, get back to work.

88
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,510
At this time,

89
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,310
shouldn't he be in a meeting?

90
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,590
Let's go.

91
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,310
That bag was definitely fake.

92
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,120
How do you know?

93
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,310
I bought one, so I know.

94
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,190
You bought one?

95
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,240
I did.

96
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,680
Do you remember?

97
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,200
No.

98
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,560
It's just...

99
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,630
Can you even ride a bike?

100
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,160
I remember... I remember...

101
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,600
Stop thinking about it.

102
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,560
Didn't I promise to buy you a phone?

103
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,590
