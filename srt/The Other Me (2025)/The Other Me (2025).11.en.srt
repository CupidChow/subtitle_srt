Mmm.

5
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,870
I remember everything now.

6
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,550
Xiaoxue wants to know

7
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,960
what exactly happened to you.

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,870
To infiltrate the Song Family,

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,870
she slashed a scar on her face.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,670
What happened after I passed out?

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,550
Please tell me

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,920
everything I missed

13
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,590
and everything Xiaoxue did for me.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,710

I can't find Hee.

Could something have happened to her?

29
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,270
The secretary has everyone's records.

30

I'll have him check and let you know.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,760
She's always been meticulous.

32
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,520
She wouldn't disappear without reason.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,520
Remember to go to therapy.

34
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,740
I'll have the driver take me.

Miss Song, let me escort you.

37
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,870
Thank you.

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,080
Hello?

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,710
Dr. Tian, you had an appointment
with Miss Song.

40
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,680
She's already here.

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Sorry about that.

42
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,960
I got held up with something.

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,910
Please ask her to wait at the clinic.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,320
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,440
Dr. Tian can't come right now.

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,760
Please wait a moment.

47
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,560
Is Dr. Tian very busy lately?

48
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,790
Yes, her patient's case is special,

49
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,230
so she has to stay for now.

50
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,230
Let me get you some snacks first.

51
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,560
Okay, thanks.

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,040
Lu Yuan.

53
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,990
Where are you going to find Xiaoxue?

54
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,710
She won't be carrying the phone

55
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,960
she uses to contact me.

56
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,320
She's afraid
that Xia Qingyang might find out.

57
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,830
We've always been very careful.

58
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Then I'll look for her near the villa.

59
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,640
I can't wait to see her.

60
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,560
Thanks for everything during this time.

61
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,590
You two are really something,

62
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,560
willing to go all out for each other.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,840
Of course.

64
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,560
Xiaoxue, I want to see you.
Where are you?

65
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,550
Yuxian.

66
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,150
What are you doing here?

67
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,460
(Oh no.)

68
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,700
(Why is he back?)

69
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,320
Didn't you go to the hospital?

70
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,590
Why are you back?

71
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
Where's the driver?

72
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,350
Uh, I have a headache.

73
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,590
So I came back early.

74
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,790
I'll go rest first.

75
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,790
What's the hurry?

76
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,560
I'll take you back.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,120
(Just in time, the real one's back.)

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,670
