00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,920
Hmm.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,600
I'm listening.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,280
Who told you to act on your own?

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,550
Enough.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,270
If anything happens to her,

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,640
you'll be doomed.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,370

Yuxian, don't be afraid.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,420
I'm fine.

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,270
I just want to know

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,500
why the light fell down.

24
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,670
Is everything else okay?

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,780
Some parts must have loosened.

26
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,550
I've contacted the renovation company.

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,500
They'll come and check for you.

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,390
Alright, you guys can go now.

29
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,390
Wasn't the piano upstairs before?

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Do you remember?

31
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,420
Hee.

32
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,420
Take Yuxian upstairs to rest.

33
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,990
It's too dangerous here.

34
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,860
Let's leave first.

35
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,110
The piano was...

36
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,020
Right in this spot.

37
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,020
You loved playing in the sunlight.

38
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,510
Don't move, don't move.

39
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,110
It's not finished yet. Sit down first.

40
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,270
You said you'd finish after this piece.

41
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,700
It'll be done soon.

42
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,540
Good girl.

43
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,420
Done. Come and see.

44
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,910
Wow.

45
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,420
You made me look so beautiful.

46
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,020
Of course.

47
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,300
I drew it based on myself.

48
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,790
So it's naturally beautiful.

49
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,950
Zhou Xiaoxue.

50
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,420
Why do we look so alike?

51
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,230
This is unbelievable.

52
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,020
You couldn't be my sister, right?

53
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,500
I've had a tough life since childhood.

54
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,820
How could that be possible?

55
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,030
If you were my sister,

56
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,990
I could ask my dad

57
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,590
to send us abroad to study.

58
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,300
You can pay me back later.

59
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,180
Do you want to deliver food forever?

60
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,740
Delivering food isn't my only option.

61
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,550
School isn't my only option either.

62
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,150
Why?

63
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,380
Why so many questions?

64
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,000
Once I pay off my debts,

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,530
I'll have plenty of time for myself.

66
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,180
You could choose an easier way.

67
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,940
That's not my way.

68
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,230
Then what's your way?

69
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,380
Tell me.

70
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,910
I just want to

71
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,110
help you

72
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
while I could.

73
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,870
Okay?

74
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,030
What's wrong? Did I scare you?

75
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,110
You don't look well.

76
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,110
Sorry about that.

77
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,550
I haven't recovered myself

78
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,060
from what happened last night.

79
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
I still feel dizzy.

80
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,510
Hee.

81
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,030
Get Yuxian a glass of water.

82
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,620
Do you have any calming tea?

83
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,030
Yes, I'll get it.

84
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,110
Rest for a while.

85
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,380
I'll make a call.

86
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,460
(Lu Yuan: I took Yuxian to work,
but she's afraid of water.)

87
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,420
Forget about working.

88
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,350
I'll figure out the money.

89
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,180
Yuxian.

90
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,910
Here are the flowers.

91
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,060
The gardener just picked them fresh.

92
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,380
They're beautiful. Just give me them.

93
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,790
But, shouldn't I go?

94
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,790
You don't have to go with me.

95
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,940
I'm a grown-up now.

96
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,150
You think I'll get lost?

97
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,170
But...

98
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,420
No buts.

99
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,620
The driver can accompany me.

100
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,700
Hurry up and go.

101
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,700
Let's go.

102
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,500
Did you make progress on that matter?

103
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,110
You might not remember

104
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,740
the details of the accident.

105
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,790
Let me brief you on it.

106
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,660
