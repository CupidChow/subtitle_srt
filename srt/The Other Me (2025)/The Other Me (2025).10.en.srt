1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,710
Why are you back?

2
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,710
Where are you going?

3
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,320
- I, I...
- Where's the driver?

4
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,870
I just wanted to take a walk.

5
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,120
You're getting confused.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,670
This is a villa area.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,150
It'll take you a long time to go out.

8
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,520
Where to? Let the driver take you.

9
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,310
I, I...

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,090
Your pants seem dirty.

11
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,470
Oh, I accidentally got something on it.

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,880
I'll go get changed.

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,240

Who is it?

27
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,120
It's you.

28
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,560
It's me.

29
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,910
I heard we're friends.

30
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,590
I have a long story to tell you.

31
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,430
Some parts may sound a bit odd.

32
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,840
But I assure you, it's all true.

33
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,960
Is it a tragedy or a comedy?

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,120
This story isn't over yet,

35
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,080
so I don't know the ending.

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Can't we just wait

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
until the story is over?

38
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,990
No.

39
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,000
Because this story

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,710
needs both of us to end it.

41
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,910
The story begins
with a bouquet of flowers.

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,710
Though our families were worlds apart,

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,400
when we were together,

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,400
you were Song Yuxian, the pianist,

45
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,750
and I was Zhou Xiaoxue, the painter.

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,000
That was all.

47
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,800
We became the closest friends.

48
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,590
We spent time together for a while.

49
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,310
I thought

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,120
your worst pain in life

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,310
came from your husband.

52
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,240
He's a bit of a chauvinist.

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,400
You even need his approval to get tattoos.

54
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,560
But now I realize

55
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,710
that in your life,

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,310
a bigger crisis awaits you.

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,910
Try to come back early.

58
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,750
It's just a month or two.

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,910
What's wrong? Something urgent?

60
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,310
No, nothing urgent.

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,400
I just feel like
something bad might happen.

62
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,520
Wait, what's going on?

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,520
Remember what I told you?

64
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,120
Xia Qingyang

65
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,120
is the most suitable man for me

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,590
chosen by my parents.

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,030
His family isn't wealthy,

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,310
but he's hardworking and reliable.

69
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,750
My parents observed him for a long time

70
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,560
before arranging our meeting.

71
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,560
When my parents passed away,

72
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,750
Xia Qingyang helped a lot.

73
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,560
Without him,

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,510
I might have lost most of the property.

75
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,720
So you're saying,

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,120
Xia Qingyang is your family's hero.

77
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,040
But all these assets are in his hands,

78
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,000
and he's still expanding his control.

79
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,040
Is he trying to take over your assets?

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
He's not bold enough to act openly yet.

81
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,950
That's complicated.

82
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,190
I don't quite understand.

83
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,600
But I've read palace intrigue novels.

84
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,360
According to the plot,

85
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,920
he should find you a nuisance now.

86
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,920
He doesn't belong to our family.

87
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,160
Many still don't support him.

88
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,190
He can't make big moves now.

89
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,000
But what if

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,040
he can make big moves later?

91
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,360
Then I'll fake my own death.

92
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,720
Is there any way to protect you?

93
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,720
To have a child with him.

94
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,390
We look exactly the same.

95
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,750
How can you prove it's me in your story

96
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
instead of you?

97
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,630
Because you can play the piano.

98
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,920
I can't.

99
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,000
I can't play the piano either.

100
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,870
Here's a video of you playing.

101
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,000
Look.

102
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,470
It's not.

103
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,190
Yuxian, it's you.

104
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,190
Take a closer look.

105
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,560
- Not me.
- It's you.

106
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,400
Yuxian.

107
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Yuxian, watch this video again.

108
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,600
It might jog your memory.

109
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,160
Xiaoxue, she can't remember anything.

110
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,560
Can you give her some time?

111
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,040
I need her to remember now.

112
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,670
Yuxian,

113
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,720
you came to me before the incident.

114
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,920
That's why I came up with a plan.

115
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,510
I pretended to be you

116
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,630
to get you out.

117
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,310
And I investigated the truth for you.

118
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,270
But now I need you.

119
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,360
I need you to remember.

120
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,160
Let's solve this together, okay?

121
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,200
Yuxian.

122
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,310
Chen Hee has gone missing.

123
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,560
We could be the next targets.

124
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,070
- Yuxian.
- Xiaoxue, my lady,

125
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,720
please give her a break.

126
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,270
You're faking amnesia,

127
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,600
but she really lost her memory.

128
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,390
We look exactly the same.

129
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,750
How can you prove it's me in your story

130
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,920
instead of you?

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,510

I'm renovating his house for free.

136
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,560
He should be thankful
I'm not charging him.

137
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,060

(I'm Song Yuxian from Song's Group.)

140
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,170
Try to come back early.

141
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,920
It's just one or two months.

142
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,600
What's wrong? Something urgent?

143
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,500
No, not that urgent.

144
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,420
I just feel like
something might happen to me.

145
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,720
