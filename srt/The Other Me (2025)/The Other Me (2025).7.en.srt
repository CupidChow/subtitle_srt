Listen to this.

2
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,000
They're playing a four-handed piece.

3
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,160
The music flows like clouds and water,

4
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,600
just like their love, a perfect harmony.

5
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,680
Great.

6
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,940

or to be spurned for another)

19
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,460
During the Ghost Festival,

20
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,620
Mr. Song and Mrs. Song come back
for ancestor worship.

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,780
They take this very seriously.

22
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,580
Everything has to be done personally.

23
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,020
That was about a year ago.

24
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,220
The tide seems off today.

25
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,380
Yes, why is it rising so early?

26
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,460
Everyone, hurry up.

27
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,880
Seize the auspicious hour.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,340
Yeah.

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,060
We're in the middle of ancestor worship.

30
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,700
Ah, everyone, get ashore quickly!

31
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,380
Get out of the water now!

32
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,500
Get out of the water now!

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,860
You were all there.

34
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,020
How could you not see it?

35
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,380
Why didn't you stop it?

36
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,020
They saw a girl.

37
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,180
They rushed over and jumped into the sea.

38
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,340
They were caught in a rip current.

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,940
You and your husband
collected their remains,

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,400
and buried them in the family grave.

41
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,140
Those days were full of
chaos and turmoil.

42
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,940
On the way back,

43
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,460
Mr. Qian must have dozed off
while driving.

44
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,260
The car went straight off the mountain.

45
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,860
Both the car and the person were gone.

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,180
Mr. Qian?

47
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,140
Yes.

48
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,780
He was the driver before I came.

49
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,860
Miss Song,

50
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,140
there's something you probably forgot.

51
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,540
What is it?

52
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,380
You were hospitalized for a while.

53
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,020
And the accident happened
during your treatment

54
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,860
at this hospital.

55
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,820
(Renai Clinic of Song's International Group)

56
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,500
Miss Song.

57
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,380
Miss Song.

58
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,140
Miss Song, it's been a few days.

59
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,620
You look even better now.

60
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,020
Thank you.

61
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,340
After lying down for so long,

62
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,580
it takes time to recover.

63
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,820
You're recovering very well.

64
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,740
Really?

65
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,700
These are for you.

66
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,620
I just picked them this morning.

67
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,260
Thank you so much.

68
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,300
I only found out this morning

69
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,500
that I fell here at your place.

70
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,780
Yes.

71
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,020
I was the one who found you back then.

72
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,860
How about I show you around?

73
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,500
Sure.

74
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,020
Look.

75
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,740
This is the spot.

76
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,860
Wasn't there a lift?

77
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,180
Why did I end up in the stairwell?

78
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,060
The lift was broken at the time.

79
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,940
You said it was just a few floors,

80
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,540
so you took the stairs instead.

81
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,900
Then why did you look for me?

82
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,180
Your driver waited outside for a while,

83
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,300
but you didn't show up.

84
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,900
He couldn't reach you by phone,

85
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,460
so he came to the hospital.

86
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,820
After I heard about it,

87
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,960
I rushed out to look for you.

88
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,580
Miss Song.

89
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,140
Miss Song.

90
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,900
At that time,
you were lying on the ground.

91
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,060
I was worried about a neck injury,

92
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,740
so I didn't dare to move you.

93
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,860
I had to wait for other doctors to help.

94
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,900
So that day,

95
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,020
I came for counseling.

96
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,220
Yes.

97
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,340
During that time,

98
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,620
you came every few days.

99
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,300
You said even just talking

100
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,020
made you feel better inside.

101
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,660
Did I mention my parents before?

102
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,140
Of course.

103
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,220
They passed away suddenly.

104
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,860
It hit you really hard.

105
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,900
For a while,

106
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,620
you had severe sleep issues.

107
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,180
You relied on alcohol and sleeping pills.

108
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,660
Alcohol?

109
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,460
Yes.

110
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,900
Luckily, your husband noticed early.

111
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,540
Otherwise, I'm afraid

112
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
you'd have to consult me
about my alcoholism.

113
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,340
Excuse me.

114
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,740
My apologies.

115
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,220
One of my patients had an issue.

116
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,060
I need to go.

117
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,900
I'll be right back.

118
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,980
Okay.
