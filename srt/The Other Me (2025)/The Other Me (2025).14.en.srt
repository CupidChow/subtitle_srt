1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,550
Don't just eat vegetables.

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,790
Here, try this fish.

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,510
Good morning.

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,000
Good morning, Miss Song.
Did you sleep well?

5
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,550
Miss Song.

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,870
Sorry about that.

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,800
I didn't know
there was an extra person today.

8
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,280
I only cooked for two.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,230
It's fine. This works out well.

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,350
My fault, my fault.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,350
I was too busy last night.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,030
I forgot to inform her to prepare more.

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,240
So I ended up eating Miss Song's share.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,560
Sorry about that.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
It's no big deal.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,200
But Dr. Tian, why are you free today?

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,910
Ah,

18
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,960
Hee has been missing these days,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,600
and you're leaving for ancestor worship.

20
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,710
So I...

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,950
I've asked Miss Tian to take care of you.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,150
Thank you, Dr. Tian.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,220
(We constantly distort others' thoughts)

24
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,300

to reconcile two scents.)

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
Back then, my grandma needed money.

38
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,520
I took any job to earn cash.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,910
One day,

40
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,750
someone hired me for a photo shoot.

41
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,080
Good, very good, very good.

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,630
Hey, hold the pose.

43
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,470
Keep the pose, very good.

44
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,750
OK, OK.

45
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,190
Make sure you tie it tight.

46
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,150
Who said "I'm the best swimmer" last time?

47
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,330
Safety first, though.

48
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,310
Better safe than sorry.

49
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,150
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,470
Do I have to wear this outfit?

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
It feels off.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,280
My boss loves this style.

53
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,750
You promised extra pay.

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,520
Don't worry, you'll get every penny.

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,400
Hurry up.

56
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,400
Alright, fine.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,410
Time to get in the water.

58
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,430
Wait, something's wrong.

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,310
The current seems off.

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
It's a rip current.

61
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,710
Pull me up, quick!

62
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,270
Hurry, hurry!

63
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,010
Dad's coming to save you.

64
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,870
These two are crazy.

65
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,750
Don't come closer, go back!

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,430
- Go, go!
- Go back!

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,590
Those two people...

68
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,360
If I'm not mistaken...

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,560
They're Yuxian's parents.

70
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,030
No, they're not.

71
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,600
You mean...

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,600
They mistook you for Yuxian.

73
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,800
They tried to save you.

74
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,910
You think so too?

75
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,910
But that's what happened.

76
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,190
Only I saw it at the time.

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,670
The public believes her parents died

78
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,110
because of the rip current.

79
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,400
Go find her.

80
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,520
You two can definitely sort it out.

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
Thank you.

82
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,160
Silly you.

83
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,750
Go on, clear things up with her.

84
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,240
Remember how I met Yuxian?

85
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,920
Didn't you send her flowers?

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Go to the flower shop
and ask something for me.

87
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,160
I'm off.

88
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Hurry up.

89
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,720
Hee! Hee!

90
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,950
Hee, where are you?

91
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,630
Hand over Hee.

92
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,590
Hee.

93
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,190
Ma'am, ma'am.

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,400
Hee.

95
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,880
Come here.

96
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,390
Still no sign of Chen Hee?

97
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,360
No, she hasn't returned yet.

98
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,950
Miss, do you know her?

99
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,510
Don't worry.

100
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,160
I'll talk to Miss Song first.

101
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,480
That girl said

102
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,310
they went to the memorial ceremony.

103
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,600
Hai County. They went to Hai County.

104
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,510
Could Hee be in Hai County?

105
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,920
Ma'am, go to the police station now.

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,900
Report it to the police

107
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,040
that Chen Hee is missing.

108
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,790
Wait a moment.

109
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,800
It's okay, it's okay.

110
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,240
Yuxian still hasn't replied to me.

111
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,830
They might have gone to Hai County.

112
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,110
Oh.

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm heading to the long-distance bus station.

114
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,950
Right. Come back after you've checked.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,840
Get on.

116
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,400
Let's go.

117
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,360
So, what did the store manager say?

118
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,190
He said he captured
the person's face that day

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,920
when he was taking photos of the flowers.

120
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,040
But it's not very clear.

121
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,360
Let me send it to you.

122
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,600
The store manager said

123
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,950
that person only waited half a minute.

124
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,000
If it weren't for the money in hand,

125
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,510
he would have thought it was a dream.

126
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,870
As I suspected,

127
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,190
my meeting with Yuxian

128
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,680
wasn't a coincidence at all.

129
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,560
