00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,060
(The room is a mess.)

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,660
(Walking; Storage room)

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,160
Hello.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,000
Miss Zhou, the police checked the footage.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,030
They said Hee never left the villa,

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,320
but they haven't found her yet.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,160
Hold on a second.

8
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,320
Ma'am, go tell the police now.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,030
That day, Xia Qingyang seemed off.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,280
You suspect he is linked
to Chen Hee's disappearance.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,670
How does that saying go?

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,670
Eliminate the impossible.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,820
What remains is the truth.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,640
So what do we do now?

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,820
(I am rooted, but I flow. - Virginia Woolf)

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,880
Let's find Yuxian first.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't get up yet.

30
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,430
What's wrong?

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,630
Right here, right now,

32
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,560
in front of my parents' spirits,

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,430
you tell me honestly,

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,750
did you have anything to do
with their death?

35
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,560
I was with you when they died.

36
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,910
We were abroad.

37
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,680
Then let me ask you again,

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,710
do you know Zhou Xiaoxue?

39
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,560
You're out of your mind.

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,470
You can't bear it, huh?

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,710
If Song Yuxian dies accidentally,

42
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,280
I won't get a single penny.

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,030
I don't want your money.

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,190
I want you.

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,190
If she dies, you're free.

46
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,500
Qingyang, listen to me.

47
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,370
Qingyang, I love you.

48
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,360
Don't go.

49
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,890
Qingyang, don't go.

50
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,470
Don't, Xia Qingyang.

51
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,770
What are you doing?

52
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't move.

53
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,600
I want to test your sisterhood.

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,040
Is it genuine or just a facade?

55
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,950
Only one of you can survive.

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,390
It's up to you.

57
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,480
Her or you?

58
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,120
Let her go. She's innocent.

59
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,430
How could she be innocent?

60
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,870
If not for her, your parents...

61
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,390
They're still alive and well.

62
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,520
It was you.

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,600
You orchestrated all this.

64
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,040
That incident was just a coincidence.

65
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,310
Even if it were me,

66
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,680
I couldn't have found someone

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,430
exactly like you.

68
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,920
Wasn't this your doing?

69
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,800
I just made a tiny hole

70
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,800
in the brake hose.

71
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,640
That's all.

72
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,750
Mr. Qian.

73
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,800
Mr. Qian's car crash wasn't an accident.

74
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,310
It was meant for your parents.

75
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,040
But I think this way is better.

76
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,600
Should I thank you?

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,240
For not harming me
while I was unconscious.

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,870
Back then,

79
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,800
if you died,

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,660
the board of directors

81
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,240
would tear me apart, wouldn't they?

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,510
Are you not afraid anymore?

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,000
Your dad's agreement covers every detail.

84
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,800
What a sly old fox.

85
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,680
Only one of you can stay.

86
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,070
You two look exactly the same anyway.

87
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,920
Decided on which one yet?

88
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,150
Choose!

89
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,590
Me.

90
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,510
Xia Qingyang, I'm warning you.

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
Don't hurt her.

92
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,750
Or I'll haunt you forever.

93
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,430
No, please no.

94
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,240
Come back.

95
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,910
Let go.

96
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,270
Hello.

97
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,270
Bring the car over.

98
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,240
Stop crying.

99
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,000
Too much crying hurts your eyes.

100
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,510
Xia Qingyang.

101
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,800
Song Yuxian's parents married her to you.

102
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,160
They gave you a golden opportunity.

103
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,390
And is this how you repay them?

104
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,850
Huh?

105
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,040
