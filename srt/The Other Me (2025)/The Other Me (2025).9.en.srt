Just stab me to death.

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,790
Give me a quick end.

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,400
What are you afraid of?

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,920
Didn't you bring the knife?

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,040
Didn't you ask me for this?

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,920
You've been avoiding me.

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,510
I tried to see you but you refused.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,640
If I hadn't come to the villa,

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,200
you wouldn't see me, would you?

24
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,200
What was our agreement?

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,790
You said it's not the right time yet.

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
You'll tell me when the time is right.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,590
Am I avoiding you?

28
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,040
But I'm pregnant.

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,040
Don't you care about me at all?

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
What did you say?

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,910
I...

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,590
I'm pregnant.

33
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,070
What?

34
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,270
Say it again.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
No.

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
I'm not pregnant.

37
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,840
I just wanted you to care about me more.

38
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,630
Back in college,

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,800
I got pregnant for you,

40
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,680
and had an abortion for you.

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,500
You probably forgot all about it.

42
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,680
I didn't, of course.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,480
Then why are you treating me like this?

44
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,400
Why are you...

45
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,080
You're being too irrational.

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,430
You used to be rational, didn't you?

47
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,630
It was your rational side that I admired.

48
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,680
That's why I chose to work with you.

49
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,870
You're really inhuman.

50
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,280
Stop. There's a security camera.

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,190
What was our agreement?

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,030
Get the Song family's fortune.

53
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,240
Everything will be ours.

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,000
So far,

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
is there a problem with our plan?

56
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,750
No.

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
But where am I?

58
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,910
Where did you place me?

59
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,120
We're already one.

60
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,910
Now tell me, where did I put you?

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,820
(Yuxian's med time.)

62
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,470
Stop.

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,120
Let go of me.

64
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't run.

65
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,310
Don't move.

66
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,710
Why is there so much blood?

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,400
Why is there so much blood?

68
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,800
I'll call an ambulance.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,120
What are you doing?

70
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,190
Don't.

71
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,800
Relax, hold it.

72
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,920
We are one.

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Don't be like this.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,080
No.

75
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,360
No, no.

76
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,630
Nanny, have you seen Chen Hee?

77
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,390
Miss Chen? I saw her just now.

78
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,310
She seemed to be headed to the garden.

79
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,150
Oh, okay.

80
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,100
(Yuxian)

81
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,120
Are all these your pen?

82
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,510
No, these belong to Xiao...

83
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,910
They're yours.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I kept them after you passed out.

85
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,670
Hmm.

86
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,630
My pens?

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,390
I don't remember them.

88
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,310
You don't even remember who you are,

89
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,730
let alone your pens.

90
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,000
You drew this.

91
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,910
Pretty, right?

92
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,560
Done changing?

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,400
Done.

94
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,750
Hello there.

95
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm Song Yuxian from Class 2, Grade 12.

96
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,040
Hello.

97
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm Zhou Xiaoxue
from the high school next door.

98
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,000
Nice to meet you.

99
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,510
Is this your school uniform?

100
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,710
Yes, it is.

101
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,240
If only

102
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,040
we had met in high school.

103
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,240
I would have had a friend.

104
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,270
Eh?

105
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,510
Your painting looks so odd.

106
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,920
What's odd about it?

107
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,040
You just don't get it.

108
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,390
When warm and cool colors
are used together,

109
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,720
they won't overshadow each other.

110
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,070
Instead, they highlight
each other's strengths.

111
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,040
Even better.

112
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,470
Really?

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,080
Of course.

114
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
