00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,160
You've always set
high standards for yourself.

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,360
But this time you realized

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,280
that as a woman,

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,320
you couldn't meet even the basic standards.

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,400
That's why you came to me.

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,240
The rain is so heavy today.

his flowers again.

To win those trophies,

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,680
I've put in a lot of effort.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,080
I would say,

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,460
hard work makes up for the lack of talent.

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,120
For one piece,

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,080
I need to practice hundreds of times

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,840
to match what talented people

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,800
achieve in dozens of tries.

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,440
But effort

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,040
doesn't guarantee results.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,840
When you're stuck at that level

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,280
after a thousand times of practice,

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
you would realize

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,440
that you're not cut out for it.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,640
To others,

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,680
you seem like a comic book character.

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,240
You have a natural protagonist aura.

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,080
But only you know

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,520
how much effort you've put in

39
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,400
to maintain that image.

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,400
When you can't make it,

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,440
you even exaggerate your achievements

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,400
just to gain praise from others.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,600
I don't really remember that.

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,800
Actually, you came to see me this time

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,280
because you found out you can't have kids.

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,920
What?

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,720
You got pregnant right after marriage.

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,240
But you miscarried after three months.

Does my husband know about this?

If what you're saying is true,

53
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,240
then he hasn't been told yet.

54
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,560
So that's how it is.

55

Hee said you've had no appetite lately.

65

This fish is so fresh.

66
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,640
It must be prepared properly to taste good.

67
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,920
How should it be prepared?

68
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,760
How about steamed fish?

69
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,080
You didn't like the dishes

70

74
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,720
I vowed to take care of you.

75
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,080
But then something happened to you.

76
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,520
Luckily,

77
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,400
you're still safe and sound.
