13
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,820
Miss Song.

14
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,420
Are you feeling unwell?

15
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,900
I just feel a bit dizzy.

16
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,700
And I have no energy.

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,740
That's normal.

18
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,220
You've been in a coma for two months.

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,300
Your waking up is already a miracle.

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,140
Yuxian.

21
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,580
The doctor said you woke up.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,780
I thought it was a joke.

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,300
You're really awake.

24
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,740
Does this hurt?

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,220
Hello?

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,980
Who are you?

27
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,340
You said Yuxian lost her memory.

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,700
Yes.

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,860
Her body functions are fine.

30
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,180
She just needs some simple rehab exercises.

31
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,420
But she's lost

32
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,700
her memory.

33
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,820
How much is gone?

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,300
Sorry about that.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,900
This isn't my area of expertise.

36
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,740
Regarding this matter,

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,060
Miss Song's previous therapist

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,240
might have more insight.

39
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,100
Mr. Xia.

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Let me explain

41
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,060
the rest to Mr. Xia.

42
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,140
Okay.

43
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,140
Yuxian.

44
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,900
This is Dr. Tian Miao.

45
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,020
You've been seeing her for counseling.

46
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,820
Hello, Miss Song.

47
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,980
Listen to me.

48
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,780
Keep pulling me, and I'll hit you.

49
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,700
Mr. Zhang.

50
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,780
Come here.

51
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,020
Yuxian.

52
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,260
Yuxian.

53
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,620
I'm Uncle Zhang.

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,980
Do you remember me?

55
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,220
I don't think so.

56
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,620
It's okay if you don't.

57
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,220
You'll remember eventually.

58
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,180
This...

59
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,980
Doctor, thank you for your care.

60
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,940
You don't have to.

61
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,780
Our hospital is part of Song's Group.

62
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,700
We'll do our best to treat Miss Song.

63
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,700
Take this.

64
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,820
Use the best medicine available.

65
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,140
Don't worry about the cost.

66
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,060
Really, no need. You're too kind.

67
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,100
Mr. Zhang, you said
you'd just take a look.

68
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,700
Alright, alright.

69
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,180
Yuxian, I have a meeting to attend.

70
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,900
Let me know what you'd like to eat.

71
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,860
I'll go buy it for you.

72
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,140
I'll bring it next time.

73
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,660
Mr. Zhang is just like that.

74
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,900
Did he scare you?

75
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,540
Mr. Xia.

76
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,920
I forgot Miss Song's evaluation form.

77
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,340
I need to head back.

78
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,180
Okay.

79
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,060
Thank you.

80
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,060
Does it hurt?

81
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,540
Move up a bit more.

82
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,540
Hee.

83
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,420
Coming.

84
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,700
Hee is your assistant.

85
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,340
She's been with you
for two or three years.

86
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,540
Yuxian, I'm Chen Hee.

87
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,820
I need to take my assistant's call.

88
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,140
Hello?

89
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,460
Yuxian, you're finally awake.

90
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,460
You have no idea how worried I've been.

91
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,620
Are you feeling better now?

92
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,380
Hee.

93
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,820
Leave us alone.

94
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,970
Okay.

95
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,820
The doctor said

96
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,300
you should do more rehab exercises.

97
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,700
Come on.

98
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,300
Can't Hee do it?

99
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,100
You're my wife, not Hee's.

100
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,460
We've been married

101
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,100
for three years.

102
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,140
Yet you're still so shy.

103
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,260
But I don't remember.

104
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,740
It's okay.

105
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,140
I'll help you remember,
piece by piece.

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,860
(I wonder how Yuxian
and Lu Yuan are doing.)

107
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,340
(Notification: Xiaoxue)

108
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,100
I'm awake.

109
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,460
(Xiaoxue)
How is Yuxian?

110
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,340
(Lu Yuan)
Not awake.

111
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,260
How about you? Any trouble?

112
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,420
(Xiaoxue)
No trouble at all.

113
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,340
I'm doing well.

114
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,380
But with a lot of people around,

115
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,500
it's hard to stay in touch.

116
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
(Lu Yuan)

117
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,660
You must be cautious with Xia Qingyang.

118
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,980
Miss Song's memory is still recovering.

119
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,860
If she remembers anything,

120
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,100
you must let me know.

121
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,340
Yes, sir.

122
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,860
I hope Yuxian

123
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,980
recover soon.

124
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,900
She is blessed by fate.

125
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,460
