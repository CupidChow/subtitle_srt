[Fighting for love]

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,050
[Episode 15]

4
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,830
General Shi.

5
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,550
Come.

6
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,910
We are in the countryside.

7
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,310
I don't have anything good to treat you.

8
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,150
Don't stand on ceremony.

9
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,920
Help yourself.

10
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,710
General Shi,

11
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,350
I want you to tell me the truth.

12
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,630
When can General Shang come back?

13
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,710
The military coalition

14
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,430
went to defend against enemies for Nanxia.

15
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,550
They will come back

16
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,230
when they kick all the soldiers of Beimo

17
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,270
out of Nanxia.

18
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,230
You just stay in Yuzhou City and rest assured.

19
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,350
I'll ask someone to inform you if there's any news.

20
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,110
Fine.

21
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,370
I'll just stay in the city for a few more days.

22
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,310
The military coalition left in a hurry.

23
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,470
There are many things that haven't been dealt with.

24
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,530
I'll drink with you

25
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,350
some other day.

26
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,050
Suit yourself, General Shi.

27
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,400
Come.

28
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,790
Qingzhou and Yuzhou have been out of control.

29
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,310
Find a way to get out of the city as soon as possible

30
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,870
and report it to His Majesty.

31
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,470
Go now.

32
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,870
Okay.

33
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,870
Stop. Where are you going?

34
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,670
I have a stomachache and need to go to the toilet.

35
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,730
Come back as soon as possible.

36
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,490
Okay.

37
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,200
Set up a camp here.

38
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,149
Ask the scouts to work in a three-shift system.

39
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,269
Yes, Marshal.

40
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,709
Set up a camp.

41
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,830
Here.

42
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,770
Brother, look at him.

43
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,640
Stop talking.

44
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,830
Recently, the army has been very anxious.

45
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,530
Remember to remind our men

46
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,040
to be alert at night.

47
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,300
He's been asserting dominance over you. Why are you defending him?

48
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,630
I'm just not convinced.

49
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,360
He is deep and cunning.

50
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,010
I don't know what His Majesty likes about him.

51
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,110
He even made him the commander of the three armies.

52
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,280
I think he's so unwise.

53
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,650
Stop talking nonsense.

54
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,480
Cui Yan,

55
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,280
no wonder your uncle always scolded you.

56
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,080
Sooner or later, you'll be in trouble due to your careless talk.

57
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,670
Alright.

58
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,750
Ask the men in the Kitchen Battalion

59
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,030
to cook more dishes tonight.

60
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,960
There will be a fierce battle soon.

61
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,760
Brother, how do you know?

62
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,850
You won't understand even if I tell you.

63
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,400
Let's go.

64
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,670
Brother,

65
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,040
I'll follow you.

66
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,440
I'll do whatever you say.

67
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,670
Our scouts delivered a message.

68
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,950
The enemy forces set up a camp

69
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,270
10 km north of our location.

70
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,230
In tomorrow's battle, we will dispatch cavalries first,

71
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,090
followed closely by infantries.

72
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,950
As long as Beimo also dispatches cavalries first,

73
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,350
they will lose their advantage

74
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,710
after they arrive at Yelanggou.

75
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,040
And their infantries will not be a threat.

76
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,720
Then it will be only a matter of time

77
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,990
to win the battle.

78
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,790
We still have one day to get ready.

79
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:55,070
Tell the kitchen to prepare steamed buns,

80
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,909
so that the soldiers can be full.

81
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,640
The entire army will launch an attack tomorrow morning.

82
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,060
General, how do you plan to deal with Beimo's cavalries?

83
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,250
[Wait for a chance at Yelanggou]

84
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,580
Mai, have some water.

85
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,150
Are you okay?

86
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,130
Are you scared?

87
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,450
I... I am not nervous.

88
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,930
I... I am not scared.

89
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,440
I... I have never been to a battlefield.

90
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,950
I've never been in a battle either.

91
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,550
I don't know what it's like on the battlefield.

92
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,360
The battlefield is not that scary.

93
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,390
Since you chose to join the army,

94
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
for Nanxia

95
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,730
and the revenge you must take,

96
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,370
you have to stabilize your emotions.

97
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,150
Because there will be a battle of life and death tomorrow.

98
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,070
Well said.

99
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,590
Sergeant.

100
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,200
Sergeant.

101
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,290
Brat,

102
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,110
what Mai said is right.

103
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,770
Mai,

104
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,960
let's take revenge

105
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,240
for Nanxia's men tomorrow.

106
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,810
Also,

107
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,710
if these Beimo people

108
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,050
dare to step on our land again,

109
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,420
let's kill them.

110
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,350
Kill them.

111
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,790
I think I should drink a toast to you with water

112
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,180
because you are so manly.

113
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,909
Sergeant.

114
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,780
Sergeant.

115
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,630
And you, brat.

116
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,750
When you go to the battlefield tomorrow,

117
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,630
don't be afraid of death.

118
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,550
I'm emotionally touched by you.

119
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,750
It's not scary to die on the battlefield

120
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,430
for killing enemies.

121
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,650
It's normal to be afraid of death. Everyone is afraid of death.

122
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,890
You can't say that.

123
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,630
I'm not afraid of death.

124
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,790
Qi.

125
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,590
Do you have a wife or a mother?

126
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,200
My mother is at home.

127
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,550
It's very dangerous on the battlefield.

128
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,740
Sergeant, if you...

129
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,080
die on the battlefield tomorrow,

130
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,770
who will take care of your mother?

131
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,750
What you just said makes me a little scared.

132
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,789
Sergeant,

133
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,150
I have an idea.

134
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:46,990
Erdan.

135
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:47,790
Come.

136
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,510
Come.

137
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,480
Turn around, back to back.

138
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,050
Come, like this.

139
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,430
Sergeant, come here too.

140
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,390
Me... Me too?

141
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,510
Yes, the three of us.

142
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,190
Come.

143
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,990
Like this.

144
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,370
Back to back.

145
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,590
Try to spin around.

146
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,530
Spin.

147
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:01,990
Spin.

148
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,190
Back to back tightly.

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,680
Yes.

150
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:05,950
What... What do you mean?

151
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,880
When the three of us go to the battlefield tomorrow,

152
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,690
let's form a team.

153
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,310
As long as we are back to back,

154
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,390
no matter how they attack us,

155
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,790
we can defend ourselves.

156
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,230
What do you think?

157
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,530
Good idea.

158
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
This is good.

159
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,300
It can prevent us from being attacked from all directions.

160
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,930
Yes. That's what I mean.

161
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,170
This is such a good idea.

162
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,950
Should we tell them?

163
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,710
Great.

164
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,920
Of course I'm willing.

165
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,110
Qi, please go tell them.

166
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,830
Okay, I'm going to tell them.

167
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,830
Guys.

168
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,430
This is great.

169
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,520
Erdan,

170
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,860
you won't die on the battlefield tomorrow.

171
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,740
Mai, I trust you.

172
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,860
Mai.

173
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,670
Brother Tang.

174
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,190
Go help Sergeant first.

175
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,710
Okay.

176
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,230
Mai.

177
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,670
Do you two still remember him?

178
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,880
He is Mai, who was in Yinbao City back then.

179
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,750
Yes.

180
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,590
Brother Mai.

181
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,870
Mai,

182
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,350
they are my brothers from Yinbao City.

183
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,230
He's Liu. He's Dong.

184
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,230
We met before.

185
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,230
It's great that you two are here.

186
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,210
Brother Tang can finally feel relieved now.

187
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,830
You two go to the camp

188
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,440
to see if there is anything else that should be prepared.

189
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,010
Okay.

190
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,070
Let's go.

191
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,630
Mai,

192
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,510
do you have something to tell me?

193
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,280
You are nervous before the battle.

194
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,490
I can't see through other things.

195
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,500
But I've been in many battles.

196
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,120
Remember,

197
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,670
when you are on the battlefield,

198
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,250
you have to be focused.

199
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,430
Got it, Brother Tang.

200
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,530
We'll go together,

201
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,310
and we'll come back together.

202
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,310
I'm not scared.

203
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,290
I really am not scared.

204
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,760
Look me in the eye.

205
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,030
Promise me.

206
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,760
I promise you.

207
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,510
Have a good sleep.

208
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,880
Only with a good night's sleep can you win the battle.

209
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,680
I'm leaving.

210
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,560
Got it.

211
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,200
What is this?

212
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,250
A bug.

213
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,740
What about this?

214
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,350
It's also a bug.

215
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,470
Mai,

216
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,710
you know clearly we are outnumbered

217
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,590
in the battle tomorrow.

218
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,350
I can't believe you still have the mood

219
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,640
to make bugs here.

220
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,070
Come on. Make some soldiers.

221
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:24,710
Okay.

222
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,140
Let's make some together.

223
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,310
This is for you.

224
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,910
Is this

225
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,480
an ancient divine beast mentioned in the ancient poems?

226
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:07,910
I see.

227
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,590
You want it to protect me.

228
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,980
Mai.

229
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,550
Actually, it's a dog.

230
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,250
Sorry.

231
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,110
I... I really couldn't tell.

232
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,270
It's okay.

233
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,670
I... I can make it a divine beast.

234
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,920
No... No need.

235
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,470
A dog is good too.

236
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,550
You are the boss in the military camp.

237
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,210
It's a dog if you say it's a dog.

238
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,550
It's late.

239
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,590
Go back and rest.

240
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,910
We'll have a battle tomorrow.

241
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,570
Sleep well to build up energy.

242
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,790
You too.

243
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,110
You go first.

244
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,200
You go first.

245
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,200
You go first.

246
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,560
I'm leaving first.

247
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,840
Come back alive.

248
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,640
Do you understand the plan I just made?

249
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,520
Yes.

250
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,600
Marshal,

251
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,350
I still think

252
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,640
Nanxia's army may set an ambush at Yelanggou.

253
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,310
If we attack rashly, we'll definitely fall into their trap.

254
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,970
Marshal, please think twice.

255
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,970
I made the plan

256
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,010
based on the message delivered by our scouts.

257
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,730
General Chang, what proof do you have

258
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,620
to support what you said?

259
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,110
My years of combat experience.

260
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,270
Yelanggou has a flat terrain...

261
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:18,990
General Chang...

262
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,600
But...

263
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,630
Have you forgotten our purpose of passing by Yelanggou

264
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,590
is to arrive in Yuzhou faster

265
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,350
and catch them off guard?

266
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,870
You just said

267
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,710
Yelanggou has a flat terrain.

268
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,170
There is nothing they can take advantage of.

269
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,150
How can Nanxia's army set an ambush?

270
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,750
Although Yelanggou has a flat terrain,

271
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,210
its topography is rugged.

272
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,190
Its east and west sides are narrow.

273
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,440
The north side is high and the south side is low.

274
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,190
If we dispatch cavalries as the vanguard

275
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,600
like you just planned,

276
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,160
they can only enter from the high ground in the north.

277
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,710
If cavalries rush to the plain from the high ground,

278
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,910
the horses won't be able to stop in time.

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,680
By that time, they just

280
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,420
need to set up a bayonet formation on the plain

281
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,680
to cause severe damage to our cavalries.

282
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,280
General Chang, what you said makes sense.

283
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,440
But in battles,

284
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,710
the priority is to know yourself and your enemy.

285
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,510
If our enemy is the Huainan Army,

286
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,640
of course we must be very cautious at this place.

287
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,190
But the soldiers in the Qingyu Military Coalition

288
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,790
are not professional at all.

289
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,790
Most of them haven't even been in a battle.

290
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,470
Why are you so panic, General Chang?

291
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,150
In that case,

292
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,470
I shall take my leave.

293
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,520
General Chang, suit yourself.

294
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,750
He's overconfident.

295
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,190
Brother, what happened?

296
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,230
Nothing.

297
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,600
I was just given the cold shoulder.

298
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,630
I knew he hasn't let it go.

299
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,710
He's so petty.

300
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,670
Brother,

301
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,060
you just put up with it?

302
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,910
He wouldn't listen to me.

303
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,829
I told him it's a trap of Nanxia's army, but he insisted on his plan.

304
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,630
I don't want my men to die in vain.

305
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,270
Come with me.

306
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,030
Are we going to fight on our own?

307
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,740
Where?

308
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,869
Yuzhou.

309
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,230
Fu Chong.

310
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,349
Yes.

311
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,069
I order you to lead your cavalries as the vanguard

312
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,950
and set off immediately.

313
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,790
Okay.

314
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,310
Pass my order.

315
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,510
Strike our camp

316
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,590
and head to Yelanggou.

317
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,630
Okay.

318
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,320
Done?

319
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,030
Done.

320
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,750
Yang Mo.

321
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,000
Big Brother.

322
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,550
Are you writing letters?

323
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,110
Help me write a letter to my family too.

324
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,710
Okay.

325
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,110
And I eat well and drink well

326
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,350
in the military camp.

327
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,430
I'll keep the extra pay

328
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,590
for her.

329
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,430
Of course.

330
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,070
And most importantly,

331
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,710
don't be reluctant to throw

332
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,590
the leftovers and the spoiled food away.

333
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,720
Give them to the pig.

334
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,950
No, wait.

335
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,010
They can't be given to the pig, right?

336
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,350
If the pig get sick after eating them,

337
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,590
we won't have pork for Chinese New Year, right?

338
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,710
Speaking of my pig...

339
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,350
Well...

340
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,760
Big Brother,

341
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,950
slow down.

342
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,510
Well,

343
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,510
I'm speaking slowly enough.

344
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,840
Do you know how to write?

345
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,630
Of course I know.

346
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,430
Listen, Big Brother.

347
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,110
When I studied in a private school back then,

348
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,770
I was a scholar in the village.

349
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,430
I'm telling you.

350
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,830
My handwriting was good.

351
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,680
Really?

352
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,270
Let me take a look.

353
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,250
They are all circles.

354
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:09,710
What is this?

355
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,750
I haven't written for a long time.

356
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,390
Is this what you called good handwriting? Do you know how to write?

357
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,440
Calm down, Big Brother.

358
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,300
How about this?

359
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,830
I'll draw a pig on it for you later.

360
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,230
I'm sure your mother can understand it.

361
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,870
Okay?

362
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,830
Then you need to draw a sow.

363
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,990
Because it's a sow we're raising, okay?

364
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:23,630
Okay.

365
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,470
Draw the pig well.

366
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,670
Mai.

367
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,630
You don't want to write a letter to your family?

368
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,110
Do you want me to write to you?

369
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,690
This boy...

370
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,650
General,

371
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,230
we found a small team of Nanxia's cavalries

372
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,510
10 km to Yelanggou just now.

373
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,430
It seems they are scouts.

374
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,070
Was General Chang right

375
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,430
about an ambush in Yelanggou?

376
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,630
So what?

377
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,400
Marshal said

378
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,610
they are not professional at all.

379
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,870
Should we report it to Marshal first?

380
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,800
No need for that.

381
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,870
The battle at Jingyang Pass

382
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,030
made Chang Yuqing famous.

383
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,990
If I can

384
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,030
defeat the Qingyu Military Coalition

385
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,590
before the army arrives,

386
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,020
I will be as famous as him.

387
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,950
Pass my order.

388
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,630
Speed up!

389
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,510
Okay.

390
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,900
Speed up!

391
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,980
[Yelanggou]

392
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,050
Charge!

393
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,960
The first arrow.

394
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,190
The second arrow.

395
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,320
The third arrow.

396
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,660
[Yuzhou]

397
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,830
General Shi.

398
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,510
What does this mean?

399
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,920
Yuzhou City has been taken over.

400
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,670
The special envoy was killed by the enemy.

401
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,470
Brother, just fight.

402
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,110
Waiting here makes me anxious.

403
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,310
Wait a little longer.

404
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,890
[Protect the country and the people]

405
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,680
[Protect the country and the people]

406
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,590
Tell General Shi

407
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,920
I don't have patience anymore.

408
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,270
General Chang, sorry to keep you waiting.

409
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,470
Have you made up your mind, General Shi?

410
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,670
Are you going to fight or surrender?

411
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,230
General Chang,

412
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,750
you must be joking.

413
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,430
Even though you have an invincible army,

414
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,630
we can't disgrace our country.

415
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,790
General, do you mean you're going to fight?

416
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,240
We can't defeat you.

417
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,450
To be honest,

418
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,270
there are fewer than 1,000 soldiers in Yuzhou.

419
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,660
We can't even defeat

420
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,960
ordinary soldiers,

421
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,830
not to mention an invincible army.

422
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,710
Then General Shi, what do you have

423
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,550
to bargain with me?

424
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,430
The civilians in the city.

425
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,950
You enjoy the reputation of an invincible general.

426
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,560
If we die in the battle,

427
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,830
the civilians in Yuzhou City will fight to death.

428
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,770
General Chang, you don't want

429
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,640
a run-down Yuzhou City, right?

430
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,120
What exactly are you trying to say?

431
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,210
General Chang,

432
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,970
it doesn't matter if I die.

433
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,200
But the civilians in Yuzhou City are innocent.

434
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,020
If you promise me

435
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,550
that you won't kill a civilian after entering the city,

436
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,340
even if I'll bear the name of a traitor,

437
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,230
I will open the city gate to welcome the Beimo Army.

438
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,070
I promise you.

439
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,990
In the name of what?

440
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,900
In the name of my ancestors,

441
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,950
I promise I won't hurt a civilian in Yuzhou.

442
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,750
Open the gate.

443
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,390
General, we can't.

444
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,470
I will take all the blame.

445
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,950
Open the gate.

446
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,710
Okay.

447
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,790
Let's go.

448
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,850
Release the fourth arrow.

449
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,510
Kill!

450
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,250
[Chen]

451
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,700
[Chen]

452
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,430
-Father!
-Go!

453
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,790
Mother!

454
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,550
Go!

455
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,030
Kill!

456
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,190
Mai!

457
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,760
-Mai!
-Mai! Come back!

458
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,070
Mai!

459
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,350
-Kill!
-Mai!

460
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,320
Mai!

461
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,070
Now we can tell Lieutenant Tang to attack and surround them.

462
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,590
Tell...

463
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,990
Kill!

464
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:57,510
Kill!

465
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,150
Mai!

466
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,470
Where's the Operation Supervision Team?

467
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,030
Shoot him!

468
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,590
Wait.

469
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,950
General,

470
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,950
those who disobey military orders in a battle shall be executed.

471
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,710
Mai is not someone who would disobey military discipline.

472
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,350
General,

473
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,990
you can't be merciful if you want to lead an army.

474
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,430
Sir, there is something you don't know.

475
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,590
Mai came up with the ideas.

476
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,630
Maybe she didn't tell me

477
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,030
about some details.

478
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,780
So let's wait

479
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,990
and see, okay?

480
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,950
Just wait and see.

481
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,000
[Chen]

482
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,710
Kill!

483
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,790
Chen Qi,

484
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,960
take care of Mai from now on.

485
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,950
Brother.

486
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,350
Sir, I'm giving you the authority temporarily.

487
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,830
Guards.

488
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,390
Yes.

489
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,510
Follow me.

490
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,070
Okay.

491
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,340
Young Marquis.

492
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,150
Brothers,

493
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,160
block the Beimo Army's escape route.

494
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,250
Charge!

495
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,750
Mai.

496
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,900
[Chen]

497
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,320
Mai.

498
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,469
Be careful.

499
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,840
The army is trapped. Marshal, please tell us what to do.

500
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,510
Retreat.

501
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,830
Mai,

502
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,200
you'll be fine soon.

503
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,990
Doctor! Doctor!

504
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,190
Why isn't he here yet?

505
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,510
Make way!

506
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,770
Make way!

507
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,540
Hurry up.

508
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,170
It must hurt a lot.

509
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,990
General,

510
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,140
pull out the arrow now.

511
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,090
Pull it out!

512
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,920
Of course we should pull it out!

513
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:28,930
General.

514
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,820
Bite it.

515
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,750
Bite it.

516
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,750
Mai.

517
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,910
It's okay.

518
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,910
It's okay, Mai.

519
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,710
It's okay.

520
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,560
Come.

521
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,330
Wait for me.

522
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,030
Report!

523
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,160
General,

524
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,350
Lieutenant Tang sent someone to report

525
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,360
that Beimo's army has retreated from Yelanggou.

526
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,350
There is no sign of a counterattack.

527
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,150
Mai, do you hear that?

528
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,360
Mr. Xu,

529
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,060
this is a secret letter.

530
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,460
[Beimo's Chang Yuqing led an army to attack Yuzhou, and Shi Dachun, the Guard General of Yuzhou, surrendered]

531
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:13,630
Sir,

532
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,770
why are you standing here?

533
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,060
[Beimo's Chang Yuqing led an army to attack Yuzhou, and Shi Dachun, the Guard General of Yuzhou, surrendered]

534
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,990
Take a look at this.

535
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,670
He chose to bear the name of a traitor

536
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,590
for the people of Yuzhou.

537
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,230
Yes.

538
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,230
I'm afraid General Shi

539
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,750
is expecting us to go back day and night.

540
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,750
But the Yuzhou Army has followed him for so many years.

541
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,710
If they know about this,

542
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,350
will it disrupt the morale of the army?

543
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,960
You've always wanted

544
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,190
to gain the military coalition's loyalty, right?

545
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,510
This is a good chance.

546
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,350
But General Shi will be wronged temporarily.

547
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,670
Marshal,

548
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,730
General Chang has taken over Yuzhou.

549
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,270
Marshal, you don't feel well.

550
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,960
And the soldiers have just finished a battle and need to rest and recover.

551
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,540
The nearest city is Yuzhou.

552
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,690
It's a good place for the entire army to recuperate.

553
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,950
Go to Yuzhou.

554
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:54,910
Okay.

555
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,490
Why are you doing this?

556
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,430
General,

557
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,790
we have followed Shi Dachun for many years.

558
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,030
We never thought

559
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,670
he would betray his own country.

560
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,830
We followed you to kill the enemies,

561
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,970
but he opened the gate and let the enemies in.

562
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,690
It's useless to say anything now.

563
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,550
General, please dismiss us.

564
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,700
We want to sneak back to Yuzhou City

565
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,830
to kill him. And then we'll kill ourselves as an apology.

566
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,270
I'm not going to stop you if you want to go.

567
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,200
But I'm going to ask you a question.

568
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,120
Are you Nanxia's soldiers

569
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,050
or Shi Dachun's soldiers?

570
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,510
Of course we are Nanxia's soldiers.

571
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,630
In that case,

572
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,150
what does it have to do with you

573
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,810
whether Shi Dachun betrayed the country or not?

574
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,520
For a long time, we've been fighting against the enemies

575
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,120
and protecting our country.

576
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,190
We are not protecting a city

577
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,150
or a family.

578
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,350
We are protecting the land of Nanxia

579
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,230
and

580
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,670
the people of Nanxia.

581
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,900
General,

582
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,560
considering what you just said, we'll follow you till we die

583
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,070
and do whatever you ask us to do.

584
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,800
Everyone, please stand up now.

585
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,950
Since you all think much of me,

586
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,630
from now on,

587
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,710
don't mention the Qingzhou Army or the Yuzhou Army anymore.

588
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,760
The military coalition will be a family from now on.

589
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,750
Okay.

590
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,110
Since the two armies have united as one,

591
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,640
there will be no Qingzhou or Yuzhou Army.

592
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,160
It's time to rename the military coalition.

593
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,230
General,

594
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,270
we're willing to follow you.

595
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,470
Please rename the military coalition.

596
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,230
Please rename the military coalition.

597
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,470
Since you trust me,

598
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,830
I'm going to rename the military coalition today.

599
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:08,230
For such a long time, the Qingyu Military Coalition

600
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,910
has been guarding the border and fighting against Beimo.

601
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,750
How about the Zhenbei Army?

602
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:28,150
The Zhenbei Army! The Zhenbei Army!
