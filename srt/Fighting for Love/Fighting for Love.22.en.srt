Episode 22

4
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,070
Stop!

5
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,430
I’ll fire the arrow at you if you don't stop.

6
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,650
Calm down, Marshal Shang.

7
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,470
I have a piece of news for you.

8
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,990
You must be interested in it.

9
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,670
I'm most interested in capturing you.

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,210
Chen Qi, I'll kill you.

11
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,450
Young Marquis.

12
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,670
Chen Qi ran away.

13
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,040
Forget it.

14
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,560
He told me

15
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,210
that the ones who killed my parents were from the palace

16
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,440
and that those from the Xuanwu Army did that.

17
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,370
The Xuanwu Army?

18
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,320
I'll investigate with you when we’re back to the palace.

19
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,590
Mai.

20
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,590
Thank you.

21
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,590
Thanks to you,

22
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,500
we managed to regain control of Yuzhou.

23
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,070
I acted on my own this time.

24
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,990
I'll take the punishment when I get back.

25
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,950
I'll talk to Sir myself.

26
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,900
[Yuzhou]

27

[Shang]

28
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,400
Your uncle is too sad to come.

29
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,280
So I came alone to see you.

30
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,230
Let's have a good chat.

31
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,490
I remember when I first met you,

32
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,110
my third uncle was taking me to Cui's Mansion.

33
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,990
You and several big boys

34
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,070
came and blocked my path.

35
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,790
At that time,

36
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,870
you were like a leopard.

37
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,170
You were younger than me,

38
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,720
but you insisted on having a fight with me.

39
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,620
When you lost,

40
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,590
you insisted that I be your big brother.

41
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,190
I was the one who took you

42
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,580
to the battlefield for the first time.

43
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,760
I promised to take good care of you.

44
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,470
Cui Yan.

45
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,620
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,930
Don't worry.

47
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,830
I'll see your parents as my parents.

48
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,160
I will take care of them for you.

49
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,390
I will also

50
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,990
avenge you.

51
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,510
I will fire the arrow into that jerk's heart.

52
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,680
In the next life,

53
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,830
let's be real brothers.

54
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,950
Chang Yuqing.

55
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,190
You'll be held accountable for the fall of Yuzhou.

56
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,570
The Marshal ordered me to capture you.

57
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,360
You'll be punished according to military law.

[The Royal Palace of Beimo]

59
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,310
You want to lead the army yourself?

60
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:50,870
Yes.

61
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,620
Please allow me to do it, Mother.

62
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,590
No.

63
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,230
Why not, Mother?

64
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,390
You're the emperor.

65
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,550
You're like a parent of our people.

[Empress Dowager of Beimo]

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,230
If you get hurt,

68
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,830
how will you face your people

69
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,030
and me?

70
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,630

[Emperor of Beimo]

72
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,750
include the solders in our army?

73
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,870
Of course.

74
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,230
What are you trying to say?

75
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,110
I think what you said is right.

76
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,900
But it's said that now,

77
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,820
everyone in our army only listens to Marshal Chen

78
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,000
and doesn't know much about the emperor.

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,350
So I want to go and see the army in person.

80
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,350
I want to let our soldiers know what their emperor is like.

81
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,390
Did someone really say that?

82
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,230
I'm not lying.

83
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,270
Today in the study,

84
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,830
I heard eunuchs outside say that.

85
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,470
Got it.

86
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,550
Go to the study and read your books.

87
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,280
Don't think too much.

88
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,270
Yes, I'll take my leave.

89
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,230
Guards!

90
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,790
Yes.

91
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,350
Find out who gossiped around the emperor.

92
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,990
They must be killed.

93
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,390
Yes.

[Yuzhou]

95
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,550
Stop walking around.

96
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,610
You're making me feel dizzier than I was on the battlefield.

97
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,230
Mai.

98
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,950
I’m worried about something but I don't know if I should tell you about it.

99
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,409
I can tell you're worried.

100
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,440
Tell me about it.

101
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,830
Yuzhou City is typically easy to attack but difficult to defend.

102
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,090
We managed to regain control of the city.

103
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,680
But who is the right person to defend the city?

104
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,980
To defend the city won't be easy.

105
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,200
You're right.

106
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,990
There is plenty of food and fodder in Yuzhou City.

107
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,470
The Beimo Army is so barbaric.

108
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,130
It's easy for them to come back and take the city.

109
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,230
I have an idea.

110
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,190
Let's leave.

111
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,390
I'm confused.

112
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,790
Where are we leaving for?

113
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,830
We can go anywhere.

114
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,190
Let's just leave Yuzhou.

115
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,760
We've taken the city.

116
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,240
So if we leave now, it means that we leave voluntarily

117
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,470
and that we are not forced to leave.

118
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,510
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

119
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,910
Nothing to be ashamed of?

120
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,750
What about the people of Yuzhou if we leave?

121
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,600
Have you forgotten what those Beimo soldiers

122
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,190
did to the people in the city?

123
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,550
Mai.

124
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,110
Why do you always care so much about the people?

125
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,170
Can't we live for ourselves for once?

126
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,550
Shang Yizhi, I didn't expect you to be this kind of person.

127
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,510
I have to stay alive before I can be a good man.

128
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,230
Stay alive?

129
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,550
Fine. You've made up your man to leave?

130
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,470
Yes.

131
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,830
I'll pack and leave tomorrow.

132
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,190
As for Yuzhou City,

133
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,120
it'll be fine anyway.

134
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,150
I'm leaving here.

135
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,310
Let who wants to defend it defend it.

136
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,190
I don't care.

137
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,590
I didn't expect that in Nanxia

138
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,910
there is not a real man.

139
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,070
The man standing in front of me

140
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,320
is not a real man, either.

141
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,270
Fine, you leave.

142
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,590
You leave and I'll defend the city.

143
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,150
Fine.

144
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,710
If you've decided to defend the city, I'm not leaving.

145
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,210
Is this your trick?

146
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,150
No.

147
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,150
Were you tricking me

148
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,390
into saying that I'd defend the city?

149
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,350
No.

150
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,150
We got so emotional

151
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,080
that we said those things just now.

152
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,910
Really?

153
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,650
Do you believe in fate?

154
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,780
What fate? I'll get you punished.

155
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,980
Stop there!

156
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,150
Marshal.

157
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,400
The envoy from the capital is here.

158
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,470
Let him in.

159
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,280
Please.

160
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:46,910
Marshal.

161
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,450
Yuzong, you went all the way to the barracks.

162
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,950
Are you here to visit your relative?

163
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,950
I'm here not only to visit my relative

164
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,680
but also to visit our soldiers.

165
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,920
On the way to the barracks,

166
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,390
I saw that our soldiers were in good form and that our provisions were also sufficient.

167
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,070
Our army has maintained a good reputation for Beimo.

168
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,400
Your comments are fair.

169
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,600
You

170
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,820
didn't find your elder brother?

171
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,750
Is that why you're searching the barracks?

172
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,470
He doesn't live in the camp anymore.

173
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,810
You'll find him in the guardhouse.

174
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:22,760
Marshal.

175
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,210
The Chang family is really powerful.

176
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,470
Marshal, you overpraised the Chang family.

177
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,950
The Cui family and the Chang family always have a good relationship.

178
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,510
Cui Yan and my elder brother

179
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,110
were so close

180
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,310
that they were like real brothers.

181
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,800
Now a Cui got killed.

182
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,630
So the two families are united

183
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,610
to protect the person from the Chang family.

184
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,280
They must have done a lot

185
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,510
for Chang Yuqing.

186
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,830
But Yuzong, you don't have to come in person.

187
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,110
If you want to join my army,

188
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,510
I will value you.

189
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,510
I don't think I should join your army.

190
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,790
I'm not like my elder brother who is good at fighting in the battlefield.

191
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,070
I just enjoy reading

192
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,870
and I'm only good at writing.

193
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,470
Yuzong, you're so modest.

194
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,360
Brother.

195
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,680
Yuzong.

196
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,790
Brother.

197
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,530
You've been unfairly treated this time.

198
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,790
It's not a big deal.

199
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,070
Brother.

200
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,230
The Beimo soldiers heavily outnumbered the Nanxia soldiers.

201
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,190
How come we lost control of Yuzhou this time

202
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,670
and Cui Yan died?

203
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,190
Let bygones be bygones.

204
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,270
One more thing.

205
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,310
How come you married a woman from Nanxia?

206
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,030
Father got furious when he heard the news.

207
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,430
He said he would never let a woman from Nanxia come to the Chang family.

208
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,390
But I bought you a house in the suburbs.

209
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,310
If there is no better option, you can let her stay there.

210
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,030
No need.

211
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,230
She ran away.

212
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,790
But one day,

213
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,790
I will wed her at a formal wedding.

214
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,310
Let me talk to Father myself.

215
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,150
The most important thing now

216
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,680
is to find a way to end everything with Chen Qi.

217
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,110
Chen Qi is very cunning.

218
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,790
Be careful.

219
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,970
Mai will be the chief guard of the city this time.

220
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,800
The rest of you, obey his orders.

221
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,390
Yes.

222
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,750
Lieutenant Tang.

223
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:42,910
You take the cavalry battalion

224
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,110
to cut off the provisions of the Beimo army

225
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,440
so they'll be isolated.

226
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,670
Yes.

227
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,670
General Shi.

228
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,630
Block all the gates quickly.

229
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,760
No one can leave the city without permission

230
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,710
Yes.

231
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,110
Counsellor Xu...

232
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,670
News!

233
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,630
An urgent message from the front.

234
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,090
The Beimo Army retreated.

235
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,360
They retreated?

236
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,950
Be careful.

237
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,550
Take it.

238
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,220
Pass it to me.

239
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,850
A little more to the left. Be careful.

240
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,670
Reinforce it.

241
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,600
Can I put it here?

242
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,720
Okay.

243
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,190
[East Street Market]

244
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,110
Be careful.

245
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,970
Now the Beimo Army has retreated.

246
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,590
Our army has more time to get ready for future battles

247
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,830
and our people

248
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,960
will have a period of peaceful life.

249
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,030
I hope this could last forever.

250
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,510
I saw clearly

251
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,950
what those from Beimo

252
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,410
did to our people after I came to the city.

253
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,330
If I can make the decision,

254
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,670
I will kill all the people from Beimo.

255
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,230
There are cruel people in every country.

256
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,820
There are also kind people in every country.

257
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,140
Who are you referring to?

258
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,390
Who is the kind person of the people from Beimo?

259
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,390
Are you trying to have a quarrel with me?

260
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,430
I'm serious.

261
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,230
You're defending Chang Yuqing.

262
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,710
Actually,

263
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,310
General Chang was nice to me those days.

264
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,030
He was always gentle and considerate and he would do anything I asked him to do.

265
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,560
If I were an ordinary woman,

266
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,430
I would consider him as my potential husband.

267
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,590
You admitted it, right?

268
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,190
You just admitted it, right?

269
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,830
Your feelings have changed so quickly.

270
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,510
That day, behind that rockery,

271
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,550
I didn't yield to temptation when I saw that perfect girl.

272
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,430
Now your feelings have changed.

273
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,430
Why?

274
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,830
Are you done?

275
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,350
I told you

276
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,710
I would do that only if I were an ordinary woman.

277
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,470
Let me ask you, am I an ordinary woman?

278
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,230
What ordinary woman?

279
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,950
Am I an ordinary man?

280
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,750
No wonder you dressed like that.

281
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,750
So you dressed like that for Chang Yuqing.

282
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,430
Stop being so unreasonable.

283
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,690
Nothing happened between him and me.

284
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,310
Alright, tell me.

285
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,250
What should I do to make you feel better this time?

286
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,350
Did you throw away those clothes?

287
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,710
I'll kill you.

288
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,310
I want you to change into those clothes to make me happy.

289
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,070
I'll kill you.

290
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,070
Stop.

291
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,450
[Yuzhou]

292
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,490
This time, Marshal Shang did a good job in leading the Zhenbei Army

293
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,950
and repelling the enemy outside the pass.

294
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,950
His Majesty and officials in the court have got the news.

295
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,640
The enemy has retreated.

296
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,390
But the Huainan Army is still stationed in the south bank of Wanjiang River.

297
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,250
Young Marquis.

298
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,900
You should make a plan early.

299
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,180
The best thing we can do now is do nothing and wait.

300
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,180
It's getting late.

301
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,550
The city gate is not closed yet.

302
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,320
I'll come back to the camp and check on Xiu'er.

303
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,980
I'll bring her over tomorrow.

304
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,670
Good.

305
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,750
I'm also going back to the camp to get some military reports.

306
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,390
General Mai, how about we

307
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,510
go back together?

308
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,079
That'll be good.

309
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,430
Please.

310
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,060
Be careful.

311
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,510
Good drinks.

312
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,170
Zhao Zhong.

313
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,500
What did you say just now?

314
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,470
What did I say?

315
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,630
You said...

316
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,750
What did I say?

317
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,550
Tell me.

318
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,510
Is he drunk?

319
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,589
You guys!

320
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,990
Come here!

321
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,880
General Mai.

322
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,110
Good.

323
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,510
How can you be drinking on the street and disturbing the people?

324
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,640
And you, Zhao Zhong.

325
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,880
Don’t you remember Marshal Shang's discipline?

326
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,870
Ask Marshal Shang to come if you dare.

327
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,470
I won't listen to you.

328
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,250
You're just...

329
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,040
He Chao.

330
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,320
General Mai, he's drunk.

331
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,910
Don't care what he said.

332
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,630
Get them flogged 20 times as a punishment.

333
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,690
Take them all away.

334
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,310
Yes.

335
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:07,800
Go.

336
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,550
I have something to tell you.

337
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,120
What is it?

338
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,230
Did you hear that...

339
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,300
It's said that General Mai is a woman.

340
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,640
Really?

341
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,640
Yes, they all said that.

342
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,250
Were you looking at me?

343
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,790
No, no, no.

344
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,170
Absolutely not.

345
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,150
You were.

346
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,580
Why don't you admit it?

347
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,230
I'm not a man with three heads and six arms.

348
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,470
Why were you looking at me?

349
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,190
We were looking at you because...

350
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,950
We admire you because you're such a cool man.

351
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,750
Yes.

352
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,350
Be honest with me.

353
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,860
Well, we...

354
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,470
We...

355
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,150
Sergeant.

356
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,680
Sergeant, we are here.

357
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,430
General Mai, we have to go.

358
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,310
-See you.
-Bye.

359
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,140
Something is wrong.

360
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,150
Brother Mai.

361
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,110
Xiu'er.

362
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,910
You're awake.

363
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,710
Are you done packing?

364
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,670
Yes.

365
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,680
I don't have much to pack, just some clothes.

366
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,270
Brother Mai, let's eat first.

367
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,780
Okay.

368
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,630
Let's enter the city after breakfast.

369
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,390
General Mai.

370
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,270
Go and have a look.

371
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,270
Zhang Shiqiang is having a fight with someone.

372
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,930
Wait for me.

373
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,620
Hit him!

374
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,820
You talked nonsense!

375
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,510
You talked nonsense! You talked nonsense!

376
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,590
You talked nonsense! I'll kill you!

377
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,520
What are you doing?

378
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,230
Stop!

379
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,030
Let go!

380
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,720
Get up.

381
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,030
What are you looking at?

382
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,030
Let's go.

383
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,150
Go away!

384
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,960
What's going on?

385
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,960
Why did you have a fight?

386
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,400
Answer me!

387
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,590
Why did you have a fight, Erdan?

388
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,590
He slandered you.

389
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,350
Erdan, shut up.

390
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,030
He also said you were a woman.

391
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,330
Everyone is talking about it in the army.

392
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,650
I just asked them a few questions.

393
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,240
And then they started to hit me.

394
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,270
General Mai.

395
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,670
Do I have to be punished for talking?

396
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,460
Stop it.

397
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,150
Say it again and I'll kill you!

398
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,720
Shut up!

399
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,910
You won't be punished for talking.

400
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,510
But you guys just had a fight.

401
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,640
According to military law,

402
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,910
you should be flogged 20 times.

403
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,030
Then we three should all be punished.

404
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,070
I punished you yesterday

405
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,050
because you didn't even consider admitting your mistake.

406
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,350
Right.

407
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,870
I don't like it

408
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,800
when people say I look like a woman.

409
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,190
But what they want to say is none of my business.

410
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,470
It's also none of your business.

411
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,190
I won't punish you for what happened today.

412
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,560
If it happens again,

413
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,770
I won't let you off.

414
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,790
Yes.

415
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,270
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

416
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,330
Let's wait and see.

417
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,750
Don't be so impulsive next time.

418
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,140
Have you forgotten how much it hurts to be flogged 20 times.

419
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,390
Of course not.

420
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,920
But he deserved to be beaten.

421
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,910
How could he spread rumors about you?

422
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,030
Who started those rumors?

423
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,760
I don't know.

424
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,140
Forget about it.

425
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,430
You two go back to work.

426
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,030
I'll go talk to Brother Tang.

427
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,260
Okay. Let's go.

428
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,550
How could I make such a slip of tongue?

429
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,590
I was so stupid.

430
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,090
I shouldn't have drunk that much.

431
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,940
Why would I say that? I shouldn't have been that drunk.

432
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,440
How could I say that?

433
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,230
How could I say that?

434
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,510
What's wrong?

435
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,400
You've got a toothache?

436
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,390
Yes, a little bit.

437
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,190
How many times have I told you?

438
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,190
Do not stay up late often. You should drink more water.

439
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,020
Yes.

440
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,250
Young Marquis.

441
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,670
This is a letter for my mother. It'll tell her I'm safe.

442
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,550
Send it to her.

443
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:52,990
Okay.

444
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,810
Young Marquis.

445
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,150
Sir sent a message to us.

446
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,870
Brother Tang.

447
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,060
What do you think about it?

448
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,830
I think the ones who started the rumor

449
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,440
must have been those

450
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,840
who saw your wedding invitation in Yuzhou.

451
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:11,900
So do I.

452
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,120
Who do you think started the rumor?

453
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,740
I don't believe it's Marshal Shang or Mu Bai.

454
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,400
I also don't believe it's you.

455
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,390
Then the close guards of yours

456
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,430
are the most suspicious.

457
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,640
What are you going to do?

458
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,560
What can I do?

459
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,130
I can't kill them to silence them.

460
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,870
Brother Tang.

461
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,590
The rumor has spread.

462
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,750
Some people would be curious about it

463
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,190
and want to find out whether it's true or not.

464
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,030
Why don't we

465
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,630
prepare a good show for them?

466
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,510
A good show?

467
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:42,910
Come on.

468
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,150
We...

469
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,740
Mai. Mai.

470
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,430
Do you know

471
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,230
that everyone in our army says that you are a woman?

472
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,490
Say it more loudly.

473
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,390
Say it more loudly

474
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,880
and the whole army will believe it's true.

475
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,800
Stay out of this thing.

476
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,030
I've got an idea how to deal with it.

477
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,750
What idea?

478
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,190
I plan to invite Brother Tang

479
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,850
to take a shower in my tent.

480
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,390
Take a shower?

481
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,320
What will you be doing?

482
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,350
Me?

483
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,880
I'll squat there

484
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,460
and hum,

485
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,190
pretending that I'm taking a shower.

486
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,250
I disagree with it.

487
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,640
You, you disagree...

488
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,670
I disagree with it too.

489
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,290
Well.

490
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,040
Why do you disagree with it?

491
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,230
Because...

492
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,800
I haven't come up with a reason yet.

493
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,480
What are you doing here?

494
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,120
Leave now. Don't talk to me.

495
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,910
The wine is so good.

496
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,000
I've quit drinking.

497
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,150
Go away.

498
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,470
You said General Mai was a woman the other day.

499
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,270
Is that true?

500
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,790
I saw the wedding invitation of General Mai and Chang Yuqing

501
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,570
a few days ago.

502
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,760
What?

503
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,520
That's not true.

504
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,390
You misheard.

505
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,310
No way.

506
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,870
I heard it clearly.

507
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,880
You said you had seen her wedding invitation.

508
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,750
Impossible.

509
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,360
You heard the rumor in the army.

510
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,870
General Mai and Marshal Shang...

511
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,310
Then why did you quit drinking?

512
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:27,830
I...

513
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,030
You said she was a woman yesterday.

514
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,870
Now you deny it.

515
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,150
You might have others fooled.

516
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,350
But you can't fool me.

517
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,390
She did all that

518
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,150
to make everyone believe that she's not a girl.

519
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,830
What do you want?

520
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,830
I want you to tell everyone the truth

521
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,360
so that everyone will know her real identity.

522
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,470
No way.

523
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,390
Fine.

524
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,750
If you don't do it, I'll do it myself.

525
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,120
He Chao, you...

526
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,070
Beimo wants to negotiate peace?

527
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,630
Yes.

528
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,440
Chen Qi's army has retreated to the area outside the pass.

529
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,070
They only stationed a group of guards in Jingyang City.

530
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,950
The Empress Dowager of Beimo has sent a peace envoy

531
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,650
who is on his way to Shengdu.

532
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,070
That woman

533
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,840
is taking state affair as a joke.

534
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,910
However,

535
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,210
we should give a warm response to her goodwill gesture.

536
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,890
Let's negotiate peace with them.

537
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:51,620
Should I invite Prime Minister Lin to the palace?

538
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,230
There's no rush.

539
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,710
Since we are in the truce,

540
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,910
this is a time when I should find out who should be rewarded

541
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,030
and also who should be punished.

542
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,670
Yes.

543
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,990
It’s my turn.

544
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,040
Uncle Shi.

545
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,350
You’ve been walking around for a while.

546
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,110
Why are you doing this?

547
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,670
Young Marquis.

548
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,840
Have you ever thought about getting back what should belong to you?

549
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,870
Young Marquis.

550
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,830
I live in seclusion,

551
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,750
but I'm not deaf or blind.

552
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,030
I've heard about

553
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,410
what the guy in the palace has done these years.

554
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,830
When you led the Qingzhou soldiers

555
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,470
to Yuzhou to get food,

556
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,000
I knew something was wrong.

557
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,960
Then the crown prince came with an imperial order

558
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,750
and convicted you of three crimes.

559
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,910
They wanted you to be dead.

560
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,640
That means

561
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,910
the person in the palace was targeting you.

562
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,950
When did you find out about it?

563
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,400
That's not important.

564
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,350
What matters is

565
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,850
whether you've ever thought about it.

566
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,030
You've never really thought about it?

567
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,990
Never.

568
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,430
Uncle Shi.

569
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,870
If we take an action, it will have consequences for many things.

570
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,190
My father is dead.

571
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,360
I can't get my mother implicated in anything.

572
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,710
Besides, you know

573
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,900
I'm not very capable man.

574
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,490
I...

575
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,280
Beat him up!

576
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,470
Beat him!

577
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,990
Be careful.

578
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,590
Beat him! Beat him!

579
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,830
Beat him! Well done!

580
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,190
Bravo! Bravo!

581
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,430
Bravo!

582
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,230
Sergeant.

583
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,720
He played dirty tricks.

584
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,950
Beat him! Bravo!

585
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,830
Bravo!

586
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,030
Do you believe

587
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,350
Mai is a woman?

588
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,470
That's impossible.

589
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,350
Don't spread rumors.

590
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,950
He has a wife.

591
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,590
What are you looking at? Focus on your training.

592
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,550
Go, go, go.

593
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,550
Did you hear that?

594
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,390
All the people in the army

595
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,730
suspect Mai is a woman.

596
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,270
Don't care what they said.

597
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,080
You don't think it's a big deal?

598
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,670
This rumor has a bad impact on our morale.

599
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,490
We must take it seriously.

600
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,550
Take it seriously?

601
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,810
You're overreacting.

602
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,310
You need to learn to take it easy.

603
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,160
How can I take it easy?

604
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,160
Good job.

605
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,000
Let's go and have a look.

606
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,190
Bravo! Beat him!

607
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,270
Keep fighting.

608
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,430
Bravo!

609
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,310
Bravo! Bravo!

610
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,990
Bravo! Beat him!

611
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,470
Bravo! Beat him!

612
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,130
Bravo! Beat him!

613
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:31,980
Beat him!

614
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,910
-Beat him.
-Yes.

615
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,390
Bravo!

616
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,750
Bravo!

617
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,230
Bravo! Bravo!

618
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,870
Stop!

619
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,270
Bravo! Bravo!

620
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,210
What are you doing?

621
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,800
We had a small duel.

622
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,610
It's nothing serious.

623
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,290
You tell us what happened.

624
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,790
Marshal Shang.

625
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,790
When Mai got back from training,

626
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,670
He Chao came to see Mai

627
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,190
and wanted to take off Mai's pants.

628
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,350
That was so unacceptable.

629
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,710
In my opinion, he deserved to be beaten.

630
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,270
Right?

631
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,110
It's all his fault. He started it.

632
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,910
How dare you!

633
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,750
You are comrades.

634
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,160
The one in front of you is not your enemy.

635
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,110
Your weapons can only be used to fight against your enemies.

636
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,630
You can't do anything to your comrade's pants.

637
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,470
I was wrong.

638
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,190
Go to your battalion commander and take the punishment.

639
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,830
Yes.

640
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,470
Alright. Everybody, leave.

641
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,390
Let’s go. Let’s do some training.

642
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:24,920
Let's go.

643
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,000
What on earth happened?

644
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,310
They wanted to have a duel with me

645
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,750
because they wanted to know my real identity.

646
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,270
How could they do that?

647
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,310
How dare you say that?

648
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,320
Think about how we should deal with it.

649
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,190
Do you know they tried

650
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,800
different ways to get to know my real identity?

651
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,830
I'm exhausted.

652
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,160
I didn't expect they would do that.

653
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,430
Besides,

654
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,200
you're such a good fighter.

655
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,760
I really can't count on you.

656
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,880
Don’t follow me.

657
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,360
Brother Mai.

658
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,430
Xiu'er.

659
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,990
Washing clothes?

660
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,720
Brother Mai.

661
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,030
Are you bothered by those rumors?

662
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,690
You've heard those rumors?

663
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:49,750
It’s okay.

664
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,200
Brother Mai, ignore those rumors.

665
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,760
I believe they're not true.

666
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,430
I know.

667
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,790
Brother Mai.

668
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,390
Marry me.

669
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,950
They always say you're a woman.

670
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,170
As long as you marry me,

671
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,550
they'll never say that anymore.

672
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,230
Xiu'er.

673
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,090
I'm willing to spend my whole life

674
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,710
repaying your favor.

675
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,480
The decision will influence your whole life. Don't be so impulsive.

676
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,630
Remember,

677
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,240
for a girl,

678
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,270
her reputation is the most important.

679
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,230
Brother Mai.

680
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,480
We can divorce when everyone stops spreading the rumor.

681
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,949
What they said

682
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:26,710
is true?

683
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,389
I still want to marry you.

684
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,230
What are you doing?

685
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,630
I still want to marry you.

686
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,110
You should listen to me.

687
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,940
Now I've known the truth.

688
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,560
It's still okay that you marry me.

689
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,350
Xiu'er, Xiu'er...

690
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,030
Besides, you have an important mission to complete.

691
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,560
You need to stay in the army.

692
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,350
There will be an auspicious day in two days.

693
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,390
Let's get married that day.

694
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,150
If you don't come down,

695
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,510
I'll throw you into the river.

696
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,770
Go ahead, Brother Mai.

697
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,910
Let's get married.

698
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,050
I'll do it, really.

699
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,390
Xiu'er.

700
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,350
-Brother Mai.
-Xiu'er, you...

701
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,470
Get down.

702
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,030
Thank you, everyone.

703
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,620
I'll prepare good wine and dishes. You should definitely come.

704
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,470
Sure, sure.

705
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:17,950
Sure.

706
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,830
Thanks.

707
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,650
Yes, go and arrange it.

708
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,070
Mr. Liu.

709
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,390
I'll get married tomorrow.

710
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,200
Good wine and dishes will be served.

711
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,740
You should definitely come.

712
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,430
General Mai, you're getting married?

713
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,270
Great!

714
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,080
I'll definitely come.

715
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,120
Thank you.

716
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,350
Okay, I'll go back to work.

717
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:33,990
Thank you.

718
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,270
Mai.

719
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,500
You’re getting married?

720
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,270
To whom?

721
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,390
Xiu'er.

722
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,910
Xiu'er?

723
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,430
If you two get married, how can she marry to somebody else in the future?

724
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,910
You're hurting her.

725
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,270
Brother Tang.

726
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,030
Why don't you send us your best wishes?

727
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,030
I've checked the calendar.

728
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,490
Tomorrow is an auspicious day for marriage.

729
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,430
Xiu'er, let go of Mai.

730
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,320
It's not worth it.

731
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,390
Why not?

732
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,890
Brother Mai is a handsome guy.

733
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,020
He's wise and brave.

734
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,630
Everyone speaks highly of him.

735
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,470
Stop acting.

736
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,760
Brother Tang knows I'm a woman.

737
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,360
Xiu'er.

738
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,710
I know you’re doing this for Mai.

739
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,350
But this is your marriage.

740
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,600
You must think about it carefully.

741
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,190
We're in the times of chaos and instabilities.

742
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,510
I have no one to rely on.

743
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,790
No matter who I marry, I won't know whether he'll stay with me forever.

744
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,170
For one thing, the Beimo soldiers are watching us closely.

745
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,150
For another, many people are waiting the Zhenbei Army to make mistakes and blame us.

746
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,990
If people now know that Mai

747
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,810
from the Zhenbei Army,

748
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,590
who is the excellent fighter famous in four kingdoms, is a woman,

749
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,080
