[Fighting for love]

00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,000
[Episode 31]

4
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,750
Maisui, Marshal of the Zhenbei Army,

5
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,950
colluded with Beimo.

6
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,680
If we don't arrest her now,

7
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,590
are we supposed to wait until she joins forces with the Beimo Army

8
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,030
to attack Nanxia?

9
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,590
Then tell me.

10
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,310
Why would she collude with the enemy?

11
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,910
Marshal Mai has admitted it.

12
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,970
[Maisui]

13
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,810
I don't believe it.

14
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,270
You must have tortured her and forced her to confess.

15
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,890
There's no need for that.

16
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,520
We have witnesses except the physical evidence.

17
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,150
Beimo's general Chang Yuqing

18
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,400
once had a wedding in Yuzhou.

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,870
His bride was Mai.

20
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,430
And many people

21
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,070
have seen that Mai and Chang Yuqing were together.

22
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,200
They are very close.

23
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,910
In that case,

24
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,030
what's Mai's intention by disguising herself as a man

25
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,000
to join Nanxia's army?

26
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,190
Prime Minister Lin, you mean...

27
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,070
Marshal Shang, I hope you can keep your promise

28
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,590
and marry Lin Zerou as soon as possible.

29
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,930
How can we be so hasty about marriage?

30
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,350
A woman joined the army.

31
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,350
She colluded with the enemy and deceived the emperor.

32
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,670
Each crime is unforgivable.

33
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,130
She should be executed according to the law.

34
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,590
Mr. Xu, what do you think?

35
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,710
On the wedding day of the emperor and the empress,

36
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,770
the emperor can announce an amnesty.

37
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,590
Then Mai can live.

38
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,710
What do you think,

39
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,760
Prime Minister Lin?

40
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,910
I hope the day of you ascending the throne

41
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,510
is also your wedding day.

42
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,750
Then there will be two things worth celebrating,

43
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,950
and the world will celebrate together.

44
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,110
Long live the emperor.

45
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,110
Long live

46
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,550
the emperor.

47
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,350
Aren't you an invincible general from Beimo?

48
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,279
Why are you being imprisoned here?

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,670
I told you I would come to you.

50
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,269
I'll definitely come to you.

51
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,680
We really are destined to meet.

52
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,110
We meet so soon.

53
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,650
If I can't take you back this time,

54
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,120
I don't need to go back to Beimo either.

55
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,510
I'm wondering

56
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,130
if you asked someone to bring me here.

57
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,530
General Chang, if you want to die,

58
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,310
don't get me implicated.

59
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,200
When I was trying to make eye contact with you just now,

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
what were you looking at?

61
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:53,770
Marshal Shang,

62
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,510
if we refused to promise

63
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,150
Prime Minister Lin just now,

64
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,630
Mai

65
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,590
will definitely die.

66
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,070
We should focus on

67
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,870
what's important and urgent.

68
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,430
Why are you suddenly getting married tomorrow?

69
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,710
We don't have enough time to prepare for it.

70
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,230
Miss Lin, this is unfair.

71
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,020
Don't say that.

72
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,990
His Majesty entered the palace not long ago.

73
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,110
He has many things to deal with.

74
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,910
Of course we should make it simple.

75
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,040
How can he be distracted because of me?

76
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,030
You're right.

77
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,580
Bring me wine.

78
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,890
Your Majesty,

79
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,070
you should stop drinking.

80
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,510
It's bad for your health.

81
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,110
What's bad for my health?

82
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,320
If you don't bring me wine,

83
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,750
I'll kill you.

84
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,110
Okay.

85
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,730
According to the emperor's edict,

86
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,190
the world is set,

87
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,390
and everything is in harmony.

88
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,300
The country is prosperous,

89
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,730
and there is a sign of developing better.

90
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,630
I heard that Zerou, the daughter of the Lin family,

91
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,800
is polite, cautious,

92
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,190
and gentle.

93
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,220
With the gold edict and seal,

94
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,000
I appoint you as the empress.

95
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,240
The responsible department shall deal with the matter.

96
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,760
Respect this.

97
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

98
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:23,750
Mai.

99
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,590
I'm going to tell you something.

100
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,650
Don't be sad.

101
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,390
I think

102
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,380
it was Shang Yizhi who put you in prison.

103
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,610
When they interrogated me these days,

104
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,150
they didn't ask anything about Beimo's military information.

105
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,990
They

106
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,200
only asked me

107
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,460
whether we have colluded with each other.

108
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,430
Except Shang Yizhi,

109
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,360
who else do you think would be interested in our business?

110
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,420
You think too much.

111
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,750
He won't do anything bad to me.

112
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,850
Let me tell you.

113
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,020
It must be Shang Yizhi.

114
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,510
Behave yourself.

115
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,150
Take him away.

116
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:25,670
Move.

117
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,290
Marshal Mai, how are you?

118
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,160
Thanks to Prime Minister Lin,

119
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,830
I sleep well every day.

120
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,880
Peace vegetables

121
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,360
and last wine.

122
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,610
You think too much.

123
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,840
General Chang.

124
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,070
It's you.

125
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,640
The emperor is getting married tonight.

126
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,790
He doesn't have time for you.

127
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,470
He asked me to come here.

128
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,720
Congratulations.

129
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,710
Go ahead.

130
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,250
What's the matter?

131
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,480
The army of Beimo is now approaching Jingyang Pass

132
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,470
and is ready to attack Nanxia.

133
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,900
What do you want?

134
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,340
If you promise that you will withdraw your army,

135
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,870
we will release you immediately.

136
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,900
Release me?

137
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,560
Why?

138
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,920
The emperor doesn't want to see the people in misery.

139
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,550
So he decided

140
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,990
to release you.

141
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,200
If Beimo doesn't have a reason to send troops,

142
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,750
the dispute will be resolved.

143
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,950
General Chang,

144
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,470
what do you think?

145
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,910
It's not difficult to withdraw the army.

146
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,970
But what about Mai?

147
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,060
Don't worry.

148
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,460
Mai

149
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,710
will surely be fine.

150
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:54,990
Okay.

151
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,390
I promise you.

152
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,510
Today is the wedding day of the emperor and the empress.

153
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,400
This is the wedding wine for you.

Boss,

172
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,710
give me a bottle of wine.

173
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,350
Okay.

174
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,910
30 coins a bottle.

175
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,490
I'm going to get it for you.

176
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:05,990
Take it.

177
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,870
Sir, goodbye.

178
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,160
General Mai.

179
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,830
Would you like a bottle of wine?

180
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,650
Give me a bottle.

181
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,200
Okay.

182
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,930
30 coins.

183
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,880
I'll come next time.

184
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,350
General Mai,

185
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,450
the wine is free of charge.

186
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,990
Everyone in Shengdu City knows General Mai.

187
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,790
Besides, today is the wedding day of the new emperor.

188
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,250

198
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,070
I'm afraid

199
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,980
I have to spend the night in the Imperial Study tonight.

200
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,310
If you really are tired,

201
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,570

202

Your Majesty,

203
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,710
I'm the empress but I'm not capable enough.

204
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,550
I just want to share your burdens.

205
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,150
I will never compete for your favor

206

or interfere in court affairs.

If you leave now,

208
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,400

209
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,910

Your Majesty,

213
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,870

214
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,050

216
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,400

217
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,030

218
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,450

377
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,960
I have nothing and no one to worry about.

378
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,290
My home is wherever I am.

379
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,560
Besides,

380
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,320
I'm not going to Beimo because of you.

381
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,310
Mai, where are you going?

382
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,660
I won't let you leave.

383
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,060
No matter where I go, it has nothing to do with you.

384
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,590
Let's go.

385
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,510
Mai,

386
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,040
if you insist on leaving,

387
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,140
you'll have to step over my body.

388
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:36,740
Bai,

389
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,260
step aside.

390
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,990
I can't do that.

391
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,530
If you leave,

392
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,880
what should the Zhenbei Army and Qi Yu do?

393
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,070
If you stay,

394
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,240
I'll let him go.

395
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,960
Otherwise,

396
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,070
you'll have to step over my body.

397
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,050
You leave.

398
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,510
Mai,

399
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,280
take this.

400
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,510
This is the passport.

401
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,590
When you go to Beimo next time,

402
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,340
you can find me with it.

403
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,030
Thank you.

404
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,000
If you dare to make her feel wronged again,

405
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,730
I will definitely lead an army to destroy Nanxia.

406
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:37,980
Let him go.

407
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,240
Your Majesty,

408
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,110
I think this is very strange.

409
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,950
Everyone in Duke Sheng's Mansion was murdered

410
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,230
by Beimo people a few years ago.

411
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,030
No one in the mansion survived.

412
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,710
Everyone in Shengdu City knows about this.

413
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,710
Now, a daughter suddenly appeared.

414
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,150
Your Majesty, please investigate it thoroughly.

415
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,140
Your Majesty,

416
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,960
what Minister Cai said is right.

417
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,250
Maisui disguised herself as a man to join the army.

418
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,840
She violated the law of Nanxia.

419
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,050
She should be executed according to the law.

420
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,640
Maybe she is pretending to be the daughter of a meritorious official

421
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,430
because she's afraid of death.

422
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,440
You are not the only ones who are shocked by it.

423
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,340
When I knew about it,

424
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,020
I couldn't believe it either.

425
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,560
But I've investigated it thoroughly.

426
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,140
Mai's real name is Han Maisui.

427
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,830
She is indeed the only daughter of Duke Sheng.

428
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,080
Everyone in Duke Sheng's Mansion was slaughtered.

429
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,920
The murderer

430
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,240
was the godson of Duke Sheng

431
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,860
and a spy of Beimo.

432
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,870
He is Chen Qi, currently Marshal of Beimo.

433
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,610
Mai was little and hid in the dark.

434
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,040
That's why she survived.

435
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,580
But it hasn't been easy for her

436
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,000
these years.

437
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,710
She hid her identity

438
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,719
and disguised herself as a man to hide in the army.

439
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,389
She just wants

440
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,880
to meet Chen Qi again

441
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,480
on the battlefield someday

442
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,310
to avenge her family members.

443
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,469
Your Majesty,

444
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,130
she has this kind of spirit as a woman.

445
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,590
She is admirable.

446
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,449
Your Majesty,

447
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,429
Maisui is indeed very filial.

448
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:35,350
But the law of Nanxia is not a joke.

449
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,040
Heaven, Earth, the emperor, family members, and mentors.

450
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,370
The emperor comes before family members.

451
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,830
She has to be punished for deceiving the emperor.

452
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,280
If every woman takes her as an example,

453
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,730
what's the use of military rules?

454
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,420
Your Majesty,

455
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,710
that's right.

456
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:51,590
Besides,

457
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,860
if other countries know

458
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,679
Nanxia let women kill enemies on the battlefield,

459
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,470
no matter what the reason is,

460
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,750
other countries would think Nanxia's men are incompetent

461
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,950
and weak.

462
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,300
Nanxia will lose face.

463
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,870
Your Majesty,

464
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,230
I have something to say.

465
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,310
Please go ahead.

466
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,130
What Prime Minister Lin and Minister Bao said

467
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,300
is reasonable.

468
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,800
But among all the people here today,

469
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,510
the only ones who saw Mai kill enemies

470
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,180
are His Majesty and me.

471
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,070
Maisui

472
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,860
is a woman,

473
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,160
but she has never been afraid during war.

474
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,290
On the battlefield,

475
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,010
she started from a nobody.

476
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,170
She's fought her way

477
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,820
to get what she has got.

478
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,800
She deserves

479
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,110
the reputation of Little God of War

480
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,270
and has never tarnished the reputation of Duke Sheng's Mansion.

481
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,830
How dare you!

482
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,230
How can a country's etiquette and law be a joke?

483
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,940
I've already

484
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,300
relieved Mai of her position as Marshal of the Zhenbei Army.

485
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,070
It's just that...

486
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,350
Duke Sheng and his wife

487
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,570
made contributions to Nanxia.

488
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,470
We should respect the deceased.

489
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,560
How about this?

490
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,860
I'll reluctantly make Mai a consort

491
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,390
to help them take care of her.

492
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,140
In this way, Duke Sheng and his wife

493
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,820
can rest in peace.

494
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,890
Your Majesty,

495
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,230
but the army

496
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,120
needs a marshal.

497
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,140
You are right.

498
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,860
I'll let Mu Bai and Tang Shaoyi

499
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,700
handle military affairs temporarily.

500
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,240
What do you think?

501
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,990
Your Majesty, you are wise.

502
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,390
Look. His Majesty obviously came prepared.

503
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,200
Could it be that Maisui and His Majesty

504
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,980
fell in love long ago?

505
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,070
Looks like His Majesty is really affectionate.

506
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,210
His Majesty and Maisui have strong feelings for each other.

507
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,890
Then the empress...

508
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,960
Don't worry.

509
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,730
I cultivated my daughter myself.

510
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,590
How can an orphan outshine her?

511
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,450
I'm sorry.

512
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,520
Her Majesty is virtuous and pretty.

513
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,020
A vulgar woman who only knows swords and spears is no match for her.

514
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,820
That's right.

515
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,910
No matter how strong she is,

516
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,230
she's still a woman.

517
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,110
She can't make a big deal out of it.

518
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,550
Just ask someone to keep an eye on her.

519
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,910
Your Majesty, why did you tell everyone

520
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,840
Mai's true identity just now?

521
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,330
The current situation is still unclear,

522
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,970
and now we are in need of manpower.

523
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,590
Your Majesty, you acted a bit recklessly.

524
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,510
Everyone knows

525
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,380
Duke Sheng was killed by Beimo people.

526
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,310
Now that I've told everyone

527
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,510
Mai's true identity,

528
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,110
she can no longer go back to Beimo.

529
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,120
What story

530
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,660
are you going to tell me this time?

531
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,530
I'm not going to tell you a story this time.

532
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,220
Chen Qi,

533
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,540
you've grown up.

534
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,360
It's time to tell you the truth.

535
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,230
About what happened back then, how much do you still remember?

536
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,990
I was little at that time.

537
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,110
I vaguely remember

538
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,110
that was the first time I went to battle with my parents.

539
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,090
But my father was defeated

540
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,230
and my parents died tragically.

541
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,190
Later...

542
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,740
my godfather saved me.

543
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,950
Do you want to avenge your parents?

544
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,530
How should I avenge them?

545
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,640
How can I find my enemies?

546
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,170
Your enemies are the Chang family in Beimo

547
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,530
and your godfather, Han Huaicheng, Nanxia's Duke Sheng.

548
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,950
The heads of your parents

549
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,480
were chopped off by Han Huaicheng himself.

550
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,040
Impossible.

551
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,550
You are lying.

552
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,760
Do you still recognize this?

553
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,250
This belonged to my father.

554
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,630
I was there during the battle.

555
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,430
Your father entrusted this to me before he died.

556
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,880
He asked me to give it to you and tell you everything

557
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,630
at a proper time.

558
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,350
Then our friendship would be worth it.

559
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,960
Han Huaicheng won the battle

560
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,450
and returned with a great victory.

561
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,450
The Chang family in Beimo took away the Chen family's reputation

562
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,290
and rose rapidly in the army.

563
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,680
But you

564
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,870
were like an abandoned dog.

565
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,490
You accepted your enemy as your father.

566
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,510
Stop talking.

567
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,310
Go kill Han Huaicheng.

568
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,910
Give it to me.

569
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,260
Your Majesty,

570
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,430
it's late.

571
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,170
Have some snacks and rest early.

572
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,640
Leave it here.

573
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,880
Is this a puppy?

574
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,100
It's so cute.

575
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,970
Can you give it to me?
