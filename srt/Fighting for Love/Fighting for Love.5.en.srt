Dong, get a team to carry the arrows.

15

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,950
Go into the city and find some help.

Big Bro.

28
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,110
Casualties among our men are occurring too rapidly.

29
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,550
They won't last long.

30
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,310
Get some strong men in the jail as a backup.

31
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,430
Then we can resist for a while longer.

32
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,870

will be pardoned.

46
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,230
I do.

47
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,630
My name is Mai. I was born in Nanxia,

48
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,360
and I will die with a Nanxia spirit.

49

It's my duty to serve the country.

I do.

51
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,990
I've never experienced such humiliation.

52
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,950
If you are a man, go!

53
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,190

let's kick out the Beimo bastards!

Kick out the Beimo bastards!

My Lord.

72
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,390
With the current situation, we simply cannot hold our ground.

73
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,470
Even if we cannot,

74
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,670
we have to.

75
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,909
If we give up,

76
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,570
everyone in the city will die.

77
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,360
We don't have enough manpower and weapons.

78
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,220
This is putting lives on the line.

79
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,550
Dong, take someone to the warehouse

80
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,940
and send out the weapons.

81
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,540
Yes.

82
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,190
Tang Shaoyi, go to the jail

83
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,430
to protect Li Erniu.

84
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,940
Go now.

85
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,309
If Li Erniu falls into the hands of the people in Beimo,

86
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,909
more of our people will die.

87
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,830
Go!

88
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,920
Guard the city gate.

89
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,830
Don't let anyone out of the city.

90
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,070
Go down the city tower and guard the city gate.

91
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's go.

[Yinbao]

93
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,780
On the battlefield, each of us serves our own master.

94
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,460
I respect you for being a true man.

95
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,190
I promise you

96
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,080
I won't hurt the people in the city.

97
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,130
Rest in peace.

98
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,860
Enter the city.

Young man,

102
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,330
I'm begging you.

103
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,700
My name is Xu Yong.

104
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,110
I have a daughter named Xu Xiu'er.

105
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,570
Please save her.

106
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,400
My house is the first house on the left in Ximeihua Alley.

107
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,180
Please save her.

108
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,060
Please save her.

109
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,780
Please save her.

110
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,640
Okay.

111
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,880
Why aren't you leaving?

112
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,110
I have nowhere to go.

113
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,550
The whole Beimo is looking for you.

114
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,290
As long as you are willing,

115
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,370
you can easily obtain a high-ranking position and generous rewards.

116
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,570
I'm from Beimo.

117
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,950
I escaped to Nanxia

118
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,570
because I didn't want to cause more deaths because of my invention.

119
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,930
If I aimed to obtain a high-ranking position and generous rewards,

120
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,200
you wouldn’t see me.

121
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,120
I don't kill,

122
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,000
yet someone dies in my stead.

123
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,950
I don't want to help the people in Beimo kill people,

124
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,030
nor do I want Nanxia people to kill my fellow countrymen

125
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,180
with my invention.

126
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,010
Although you burned the drawings,

127
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,190
you are the living drawings.

128
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,080
Kill me.

129
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Although you're from Beimo,

130
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,990
I can't kill you.

131
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,640
How about this?

132
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,920
I'll take you to break through the encirclement.

133
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,810
If we break out, we'll live.

134
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,530
If we can't,

135
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,570
I'll kill you first.

136
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,190
What do you think?

137
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,470
Mother.

138
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,360
Mother.

139
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,110
I'm scared.

140
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,630
It's okay.

141
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,570
Don't cry.

142
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,550
Erya! Erya! Erya!

143
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,670
Thank you.

144
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,720
Ma'am.

145
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,230
Do you know how to get to Ximeihua Alley?

146
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,550
At the end of this road,

147
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,270
on the left side, there's Wang's Iron Shop.

148
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,950
It's the third alley behind the iron shop.

149
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,060
There's a big tree.

150
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,050
Be careful.

151
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,190
Don't go.

152
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,430
Beimo soldiers are all over there.

153
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,030
Don't go.

154
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,710
Block the city.

155
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,430
Search Li Erniu with all your might.

156
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:20,990
Yes.

157
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,160
Let's go.

158
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,310
Wait.

159
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,840
Please save my husband.

160
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,270
Madam.

161
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,910
He's gone.

162
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,670
Let's go.

163
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,470
Madam.

164
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,990
Madam.

165
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,190
Let's go.

166
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,600
Don't come over.

167
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,870
Miss.

168
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,470
You're quite strong.

169
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,270
Don't come near me!

170
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,300
Don't come near me!

171
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,780
Don't come over.

172
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,670
Stop screaming. It's all right now.

173
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,620
Stop screaming.

174
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,640
People from Beimo are outside.

175
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,430
All right.

176
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,890
Enough.

177
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Are you Xu Xiu'er?

178
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,200
Your father asked me to give this to you.

179
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,080
Where is my father?

180
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,070
Why isn't my father coming?

181
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,400
Where is my father?

182
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,990
Xiu'er.

183
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,990
I want to find my father.

184
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,230
Don't go. Don't...

185
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,390
Xiu'er, don't go.

186
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,820
Xiu'er!

187
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,320
I will take you out of the city.

188
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,980
I will take you out of the city.

189
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,750
Alright, stop screaming.

190
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,410
I will take you out of the city.

191
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,650
No.

192
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,510
Xiu'er, do you want to find your father?

193
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,250
Put the knife down before you go.

194
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,230
Here.

195
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,170
-This way.
-Stop!

196
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,160
Stop! Stop!

197
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,550
Calm down.

198
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,610
The General said not to hurt Li Erniu.

199
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,040
Don't forget what you said.

200
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,590
Kill me first if you can't defeat them.

201
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,470
Don't worry.

202
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,670
Let's go.

203
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,870
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

204
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,030
Let's go.

205
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,850
Do you want some water?

206
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,710
No.

207
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,390
Xiu'er.

208
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,670
Xiu'er, don't be afraid.

209
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,060
We're on the same side.

210
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,480
His name is Li Erniu.

211
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,480
Sir, you are...

212
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,470
I'm Tang Shaoyi, Commandant of Yinbao City.

213
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,390
Thank you for saving me.

214
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,040
You’re welcome.

215
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,020
I’m Mai.

216
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,830
I’m new here.

217
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,230
Her name is Xu Xiu'er.

218
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,240
Her father was a warden.

219
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,750
Xu Xiu'er?

220
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,890
Is your father Mr. Xu Yong?

221
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,790
Where is he?

222
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,800
It's all my fault.

223
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,700
If it weren't for the whip arrow manual,

224
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,360
Warden Xu wouldn’t have died.

225
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,390
So many people wouldn’t have died in Yinbao City.

226
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,590
When I was in Beimo,

227
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,150
I knew Chang Yuqing.

228
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,750
Since Chang Yuqing

229
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,550
knew that our family had the whip arrow manual,

230
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,950
he sent people to ask for it again and again.

231
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,280
My father refused to give it to him.

232
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,710
He killed my whole clan.

233
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,830
I escaped with the manual.

234
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,360
But I had no one to rely on in Nanxia.

235
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,480
So I tried to

236
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,630
put myself in prison.

237
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,840
The news was leaked.

238
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,960
Chang Yuqing knew I was in prison.

239
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,790
He failed to break into the prison,

240
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,120
so he killed so many people in Yinbao City.

241
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,990
I want to kill him now.

242
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,790
Is Chang Yuqing

243
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,230
the one who came to see you in the prison that day?

244
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,830
Yes.

245
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,630
I fought him before.

246
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,630
I stole his pass

247
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,060
to enter the Yinbao City.

248
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,230
The spy I told you was him.

249
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,030
Li Erniu.

250
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,640
Is Chang Yu Qing a general in Beimo?

251
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,750
Yes.

252
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,200
Chang Yuqing comes from a noble family in Beimo.

253
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,430
The Chang family has produced

254
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,230
a total of 37 generals.

255
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,750
Chang Yuqing is a novice of the Chang family.

256
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,710
He led the army alone when he was 18

257
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,630
and wiped out the bandits' hideout that had been in Beimo for years.

258
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,150
After that, he made many achievements

259
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,230
with his intelligence and bravery.

260
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,290
At such a young age,

261
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,640
he's already a famous general known to four nations.

262
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,830
I see.

263
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,430
No matter what, we can't stay in Yinbao.

264
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,660
We have to find a way to escape.

265
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,500
There are Beimo soldiers outside.

266
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,470
How do we get out?

267
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,070
We will fight our way out,

268
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,760
otherwise, we'll just die.

269
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,100
I have an idea.

270
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,190
Brother Tang.

271
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,960
Find some clothes of the Beimo people.

272
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,910
Who ordered to sack the city?

273
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,950
General.

274
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,550
The Marshal once ordered

275
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,550
that the soldiers and officers attacking the city

276
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,130
could do anything they wanted on the day the city was breached.

277
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,630
The soldiers have worked hard for so long.

278
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,030
They should be rewarded.

279
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,720
I don't care what others' soldiers will do,

280
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,370
but my soldiers can't do this.

281
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,530
As long as you are in my army,

282
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,310
you should obey my order.

283
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,710
If you are not convinced,

284
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,150
you can tell on me to him.

285
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,830
I dare not.

286
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,110
Pass my order.

287
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,120
From now on, no slaughter or looting is allowed.

288
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,380
Anyone who disobeys will be executed immediately.

289
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,230
Yes.

290
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,650
Lieutenant Jiang.

291
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,190
Mind your soldiers.

292
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,430
Send a message for me.

293
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,020
My Chang family

294
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,670
is not something that can be shaken by a commoner marshal who has just climbed up

295
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,070
from humble beginnings.

296
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,830
In the future, refrain from displaying

297
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,750
such disgraceful tactics.

298
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,750
Here.

299
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,450
Keep up.

300
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,260
Looks like something happened.

301
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,160
We're late.

302
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,710
Forget it. Let’s go.

303
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,460
Is that Mai?

304
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,430
Mai.

305
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,390
He's my friend.

306
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,630
You're late.

307
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,610
My place has been looted by soldiers.

308
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,760
There's nothing left.

309
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,020
As long as you are fine.

310
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:23,910
Mr. Four.

311
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,990
We want to go out of the city.

312
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,900
Please help us.

313
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,870
All four of you are leaving the city?

314
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,710
All of us.

315
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,570
How can I help you?

316
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,600
Make me a token of the Beimo people.

317
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,010
It's war time now. The city is blocked.

318
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,810
It's hard to get out of the city with just one token.

319
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,170
Ordinary people

320
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,510
with ordinary tokens can't pass.

321
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,470
But this token is different.

322
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,320
If it were Chang...

323
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,590
Chang...

324
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,050
Chang Yuqing.

325
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,350
Where if it's Chang Yuqing's token?

326
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,400
You mean...

327
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,280
General.

328
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,360
We can't stop here anymore.

329
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,920
The Marshal ordered us to attack Qinshan's guard post.

330
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,620
We've been here for a long time.

331
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,350
I'm afraid we'll miss the opportunity.

332
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,510
I have my own plan.

333
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,300
General.

334
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,760
The Marshal has a grudge against you.

335
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,260
If you're like this, I'm afraid he might seize the opportunity to get a handle on it.

336
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,460
Li Erniu.

337
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,270
I'm determined to get him.

338
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,150
General.

339
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:29,910
Shut up!

340
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,070
General.

341
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,240
One of our troops has found Li Erniu.

342
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,310
Where?

343
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,890
The soldiers found

344
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,150
Li Erniu escaped with two men and a woman.

345
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,150
The other two have been identified.

346
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,230
But no one recognizes this woman.

347
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,480
[Warrant]

348
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,150
This thief again!

349
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,630
Moyu.

350
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,350
Yes.

351
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,500
Knock on every door.

352
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,510
Tomorrow morning, make sure to gather

353
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:09,910
the townspeople in the city square.

354
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,550
But...

355
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,030
There are many people in the city...

356
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,510
Go to the scouting camp to get help.

357
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,920
Yes.

358
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,650
What are you waiting for?

359
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,350
Go.

360
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,590
Yes.

361
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,370
Disguising oneself as Chang Yuqing?

362
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,260
Are you crazy?

363
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,100
With your slim arms and legs,

364
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,620
you'll be easily exposed.

365
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,220
How could I be the one to do it?

366
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,820
You should be the one to do it.

367
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,350
Brother Tang.

368
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,820
Haven't you noticed?

369
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,110
Don't you think you look

370
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,830
a bit similar to Chang Yuqing?

371
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,040
Do you know?

372
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,490
The black cavalry is Chang Yuqing's confidant army.

373
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,770
How can they not see it?

374
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,710
It's because it's his confidant army

375
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,350
that no one dares to suspect

376
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,890
someone would disguise as Chang Yuqing.

377
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,510
Mr. Four.

378
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,980
We just need to make it 60% alike.

379
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,430
That's a good idea.

380
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,780
But I've only heard of his name but never seen him.

381
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,350
I've seen him.

382
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,190
Me too.

383
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,370
To dress up to look 60% like him,

384
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,060
the emphasis is on a similar appearance.

385
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,020
The details are not important.

386
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,900
Chang Yuqing is a renowned general across four nations.

387
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,080
[Yinbao]

388
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,310
He wields a long spear, wears a mask,

389
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,990
rides a white horse, and dons silver armor.

390
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,110
The mask and silver armor are essential.

391
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,290
To craft silver armor, assemble bamboo components

392
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,430
and connect them using hemp rope layer by layer.

393
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Then paste paper on the bamboo armor

394
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,410
to make simple paper armor.

395
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,990
Add a layer of fine silver pound on it.

396
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,940
Layer by layer, stick and flatten.

397
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,610
Not bad, right?

398
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,140
The silver armor is now about 80% similar to his.

399
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,090
Only 80%?

400
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,890
What about the remaining 20%?

401
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,570
The remaining 20%

402
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,290
will depend on the cover of the night.

403
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,160
The moon is dim in the night.

404
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,730
In such a short time,

405
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,610
achieving an 80% resemblance

406
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,320
is not an easy task.

407
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,510
No.

408
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,790
Now the whole Nanxia is related to him.

409
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,320
I can't take risks with him.

410
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,870
Who asked you to take risks with him?

411
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,330
Everyone,

412
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,870
I mean

413
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,150
to have a group of Beimo soldiers

414
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,270
armed with real weapons

415
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,600
personally escort us out of the city.

416
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,700
What are you thinking?

417
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,070
How could Beimo soldiers armed with real weapons

418
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,270
escort us?

419
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,980
To achieve this, you have to listen to me.

420
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,030
These three are wanted criminals of our Beimo Army.

421
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,810
They are hiding in the city now.

422
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,840
If we find them quickly, we will retreat.

423
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,440
We won't offend Yinbao.

424
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,310
If we don't find them today,

425
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,200
30% of the people in the city will be killed at this moment tomorrow.

426
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,290
If we can't find them within three days,

427
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,000
we will leave no one alive in Yinbao.

428
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,440
What should we do?

429
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,630
Your lives are in your hands.

430
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,150
Don't miss the opportunity.

431
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,690
Let me see.

432
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,550
Let me see.

433
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,150
Let me see.

434
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,630
Find them.

435
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,230
Let's go and find them.

436
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,410
[Warrant]

437
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,680
This armor doesn't fit.

438
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,130
It's not even tightened here.

439
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,200
Why are you so much fatter than him?

440
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,230
What are you talking about?

441
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,830
Martial arts practitioners are all so strong.

442
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,490
Put your stomach back.

443
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,440
I can't.

444
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,260
I'll find a rope to tighten around your stomach.

445
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,320
Go over there. Go.

446
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,390
Go that way.

447
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,020
Hide!

448
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,180
Hurry up!

449
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,270
Hurry up.

450
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,270
Let's go in.

451
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,290
Come on. Hurry up.

452
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,870
Mother.

453
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,350
It's my brother.

454
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,090
Auntie.

455
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,150
It's me, Auntie.

456
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,910
Big Bro.

457
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,290
Put the knife away.

458
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,850
Don't scare the child.

459
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:39,780
Girl.

460
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,660
Haven't eaten anything for days?

461
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:46,860
Here.

462
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,490
I'll get you some delicious food.

463
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,480
Auntie.

464
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,300
This is all we have.

465
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,680
Give them all to the child.

466
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,000
Thank you.

467
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,600
So what if she eats it today?

468
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,389
She will die tomorrow.

469
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,920
Why?

470
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,320
The general of Beimo said he wanted to find you.

471
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,540
If they can't find you tomorrow,

472
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,940
they will kill 30% of the people in the city.

473
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,010
If they can't find you in three days, they'll kill all the people in the city.

474
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,340
I'm not afraid of death.

475
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,650
But Erya is still young.

476
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,810
I don't want her to die.

477
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,670
I'll go.
