[Episode 2]

4
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,150
I'm not your father.

5
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,789
What do you mean?

6
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,210
You were adopted by my wife and me.

7
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,640
Your real name is Qi Huan.

8
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,680
You were born in the 37th year during the reign of Emperor Yongxi.

9
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,600
Your father was the former Crown Prince,

10
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,490
Qi Xian.

11
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,370
How is that possible?

12
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,229
Father.

13
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,030
Your biological mother was a concubine in the Crown Prince's Mansion.

14
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,430
When you were born, there was a rebellion in the palace.

15
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,829
All the people in the Crown Prince's Mansion were killed.

16
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,590
You were saved by the midwife.

17
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,390
I'm actually your aunt.

18
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,440
Why did you hide this thing from me?

19
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,130
His Majesty has been looking for you.

20
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,470
In order to protect you,

21
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,470
the marquis and I have really racked our brains.

22
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,720
But recently,

23
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,150
my elder brother is getting more and more suspicious.

24
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,750
He killed many young people

25
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,350
who were born in the 37th year during the reign of Emperor Yongxi.

26
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,850
It shows that...

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,990
It shows that he's getting more and more determined

28
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,590
to kill you.

29
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,230
I finally understood

30
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,080
why you had asked

31
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,130
those three masters to teach me self-defense skills all the time.

32
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,710
Yes.

33
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,110
The marquis and I will die before you anyway.

34
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,030
I need to let you learn how to protect yourself.

35
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,180
Then why did you hide the truth from me until today?

36
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,150
Because

37
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,590
I've had a relapse of my old disease.

38
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,190
I'll die soon.

39
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:32,620
Father.

40
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,290
After I die,

41
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:39,430
the Huainan Army will definitely be taken over by the imperial power again.

42
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,390
Then the Marquis Dingnan’s Mansion can't protect you.

43
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,430
Your mother and I have discussed it and made a decision.

44
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,670
We'll send you away from Shengdu as soon as possible.

45
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
I can't leave.

46
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,670
You two...

47
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,880
You two racked your brains

48
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,240
in order to protect me.

49
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,150
At this critical moment,

50
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,790
if I escape alone,

51
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,010
what a bad son I'll be.

52
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,650
Yizhi,

53
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,920
if you don't leave,

54
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,630
your mother will be implicated.

55
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,080
Sir.

56
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,110
Were you waiting in the courtyard just now?

57
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,310
I went to the front of the house to deliver a message for His Highness just now.

58
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,770
I wasn't in the courtyard.

59
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,550
What can I do for you, sir?

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,200
Nothing.

61
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,630
Where is His Highness?

62
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,880
Sir,

63
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,310
His Highness is in the front yard.

64
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,550
He asked me to take you to stay in the inner dwellings.

65
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,310
Please.

66
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,750
Thank you.

67
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,300
This yard is really big.

I've finished taking a bath.

73
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,690
I feel so comfortable.

74
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,770
The clothes fit me well, too.

75
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,640
Great.

76
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,410
Your eyes are red.

77
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,750
No.

78
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,630
Did you cry?

79
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,230
My father is sick.

80
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,590
Is it serious?

81
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,010
Marquis Dingnan is a good man.

82
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,350
He will be blessed by God.

83
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,950
He will be safe.

84
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,240
Really?

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,550
Yes.

86

Go to the Imperial Hospital.

91
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,340
I've asked him to come here.

92
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,510
He's outside the hall right now.

93
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,650
Greetings, Your Majesty.

94
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,230
You did a good job.

What rewards do you want to get from me?

96
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,100
I dare not ask for any rewards.

97
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,020
Your Majesty, considering that I'm so loyal,

98
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,930
please allow me to retire and go back to my hometown.

99
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,760
Just go.

100
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,950

Sister,

108
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,440
I came here late at night.

109
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,700
You don't mind, do you?

110
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,350
You're busy with state affairs,

111
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,460
but you still found time to come here.

112
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,150
I'm very grateful.

113
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,230
Marquis Dingnan guarded

114

the southwest border for Nanxia for decades.

115
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,860
I thought

116
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,150
after I let him return to Shengdu,

117
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,830
he could enjoy his life with his family for a few years.

118
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,960
I didn't expect that a cold would kill him.

119
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:03,990
I...

120
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,470
feel sad.

121
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,030
You have a good son.

He will inherit the title

139

and be the director of the Etiquette Department in the Ministry of Rites.

At Yizhi's age,

146
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,950
he should learn to be mature.

Thank you, Prime Minister Lin.

160
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,440
His Majesty is very thoughtful towards your son.

161
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,670
But the way of being an official is very complicated.

162
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,560
Your son is a kind and simple boy.

163
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,470
I'm afraid he won't be competent to do the job well.

164
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,630
I'm also worried about this problem.

165
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,590
Marquis Shang has been a soldier for half his life.

166
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,450
He had great prestige in the army.

167
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,530
Your son is just like his father.

168
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,750

It's late now.

170
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,430

172
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,240
see Prime Minister Lin off.

Yes, Mother.

175
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,790
Just rest in peace.

176
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,150
I will try my best

177
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,990
to protect Yizhi.

178
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,790
You came so early.

179
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,280
Mai, let me tell you.

180
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,270
The main street is very lively today.

181
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,550
There is a funeral in Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

182
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,790
It’s a big scene.

183
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,110
The carriages of high-ranking officials and noble lords went there one after another.

184
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,270
Let's go and watch this big scene.

185
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,200
How ridiculous!

186
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,310
They're holding a funeral and you want to watch this big scene?

187
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,040
Did Aunite teach you like that?

188
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,290
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,690
Though we're poor,

190
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,110
we can't be ignorant of etiquette.

191
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,510
Don't be like this again.

192
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,140
I won't.

193
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,270
Is Mr. Mai here?

194
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,910
Yes.

195
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,670
Miss Lvli.

196
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,790
Mr. Mai.

197
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,550
Chunniang wants to see you.

198
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,150
Now?

199
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,230
Yes.

200
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,190
Yu, look after the house.

201
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,950
This bank note of 500 taels

202
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,230
is a gift from Princess Shenghua for showing thanks to you.

203
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,150
Her Highness said that

204
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,280
she should have thanked you in person.

205
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,600
But there has been a funeral in her mansion recently.

206
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,750
It's not convenient for her to see guests.

207
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,630
Please don't mind it, Mai.

208
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,010
I just want a piece of news.

209
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,430
I have no intention of attaching myself to Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

210
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,960
Why are you looking for him?

211
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,710
Because he owes me money.

212
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,600
He owes me a lot of money.

213
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,710
I must find him.

214
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,600
Alright.

215
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,490
I won't ask you the reason.

216
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,670
However, I've been in charge of

217
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,190
exchanging information within the borders of Nanxia.

218
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,430
I'm not able to

219
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,630
help you solve your problem.

220
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,510
Do you mean that Chen Qi is not in Nanxia?

221
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,710
Take this stuff

222
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,270
and go north to Yinbao City after you leave Shengdu.

223
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,430
Find someone called Mr. Ghost Hand Four.

224
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,470
He'll tell you what you want to know.

225
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,950
Mr. Ghost Hand Four?

226
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,750
Please deliver a message for me.

227
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,790
Tell him it's a long journey.

228
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,550
I have no time to see him.

229
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,070
I feel very guilty.

230
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,440
Thank you, Miss Chunniang.

231
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,430
I've kept it in mind.

232
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,790
See you.

233
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,790
Take care, Miss.

234
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,790
What's the matter?

235
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,430
Your Majesty.

236
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,750
Princess Shenghua

237
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,950
kowtowed at every step outside the palace and asked to see you.

238
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,950
It was also the time for the officials to go to the imperial court.

239
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,270
Many people saw it.

240
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,270
She wants to force me to fulfill her request.

241
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,710
Where is Shi Yuan?

242
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:23,240
Lord Shi has left the palace after receiving the decree.

243
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,060
Greetings, Brother.

244
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,310
You made yourself look like this.

245
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,670
Are you trying to force me to fulfill your request?

246
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,690
Please help me, Brother.

247
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,330
I know what you're asking for.

248
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,250
I've heard that a few days ago,

249
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,770
Yizhi met an assassin in the Emerald Pavilion.

250
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,690
You want him to leave Shengdu to avoid trouble?

251
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,170
My son and I are left alone after my husband's death. Please help us, Brother.

252
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,540
I will help you.

253
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,890
Get up.

254
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,420
After investigation, I've found that

255
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,740
the Emerald Pavilion is a spy den.

256
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,780
There are dozens of members there.

257
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,790
They conducted spy activities in the name of the brothel.

258
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,170
I can't believe that it has existed

259
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,450
for so long under my eyes.

260
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,750
Fortunately, I've just asked Shi Yuan to deal with it.

261
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,680
Shi Yuan is highly skilled at martial arts,

262
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,610
and is ruthless while carrying out his missions.

263
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,710
He is indeed the best candidate for eliminating spies.

264
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,640
Don't worry.

265
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,980
Shi Yuan will never show mercy

266
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,080
for those female spies.

267
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,190
I can't believe that Lord Shi came here personally.

268
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,250
It's the honor of the Emerald Pavilion to have you here.

269
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,270
Just the three of you?

270
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,560
The three of us are powerful enough to fight with you.

271
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,470
Brother.

272
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,880
Though Yizhi is the descendant of a general,

273
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,510
he has been weak and feeble

274
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,510
since childhood.

275
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,280
Now he is the only offspring of the Shang Family.

276
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,560
If he gets into danger again,

277
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,380
how can I face my husband

278
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,920
and the ancestors of the Shang Family in the future?

279
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,280
Hongluan!

280
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,150
You're a loving mother,

281
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,670
which makes me feel so touched.

282
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,710
I'll

283
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,030
withdraw the decree.

284
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,800
Yizhi

285
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,510
doesn't need to join the Ministry of Rites anymore.

286
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,470
Just let him be a general in a prefecture-level army

287
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,920
and receive training in the military camps.

288
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
What do you think?

289
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,780
Let me think about it.

290
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,390
Ask him to go to Qingzhou.

291
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,170
All Shang Wei's former subordinates are soldiers in Qingzhou.

292
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,350
In this way,

293
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,570
you can stop worrying.

294
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,570
Send Yizhi to Qingzhou as soon as possible.

295
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,710
I've arranged everything.

296
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,440
Someone there can protect him.

297
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,660
Brother, you're the one

298
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,340
who is so thoughtful.

299
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,870
Don't worry.

300
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,110
Masters,

301
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,670
today,

302
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,330
just let me be alone here

303
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,400
to keep you company.

304
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,070
[Memorial Tablet of My Dear Master Gu Chunniang]

305
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,670
Cheers.

306
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,990
[Memorial Tablet of My Dear Master Gu Chunniang]

307
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,020
I'm too immature.

308
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,870
In the past,

309
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,820
I always slacked off.

310
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,430
In the future,

311
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,850
I will get rid of this bad habit.

312
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,640
There's no future.

313
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,850
[Memorial Tablet of My Dear Master Gu Chunniang]

314
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,410
They told me not to cry.

315
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,450
When my masters see me cry,

316
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,250
they'll be sadder.

317
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,460
I'll stop crying.

318
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:13,610
[Memorial Tablet of My Dear Master Gu Chunniang]

319
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,520
Let's have a good drink.

320
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,710
Let's have one more cup of wine.

321
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,390
Yizhi.

322
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:24,990
Mother.

323
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,470
Chunniang was an extraordinary woman.

324
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,610
[Memorial Tablet of My Dear Master Gu Chunniang]

325
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,210
She wandered around the martial arts world for half of her life,

326
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,210
and experienced countless things.

327
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,470
To some extent, she watched you grow up.

328
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,610
Why would she blame you?

329
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,690
I'm the one who made her

330
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,360
lose her life.

331
00:24:59,270 --> 00:24:59,950
Mother.

332
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,870
Don't blame yourself.

333
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,800
My three masters' death

334
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,150
was caused by me.

335
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,750
So...

336
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,750
So you have to live on.

337
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,670
Living well

338
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,160
is the only best way to repay their kindness.

339
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,180
You're leaving for Qingzhou tomorrow.

340
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,890
Your father's former subordinates are all there.

341
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,030
You must remember one person.

342
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,190
His name is Xu Jing.

343
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,360
He has a good grasp of science and literature,

344
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,630
and is good at scheming.

345
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,910
As he was good at scheming,

346
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,710
your father asked me to hire him

347
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,400
and let him stay in Qingzhou.

348
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,960
And now you just need someone like him.

349
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,870
I can only feel relieved when he's by your side.

350
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,910
Mother, don't worry.

351
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,070
After I settle down,

352
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,190
I'll go to see Mr. Xu immediately.

353
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,870
The marquis and I

354
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,600
have been taking care of you

355
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,960
for so many years,

356
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,590
and we've tried our best.

357
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,080
The path of the future

358
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,830
will depend on yourself.

359
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,590
Mother, don't worry.

360
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,630
I will remember

361
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,070
every word you said.

362
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,670
Mai, do you have to go?

363
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,550
Our aunts don't want you to leave.

364
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,200
Tell them

365
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,630
not to worry.

366
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,960
I'll come back to visit you as soon as I finish my task.

367
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,660
I've bought some food and new tools.

368
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,890
There are some bank notes under the pillow.

369
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:19,860
Keep them well.

370
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,070
Give them to everyone later so that they can do some business.

371
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,930
It's better than doing an unstable job.

372
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,330
Mai, don’t worry.

373
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,990
I’ll do my best to finish the task you gave me.

374
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,910
Go back now.

375
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,080

376
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,160

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,950
I've asked Bai to select some strong guards

379

to escort you to Qingzhou.

380
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,030
Don't waste any time on the way.

381
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,030
Get to Qingzhou as soon as possible.

382
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,350
Besides, don't lose your temper on the way.

383
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,670
Don't let the guards be away from you.

384

00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,240
But Mother,

386
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,520
you have to take good care of yourself.

387

After you leave,

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,950
I don't know when we can...

389
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,710
I don't want anything else for the rest of my life.

390
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,510
As long as you are safe,

391
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,370
I'll be fine in every aspect.

392
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,110
Just go.

393
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,510

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,940
I've memorized every word

396

Wait for me to come back.

397

Isn't this the cavalry team from Marquis Dingnan's Mansion?

408
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,320
They have so many items.

409
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,990
There are so many attendants.

410
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,520
They must be traveling far.

411
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,550
But I wonder who's sitting inside the carriage.

412
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,680
It's Young Marquis.

413
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,610
Since Young Marquis is sitting inside there,

414
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,250
Mai,

415
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,230

For Shenghua's petty trick,

Go over there.

478
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,080
Constable Zhang, what kind of criminal did you catch this time?

479
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,000
He was so bold and pretended to be an officer to swindle the people in Shengdu.

480
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,969
Obviously, he didn't respect us at all.

481
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:13,870
Unfortunately, those several bastards ran away fast.

482
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,199
We caught only this man.

483
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,630

484
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,139
I'll confess. There's a mastermind behind my scheme.

Who is the mastermind?

486
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,630
He...

487
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,940
He made me so worried.

488
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,469
He escaped today.

489
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,790
But I know where he lives.

490
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,780
I'll take you to catch him tomorrow.

491
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,510
You'd better behave yourself.

492
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,100
If anything wrong happens again,

493
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,760
don't blame me for being rude.

494
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,460

497
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,469
Tie him to the yard.

498
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,620

This is my distant nephew.

Well...

508
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,110
It's not my uncle's fault.

509
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,460
Forget it. Since he's your relative,

510
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,290
just let him sleep in the yard.

511
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,590
Constable Zhang

512
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,150
is an inflexible man.

513
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,830
Sorry for making you suffer.

514
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,360
This is not suffering. I...

515
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,100
It's okay. I'll keep the door open for you.

Come on.

535
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,280
He's just a thief.

536
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,770
By the way, Uncle,

537
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,340
I'll pay for all the dishes and wine today.

538
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,080
Okay.

539
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,580
Please do me the honor of drinking this cup of wine.

540
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,380
Right.

542
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,120
If you don't drink too much, it won't hinder your work.

-Come on.
-Okay.

My Lord.

555
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,430
I drank too many cups of wine.

556
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,990
Go to the toilet now.

557
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,000
Come on, My Lord.

558
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,880
Come on.

559
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,450
Lower your voice.

560
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,270
Aren't you afraid everyone might hear you?

561
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,660
Well,

562
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,820
did you take what I had said as nonsense

563
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,920
and then forget it all?
