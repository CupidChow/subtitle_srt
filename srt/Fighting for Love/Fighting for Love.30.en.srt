Marshal Shang enters the palace,

154
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,490
and Zerou will enter the palace soon.

I'm going to sleep in the palace.

161
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,750

162
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,220
to enter the palace earlier

163
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,270
so that people can calm down.

164
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,830
Don't be sad anymore.

165
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
It's all my fault.

166
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,510
I killed Mother.

167
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,580
How could it be you?

168
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,000
It was Qi Min who did such thing

169
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,960
and killed Princess Shenghua.

170
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,870
Mother told me

171
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,910
to fight for the throne.

172
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,270
She also told me

173
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,820
Qi Jing intended to pass the throne to me.

174
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,330
It's just that I kept shrinking back.

175
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,750
That’s why Qi Min

176
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,660
had a chance.

177
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,350
You're not the one who gave him a chance.

178
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,360
It's Yu.

179
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,230
Qi Yu was adopted by Qi Jing

180
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,830
in order to be a crown prince.

181
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,210
He is not crown prince's biological son.

182
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,070
Qi Min found out about it.

183
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,250
That's why he was rampant

184
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,610
and tried to usurp the throne.

185
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,070
Qi Jing told me this before he died.

186
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,110
So,

187
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,590
don't blame yourself.

188
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,480
You just need to understand

189
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,240

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,510
please allow me to finish

194
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,240
the last thing for His Majesty.

195
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,670
I’m here to execute

196
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,600
the last order of the late emperor.

197
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,190
Go ahead.

198
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,230
I’m not in a hurry.

199
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,590
Mr. Shi, what’s your plan?

200
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,670
I’ve applied to resign and leave the palace.

201
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,240
But...

202
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,830
I've tried to kill the new emperor several times.

203
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,510
I have no expectations.

204
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,350
You didn't prepare a way out for yourself.

205
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,230
Since I have no choice,

206
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,310
I'll leave it to fate.

207
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,940
Do you have any unfulfilled wishes?

208
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,350
If I have a chance,

209
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,430
I’ll do my best to help you.

210
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,110
Actually, you don't have to do that.

211
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,470
His Majesty had a heavy mind.

212
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,070
He knew everything,

213
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,310
but he didn’t expect that I would go with him.

214
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,060
Mr. Shi.

215
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,390
Mr. Mu, why are you

216
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,910
seeing me at this moment?

217
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,510
I've taken care of the Longyin Guards.

218
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,450
His Majesty knows that you've been leading the Longyin Guards for many years.

219
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,320
You must have deep a connection with them.

220
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,780
So he sent me to inform you.

221
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,160
In the future,

222
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,630
he will treat them well.

223
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,000
Mr. Mu,

224
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,340
please thank His Majesty for me.

225
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,050
But such a trivial matter,

226
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,660
why are you coming yourself?

227
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,600
Mr. Shi asked to resign and leave the palace.

228
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,870
His Majesty felt sorry

229
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,870
so he asked me to send you off.

230
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,410
He wants to make sure you don't leave the palace alone.

231
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,070
Mr. Shi.

232
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,390
Please.

233
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,830
Mr. Shi.

234
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,840
This is all I can do.

235
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,430
Take care.

236
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,290
The emperor is infinitely gracious.

237
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,110
Thank you.

238
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,150
Mr. Mu.

239
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,240
I’m afraid that once I leave,

240
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,640
we will never meet again.

241
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:21,950
I

242
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,670
have some sincere words.

243
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,910
Mr. Shi, please go ahead.

244
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,050
The new emperor is still young

245
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,650
and still has a kind heart.

246
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,110
I wonder if the new emperor

247
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,310
can keep that after many years.

248
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,110
I’m lucky

249
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,680
to have such an ending.

250
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,720
Mr. Mu,

251
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,820
take care of yourself.

252
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,050
You worry too much.

253
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,430
We are

254
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,910
different.

255
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,940
The new emperor has moved into the palace.

256
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,100
Before entering the palace,

257
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,360
General Mai met the new emperor

258
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,090
in Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

259
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,430
They had a talk at Luoxia Pavilion for nearly an hour.

260
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,110
The content is still unknown.

261
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,910
What about that young kid from Beimo?

262
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,230
He has been put into the prison.

263
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,270
Okay.

264
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,580
I understand.

265
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,590
Thank you for your hard work.

266
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,750
Yes.

267
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,990
Thank you for your concern, Father.

268
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,790
It's so hard lately.

269
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,270
I used to think that the old emperor was weird

270
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,470
and grumpy.

271
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,470
But when I really sat on the throne,

272
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,330
I realized that

273
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,900
this seat

274
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,390
makes people grumpy.

275
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,030
You are busy with state affairs.

276
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,560
You've been carrying too much burden lately.

277
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,750
I'll go to the imperial kitchen this afternoon

278
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,610
to make some supplements for you.

279
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,740
Are you going to make it yourself?

280
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,190
If you dare to cook,

281
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,980
I might not dare to eat it.

282
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,390
You're still so naughty.

283
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,490
You don't look like an emperor at all.

284
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,000
I'll be careful.

285
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,390
You'll get busier.

286
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,580
We can't talk

287
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,150
like this.

288
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,710
What are you worried about?

289
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,110
You'll be my empress.

290
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,830
Empress?

291
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,590
Can you imagine what I would look like

292
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,580
when I became the empress?

293
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,030
Let me think.

294
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,250
What will you look like?

295
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,870
What?

296
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,390
Nothing.

297
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,350
It's better this way.

298
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,320
Why?

299
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,270
Because I think

300
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,830
you may not look better than me

301
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,750
in women's clothing.

302
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,090
Shang Yizhi, let's make it clear.

303
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,210
What were you thinking?

304
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,840
[Lin's Mansion]

305
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,750
Rou.

306
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,870
Father.

307
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,790
Have you been practicing the rules in the palace?

308
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,230
Don't worry, Father.

309
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,830
I practice hard every day.

310
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,510
Okay.

311
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,080
Come.

312
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,270
Rou, have a seat.

313
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,350
Yizhi will ascend the throne soon.

314
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,890
I've also got the title of empress for you.

315
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,960
It has to rely on yourself

316
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,870
whether you can hold it.

317
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,830
Father, don't worry.

318
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,950
I understand.

319
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,070
Rou has always been smart.

320
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,830
However,

321
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,350
there is someone

322
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,970
you need to pay more attention to.

323
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,190
Who is it?

324
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,880
Marshal Mai, General of the Zhenbei Army.

325
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,870
Little God of War?

326
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,270
Why do you want me to pay attention to a man from outside?

327
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,710
She is a woman.

328
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,320
A woman?

329
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,710
She has accompanied Yizhi for many years

330
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,650
and experienced life and death together.

331
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,910
I'm afraid it's hard to break up this relationship.

332
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,270
But she still appears as a man.

333
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,920
She won't enter the palace.

334
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,960
Rou, don't worry too much.

335
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,950
As long as I am alive,

336
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,870
I will guarantee your position.

337
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,910
Be careful. Hurry up.

338
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,630
Hurry up.

339
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,240
Hurry up.

340
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:54,790
Coming.

341
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,270
Here.

342
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,310
Let me help you.

343
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,950
What is that for?

344
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,240
I've heard a lot about you, Marshal Mai.

345
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,630
I'm Lin Zerou.

346
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,310
What's the matter

347
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,580
to see me?

348
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,670
I just want to see

349
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,030
what Charming Yama looks like.

350
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,430
Being able to stay with Brother Yizhi all the time,

351
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,110
he must be valiant.

352
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,640
You are too kind.

353
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,430
I'm just an ordinary person.

354
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,190
The military camp is so messy.

355
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,920
Do you want to

356
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,910
have some tea inside?

357
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,630
No.

358
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,110
I won't bother you then.

359
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,350
Goodbye.

360
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,230
I've decided to

361
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,530
break off the engagement with the Lin family.

362
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,150
But we still need Prime Minister Lin's help.

363
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,310
Things in the court are hard to settled.

364
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,830
Without Prime Minster Lin's mediation,

365
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,390
I’m afraid the imperial edict can’t leave the palace.

366
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,870
There will be issues

367
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,290
with Marshal Shang's enthronement.

368
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,830
But have you forgotten?

369
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,950
I fought for the throne

370
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,390
to protect the one I care about.

371
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,990
And now,

372
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,710
I have to abandon the one I care about

373
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,110
for this throne.

374
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,140
Why should I do this?

375
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,150
But...

376
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,830
Stop it.

377
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,640
I've made up my mind.

378
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:21,910
Sir,

379
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,900
draft a breach of engagement letter for me.

380
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,130
Mai.

381
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,050
There is an usual action in Beimo.

382
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,710
I'm afraid they'll attack us.

383
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,410
There are things that can be discussed.

384
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,530
This is the only thing we can't.

385
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,820
For the people of Nanxia,

386
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,900
why not?

387
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,200
Marshal Shang, you should know that

388
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,670
you can hide now but not forever.

389
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,550
Young Marquis.

390
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,090
Young Marquis.

391
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,150
Sir.

392
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,400
I heard there’s an uproar in Beimo.

393
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,750
Mai, just in time.

394
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,500
Marshal Shang is going out to battle.

395
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,700
Please persuade him.

396
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,030
Why?

397
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,500
Isn't that my job?

398
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,570
Marshal Shang.

399
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,070
You can’t avoid it.

400
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,670
Have a good chat with General Mai.

401
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,330
I'll take my leave.

402
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,220
You can't avoid what?

403
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,070
Did you get into trouble again?

404
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,950
That old man.

405
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,750
Now who I want to marry

406
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,150
is not up to me.

407
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,880
He insisted that I marry Lin Zerou.

408
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,430
I wanted to break off the engagement.

409
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,030
But there was an uproar in Beimo.

410
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,550
He said the internal affairs were unstable.

411
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,420
Nanxia will soon be destroyed.

412
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,250
That's why you want to lead the expedition?

413
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,030
Yes.

414
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,910
I'm doing this to avoid this.

415
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,580
I think he is right.

416
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,030
At this time,

417
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,180
you shouldn't leave Shengdu.

418
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,630
If I stay here...

419
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,690
Listen to me first.

420
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,830
You haven't ascended the throne yet.

421
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,430
If you leave Shengdu now,

422
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,470
people will think

423
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,190
Nanxia is in danger.

424
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,850
For the soldiers,

425
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,340
it not only can't encourage the morale,

426
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,030
but may also affect the morale of the army.

427
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,350
Is it that serious?

428
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,870
So you can't go this time.

429
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,520
I’ll go.

430
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,310
Mai, don’t worry.

431
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,020
I’ll find a way

432
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,940
to not marry Lin Zerou.

433
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:41,639
♫We walk slowly, holding hands again♫

434
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:47,850
♫Time flows slowly until forever♫

435
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Your Excellency,

436
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,989
the enemy of Beimo is coming.

437
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,560
♫We walk slowly, and this life is enough♫

438
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,989
I assign General Yunhui, Mai Sui,

439
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,750
♫Knowing and cherishing you until old age♫

440
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,190
as Marshal of the Zhenbei Army.

441
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,150
General Zhenwei, Tang Shaoyi,

442
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,650
♫We met in the starry night♫

443
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,780
will be the Deputy Marshal of the Zhenbei Army.

444
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,230
♫We walk slowly, and this life is enough♫

445
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:04,230
I ordered the Zhenbei Army to deploy today

446
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,390
to fight in Jingyang within ten days.

447
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,310
♫Knowing and cherishing you until old age♫

448
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,270
This will be executed.

449
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:15,710
♫We met in the starry night and embraced in the wind and rain♫

450
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,160
This is the end of the edict.

451
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,630
Thank you, Your Majesty.

452
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,630
Marshal Mai.

453
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,150
What's the name of that woman who came this afternoon?

454
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,390
Lin Zerou, right?

455
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,110
She's up to no good.

456
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,870
When the fox preaches, take care of your geese.

457
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,830
Don't kick me.

458
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,830
She's here to steal your man.

459
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,310
Although she looks like that,

460
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,110
her eyebrows and eyes.

461
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,710
Someone like her

462
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,230
is obviously a bad woman.

463
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,950
Don't kick me. Let me finish.

464
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,150
My mother said

465
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,190
this kind of woman...

466
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,830
Dan.

467
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,550
You don't even have a wife.

468
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,670
Why are you babbling here?

469
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,910
Do you know women?

470
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,830
I told you my mom said it.

471
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,710
Can our Marshal Mai to be

472
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,770
compared with her?

473
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,230
How manly is our Marshal Mai?

474
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,830
Yeah.

475
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,830
Except being feminine,

476
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,560
our Marshal Mai is good enough.

477
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,470
Can you stop talking if you can't talk?

478
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,150
Stop.

479
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,200
Have you counted all the provisions?

480
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,270
We'll go now.

481
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,680
Hurry up.

482
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,620
What's wrong with me?

483
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,750
Look at your mouth.

484
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,060
What's wrong with me?

485
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,870
Am I wrong?

486
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,830
Mai.

487
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,540
Big Brother.

488
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,910
The weapons are ready.

489
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,090
We can dispatch the troops after we count the provisions.

490
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,560
Okay.

491
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,030
Did they talk nonsense to you again?

492
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,690
Are you okay?

493
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,270
I'm fine.

494
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,650
Actually, I saw it this afternoon.

495
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,890
Lin Zerou came to you.

496
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,360
Does she know...

497
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,070
I'm pretty sure.

498
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,430
I'm fine.

499
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,030
I believe in Shang Yizhi.

500
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,170
Good.

501
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,150
Marshal,

502
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,280
the army has been assembled for days.

503
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,950
When will we attack the city?

504
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,360
Nanxia Army's provisions are ready.

505
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,670
Is Mai Sui the commander?

506
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,400
Yes.

507
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,390
I know

508
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,460
this expedition is restricted by the Chang family.

509
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,590
I'm sorry, Marshal.

510
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,390
If we hold out much longer

511
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,490
and the Nanxia people manage to kill Chang Yuqing,

512
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,400
Marshal,

513
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,070
it will be hard to explain when we get back.

514
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,310
Then this is where he is meant to die.

515
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,750
But Marshal,

516
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,990
should we fight

517
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,270
or not?

518
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,550
Wait.

519
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:51,990
Yes.

520
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,350
Come on.

521
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,600
Marshal Mai.

522
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,510
The food has been counted.

523
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,710
It's enough for our army for a month.

524
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:17,390
Okay.

525
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,040
Prepare to decamp at any time.

526
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,510
Yes.

527
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,430
Report!

528
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,150
Marshal Mai.

529
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,310
Minister Du Changying from the Ministry of War

530
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,710
has brought people here.

531
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,150
Du Changying?

532
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,150
Greetings, Minister Du.

533
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,340
Marshal Mai.

534
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,430
The Ministry of War has some evidence

535
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,720
about Marshal Mai’s collaboration with foreign enemies.

536
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,120
I don’t know if it’s true.

537
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,870
So please come with me.

538
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,670
Colluding with foreign enemies?

539
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,630
Are you crazy?

540
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,420
How could he collude with the enemy?

541
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,440
Listen.

542
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,110
Don’t slander.

543
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,320
This is Marshal Mai.

544
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,590
Don’t you dare catch him.

545
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,030
Where is the Zhenbei Army?

546
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,590
Yes.

547
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,320
What are you doing?

548
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,820
Are you rebelling?

549
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,790
Return!

550
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,050
Marshal Mai.

551
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,620
He is obviously framing you.

552
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,670
Mr. Du said

553
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,670
it’s just a misunderstanding.

554
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,200
We are just having some tea.

555
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,430
Go back.

556
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,990
Mai.

557
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,830
Are you really going?

558
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,070
Don't worry.

559
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,100
I'll leave the military camps to you.

560
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,760
Prepare to decamp at any time.

561
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,100
Marshal Mai, please.

562
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,420
Marshal Mai.

563
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,830
You are so carefree.

564
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,550
Minister Du,

565
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,020
you are finally here.

566
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,790
Tell me.

567
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,650
How did I get the crime

568
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,810
for colluding with the enemy?

569
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,790
So Marshal Mai didn’t remember it, right?

570
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,560
It doesn't matter.

571
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,310
I've checked it for Marshal Mai.

572
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,560
I'm here

573
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,870
to ask Marshal Mai

574
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,800
to sign here.

575
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,350
Bring him here.

576
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,570
Marshal Mai and General Chang

577
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,420
must be old friends.

578
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,150
He and I fought a few times

579
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,670
on the battlefield.

580
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,610
Of course we know each other.

581
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,110
Not only that,

582
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:17,320
Marshal Mai once let the enemy go.

583
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,390
Right?

584
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,590
Marshal Mai.

585
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,360
My men saw it with their own eyes that night.

586
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,510
You and him were talking in South Alley and left separately.

587
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,070
If I call the witness,

588
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,390
it won't look good.

589
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,830
If you sign your name,

590
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,880
everything

591
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,790
will be easy.

592
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,480
[Marshal Mai Sui of the Zhenbei Army released the enemy, General Chang Yuqing, in the battle of Pingjia'ao]

593
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,480
[Even released the enemy in the bamboo forest in front of Shengdu. There is no objection with the crime of colluding with enemy]

594
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,170
Don't bother.

595
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,470
I remember now.

596
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,760
I let him go.

597
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,280
I'll sign it for you.

598
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,920
[Marshal Mai Sui of the Zhenbei Army released the enemy, General Chang Yuqing, in the battle of Pingjia'ao]

599
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,920
[Even released the enemy in the bamboo forest in front of Shengdu. There is no objection with the crime of colluding with enemy]

600
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,130
[Marshal Mai Sui of the Zhenbei Army released the enemy, General Chang Yuqing, in the battle of Pingjia'ao]

601
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,130
[Even released the enemy in the bamboo forest in front of Shengdu. There is no objection with the crime of colluding with enemy]

602
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,240
Thank you, Marshal Mai.

603
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,700
Take him away.

604
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,140
Watch him carefully.

605
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,920
Marshal Shang.

606
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,510
Mai was detained

607
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,120
and was imprisoned for the crime of colluding with the enemy.

608
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,450
Collude with the enemy?

609
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,150
Who caught him?

610
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:33,150
Minister Du Changying from the Ministry of War.

611
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,850
Prime Minister Lin.

612
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,840
There must be something suspicious.

613
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,670
Prime Minister Lin wants to see you.

614
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,570
Marshal Shang.

615
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,720
Prime Minister Lin.

616
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,410
The front line is still at war

617
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,010
and you caught the commander.

618
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,580
What’s your plan?

619
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,680
Marshal Mai Sui of the Zhenbei Army

620
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,900
colluded with Beimo.

621
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,460
If we don't arrest him now,

622
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,510
do we have to wait until they join forces with the Beimo army

623
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:08,960
to attack Nanxia?

624
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,500
Then tell me

625
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,310
what's the reason for her to collude with the enemy?

626
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:13,750
Marshal Mai has admitted it.
