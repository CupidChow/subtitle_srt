[Fighting for love]

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,940
[Episode 29]

4
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,620
Qi Min.

5
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,550
Why are you here?

6
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,270
Didn't I tell you

7
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,870
not to come and serve me?

8
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,480
I'm afraid you'll be thirsty after waking up,

9
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,930
so I came to serve tea and waited here.

10
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,450
Father, have some tea.

11
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,990
Father.

12
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,590
Father.

13
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,030
When I got the news that you were ill

14
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,880
and couldn't eat or sleep well,

15
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,470
I wanted to visit you many times,

16
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,870
but that eunuch stopped me outside.

17
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,560
Really detestable!

18
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,590
Deng Gao…

19
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,710
What did you do to him?

20
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,110
Father!

21
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,350
Father!

22
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:01,830
Father.

23
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,830
Don't worry, Father.

24
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,350
Although he offended me,

25
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,670
I knew

26
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,350
he was the most important person to you.

27
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,240
I didn't do anything to him.

28
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,830
I just let him sleep some more,

29
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,450
seeing his health condition.

30
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,350
Those guards

31
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,350
are all from noble families.

32
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,390
How many of them can endure the hardships of being in the army?

33
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,070
There are always some who are too fond of play.

34
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,110
I just catered

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,790
to their pleasure.

36
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,550
Sit down and talk.

37
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,110
Father.

38
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,950
I'm here to let you know

39
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,250
that in this world,

40
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,230
no one is reliable

41
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,830
except me.

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,750
I have always been

43
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,190
loyal to you.

44
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,070
What on earth is your intention?

45
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,040
Father, there's something you don't know.

46
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,720
My good brother and brother-in-law

47
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
pretended to be pregnant

48
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,870
just to get the position of the crown prince.

49
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,270
They found a random child to fake it.

50
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,110
They

51
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,540
have been lying to you and the whole court until now.

52
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,470
That is impossible.

53
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,800
I have proof.

54
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,880
Father.

55
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,250
I brought the evidence

56
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,250
to confront the crown prince.

57
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,920
I couldn't believe the crown prince risked his life to protect his son.

58
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,670
Then, the crown princess went with the crown prince.

59
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,350
Father,

60
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,750
the news has spread.

61
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,030
Everyone knows it.

62
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,350
Father, you...

63
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,300
Don't you think it's strange?

64
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,070
It must be the people around you.

65
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,590
They were afraid that you would be scared again,

66
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,310
so they kept it from you.

67
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,470
Father.

68
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,150
There are many rumors

69
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,630
in the court.

70
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,870
People are jittery.

71
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,350
I worry about what you worry about

72
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,840
and meet your needs.

73
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,550
I came here

74
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,550
to wash the brush and grind the ink for you personally.

75
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,150
It only…

76
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,150
only takes a few strokes

77
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,180
to stabilize the foundation of Nanxia.

78
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,030
I

79
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,110
volunteer!

80
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,030
I'd like to thrust myself forward to face the challenge!

81
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,190
Father! Father!

82
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,710
Qi Min,

83
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:56,150
why should I pass the throne to you?

84
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,830
Father.

85
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,190
The crown prince is dead.

86
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,710
Qi Yu is not even part of the royal bloodline.

87
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,430
Father.

88
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,550
If you don't pass it to me,

89
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,000
to whom will you pass it?

90
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,590
Father! Father!

91
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,430
Who let you in?

92
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,640
Your Majesty.

93
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,590
I

94
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,120
will pass the throne to Qi Huan.

95
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,710
I am his only son.

96
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,560
His only son!

97
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,830
And he wants to pass the throne to Qi Huan?

98
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,070
Is he too old to be sensible?

99
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,090
Calm down, Your Highness.

100
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,180
His Majesty is still alive.

101
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,990
He hasn't issued a decree to pass the throne yet.

102
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,350
It's not decided yet.

103
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,950
The Eldest Princess!

104
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,880
It must be Princess Shenghua who's behind it.

105
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,950
If it weren't for her,

106
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,270
Father wouldn't have wanted to pass the throne to Qi Huan.

107
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,409
Your Highness.

108
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,909
Even so,

109
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,180
we can't touch Princess Shenghua now.

110
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,290
We are already battered by criticism for the crown prince's death.

111
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,310
If we were to be so cruel,

112
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,910
the ministers wouldn't come

113
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,790
and pledge loyalty to you.

114
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,390
That woman tried so hard to make His Majesty

115
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,830
pass the throne to her son.

116
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,550
She also instigated Lord Zeng.

117
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,670
She is clearly

118
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,830
targeting me.

119
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,800
Even if Princess Shenghua intends to seize the crown,

120
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,550
Your Highness is a legitimate heir.

121
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,870
If you want to ascend the throne,

122
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,750
you just need to calm down, win over the officials,

123
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,990
and gain popularity.

124
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,560
Then, the throne will be at your disposal.

125
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,950
The more you do now, the more mistakes you'll make.

126
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,990
What if I kidnap her?

127
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,400
Your Highness is wise.

128
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,850
If we can capture Princess Shenghua,

129
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,390
Shang Yizhi and the Zhenbei Army

130
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,040
will be under Your Highness's control.

131
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,710
Nonsense!

132
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,400
Didn't you understand what I said?

133
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,590
I think Shen Tingyuan is right.

134
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,070
At this point,

135
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,950
in troubled times, we must rule with an autocracy.

136
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,910
After I wipe out all those who oppose me,

137
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,040
the throne will be mine naturally.

138
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,030
When I ascend the throne,

139
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,310
will I still worry that no one comes to pledge loyalty to me?

140
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,430
Marquis Dingnan has a military background.

141
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,950
He is not easy to solve.

142
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,710
Even if you want to,

143
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,150
you have to know what you are capable of.

144
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,750
Master Pang, talk nicely.

145
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,030
Why do you have to be so aggressive?

146
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,030
Besides, you've gone too far as a servant.

147
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,150
I only know that as a servant,

148
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,230
since I look to my master for backing,

149
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,990
I have to do my best to remonstrate with my master and offer my advice,

150
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,660
especially when my master is making a mistake.

151
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,490
Then, Master Pang, what's your plan?

152
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,070
What we should do now is to do nothing

153
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,450
so as not to provide a pretext for others.

154
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,640
Master Pang, you mean

155
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,070
I can only watch Princess Shenghua

156
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,870
sending her son to the throne.

157
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,160
Master Pang, you are so considerate towards Princess Shenghua

158
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,990
and always protect Marquis Dingnan.

159
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,550
Which boat are you on?

160
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,610
Calm down, Your Highness.

161
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,830
We all know

162
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,650
Master Pang is loyal to you.

163
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,430
Others can be disloyal,

164
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,690
but never Master Pang.

165
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,710
Master Pang's foresight

166
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,670
must be for your great cause.

167
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,400
Are you telling me I should let Princess Shenghua get her way

168
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,390
for the sake of my great cause?

169
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,120
Master Pang,

170
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,510
you always told me

171
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,880
that when I do great things,

172
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,830
I must endure the unbearable things for ordinary people,

173
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,960
that I must calm down

174
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,960
and win over the people to accumulate the popularity,

175
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,510
that the more I do,

176
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,550
the more mistakes I'll make.

177
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,670
In the end, I am forced into a corner.

178
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,070
My father

179
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,560
doesn't even want to look at me anymore.

180
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,840
I always thought

181
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,430
you could truly understand the way of being a monarch.

182
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,150
Now I realize

183
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,710
it was just my daydream

184
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,360
and my wishful thinking.

185
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,590
What did you say?

186
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,390
I mean...

187
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,510
I finally understand

188
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,590
why your father

189
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,670
would rather give the throne to an outsider

190
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,190
than pass it to you.

191
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,590
Master Pang!

192
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,470
Someone!

193
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,710
Yes.

194
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,170
Put Master Pang in prison.

195
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,620
Go!

196
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,030
Your Highness.

197
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,200
Master Pang…

198
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,040
He did it for Your Highness's good.

199
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,920
Find someone.

200
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,070
Do it.

201
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,440
[Wise eyes have boundless insight]

202
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,700
Tell me,

203
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,030
how could Yizhi fall for General Mai?

204
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,510
Don't worry, Your Highness.

205
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,030
I think

206
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,550
Young Marquis was just bewitched for now.

207
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,510
Really?

208
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,680
Your Highness, you're just too worried to think clearly.

209
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,080
Although Young Marquis used to be a playboy

210
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,490
and went to the Emerald Pavilion

211
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,490
every day under your instructions,

212
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,830
that was only for outsiders to see.

213
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,830
Chunniang has run the Emerald Pavilion

214
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,110
very well.

215
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,270
I'll say something I shouldn't say.

216
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,630
It's just because Young Marquis couldn't even touch

217
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,550
a woman's skirt

218
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,710
that he is so mesmerized by a woman now.

219
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,550
Yes, I was too strict.

220
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,870
Maybe after the initial surge of interest,

221
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,800
plus General Mai's short temper,

222
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,430
the days they quarrel are coming.

223
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,510
I think your plan to let Miss Lin

224
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,240
marry Young Marquis in advance

225
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,950
is indeed a great idea.

226
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,950
Miss Lin is virtuous.

227
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,960
She will surely be able to attract Young Marquis.

228
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,790
Yes.

229
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,910
Now,

230
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,360
I have to bow down first.

231
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,150
As the old saying goes,

232
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,810
children are parents' debts.

233
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,980
I remember

234
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,440
Young Marquis likes the desserts from Liuyue Bakery the most.

235
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,880
Would you like to have a look, Your Highness?

236
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,920
Yes, let's.

237
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,470
Thank you.

238
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,510
Come again if you like it.

239
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,450
Did you upset Her Highness again?

240
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,710
Is it so obvious?

241
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,990
Every time you upset Her Highness,

242
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,060
you bought the same cake.

243
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,910
Everyone can see that.

244
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,990
But I used the same cake

245
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,150
to make her happy again every time.

246
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,190
I don't understand

247
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,520
what's so good about it.

248
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,130
It's one thing whether it's good.

249
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,470
It is another thing whether you buy it or not.

250
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:05,990
But…

251
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,640
if it's not tasty, why would she forgive you?

252
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,440
What they care about

253
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,470
is not the thing per se,

254
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,030
but your attitude.

255
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,190
Wait.

256
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,740
What does this have to do with the attitude?

257
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,910
Mu Bai,

258
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,320
you are hopeless.

259
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,590
Remember this.

260
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,190
In Shengdu City,

261
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,120
no one knows women better than me.

262
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,000
Women?

263
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,190
What does this have to do with women?

264
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,470
Your Grace.

265
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,800
Have you seen my mother?

266
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,120
Your Grace.

267
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,910
Her Highness left the mansion at noon. She hasn't come back until now.

268
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,840
Where did she go?

269
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,350
I don't know.

270
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,680
But Her Highness rarely stayed outside at this hour.

271
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,110
I'm worried, too.

272
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,470
I see.

273
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,230
Princess Shenghua has not been back yet?

274
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,030
No.

275
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,710
This has never happened to my mother.

276
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,170
Young Marquis.

277
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,510
Young Marquis.

278
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,710
Constable Chen has something important to report.

279
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,370
Young Marquis.

280
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,130
I received a report an hour ago.

281
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,800
[Marquis Dingnan]

282
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,310
We found a male body in his fifties

283
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,950
in the dark alley.

284
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,350
Young Marquis,

285
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,990
I've checked it.

286
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,920
That male body

287
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,990
was Mr. Liu, who drove the cart for Her Highness.

288
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,710
What?

289
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,280
Then Mother…

290
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,750
This matter

291
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,930
is related to the safety of Princess Shenghua.

292
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,640
Please keep it a secret, Constable Chen.

293
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,350
Yes.

294
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,070
Butler Gui.

295
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,670
Yes.

296
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,000
Gather all the servants

297
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,250
to go and look for Princess Shenghua.

298
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,790
Let's go.

299
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,320
Let's go.

300
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,390
You're awake.

301
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,770
Your Highness, are you all right?

302
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,340
Your Highness.

303
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,270
I'm fine.

304
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,390
Who is so bold

305
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,310
that he even dares to kidnap the Eldest Princess?

306
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,790
Don't panic, Your Highness.

307
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,190
I will get you out of here.

308
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,230
Don't waste your energy.

309
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,710
I've checked.

310
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,270
The surroundings are sealed.

311
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,720
But don't worry.

312
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,290
Now that he's kidnapped us,

313
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,070
he won't hide for too long.

314
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,350
He will appear

315
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
when it's time.

316
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,310
Okay.

317
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,030
I'll accompany you.

318
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,310
You two go this way. The rest of you, follow me.

319
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,440
-Search!
-Yes! Yes!

320
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,589
Madam.

321
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,030
Excuse me.

322
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,109
Have you seen someone this tall?

323
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,310
Have you seen someone this tall?

324
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,310
Excuse me.

325
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:18,910
Have you seen

326
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,829
a woman who's about this tall

327
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,430
coming from that direction?

328
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:30,820
Go!

329
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,030
Open the door.

330
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,040
I need to talk to Master Pang.

331
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,030
You may leave.

332
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:52,750
Yes.

333
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,270
Master Pang, you're still calm even when in prison.

334
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,170
I admire you very much.

335
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,240
What brings you here?

336
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,390
His Highness was too angry

337
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,840
and didn't understand your good intentions.

338
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,630
Please take care of yourself.

339
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,700
In the future, His Highness's great cause

340
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,360
will rely on you, Master Pang.

341
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,170
Where is His Highness?

342
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,440
He has taken Princess Shenghua

343
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,420
to meet Marquis Dingnan.

344
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,230
By seizing Princess Shenghua, His Highness now has the advantage.

345
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,110
As long as he can win

346
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,950
and become happy,

347
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,070
he will definitely pardon me.

348
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,390
If he loses,

349
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,070
I'm afraid I'll die.

350
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,430
These days,

351
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,430
I've learned

352
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,230
how to be a courtier from you, Master Pang.

353
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,550
In the future,

354
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,500
I'm afraid I won't have such a chance.

355
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,670
I'm going back to Beimo.

356
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,200
Going back to Beimo?

357
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,840
Where can you get the passport?

358
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,070
I'm here to thank you.

359
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,370
Only because of you

360
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,270
can I have my wish fulfilled and go back home.

361
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,390
Who harmed me?

362
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,110
His Majesty wants to see you off.

363
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,370
Master Pang.

364
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,510
Goodbye.

365
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,570
Young Marquis.

366
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,270
We have searched many times

367
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,470
but got no clue at all.

368
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,680
Keep searching.

369
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,440
Don't worry.

370
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,390
We will find Princess Shenghua.

371
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,070
Today

372
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,870
is the first time the Vanguard Battalion of the Zhenbei Army has formed an array.

373
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,750
You're all elite soldiers

374
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,250
that I picked from all the soldiers.

375
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,150
From now on, the Vanguard Battalion

376
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,480
will be the first camp of the Zhenbei Army.

377
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,270
What's our slogan?

378
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,030
Only advance; never retreat.

379
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,590
Live without fear of death.

380
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,990
Good.

381
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,670
Did you see whose guards they are?

382
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,440
I haven't seen them before.

383
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,230
What time is it now?

384
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,270
It was just dawn.

385
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,150
I guess it's about 5 o'clock.

386
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,110
Your Highness.

387
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,870
Let me help you get some rest.

388
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:13,510
It's okay.

389
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,030
You go and rest.

390
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,180
Save your strength.

391
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,910
I'm fine.

392
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,310
But when have Your Highness suffered like this?

393
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,080
Your Highness, hang in there.

394
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,920
Young Marquis will definitely come to save you.

395
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,470
That's what I'm worried about.

396
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,460
[Prince Kang's Mansion]

397
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,400
Aunt?

398
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,070
You damn fools.

399
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,730
How can you treat my aunt like this?

400
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,820
Aunt.

401
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,270
Aunt.

402
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,150
Why aren't you surprised to see me?

403
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,390
Among all the people in Nanxia, who dares to do this to me

404
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,190
except you, the heartless and ungrateful rascal?

405
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,670
You have a point.

406
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,390
In that case,

407
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,230
you should know

408
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,150
why I invited you here.

409
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,830
If you want to threaten my son with me,

410
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,670
I advise you not to court your doom.

411
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,270
Aunt,

412
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,170
you really love my cousin.

413
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,800
I really envy him.

414
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,510
Unfortunately, the dog sent by your good son

415
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,150
has followed me since the moment I left the mansion.

416
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,190
Aunt.

417
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,910
Try and touch him.

418
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,080
Aunt, you misunderstood.

419
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,550
Shang Yizhi is my cousin, after all.

420
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,110
I'm soft-hearted,

421
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,410
and I decide to spare his life.

422
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,670
But I'm about to ascend the throne.

423
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,110
I always need a few people to help me.

424
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,230
My cousin is not suitable

425
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,910
to be a general.

426
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,470
I still need a supervisor of eunuchs.

427
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,090
My cousin is perfect for it.

428
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,230
Aunt.

429
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,630
Don't worry.

430
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,840
I will allow him to come home often

431
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,550
to visit you.

432
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,750
Aunt?

433
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,070
I'm being kind.

434
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,630
I don't want

435
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,990
to see the tragedy of parents losing their children.

436
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,640
Aunt,

437
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,470
you must appreciate my kindness.

438
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,990
You...

439
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,750
Why are you laughing?

440
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,590
I think my father was right.

441
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,710
It's karma.

442
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,950
Retributive justice is so true.

443
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,270
Just laugh at me.

444
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,880
I'm not laughing at you.

445
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,590
I'm laughing at my brother.

446
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,510
You may not believe me,

447
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,350
but this scene today

448
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,870
is so familiar.

449
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,870
And compared to your father,

450
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,950
you're even more

451
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,630
vicious and shameless.

452
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,470
I'm just curious

453
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,250
what your descendants

454
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,610
will be like compared to you.

455
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,950
And what will happen to you in the end?

456
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,670
Well,

457
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,030
you don't have to worry about it.

458
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:42,980
By the way,

459
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,350
I

460
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,750
suddenly changed my mind

461
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,950
and decided

462
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,350
to trade a life for a life.

463
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,790
If you feel bored,

464
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,150
you may think about

465
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,440
how to make me happy

466
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,030
to protect your good son.

467
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,870
Qi Min,

468
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,070
don't forget

469
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,390
who you are.

470
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,230
My son, Yizhi,

471
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,710
is the Grand Marshal of the three armies.

472
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,150
He is my beloved son.

473
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,030
And you?

474
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,550
You are just

475
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,670
a child that my brother despises.

476
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,720
You've been living in the shadow of your brother

477
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,550
and despised by everyone in the world.

478
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,860
Even at this moment,

479
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,630
when you're confident you're going to succeed

480
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,190
and ascend the throne,

481
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,390
ask yourself:

482
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,630
Which one of the ministers

483
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,870
really respects you and wants to acknowledge you?

484
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,310
Don't think I won't kill you.

485
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,000
Your Highness.

486
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:10,910
Go.

487
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,670
Yes.

488
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,460
Your Majesty.

489
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,370
Your Majesty?

490
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,220
Your Majesty?

491
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,070
What time is it?

492
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,480
Your Majesty.

493
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,350
It's 9:15.

494
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,130
Light the brazier.

495
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,270
Brother Tang will lead a team

496
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,590
and hide in the woods outside the cabin.

497
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,700
Mu Bai and I will each lead a team.

498
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,310
We'll enter the cabin from the east and west separately.

499
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,840
While the cabin is in chaos,

500
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,110
Marshal Shang will bring his men inside to rescue Princess Shenghua.

501
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,710
After Marshal Shang goes in,

502
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,030
Brother Tang will enter it,

503
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,360
and then we'll besiege the cabin together.

504
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,960
Yes.

505
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,280
It's well-planned.

506
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,760
Let's do it that way.

507
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,190
We'll hurry up

508
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,990
and not give them a chance to react.

509
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,190
We can save Princess Shenghua for sure.

510
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,130
Young Marquis.

511
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,220
Your Grace,

512
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,630
this person works for the Second Prince.

513
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,080
He brought you a message from the Second Prince.

514
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,640
Say it.

515
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,830
Hello, Generals.

516
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,970
Marshal Shang.

517
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,590
My master wants to see you.

518
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,630
By the way,

519
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,030
My master also said

520
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,950
only Marshal Shang could go there.

521
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,470
If there are too many people,

522
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,870
my master won't be able to guarantee

523
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,830
the safety of Princess Shenghua.

524
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,390
How dare you!

525
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,190
No, no, no.

526
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,990
I am just a messenger.

527
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,040
Take him away first.

528
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,440
Go.

529
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,470
This is obviously a trap.

530
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
You can't go.

531
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,110
They want you to risk your life.

532
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,570
Mai.

533
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,870
My mother raised me when I was little.

534
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,710
Didn't she risk her life, too?

535
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,790
I'll go.

536
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,150
What if you are detained?

537
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,190
What would you do

538
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,790
if you were me?

539
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,910
If you don't return in two hours,

540
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,400
we'll lead the troops to attack.

541
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,880
Young Marquis.

542
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,910
Shall we… just wait?

543
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,450
Let's wait for a while.

544
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,800
Two hours is too long.

545
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,230
An hour?

546
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,630
Two hours,

547
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,670
as planned.

548
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:23,950
Mr. Xu.

549
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,560
An hour.

550
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,690
Okay.

551
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,990
An hour it is.

552
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:37,990
We'll set off

553
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,590
in an hour.

554
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,190
Yes.

555
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,670
Marshal Shang.

556
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,270
Please.

557
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,360
Mother.

558
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,590
Don't worry.

559
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,280
I'm here to save you.

560
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,660
Marquis Dingnan is really a filial son.

561
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,110
It's worth

562
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,350
my delicate plan.

563
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,550
Qi Min,

564
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,630
you only want me.

565
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,150
Let my mother go.

566
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,990
If my guess is right,

567
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,590
your Zhenbei Army

568
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,830
is approaching the mountain.

569
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,510
So, it's easy

570
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:11,679
to let her go.

571
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,389
But it's not that easy

572
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
for you to get out of this door alive.

573
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,630
I've put all my effort into it.

574
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,429
Between your mother's life and your life,

575
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,940
Marquis Dingnan,

576
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,070
choose one.

577
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,670
Don't forget

578
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,310
what I told you.

579
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,389
Do what you should do.

580
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,430
Fool!

581
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,270
My effort is all wasted.

582
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:05,780
Mother.

583
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,980
Don't call me Mother.

584
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,590
I never gave birth to you.

585
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,070
If I knew you were so useless,

586
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,670
why would I

587
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,070
take so much effort to raise you?

588
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:20,910
Aunt.

589
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,830
What act are you putting on?

590
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,310
You loser! You don't deserve to talk to me.

591
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,420
What?

592
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,290
I don't deserve it?

593
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,690
I don't deserve it?

594
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,350
Aunt,

595
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,670
watch your mouth.

596
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,320
Did I say anything wrong?

597
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,780
You're from a lowly background and have an average capability.

598
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,230
You should be bullied in the palace.

599
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,230
If I hadn't pitied you

600
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,590
and taken you to see His Majesty,

601
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,950
my brother had long forgotten

602
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,670
he had such a son.

603
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,880
Although the crown prince was not very talented,

604
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,590
but with you as a contrast,

605
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,950
he looked good at everything.

606
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,150
Besides,

607
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,870
he had Qi Yu.

608
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,510
And you?

609
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,370
You were even so stupid to compete for His Majesty's favor.

610
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,870
Didn't you look at yourself?

611
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,230
Shut up!

612
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,350
Shut up!

613
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,270
You killed the crown prince

614
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,230
with those lowly means.

615
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,030
So what if you kill Yizhi today?

616
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,190
Do you think you can win the throne?

617
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,550
Let me tell you,

618
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,750
you still can't.

619
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,750
Because in my brother's heart,

620
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,710
he loves Qi Yu the most.

621
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,630
In the end, you can't even beat a little kid!

622
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,560
Mother!

623
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,660
[Min]

624
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:35,920
Mother.

625
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,270
Mother.

626
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,600
Your Highness.

627
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,310
Do you really

628
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,070
have to go that far?

629
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:10,110
His Majesty wants to abdicate in favor of Yizhi.

630
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,190
Abdicate?

631
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,840
He also does it to protect the life of his grandson.

632
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,870
His Majesty doesn't mean it.

633
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,990
Even if His Majesty does this for his grandson,

634
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,750
how could His Majesty not know

635
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,680
Prince Kang could even kill his own big brother

636
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,610
in order to obtain the throne?

637
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,310
I'm afraid he just wants to divert the disaster.

638
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,350
How can I not know about my brother?

639
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,310
Whether he wants to divert the disaster

640
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,970
or he just loves his grandson,

641
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:44,950
whether he's sincere or not,

642
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,870
I will make it real,

643
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,230
even if it costs my life.

644
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,780
Your Highness, why would you go so far?

645
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,030
For Yizhi.

646
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:00,190
He wallows too much in the romantic love.

647
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:05,470
He won't understand if not stimulated.

648
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,830
What do you plan to do, Your Highness?

649
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:14,680
Prince Kang.

650
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,360
Your Highness wants to make use of his scheme?

651
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,790
If His Majesty really wants to

652
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,690
divert the trouble like you said,

653
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,270
Prince Kang will find it out soon.

654
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,790
Although he's ruthless,

655
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,910
he's not smart.

656
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:38,310
He'll risk everything when he's perturbed in mind.

657
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,790
Yizhi doesn't have many weaknesses.

658
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,960
I may be one of them.

659
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,910
Your Highness.

660
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,630
Is it worth it?

661
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,470
Yes.

662
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,430
Only a benevolent man like Yizhi

663
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,670
deserves the throne.

664
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,670
And it belonged to Yizhi in the first place.

665
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,870
Since you know how kind Young Marquis is,

666
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,870
how can you let him experience the pain of losing his mother?

667
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,150
How cruel.

668
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,950
For the people,

669
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,320
he has to grow up

670
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,310
to be a wise emperor.

671
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,630
Please help me

672
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,530
and Yizhi.

673
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,710
Mother.

674
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,390
Only...

675
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,360
Only by becoming an emperor

676
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,710
can you protect

677
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,670
the one you want to protect.

678
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,390
Do you understand?

679
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,190
Mother!

680
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,090
-Mother!
-Your Highness!

681
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,190
Princess Shenghua.

682
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,070
Your Highness.

683
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,230
Zhenbei Army, listen to my orders.

684
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,190
Yes.

685
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,460
Set off!

686
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,750
Yes.
