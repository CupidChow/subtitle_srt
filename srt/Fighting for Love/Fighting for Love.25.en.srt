5
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,060
I can't believe Shang turned to crown prince.

6
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,800
Can you bear it?

7
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,550
Then don't.

8
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,949
It's time.

00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,750
This...

10
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,030
Father likes Qi Yu.

11
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,760
Now that kid took Mai as his master

12
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,670
and the Crown Prince's Mansion has taken the Zhenbei Army in.

13
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,829
His Majesty has made up his mind.

14
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,320
As long as I live one more day,

15
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,350
Father will have less chance to change his mind.

16
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,110
What chance do I have?

17
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,870
The more stable the position of the Crown Prince's Mansion,

18
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,829
the less chance Your Highness will ascend the throne.

19
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:50,160
I'll use some tricks tomorrow morning during the meeting.

20
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,550
The foundation of Crown Prince's Mansion should be loosened.

23
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,750
Are all of these invitations for Mother to enjoy flowers?

24
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,430
Yes.

25
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,920
In these families,

26
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,910
there are similar girls to your age.

27
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,840
So I'm here to ask for your opinion.

28
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,870
Mother,

29
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,800
if you want to go for relaxation, then just go.

30
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,390
If it's for my marriage,

31
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,610
then you don't have to worry about it.

32
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,380
Why?

33
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,829
Because I

34
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,050
have a person in the heart.

35
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,590
Really?

36
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,350
Which family is she from?

37
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,990
Her parents are deceased, and they didn't hold any official positions.

38
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,070
Is she a commoner or an orphan?

39
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,510
Something happened to her family when she was young.

40
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,670
She grew up alone.

41
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,190
It's really hard for her to come this far.

42
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,110
She has to pose as a man to survive.

43
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,270
However,

44
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,150
she is still innocent and kind.

45
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,640
Fine.

46
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,070
There is such a pitiful and lovely person in the world.

47
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,340
I sympathize with her situation.

48
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,030
But

49
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,110
a commoner can't be your legal wife.

50
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,390
But Mother,

51
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,149
she saved me twice.

52
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,550
Do you remember I was assassinated at the Emerald Pavilion?

53
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,750
If it weren't for her,

54
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,360
I wouldn't have made it out.

55
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,030
And when I arrived in Yuzhou and Qingzhou,

56
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,470
I was in danger several times.

57
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,320
But because of her help,

58
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,670
I survived.

59
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,750
Are you talking about...?

60
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,310
It's indeed my brother, Mai.

61
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,470
Does a woman like Mai

62
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,150
not deserve to marry me?

63
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,830
I see.

64
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,190
No wonder

65
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,310
when you just came back to Shengdu,

66
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,320
Mai was so nervous to see me.

67
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,640
Fine.

68
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,200
I won't interfere with your business.

69
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:05,710
By the way,

70
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,230
can you ask General Mai

71
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,430
to have a chat with me?

72
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,350
Mother.

73
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,430
She is

74
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,430
used to being a man.

75
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,310
She's not even used to being a woman.

76
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,150
Let alone these complicated etiquette.

77
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,770
How about this?

78
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,030
Give her some time.

79
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,750
I'll make arrangements.

80
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,909
Fine, I'll listen to you.

81
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,830
Envoy Gao,

82
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,070
don't try to seek connections randomly.

83
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,550
How could my brother do

84
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,409
such terrible things to the country and the people?

85
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,110
Father,

86
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,750
this has nothing to do with Brother.

87
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,210
Please investigate this matter throughly.

88
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,190
Your Majesty,

89
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,950
I have a written letter from His Royal Highness.

90
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,630
I'm just worried that one day something like this will happen.

91
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,830
So, I risked my life to keep this letter.

92
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,510
Where is the letter?

93
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,670
[Gao, this time, it will be Xia Hongxuan from Zhou Zhou, Yang Feng from Xin Zhou and Liu Min from Ding Zhou]

94
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,670
[The three of them should be given positions below seventh-rank as soon as possible]

95
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,670
This...

96
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,200
Crown prince.

97
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,950
My good son.

98
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,940
Father is wise, I am innocent.

99
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,600
Father is wise, I am innocent.

100
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,950
Prime Minister Lin's good student.

101
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,870
The crown prince neglected his duty

102
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,520
and is suspected of indulging subordinates to embezzle money for no reason.

103
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,480
I order you

104
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,310
to stay in the Crown Prince's Mansion

105
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,510
before this matter is verified.

106
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,590
Father!

107
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,840
Father!

108
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,510
Mai.

109
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,760
Mother promised me.

110
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,630
Promise what?

111
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,230
About our marriage.

112
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,510
You...

113
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,230
Why did you tell her?

114
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,630
Didn't I tell you not to tell her?

115
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,670
You have no idea how urgent it was.

116
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,850
Mother wanted someone to marry me...

117
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,750
No.

118
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,310
She wanted me to marry someone else...

119
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,960
No.

120
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,990
Anyway, she wanted me get married.

121
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,870
I had no choice but to give you up.

122
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,710
But...

123
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,590
we haven't found anything about the Xuanwu Army.

124
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,150
I...

125
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,070
Now...

126
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,909
Mai.

127
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,520
If you’re not ready,

128
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,750
I can wait.

129
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,400
When you are ready,

130
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,950
let's visit Mother.

131
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,940
Young Marquis.

132
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,310
Something happened in the Crown Prince's Mansion.

133
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:13,950
What is it?

134
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,590
It is said that Cao Imperial Censor told on Envoy Gao Liu from the Bureau of Scrutiny.

135
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,800
He said he had solid evidence of bribery.

136
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,030
Gao Liu was irrefutable.

137
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,290
So he said it was the crown prince's idea.

138
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,710
It was Prince Kang again.

139
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,030
Return to Shengdu?

140
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,250
Set off immediately. As soon as possible.

141
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,350
You should know

142
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,270
you can't act without an order.

143
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,990
Otherwise, it will be considered as treason.

144
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,309
Did something happen in Shengdu?

145
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,660
[It's time, come back quickly]

146
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,950
Sir, what is this?

147
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,280
Marshal Shang needs us.

148
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,080
Did he already have a plan before he left?

149
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,970
He didn’t know.

150
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,040
I'll tell you the truth later.

151
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,400
But I can be sure that

152
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,710
if we don’t go,

153
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,710
Marshal Shang and Mai will die.

154
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,510
Forget it.

155
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,410
Sir, tell me what should we do?

156
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,930
I've thought about it.

157
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,270
We'll send troops in the name of surppressing bandits.

158
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:35,790
Okay.

159
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,830
Tell me.

160
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,810
Your Highness.

161
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,120
His Majesty hasn't sent anyone

162
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,580
to ask about his grandson.

163
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,190
It's not a good sign.

164
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,230
Father is busy every day.

165
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,350
He just temporary forgot.

166
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,270
Your Highness, don't lie to yourself.

167
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,470
Why don't you come up with a plan sooner?

168
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,590
One.

169
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,470
Two.

170
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,880
Three.

171
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:11,870
Four.

172
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,710
So noisy.

173
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,120
I spoke too much.

174
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,080
Forgive me, Your Highness.

175
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,440
In your opinion,

176
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,790
how is the situation now?

177
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,950
Your Highness ordered your son to learn from General Mai

178
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,030
is indeed a good move.

179
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,880
When His Majesty issued the edict,

180
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,950
Marquis Dingnan also came to visit.

181
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,510
It shows that the generals of the Zhenbei Army

182
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,430
want to get closer to us.

183
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,910
This is a gain.

184
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,670
But recently, the Second Prince

185
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,350
has been very close to the officials.

186
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,550
I'm afraid someone has already offered their services to him.

187
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,550
This is a loss.

188
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,110
I think something is going to happen in the Shengdu City.

189
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,550
If the Second Prince took the chance to win His Majesty's heart,

190
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,790
we will be in danger.

191
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,870
For the sake of the crown princess and your son,

192
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,990
Your Highness should deal with it as soon as possible.

193
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,790
Nonsense.

194
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,670
As long as Yu is here,

195
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,790
I'll win His Majesty's heart.

196
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,790
Don't talk nonsense.

197
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,290
I've crossed the line.

198
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,110
I am guilty.

199
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,470
Your arms must be straight and flat.

200
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,270
Do you hear me?

201
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,470
Hang in there.

202
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,470
Young Master.

203
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,330
Don't help him.

204
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,010
Since you want to learn martial arts,

205
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,490
you shouldn't be that delicate and arrogant.

206
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,590
Get up if you fall down.

207
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,670
I can do it myself.

208
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,110
Don't come over.

209
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,990
Master Mai, again.

210
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,770
Your Highness,

211
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,190
I have something to do today.

212
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,910
May I leave?

213
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,350
Then teach me tomorrow.

214
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,750
Okay, let's practice tomorrow.

215
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,250
Thank you, Your Highness.

216
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,830
Do you like the scenery here, Cousin?

217
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,550
Clear water, green mountains, and music that is pleasant to the ears.

218
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,810
I've been immersed in the music just now.

219
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,670
Please don’t mind.

220
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,270
Don’t joke.

221
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,510
With your great reputation in Shengdu,

222
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,840
you've probably seen everything.

223
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,920
I haven't been back for a long time.

224
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,830
Sorry.

225
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,140
If you like it,

226
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,710
I'll buy this yard and give it to you.

227
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,910
You can't do that.

228
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,980
I can't accept a reward without contributions.

229
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,130
I heard that when you came back to Shengdu this time,

230
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,300
my brother

231
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,470
sent a lot of gifts to your mansion.

232
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,410
So my brother can send you gifts

233
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,920
but I can't?

234
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,790
Well...

235
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,800
You must have a favor to ask for coming back.

236
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,230
I can do whatever the crown prince can.

237
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,350
If there is something the crown prince can't do,

238
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,550
I promise,

239
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,630
I will do it for you in the future.

240
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,510
I'm very sincere.

241
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,460
You are a smart man.

242
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,330
You know how to choose.

243
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,380
I can only say

244
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,510
you probably don't understand how uneasy it is for me.

245
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,440
I do understand.

246
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,130
It looks like you don’t believe what I am capable of.

247
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,350
No.

248
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,230
I heard that General Mai went to the Ministry of War

249
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,430
to check the lists but it didn't go well.

250
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,710
Is that true?

251
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,520
It's not that important.

252
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,160
It doesn’t matter if it’s sooner or later.

253
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,710
The Zhenbei Army is a big family.

254
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,710
If you can't check the list,

255
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,950
you will not get pay.

256
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,190
They are warriors who sacrifice their lives for the country.

257
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,950
I can't bear to see them suffer.

258
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,430
Take this

259
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,540
to the Ministry of War and find the Primary Assistant Minister Wang Jian.

260
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,590
I think this will be useful.

261
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,190
Thank you, Second Cousin.

262
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,910
We are family.

263
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,790
No need to thank me.

264
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,030
I hope next time I see you,

265
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,430
you'll make the right decision.

266
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,160
Since Your Majesty knew it was Prince Kang,

267
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,490
why did you still punish the crown prince?

268
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:13,040
A few days ago, Yu took Mai as his master.

269
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,510
I've heard about it too.

270
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,990
But the crown prince has always been benevolent and filial piety.

271
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,720
This must be what Your Majesty's grandson wants.

272
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,390
Do you think I'll be suspicious?

273
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,950
I dare not.

274
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,200
All the princes in the royal family

275
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,310
are interested in this chair.

276
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,310
It's understandable.

277
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,070
What they are doing wrong is

278
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,670
putting all the efforts

279
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,590
in wining over Marquis Dingnan.

280
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,910
Two princes, born in the palace

281
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,510
and raised by women,

282
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,710
are interested in military power.

283
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,590
But they never thought about

284
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,350
whether they could keep

285
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,750
those elite soldiers under their control.

286
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,860
If they do it well,

287
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,750
It's the icing on the cake.

288
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,190
If they fail,

289
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,350
they will bring disaster upon themselves.

290
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,790
Both of the princes are talented.

291
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,030
They are the descendant of the royal families.

292
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,940
And with Your Majesty's suppression,

293
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,540
Marquis Dingnan wouldn't dare to do anything.

294
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,070
Prime Minister Lin,

295
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,110
you always say nice things.

296
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,030
In fact, it's the truth.

297
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,940
I tried to kill him many times

298
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,960
but he avoided.

299
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,310
This time, he has become the crown prince's people.

300
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,829
Of course, I won't let him off.

301
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,230
I won't let him grow.

302
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,150
What my second son did may be clumsy,

303
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,720
it doesn't hinder me from taking the chance

304
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,069
to teach the crown prince some lessons.

305
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,510
Prince Kang is ambitious.

306
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,880
How could His Majesty not know?

307
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,160
How could His Majesty not know.

308
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,230
He knows

309
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,310
about my two cousins' nature better than us.

310
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,100
He didn't do anything to me

311
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,510
because in his eyes,

312
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,870
I'm like a big giant grindstone.

313
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,480
You mean

314
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,510
he wants to use Prince Kang and crown prince as knife to kill you?

315
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,910
The reason they are trying to win us over

316
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,770
is because of our military power.

317
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,760
But have you ever thought

318
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,440
no matter who wins or loses,

319
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,180
whoever loses will kill us.

320
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,260
But no matter what the result is,

321
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,590
His Majesty will always be happy to see it.

322
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,680
The father and sons of this royal family are really scheming.

323
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,590
That's not right.

324
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,150
When I asked you to read The Art of War,

325
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,480
why didn't you have this kind of thinking?

326
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,990
I must have taught you seriously

327
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,450
but you didn't study hard.

328
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,950
You're good at fighting.

329
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,410
How could I not be serious?

330
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,510
It's just about my childhood experience.

331
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,150
Naturally, I'm aware of

332
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,420
the imperial strategies.

333
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,030
Learn something good.

334
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,230
I'll go to the Ministry of War

335
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,960
to see if the face of this second prince is useful.

336
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,310
Please follow me.

337
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,200
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

338
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,590
Here are the initial lists of each army when they were established.

339
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,630
The Qingzhou and Yuzhou Army established early.

340
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,760
It's a long time ago.

341
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,990
Do you need me to send some men here?

342
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:30,870
No need.

343
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,030
I can find it myself.

344
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,720
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

345
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,230
General Mai, help yourself.

346
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,040
[Jingyang Army]

347
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,330
[Record of deployment]

348
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,600
[Jingyang Army]

349
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,440
You said he entered the Ministry of War

350
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,090
with Prince Kang's letter?

351
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,110
Your Highness,

352
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,630
yes.

353
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,270
Fine. You may leave.

354
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,050
Your Highness.

355
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,990
It seems that Prince Kang has people in the Ministry of War.

356
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,070
So I'm wondering, among the six ministries,

357
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,400
how many of them are Prince Kang's people?

358
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,890
We must take precautions.

359
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,850
Your Highness.

360
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,150
Mr. Yang is right.

361
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,930
Prince Kang has long been ambitious.

362
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,990
If he can win over Marquis Dingnan

363
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,710
and gain the military power of the Zhenbei Army,

364
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,170
he will definitely fight against the Crown Prince's Mansion.

365
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,000
Your Highness, you can't just sit and watch.

366
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,830
This brother

367
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,200
is really a jerk.

368
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,370
Your Highness.

369
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,870
Anger is bad for your health.

370
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,710
I think it's not clear yet.

371
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,480
Don't jump to conclusions.

372
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,230
It's obvious that Marquis Dingnan thought Your Highness were grounded

373
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,270
and had lost his power,

374
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,230
so he immediately turned to Prince Kang.

375
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,960
A chameleon like him

376
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,270
will have no excuses.

377
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,630
What Mr. Yang said makes sense.

378
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,910
But these days,

379
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,570
I saw the scene of General Mai teaching your son.

380
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,910
General Mai has never been perfunctorily.

381
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,510
From a small part we may recognize the whole.

382
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,430
So I think

383
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,230
Marquis Dingnan may be shaken,

384
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,270
but he may not have betrayed Your Highness.

385
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,350
Why don't you fight for it?

386
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,150
You're right.

387
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,270
I was impatient.

388
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,530
Your Highness.

389
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,070
I still don't understand one thing.

390
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,270
If Marquis Dingnan

391
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,000
really went to check the list of the Zhenbei Army,

392
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,750
it's not necessary that he has to go to the Ministry of War.

393
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,230
He can find another way.

394
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,150
But he was very determined

395
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,350
to go there.

396
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,390
I'm afraid there's another reason.

397
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,270
Look into it.

398
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,000
See what the people of Marquis Dingnan's Mansion

399
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,230
are looking for when they go to the Ministry of War.

400
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,160
Yes.

401
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,220
[Record of entry and exit of the archives room]

402
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,690
What happened?

403
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,600
I've looked into these files

404
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,720
but none of it has ever mentioned the Xuanwu Army.

405
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,400
Could Chen Qi have deceived you?

406
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,350
I still want to finish reading all these files.

407
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,910
After you finish teaching these days,

408
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,110
I'll accompany you to the Ministry of War to investigate.

409
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,120
I don’t believe

410
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,080
with our intelligence,

411
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,440
we can't find out anything?

412
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,350
With your intelligence?

413
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,030
Can't you see that I've read

414
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,090
this file already?

415
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,630
I-I'm sorry.

416
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:02,790
Your Highness.

417
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,050
Mr. Xu wants to see you.

418
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,190
Greetings, Princess Shenghua.

419
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,120
Mr. Xu.

420
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,950
I'm sorry for

421
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,310
keeping you in Qingzhou these years.

422
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,830
I, Jing, am gladly endure hardships.

423
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,110
How was your trip?

424
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,110
As soon as I received your message,

425
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,110
I immediately deployed troops

426
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,110
in the name of suppressing bandits.

427
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,470
The army broke up into parts in the mountain

428
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,670
and entered Shengdu.

429
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,950
General Tang led his troops to wait 20 miles outside the city.

430
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,990
I entered the city first.

431
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,590
Thank you.

432
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,190
I'm just worried that

433
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,240
it's hard to explain to Young Marquis.

434
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,790
Yizhi has made great progress after leaving Shengdu for so long.

435
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,590
It's time for him to understand.

436
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,650
It doesn't matter.

437
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,600
I'll talk to him.

438
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,840
Young Marquis has achieved this much

439
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,310
is because of Mai.

440
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,270
Yeah.

441
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,110
Mai is handsome and talented.

442
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,120
Her personality is free and easy like a man.

443
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,270
I like it very much.

444
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,800
Moreover, she is very intelligent and knows the art of war.

445
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,590
She can assist Yizhi in the future.

446
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,870
Although her status is a minus,

447
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,930
it doesn't matter.

448
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,190
It’s good that she doesn’t have relatives.

449
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,990
Don’t you know Mai’s background?

450
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,760
Isn't she

451
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,830
an orphan?

452
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,790
Mai isn’t a commoner.

453
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,270
She’s from a noble family.

454
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,150
Unfortunately, her family has declined.

455
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,320
Which family did she come from?

456
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,760
She is the daughter of Duke Shengguo, Han Maisui.

457
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,890
Your Highness.

458
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,780
The daughter of Duke Shengguo is still alive.

459
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,960
It's been more than ten years.

460
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,690
She wanted to find the enemy who killed her family

461
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,150
and avenge her parents who were killed.

462
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,830
How impressive.

463
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,050
Good deeds will be rewarded and bad deeds will be punished.

464
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,910
Yu's kung fu is quite impressive lately.

465
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,170
It's all thanks to General Mai.

466
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,670
I’m flattered.

467
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,670
It’s my duty.

468
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,200
I heard you’ve been investigating the Xuanwu Army.

469
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,670
Have you?

470
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,590
W-We were just bored.

471
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,920
We were just looking around.

472
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,720
Who would have thought that Your Royal Highness would hear about it?

473
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,310
When I was young, there was a guard

474
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,340
without a name.

475
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,430
Everyone calls him Qi.

476
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,160
There was an obvious scar on his face.

477
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,640
Later, he was transferred away by the army

478
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,550
then there was no news about him.

479
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,920
I was curious so I sent someone to investigate.

480
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,790
It's the Xuanwu Army you two are investigating.

481
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,350
Do you know where he is now?

482
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,630
If you need,

483
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,510
I can send someone to investigate further.

484
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,270
Yes.

485
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,820
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

486
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,150
General Mai, you're welcome.

487
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,920
It's too sudden.

488
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,550
I didn't expect

489
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,640
the crown prince has information

490
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,270
about the Xuanwu Army.

491
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,430
If we find Qi,

492
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,090
we'll know everything that happened back then.

493
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,990
I can accompany you.

494
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,270
But there are many people in the palace.

495
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,070
Go home.

496
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,660
Control yourself.

497
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,770
Let's have a drink.

498
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,430
Sure. I'll prepare some dishes.

499
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,390
Here.

500
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,230
Cheers.

501
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:53,910
Cheers.

502
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,550
Drink.

503
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,990
One more.

504
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,510
Mother.

505
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,430
Did you drink?

506
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,550
I'm in a bad mood.

507
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,310
I had a few drinks.

508
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,870
The front yard is so lively.

509
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,270
I can hear General Mai's laughter from

510
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,470
my Luoxia Pavilion.

511
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,650
It's exactly because of this.

512
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,910
Mother.

513
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,510
Do you remember my father's personal guard, Uncle Qi?

514
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,190
The one with a scar on his face.

515
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,160
You've already found this.

516
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:44,040
Is the Xuanwu Army really related to my father?

517
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,430
Yes.

518
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,210
The commander in chief of the Xuanwu Army is your father.

519
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,960
Then Mai’s father...

520
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,390
Back then,

521
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,870
your father brought a group of elites

522
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,920
disguised as Beimo people.

523
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,910
Chen Qi, the adopted son of Duke Shengguo, led them

524
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,080
to kill Duke Shengguo and his wife.

525
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,070
So your father

526
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,470
killed Mai’s father.

527
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,760
No way.

528
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,870
Why did my father do that?

529
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,550
I wanted to hide it from you.

530
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,950
I didn't expect you to find this part so soon.

531
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,260
Does General Mai know the relationship between Qi and us?

532
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,560
I didn't mention it.

533
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,470
Fine.

534
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,310
Actually, I also like

535
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,200
the person you like.

536
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,500
But you’ve already found this.

537
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,590
Mai is smart.

538
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,500
She won’t miss this clue.

539
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,950
You can't wrap fire in paper.

540
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,560
We should plan for it as soon as possible.

541
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,550
Mother.

542
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,550
You have to help me now.

543
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,670
What do you plan to do?

544
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,590
I plan to

545
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,790
hide it from her forever.

546
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,550
Mu Bai.

547
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:40,830
Yes.

548
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,270
Tell the kitchen

549
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,310
to prepare a bowl of hangover soup for our great General Mai.

550
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,030
Look.

551
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,790
She's so upset.

552
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:48,790
Yes.

553
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,590
I was careless last night.

554
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,310
Did I disturb anyone?

555
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,240
I don't think so.

556
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,600
It's just...when I went to visit Mother this morning,

557
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,350
she had dark circles under her eyes.

558
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,750
I wonder if it was because of you last night.

559
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,350
Really?

560
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,070
I didn't leave any good impression.

561
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,950
I'll apologize to her.

562
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,070
If you go now,

563
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,110
you'll wake her up.

564
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,240
It's the right time.

565
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,310
Well...

566
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,080
I...

567
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,400
What should I do?

568
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,310
Why are you laughing?

569
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,750
Just kidding.

570
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,550
I'll teach you a lesson when I sober up.

571
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,570
Young Marquis.

572
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,170
Young Marquis.

573
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,820
There's a letter from the crown prince.

574
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,790
Please open it yourself.

575
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,470
Thank you.

576
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,280
East Market.

577
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,600
You're looking for him?

578
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,910
This is his stall.

579
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,750
It's been vacant for a while.

580
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,240
Why did he suddenly die?

581
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,270
He used to be a strong man.

582
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,430
A few days ago, he was bitten by a poisonous snake

583
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,690
and couldn't be saved.

584
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,950
He's already burned down.

585
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,350
Does he have any relatives?

586
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,590
He has no friends or descendants.

587
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,470
What a pity.

588
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,640
Why are you more depressed than me?

589
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,030
I'm depressed for you.

590
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,030
Life is like this.

591
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,590
Nothing will go your way.

592
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,469
Let it be.

593
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,840
I thought after today,

594
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,429
I can know the truth.

595
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,219
Everything will be fine.

596
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,050
It's getting late.

597
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,429
Go back first.

598
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,270
I want to be alone.

599
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,750
Yizhi.

600
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,150
Mother.

601
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,930
Did she suspect anything?

602
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,160
Everything is predetermined.

603
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,930
How about going to the temple with me to offer incense tomorrow?

604
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,540
Grandfather.

605
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:06,900
Yu.

606
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,140
Yu.

607
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,100
Yu.

608
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,900
Yu.

609
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,690
Why did you come at this time?

610
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,070
Yu just finished school

611
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,270
so I came to visit you.

612
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,990
You are not here

613
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,470
to plead for your father?

614
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,910
No.

615
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,520
I will be punished if I do something wrong.

616
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,710
Now that Father makes you angry,

617
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,570
naturally he should be punished.

618
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,950
What If I

619
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,350
really punished your father,

620
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,350
you

621
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,070
shouldn't beg for mercy.

622
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,420
Can I ask you

623
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,550
why Father made you angry?

624
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,270
I also want to ask you something.

625
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:51,990
Come.

626
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,710
Let me ask you.

627
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,350
Why did your father find Mai Sui

628
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,110
to be your teacher?

629
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,420
You knew

630
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,310
Master Mai became my master?

631
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,790
Of course.

632
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,910
Grandfather, have you ever met Master Mai?

633
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,230
Let me tell you.

634
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,710
Although I am in the palace,

635
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,630
I've heard about his achievements.

636
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,030
I've always admired him.

637
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,410
That's why I asked my father to ask Master Mai to teach me martial arts.

638
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,390
Really?

639
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,430
Is it really your idea?

640
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,310
Yes.

641
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,830
I want to be a general like Master Mai.

642
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,270
In the future, I'll fight the enemies and protect Nanxia.

643
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:49,430
Did your master meet someone

644
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,470
in the Crown Prince's Mansion?

645
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,150
No.

646
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,430
Master Mai only came to the Crown Prince's Mansion for two hours.

647
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,070
He left the palace after class.

648
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,350
Even my mother hasn't seen him often.

649
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,150
Why did you mention this?

650
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,610
Can you stop punishing me?

651
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,550
No.

652
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,760
But I can let you choose how to punish him.

653
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,830
It's usually he punishes me.

654
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,510
How can I punish him?

655
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,150
You can do it because I say so.

656
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,430
How did he punish you?

657
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,690
I'll take revenge for you.

658
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,390
When I do something wrong,

659
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,130
my father will ask me to copy characters.

660
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,470
Copy characters?

661
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,150
Okay.

662
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:41,470
Then we will let your father copy the characters.

663
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,590
Okay?

664
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,870
Then I'll do it with Father.

665
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,590
Why?

666
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,790
Father once taught me

667
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,590
filial piety is the foundation of virtue.

668
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,750
Filial piety starts with serving parents;

669
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,870
it proceeds to serving the country;

670
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,070
it is completed by working and behaving within the rules of conduct.

671
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,130
Father was punished by Grandfather.

672
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,030
I want to be punished with him.

673
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,230
This is filial piety.

674
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,240
You established yourself with filial piety.

675
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,670
Grandfather approved.

676
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,670
Great.

677
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,870
I thank you on behalf of my father.

678
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,020
The end of the imperial order.

679
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,390
Receive the order.

680
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,510
Don't think too much, Your Royal Highness.

681
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,990
His Majesty just wants you

682
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,190
to calm down.

683
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,910
Your Highness raised Yu well.

684
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,670
His Majesty is very happy.

685
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,410
Thank you for your advice.

686
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,470
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

687
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,150
I’m leaving.

688
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,350
Mai.

689
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,850
I know you’re in a bad mood,

690
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,710
so I asked the kitchen to prepare porridge for you.

691
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,560
Ask them for whatever you want.

692
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,810
Are you going out?

693
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,560
I want to go to the morgues in Shengdu City.

694
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,390
Didn't Qi have no offspring?

695
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,390
His body must be in a morgue.

696
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,510
I want to check if there's any clue.

697
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,110
I thought you were still sad.

698
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,160
Sad?

699
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,510
I'm sad indeed.

700
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,230
But I will tell myself

701
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,420
it's better to have clues than without clues.

702
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,810
But there are so many morgues.

703
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,110
Can you find him?

704
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,970
I'll just check one by one.

705
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,550
I'll go to the East Market first.

706
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,120
Go offering incense with Princess Shenghua.

707
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,980
Leave me alone.

708
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,490
The end of the imperial order.

709
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,830
I, Qi Min, receive the order.

710
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,510
Please report to Father.

711
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,310
I'll pack up

712
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,080
and head to the fief.

713
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,070
I wish Prince Kang a safe journey.

714
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,230
I'll take my leave.

715
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,470
Goodbye, Mr. Deng.

716
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,230
I didn't expect my father to be so cruel.

717
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,990
I thought he figured it out after he confined the crown prince

718
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,920
and wanted to pass the throne to me.

719
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,620
I didn't expect...

720
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,950
I didn't expect that he cut the ground from under my foot.

721
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,030
That's why your father

722
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,110
is the emperor.

723
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,830
You need to learn slowly.

724
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,110
I'm afraid he won't give me the time

725
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,040
to learn slowly.

726
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,840
Master Pang,

727
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,030
what should we do?

728
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,350
Didn't your father

729
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,190
has already given you a clear way?

730
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,390
A clear way?

731
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,030
A fiefdom?

732
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,230
No.

733
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,630
No, no, no.

734
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,350
A clear way...

735
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,770
Cutting the ground under my foot.

736
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,870
Cutting the ground under my foot.

737
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,810
Cutting the ground under my foot.

738
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,270
I'm sick.

739
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:51,510
I caught a cold.

740
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,740
I can leave after I recover.

741
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,230
As long as you give me time,

742
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,230
I will cut off the crown prince's ground

743
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,400
under his foot.
