[Episode 6]

4
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,110
I'll go.

5
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,350
If you go, I'll kill you now.

6
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,870
Then kill me.

7
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,470
Give my body to Chang Yuqing

8
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,550
so that he can stop thinking about it.

9
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,350
Li Erniu.

10
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,110
Calm down.

11
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,360
If you die,

12
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,190
you'll only irritate that Chang

13
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,070
and he'll vent his anger on the people.

14
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,270
That won't do either.

15
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,270
What should we do?

16
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,990
Do you want us to watch

17
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,910
those innocent people

18
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,440
die because of me?

19
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,949
We have to escape.

20
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,230
Not only do we have to escape,

21
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,950
but also let Chang know that we've escaped.

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,550
Have you found them?

23
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,310
Check over there.

24
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,020
No.

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Did you find them?

26
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,440
We need to lure Chang Yuqing to chase us

27
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,090
and leave the city with us.

28
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,030
Then they have no time to blame the people.

29
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,750
General.

30
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,230
Still no news.

31
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,470
Then why did you come back?

32
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,070
Keep looking.

33
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,310
Yes.

34
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,910
General.

35
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,310
Say it.

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,070
If we can't find them, are you really going to sack the city?

37
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,710
No.

38
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,470
Killing is just a weapon,

39
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,350
not a purpose.

40
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,180
What if the people don't believe it?

41
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,950
If they don't,

42
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,480
I endured the unfounded accusations thrown at me yesterday

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,630
for nothing.

44
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,990
I see.

45
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,630
The people are afraid of being killed.

46
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,960
So they must believe it.

47
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,750
If you've understood, go find them.

48
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,070
Yes.

49
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,150
Mr. Four.

50
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,130
What are you doing?

51
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,340
I decided to go with you.

52
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,510
Sir.

53
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,270
You are not wanted.

54
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,800
You don’t have to get involved with it.

55
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,830
I promised Mai to make the passport.

56
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,070
Of course, I’ll go with you.

57
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,640
Mr. Four. You're so righteous.

58
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,150
I just don't want to break my promise to Chunniang.

59
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,190
Raise.

60
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,230
Let's go.

61
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,790
I'll take the lead to go to the neighborhood

62
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,390
and deploy Beimo soldiers to leave the camp.

63
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,350
You must make a scene outside.

64
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,280
Don't hesitate.

65
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,770
Do you understand?

66
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,390
Mr. Four.

67
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,760
Do you have anything to tell us?

68
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,030
I left something at home.

69
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,550
Is it important?

70
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,950
It's important.

72
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,930
Then go back and get it.

73
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,470
We'll wait for you here.

74
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,140
Okay.

75
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,200
How about this?

76
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,750
I'll come back if I can make it.

77
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,510
If it's too late,

78
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,190
don't wait for me. You go first.

79
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,790
All right?

80
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,750
Take care.

81
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,670
Okay.

82
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:21,750
Stop!

83
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,340
Sergeant.

84
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,660
Why are you here alone?

85
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,010
Where is your Sergeant?

86
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,920
Earlier on, our Sergeant

87
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,400
led us to rob a rich family.

88
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,380
He asked us to carry the things back.

89
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,540
I was thinking

90
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,170
to see if there are any valuable things left.

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,330
You are really lucky.

92
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,350
Guys, did you see that?

93
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,930
Look at us.

94
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,590
We've been busy for so long.

95
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,270
Look.

96
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,380
We just caught two chickens.

97
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,370
And we were warned by Guard Mo.

98
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,230
What a bad luck.

99
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,430
What squad are you in?

100
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,100
Sergeant.

101
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,950
I am from the ninth squad.

102
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,750
The ninth squad?

103
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,910
The ninth squad.

104
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,270
Your sergeant is surnamed Liu, right?

105
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,070
Sergeant.

106
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,990
Don't mention me

107
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,230
when you see our sergeant.

108
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,030
Otherwise, he won't forgive me.

109
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,430
Don't worry. I understand.

110
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,890
You may leave.

111
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,550
Thank you, Sergeant.

112
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,720
Stop!

113
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,710
What is this?

114
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,510
This is

115
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,430
a worthless toy.

116
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,590
I just got it from

117
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,630
the rich...

118
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,710
Give it to me.

119
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,720
Not bad.

120
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,390
What are you waiting for?

121
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,430
Leave. We don't need you here.

122
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,320
I said leave!

123
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,830
Don't you understand?

124
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:08,950
Leave.

125
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,030
Let's go back for a drink.

126
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,510
Why isn't he back yet?

127
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,070
Is he back, Erniu?

128
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,910
We can't wait any longer.

129
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,270
The soldiers at the city gate will change guards.

130
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,600
Something will happen.

131
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,669
Just wait.

132
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,550
You've gone too far!

133
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,110
We can't wait any longer.

134
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,870
Just wait.

135
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,560
Have you ever thought

136
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,730
how many soldiers of Nanxia would sacrifice

137
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,660
if Li Erniu fell into the hands of the Beimo Soldiers?

138
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,950
Let's go.

139
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,650
The spy escaped from the city.

140
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,270
The spy escaped from the city!

141
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,010
Hurry up! Mount up!

142
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,470
The spy has escaped from the city. Mount up!

143
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,290
Mount up!

144
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,550
Mount up!

145
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,790
The General has ordered that since the spy has escaped from the city,

146
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,050
everyone should mount up and follow the general out of the city immediately.

147
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,140
Give me a pastry.

148
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,750
Let's go.

149
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,160
Let's go.

150
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,410
Follow the General.

151
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,430
Follow the General.

152
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,890
General.

153
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,450
A large army of cavalry left the city.

154
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,890
Who is the leader?

155
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,030
You.

156
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,790
Open the gate.

157
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,950
The General is leaving the city.

158
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,010
Don't delay the General's business.

159
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,810
Hurry, open the city gate.

160
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,370
[Yinbao]

161
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,750
Why didn't the General ride Night White today?

162
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,350
It's terrible.

163
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,400
[Yinbao]

164
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,210
Let's split into three groups. Let's go.

165
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,470
General.

166
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,560
They split up.

167
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,470
Liu San, Moyu.

168
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,110
Yes.

169
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,270
Each of you leads a group of soldiers and go search separately.

170
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,470
If you see Li Erniu,

171
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,630
don't hurt him.

172
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,270
Yes.

173
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,750
San.

174
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,870
The leader is wearing silver armor.

175
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,630
San.

176
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,540
The General has ordered

177
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,830
not to hurt Li Erniu.

178
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,670
I can't let him fall into the Nanxia people's hands.

179
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,750
I'll apologize to the General.

180
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,510
We've gotten rid of them.

181
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,610
We must have escaped.

182
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,470
Erniu.

183
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:58,950
Erniu.

184
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,140
Erniu.

185
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,050
Erniu.

186
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,320
Erniu.

187
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,480
I

188
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,970
am not afraid of death.

189
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,010
But

190
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:43,230
the whip arrow technique I've been studying all my life will be unable to pass on.

191
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,850
I... I can't accept it.

192
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,860
Erniu.

193
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,840
Mai.

194
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,730
Mai.

195
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,620
I'm here.

196
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,230
We haven't known each other for long,

197
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,790
but I know you know a lot about the whip arrow.

198
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,260
Actually...

199
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,840
the secret

200
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,620
is to carve

201
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,740
a spiral groove ascending on the outside of the arrow.

202
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:29,470
Then the arrow can fly further with the wind.

203
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,480
Mai.

204
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,890
Promise me.

205
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,270
Don't let the people in Beimo get this secret.

206
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,670
You have to carry out the whip arrow technique.

207
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,130
Understand?

208
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,250
Erniu.

209
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,250
You'll be fine. Hang in there.

210
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,290
Erniu.

211
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,900
Erniu.

212
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,370
Erniu.

213
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,850
Erniu.

214
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,020
[Yinbao]

215
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,470
How dare you shoot arrows?

216
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,080
General.

217
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,210
I couldn't catch up with Li Erniu.

218
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,910
Li Erniu possesses the secrets of weapons.

219
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,440
I would rather kill him

220
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,720
than let him fall into the hands of the Nanxia people.

221
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,780
Do you know what punishment you will get

222
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,000
for disobeying orders?

223
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,840
I'm guilty.

224
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,150
You can punish me however you want.

225
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,110
Do you think I dare not?

226
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,349
General.

227
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,609
The envoy of the Marshal wants to see you.

228
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,780
I'll deal with you later.

229
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,400
Invite the envoy in.

230
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,230
Yes.

231
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,750
Get lost!

232
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,800
Greetings, General Chang.

233
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,430
General Chang, I've been looking for you all the way.

234
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,350
I wanted to go to Qinshan to congratulate you.

235
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,110
I never expected you

236
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,790
to swagger in this remote little town.

237
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,710
I was surprised.

238
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,570
What do you know?

239
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,540
The General has his reasons

240
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,990
to be here.

241
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,860
You're just an envoy. It's not your turn

242
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,120
to talk nonsense here.

243
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,290
I know what the Marshal means.

244
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,380
Our army will depart immediately.

245
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,360
The small Qinshan can be conquered at any moment.

246
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,020
The Marshal can rest assured.

247
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,010
It’s good that you are confident.

248
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,560
Time is running out.

249
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,980
Please behave yourself.

250
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,070
Pass my order.

251
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,330
Get ready.

252
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,460
We'll set off after 11 o'clock.

253
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,100
Yes.

254
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,870
[Beimo Military Camp]

255
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,180
Where are you going?

256
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,950
Don't stop me.

257
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,230
I'm going to ask that Chen

258
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,110
[Cui Yan]

259
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,450
whether he dares to hurt my brother.

260
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,450
That Chen?

261
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,750
Show some respect. He's the Marshal.

262
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,990
Chang Yuqing is not your brother.

263
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,240
Your surname is Cui.

264
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,620
I've been following him since childhood. He is my brother.

265
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,870
Uncle, don't stop me.

266
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,120
I have to seek justice for my brother.

267
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,950
What justice? Don't make trouble.

268
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,970
My brother is not as impulsive as I am.

269
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,100
He must have his reason to attack Yinbao.

270
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,760
Then Yinbao must be attacked.

271
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,750
Why should he punish my brother?

272
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,450
So you know you're impulsive.

273
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,900
Yan, you're not young anymore.

274
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,020
Think before you act.

275
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,430
His surname is Chang. It's the Life-saving Charm.

276
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,870
What big trouble can he have?

277
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,400
What're you worried about?

278
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,100
Will my brother really be okay?

279
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,190
Chang Yuqing is the backbone

280
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,150
of the younger generation in the Chang family.

281
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,550
Can they leave him alone?

282
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,990
You should worry about yourself.

283
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,320
You're reckless and impulsive...

284
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,240
All right.

285
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,130
It's good that he'll be fine.

286
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:46,930
I’m leaving.

287
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,860
Marshal. Zhou Zhiren wants to see you.

288
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,570
Come in.

289
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,270
Greetings, Marshal.

290
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,750
General Zhou, look at this.

291
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,330
[Chen Qi, General of Beimo Army]

292
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,660
How can the scheduled distribution of soldiers' provisions

293
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,120
be unreasonably delayed?

294
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,400
His Majesty may be too young to understand military affairs.

295
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,800
But there's no one in the court to guide him.

296
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,160
What does His Majesty know?

297
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,370
Of course, it's the Chang family's idea.

298
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,230
They can even reach out to the military supply?

299
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,790
The youngest son of the third branch of the Chang family

300
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,650
married the legitimate daughter

301
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,980
of the second branch of the Zhang family two months ago.

302
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,230
The eldest son of the first branch of the Zhang family

303
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,550
is Zhang Heng, the Deputy Minister of Revenue who specializes in military supply.

304
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,390
It's not surprising that influential families in the court

305
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,720
are closely connected.

306
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,020
Marshal.

307
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,310
The Chang family also rose to prominence through military leadership.

308
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,030
They should know that delaying the provisions

309
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,490
is like delaying the battle opportunities.

310
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,550
Are they doing this

311
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,510
just to force you to pardon Chang Yuqing?

312
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,310
Yes.

313
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,470
They know the importance.

314
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,190
So they can use it as a bargaining chip to threaten me.

315
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,890
This is related to the life of all the soldiers in Beimo.

316
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,120
Don't worry, General Zhou.

317
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,550
I won't risk my soldiers' lives.

318
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,790
Chang Yuqing

319
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,500
never obeys my orders.

320
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,990
Besides, the Chang family is supporting him.

321
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,750
I can’t control him for now.

322
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,070
What I really worry about is

323
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,030
His Majesty is still young.

324
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,530
He is easily manipulated.

325
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,040
Those in the court who opposed the southern expedition

326
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
will take the chance to play tricks.

327
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,350
We must make it quick.

328
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,080
Marshal.

329
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,510
While our soldiers risk their lives on the front,

330
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,030
they are solely focused on internal conflicts.

331
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,440
What's the point of this war?

332
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,710
That’s why

333
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,750
I insist on going south.

334
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,360
When my family's glory is restored,

335
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,550
I'll surely have a place in the court.

336
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,550
You possess both civil and martial strategies.

337
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,460
How can those shortsighted individuals be compared to you?

338
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,510
I'm willing to serve you.

339
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,130
Since I have endured it for ten years,

340
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,070
why not endure it this time?

341
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,510
[Imperial edict]

342
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,060

00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,790
What’s your plan?

345
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,270
I came to Yinbao

346

to seek Four's help to go to Beimo.

347
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,240
Four is missing.

348
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,650
I can only go to Qingzhou to find my friend.

349
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,810
My friend is the Guard General of Qingzhou.

350
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,410
See if he can help me.

351
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,010
Now that Beimo people are attacking,

352
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,310
we must inform the prefectures

353
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,840
and ask them to be vigilant.

354
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,650
Mai, since you're going to Qingzhou,

355
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,110
please pass this message

356
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,070
to the Guard General of Qingzhou.

357
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,910
I'll inform the Yuzhou Army.

358
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,870
Okay, let's split up.

359
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,960
Okay.

Xiu'er.

361
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,870
How about you follow me first?

362
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,830
We'll talk about other things later.

363
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,760
Okay.

364
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Lieutenant Tang.

365
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,660
We'll see each other later.

366
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,750
We’ve been through life and death. Don't be so polite.

367
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,350
Mai.

368
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,390
Why don’t we

369
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,250
become sworn brothers here?

370
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,430
Okay.

Lieutenant Tang...

372
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,070
No.

373
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,790
I should call you Brother Tang.

374
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,720
Take it.

375
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,850
This...

376
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,680
This isn't proper.

377
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,760
It's a long way to go.

378
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,510
You need something to protect yourselves.

379
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,840
Thank you. Brother.

380
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,390
Take care.

381
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,840
Take care.

382
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,780
Mai.

383
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,350
The fish is delicious.

384
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,470
The river fish in this season is the freshest.

385
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,110
If you like it, I'll catch it for you tomorrow.

386
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,160
Are you done?

387
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:23,550
Xiu'er.

388
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,550
Tonight,

389
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,480
we'll just rest here for the night.

390
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,000
I promise you.

391
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,730
After crossing this mountain and arriving in Qingzhou,

392
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,930
I'll bring you to eat something better.

393
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,600
Go to sleep.

394
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,650
Mai.

395
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,570
Does your hand still hurt?

396
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,910
No.

397
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,640
Sorry.

398
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,110
Mai.

399
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,350
I want to live.

400
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,110
Only by following you

401
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,750
can I live.

402
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,440
I know I'm a burden

403
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,920
to you.

404
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,350
So,

405
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,640
if you abandon me,

406
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,900
I won’t blame you.

407
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,550
What are you thinking about?

408
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,760
I won't abandon you.

409
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,790
Count the stars if you can't sleep.

410
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,590
Mai, do you know?

411
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,140
I used to watch stars

412
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,270
with my mother.

413
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,490
Do you miss her?

414
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,280
Xiu'er.

415
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,470
Have you heard of a legend?

416
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,270
The dead

417
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,950
will turn into stars in the sky.

418
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,470
Look.

419
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,690
They are over there

420
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,130
watching you,

421
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,210
accompanying you,

422
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
and guarding you.

423
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,790
So you're not lonely.

424
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,870
Mai.

425
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,960
Mai.

426
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,430
Mai.

427
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,630
Xiu'er.

428
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,830
Look what I found.

429
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,120
Wild bamboo shoots.

430
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,190
Well...

431
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,720
Why are you crying?

432
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,100
Did you think

433
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,280
I left you alone?

434
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,370
You're not that kind of person.

435
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,920
Then why are you crying?

436
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,500
Just kidding.

437
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,040
Go wash your face by the river

438
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,090
and come back to eat bamboo shoots.

439
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:27,650
Okay.

440
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,280
Go.

441
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,030
[Crown Prince Qi Jing]

442
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,610
[Second Prince Qi Min]

443
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,590
I heard that someone from Beimo attacked us.

444
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,110
Father.

445
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,990
A few days ago, a Beimo army

446
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,230
sneaked into Nanxia,

447
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,700
attacked Yinbao City,

448
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,830
and went missing after looting.

449
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,410
Yinbao City?

450
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,790
Your Majesty,

451
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,630
this city used to be a military town.

452
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,530
Most of the weapons were from here.

453
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,770
But it was during the previous dynasty.

454
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,610
They no longer produce weapons.

455
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,730
I don't know why the people of Beimo attacked this city.

456
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,230
The two of you.

457
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,510
What do you think?

458
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,110
Father.

459
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,400
I think

460
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,790
no matter what their purpose is,

461
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,790
the people of Beimo can

462
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,400
appear in Nanxia quietly

463
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,030
and leave quietly.

464
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,230
It's creepy.

465
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,830
We should take precautions.

466
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,660
Brother,

467
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,850
do you think the Beimo army will go south?

468
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,940
I think it's possible.

469
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,400
Sergeant.

470
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,320
How long do we have to investigate in the mountain?

471
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,160
The rules of the Beimo scouting camp don't allow us

472
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,560
to return empty-handed.

473
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,000
We didn't even meet a single soldier from Nanxia.

474
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,330
If we go back empty-handed,

475
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,260
we will be punished by the Marshal.

476
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,170
All right. Cheer up.

477
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,680
Make contributions soon.

478
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,280
Xiu'er.

479
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,750
I found some Beimo soldiers.

480
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,080
We have to leave here.

481
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,330
Don't be afraid.

482
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,470
I won't let them get close to you.

483
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,110
Let's go.

484
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,420
Search carefully.

485
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,690
Don't miss any marks.

486
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,610
Follow me.
