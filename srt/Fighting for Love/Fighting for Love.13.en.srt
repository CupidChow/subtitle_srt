[Episode 13]

4
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,210
-Mai.
-Tang...

5
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,850
I knew it's you judging from the figure.

6
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,820
Let's go.

7
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,390
I'm going to show you something good.

8
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:03,920
Let's go.

9
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,490
Sit, Brother Tang.

10
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,150
Sit. Sit.

11
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,270
Do you feel warmer?

12
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,280
Why did someone ask you to be on night duty

13
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,880
on your first day in the army?

14
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,620
Did someone bully you?

15
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,670
No.

16
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,670
Okay.

17
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,600
If someone bullies you,

18
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,960
remember to tell me.

19
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,980
In troubled times,

20
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,960
a military camp is a man's home.

21
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,100
Comrades are men's families.

22
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,790
How much did you drink?

23
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,550
Not much.

24
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,270
I'm happy today.

25
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,430
My two brothers in Yinbao City

26
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,960
came to join the army today.

27
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,320
Just now,

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
we drank some wine

29
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,280
and talked about our past in Yinbao City.

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,200
Back then,

31
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,870
I made a promise.

32
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,230
It's fine if Beimo people don't invade Yinbao City.

33
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,270
If they invade Yinbao City,

34
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,030
I will kill them all

35
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,760
and make them retreat to Beimo.

36
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,030
But what happened in the end?

37
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm incompetent.

38
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,150
I broke my promise.

39
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,670
Brother Tang,

40
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,870
you killed enemies bravely in Yinbao City.

41
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,920
I saw it.

42
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,380
Mai,

43
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,070
do you know

44
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,130
what the armor you are wearing means?

45
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,710
What does it mean?

46
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,520
It just means I'm a soldier, right?

47
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,029
Then do you know what it means to be a soldier

48
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,769
and what a battlefield means?

49
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,760
I'm not afraid of death.

50
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,110
Brother Tang,

51
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,910
I never told you this.

52
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,790
I have lived alone

53
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,400
since I was 10 years old.

54
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,230
We are in troubled times now.

55
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,909
Maybe one day,

56
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,350
I'll die on the street.

57
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,880
I'm willing to be a soldier.

58
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,440
I can be with you by being a soldier.

59
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,000
I've been thinking.

60
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,070
If one day,

61
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,030
I die in a war against Beimo,

62
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,070
can you help me retrieve my body?

63
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,710
Mai,

64
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,350
trust me.

65
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,550
It won't take long

66
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,840
for us to defeat the Beimo Army.

67
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,450
After you and I earn some military exploits,

68
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,190
we'll retire.

69
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,670
Then let's go to the countryside,

70
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,270
and I'll get you a wife.

71
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,750
One is not enough.

72
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,290
I'll get you 8 or 10 wives.

73
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,510
You can have 8 or 10 wives.

74
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,470
One is enough for me.

75
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,790
Fear not the want of armor,

76
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,710
for mine is also yours to wear.

77
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,710
Fear not the want of armor,

78
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,000
for mine is also yours to wear.

79
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,830
Erdan.

80
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,640
Get up. It's your turn to be on duty.

81
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:06,960
Mai.

82
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,270
What's so stinky?

83
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,750
Why are you crying?

84
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,720
What are you doing?

85
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,100
An amulet.

86
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,150
An eye for an eye.

87
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,220
I'm going to suffocate you with this.

88
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,830
What?

89
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,110
You think we stink,

90
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,190
so you won't sleep in the bed, right?

91
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,560
If you don't like it,

92
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,960
you can sleep outside every day.

93
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,990
What's this smell?

94
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,760
What's this smell?

95
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,570
Did someone kick the chamber pot down?

96
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,860
Assemble!

97
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,480
Hurry! Assemble in the drill ground!

98
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,630
Let's go.

99
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,710
Go.

100
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,080
Go.

101
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,470
Go.

102
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,070
Go.

103
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,230
Go.

104
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,060
Go.

105
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,110
Go.

106
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,080
Go.

107
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,930
What's this smell?

108
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,030
Bro, I don't know.

109
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,070
Go.

110
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,840
Don't get distracted during training.

111
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,070
Mai.

112
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:09,990
Yes.

113
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,650
Good job.

114
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,430
Continue.

115
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,430
Okay.

116
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,830
Go.

117
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,710
I can't

118
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,310
lift my arms.

119
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,590
Take a break.

120
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,750
This is not right.

121
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,940
Everyone, stand up.

122
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,030
Why has this smell

123
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,820
been following us?

124
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,220
Did someone step on shit?

125
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,430
Come on. Take a look at your feet.

126
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,190
No.

127
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,950
Take a look at your feet.

128
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,430
Yes. This smell does exist.

129
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,490
It really is not me.

130
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,530
Don't move.

131
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,430
You stink!

132
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,460
What's the smell on you?

133
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,340
What's this smell?

134
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,210
It's so smelly.

135
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,190
I...

136
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,830
Don't move!

137
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,950
Don't come over.

138
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,510
I...

139
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,070
Stand there.

140
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,530
Take three steps back now.

141
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,110
Sorry, everyone.

142
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,000
I've been having a strange smell since I was a kid.

143
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,090
My bed is in there,

144
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,180
so I didn't dare to go in last night.

145
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,670
I slept on the bench last night.

146
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,670
Sergeant saw it.

147
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,590
Move your stuff

148
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,430
to the bed at the entrance now.

149
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,280
Move... Move your stuff away.

150
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,120
No.

151
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,890
The bed at the entrance is perfect for enjoying the wind.

152
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,420
Why are you giving it to him?

153
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,250
I'm gonna kick you to death.

154
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,790
Can't you make a sacrifice

155
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,510
and think for us?

156
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,950
That's right.

157
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,550
He stinks. If he doesn't sleep at the entrance,

158
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,550
the smell won't dissipate, right?

159
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,470
This... This is not proper.

160
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,440
How about...

161
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,790
Cut the crap. Hurry up.

162
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,070
Fine.

163
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,130
Hurry... Hurry up.

164
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,680
Okay.

165
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,830
This smell...

166
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,330
Move. Move to that bed now.

167
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,310
Thank you.

168
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,520
Erdan,

169
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,340
you two are new here.

170
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,190
Move your beds over there, so that it'll be more convenient for you to communicate.

171
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,750
Okay.

172
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,950
Mai, move your bed.

173
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,950
I'm going to get more training.

174
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,030
-Me too.
-Me too.

175
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,740
-Wait for me.
-Wait for me.

176
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,430
Let's go.

177
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,200
Erdan,

178
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,630
you can stand the smell on me?

179
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,430
Yes.

180
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,440
Sergeant.

181
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,190
Sergeant.

182
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,210
Sergeant.

183
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,430
It's time for me to take over the shift.

184
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,070
I can't go.

185
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,790
You sleep.

186
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:29,690
It's okay.

187
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:03,850
Mai.

188
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,370
Sergeant.

189
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,420
Do you admit your mistake?

190
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,260
Please enlighten me.

191
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,580
You are overambitious.

192
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,530
I just criticized you yesterday.

193
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,710
Even though you want to demonstrate your capabilities

194
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,230
to gain a firm foothold in the battalion,

195
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,960
you should know what you should and shouldn't do.

196
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,080
Look at yourself.

197
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,350
You were on duty alone all night,

198
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,150
and now you have no energy at all.

199
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,780
Is it funny?

200
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,990
You are right.

201
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,590
Don't worry.

202
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,390
It won't affect the training.

203
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,350
Enough.

204
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,530
Stop bragging.

205
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,830
We'll know

206
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,880
after we go to the drill ground.

207
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,480
Okay.

208
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,430
I can't hear you.

209
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,900
Okay!

210
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,520
Mai,

211
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,910
you were scolded by Sergeant

212
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,370
because I failed to get up.

213
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,260
It's okay.

214
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,110
You have finished washing up?

215
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,710
Yes.

216
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,150
Let's go.

217
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,360
Let's go for the training since we have finished washing up.

218
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,630
The training starts now.

219
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,810
Go.

220
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,130
Take this.

221
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,670
The sandbag formation is a basic training program.

222
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,010
If you can't even master the basic skills,

223
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,600
how can you kill enemies in the future?

224
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,210
Especially you.

225
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,750
You were the first one who made a mistake.

226
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,950
Your comrade failed too because of you.

227
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,630
He couldn't dodge them in time.

228
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,110
If we were on the battlefield now,

229
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,270
you would have died.

230
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,790
Do you accept your punishment?

231
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,150
Yes.

232
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,670
Run 10 laps around the drill ground after the training.

233
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,470
Wait.

234
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,850
There must be another reason for this.

235
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,540
General, do you mean I'm wrong?

236
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,390
Of course you are wrong.

237
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,430
They are new here.

238
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,990
It's inevitable for them to make mistakes.

239
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,830
If they make a mistake, they should be punished. Why am I wrong?

240
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,950
It's my fault.

241
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,960
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

242
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,490
You...

243
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,430
Fine.

244
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,200
Then run a few more laps.

245
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,900
Let's go.

246
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,370
Who is Lu Gang?

247
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,440
Did you see

248
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,030
how he... he...

249
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,310
he talked... talked to me just now?

250
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,510
-I'm pissed off.
-But...

251
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,590
Lu Gang was right.

252
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,190
Mai just joined the army.

253
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,510
Of course he should be strict with Mai.

254
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,160
And?

255
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,450
Train him well.

256
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,790
You are not on my side, right?

257
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,470
Stand here.

258
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,000
You are not allowed to go in.

259
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,200
How ungrateful you are!

260
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,630
What are you looking at?

261
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,000
Even you guys

262
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,890
are laughing at me, right?

263
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,360
General.

264
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,710
Mr. Xu.

265
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,230
Calm down.

266
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,400
Sir,

267
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,510
I went to help Mai today.

268
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,130
But she embarrassed me in public.

269
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,260
She has been in the military camp for only a few days.

270
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,390
Why has she changed?

271
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,750
I heard about it just now.

272
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,430
Don't be angry, General.

273
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,600
I want to tell you something.

274
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,470
Are you on their side?

275
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,470
No.

276
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,670
General, I'm on your side.

277
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,430
Finally, there's a wise man.

278
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,120
Go ahead.

279
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,190
General,

280
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,320
although you and Mai

281
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,630
have gone through fire and water together

282
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,870
and you are very close like brothers,

283
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,960
you are a general

284
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,760
and he's a soldier after all.

285
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,550
If Mai accepted your kindness today,

286
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,840
have you ever thought

287
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,590
what would happen to him in the future?

288
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,310
No one would bully her in the future.

289
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,910
Yes.

290
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,550
No one would dare to bully him.

291
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,910
But no one would treat him sincerely either.

292
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,070
Everyone would ostracize him.

293
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,310
He would be alone and weak.

294
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,830
Mai could go to the battlefield with the army anytime.

295
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,760
If he doesn't have trustworthy comrades around him,

296
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,470
do you think he could stay safe?

297
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,350
Besides,

298
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,470
although I don't know

299
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,830
why Mai changed his mind to stay in the army,

300
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,950
I know you hope

301
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,070
he can give full play to his abilities one day.

302
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,550
We've seen his abilities

303
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,180
to lead and dispatch troops.

304
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,230
It takes time to make him better.

305
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,670
He can only walk his path on his own.

306
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,150
You can't help him.

307
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,820
Sir,

308
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,150
you have enlightened me.

309
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,150
I see.

310
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,230
Since I can't help her,

311
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,310
I'll move to the military camp

312
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,970
to share weal and woe with her.

313
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,020
Young Marquis.

314
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,990
General. General.

315
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,390
Here.

316
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,430
Here.

317
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,030
Eat more.

318
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,390
Eat them all.

319
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,710
Come on. Hurry.

320
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,170
Eat.

321
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,520
Mai, are you okay?

322
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,470
There is no food left?

323
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,110
Mai,

324
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,500
eat mine.

325
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,790
You don't want to eat it?

326
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,030
I'm not full.

327
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,310
Are you hungry?

328
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,440
I'm hungry.

329
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,400
Come on, eat.

330
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,800
According to one of the military rules,

331
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,460
there is no food for anyone who comes back late.

332
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,630
You humiliated the Eighth Squad today.

333
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,880
Yet you still have the mood to eat?

334
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,720
Here. I'm giving you some.

335
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,750
Mai. Mai.

336
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:10,940
Mai.

337
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,310
A steamed bun.

338
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,670
I secretly saved one for you.

339
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,340
Thank you.

340
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,030
General thinks highly of you.

341
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,150
You really don't have to stay here

342
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,210
to suffer this.

343
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,290
It's just getting less food

344
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,710
and less sleep.

345
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,830
It's not a big deal.

346
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,710
Then why do you want to stay here?

347
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,390
Because of something very important.

348
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,150
What is it?

349
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,670
Every day,

350
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,990
I eat and sleep for it.

351
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,800
You've gone too far.

352
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,930
I advise you to mind your own business.

353
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
It's none of your business. Shut up.

354
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,150
Why have you been picking on Mai?

355
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,840
Why have you been bullying him?

356
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,710
The Eighth Squad never bullies newcomers.

357
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,330
But he used his connections to be here.

358
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,990
Someone like him will get you killed on the battlefield.

359
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,100
But he... he started it.

360
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,440
You, come here.

361
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,570
I just didn't want to argue with you in the past.

362
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,170
It doesn't mean I'm a coward.

363
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,810
We have training every day.

364
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,170
I failed today.

365
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,810
It doesn't mean I'll fail in the future.

366
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,040
We are brothers.

367
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,160
We should help each other

368
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,240
instead of making trouble behind each other's back.

369
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,750
Bro,

370
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,310
what should we do?

371
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,240
What do you mean?

372
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,190
I can't believe you were hurt by him.

373
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,750
I...

374
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,430
But this guy is indeed a bit dauntless.

375
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,350
How about this?

376
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,830
He'll be on duty tonight.

377
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,100
If he can make it through,

378
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,900
we won't go against him anymore.

379
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,430
Bro.

380
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,970
Train harder.

381
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,140
Look at you.

382
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,620
[Shang]

383
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,560
[Shang]

384
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,050
Young Marquis,

385
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,630
you still won't go to bed?

386
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,750
I'm used to living in my mansion.

387
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,750
Now I'm in the military camp. It's quite interesting.

388
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,520
Look.

389
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,260
There's a bed here.

390
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,190
It's so comfortable.

391
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,030
Guys,

392
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,070
let's call it a day.

393
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,870
Get some rest.

394
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,480
Let's go.

395
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:02,920
Okay.

396
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,550
Let's go.

397
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,390
Let's go take a shower

398
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,630
to cool off.

399
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,470
-Okay.
-Okay.

400
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,630
Let's go take a shower.

401
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,380
We can take a shower in broad daylight?

402
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,360
Of course.

403
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,600
We can take two showers a day in our military camp.

404
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,530
Where are we going to take a shower?

405
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,390
You follow them. They're going to reserve a seat.

406
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,230
I'll go there later.

407
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,870
Okay.

408
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,840
Mai. Mai.

409
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,590
I'm going to take a shower. Let's go together, okay?

410
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,430
Let's go together.

411
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,270
I don't like to join in the fun.

412
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:26,910
You go first.

413
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,970
Then I'm going now.

414
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,270
Let's go.

415
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,310
Take more showers

416
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,790
to cool off.

417
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,030
Slow down.

418
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,170
I really can't.

419
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,530
Let's go take a shower.

420
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,030
Wait for me.

421
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,470
Hurry up.

422
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,510
In a minute.

423
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,990
-Come on.
-Let's go.

424
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,050
-Hurry up.
-Hurry.

425
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,790
Mo, we've reserved a seat for you.

426
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,790
Reserve it for me.

427
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,360
Hurry up. Stop dillydallying.

428
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,240
I've been in poor health since I was a kid.

429
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,840
I'll get sick if I take a shower after sweating.

430
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,880
You are not going to take a shower? You just let yourself stink?

431
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,950
I... I'll just wipe my body.

432
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,040
Wipe?

433
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,110
Put me down.

434
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,070
Mai, let's go take a shower.

435
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,910
Listen, taking a shower is very comfortable.

436
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,910
-Let go of me!
-Take a shower.

437
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,670
Wait, I'm not going.

438
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,410
Wash him clean.

439
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,150
Don't come back if you don't.

440
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,150
I really can't.

441
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,760
Take a shower.

442
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,070
-Mu Bai!
-Let's go!

443
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,150
-What are you doing?
-Does General Shang...

444
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,010
Does General Shang want to see me?

445
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,830
No.

446
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,590
Go ask him.

447
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,910
He wants to see me!

448
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,190
Young Marquis, we should go.

449
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,310
The city gate will be locked if we don't go now.

450
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,840
I want to go see Mai after the training is over.

451
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,190
Mai?

452
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,010
Young Marquis,

453
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,480
can you remind Mai

454
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,160
to pay attention to personal hygiene?

455
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,840
He stinks.

456
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,810
What?

457
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,430
It's normal that men stink.

458
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,590
Stinky men, right?

459
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,190
Do you think you don't stink?

460
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,680
Have I ever despised you?

461
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,240
I understand what you mean.

462
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
Although I can stand it, they can't.

463
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,040
What do you mean?

464
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,620
Listen.

465
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,430
Something interesting happened just now.

466
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,560
Some men in the Eighth Squad carried Mai to take a shower.

467
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,950
What?

468
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,200
Take a shower?

469
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,760
I'm afraid of water.

470
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,510
Let's take a shower.

471
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,590
Stop it, everyone.

472
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,430
-I'm really afraid of water.
-Take a shower.

473
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,230
Take a shower.

474
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,320
I'm really afraid of water.

475
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,630
One.

476
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,350
Two.

477
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,380
Stop.

478
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,470
What are you doing?

479
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,870
-General.
-General.

480
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,710
General.

481
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,320
Mai,

482
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,710
I asked you to come to me.

483
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,870
Why didn't you come?

484
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,910
I was having so much fun

485
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,880
that I forgot.

486
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,070
Yes.

487
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,870
-I'm sorry, General.
-That's right, General.

488
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,790
We were just kidding.

489
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,320
-We were just kidding.
-We were just kidding.

490
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,420
Forget it.

491
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,450
I have something important to tell you.

492
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,550
You guys leave now.

493
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,830
Okay, General.

494
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,270
-Okay.
-Let's go.

495
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,920
I'm leaving too.

496
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,630
Thank you.

497
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,220
What's wrong?

498
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,760
Did something happen in the military camp?

499
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,510
You are a woman,

500
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,260
but you are with a bunch of men every day.

501
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,470
How inappropriate!

502
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,270
If I hadn't stopped you,

503
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,310
they would have taken off your clothes

504
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,630
and thrown you into the water.

505
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,830
And everyone would have seen you naked.

506
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,630
But I only saw your back.

507
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,310
Enough.

508
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,470
They didn't see my body, right?

509
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,940
If you keep staying here, someone will see your body sooner or later.

510
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,100
I know what to do.

511
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,330
What do you know?

512
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,900
I finally understand.

513
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,650
Do you want them to see your body?

514
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,410
Where are you going?

515
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,040
I can't sleep. I'm going out for a walk.

516
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,450
No need to follow me.

517
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,510
Well...

518
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,120
Mai.

519
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,910
It... It looks like you are very cold.

520
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,510
I'm not cold. The weather is nice today.

521
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,760
You're cold when I say you're cold.

522
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,110
Here, put it on.

523
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,390
Why are you here?

524
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,750
I was passing by.

525
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,710
When I looked around, I saw someone.

526
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,990
And I thought isn't this Mai?

527
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,690
So I came to say hello.

528
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,730
Why did you pass by this place?

529
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,650
Did you come for business?

530
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,480
This... This is my military camp.

531
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,830
I can go wherever I want.

532
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,670
I forgot to tell you in the daytime.

533
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,050
I have moved in.

534
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,210
We'll be neighbors from now on.

535
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,120
You have moved to the military camp?

536
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,630
Well...

537
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,230
Are you used to the hard bed?

538
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
I haven't paid attention to the bed.

539
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,670
The pillow... is not bad.

540
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,550
Pillow?

541
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,930
What trick are you playing?

542
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,680
I'm not playing with you. I'm serious.

543
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,160
I'd like to see

544
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,380
why the military camp

545
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,310
is so attractive to you.

546
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,670
You're so petty.

547
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,030
Are you still angry about what happened that day?

548
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,390
If you say so.

549
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,310
Besides, shouldn't I be angry?

550
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,420
Listen.

551
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,550
Even if you didn't help me that day,

552
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,430
they would still think

553
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,230
I joined the army because of you.

554
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,410
I don't want to cause you trouble.

555
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,150
In addition,

556
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,150
I don't want to put pressure on them.

557
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,010
If they know our relationship,

558
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,230
they will feel pressured.

559
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,030
-Fine.
-They…

560
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,470
Mr. Xu has already told me

561
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,310
what you just said.

562
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,670
Since Mr. Xu has told you,

563
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,200
why did you still come here?

564
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,070
You're confusing me.

565
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,560
There is nothing wrong.

566
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,080
I couldn't sleep because I was confused.

567
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,840
I came to see you because I couldn't sleep.

568
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,300
Everything makes sense.

569
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,370
Young Marquis,

570
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,370
you became confused after you came here.

571
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,030
Mai, can you shut up?

572
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,600
Sergeant.

573
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,110
Why aren't you sleeping?

574
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,110
You sleep.

575
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,360
Wait, Sergeant.

576
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,870
What do you want to do?

577
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,860
He didn't sleep all night

578
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,320
and didn't eat anything.

579
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,290
I'm going to take over the shift.

580
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,510
I'm worried something might go wrong during the training tomorrow.

581
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,310
I can't afford to be humiliated.

582
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,880
Sergeant.

583
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,990
What now?

584
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,910
I think you are a nice person.

585
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,310
Enough, stop talking.

586
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,970
Otherwise, I'll ask you to go.

587
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,910
You said it yourself.

588
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,030
Our relationship is nepotism, right?

589
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,900
Everyone is worried about you now.

590
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,320
They think you're reckless,

591
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,520
so they sent me here to keep an eye on you.

592
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,560
Listen.

593
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,830
If you continue to act rashly,

594
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,290
you will be flogged on the butt.

595
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,460
Are you worried about our nepotism

596
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,550
or me?

597
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,400
Neither.

598
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,630
I'm worried about...

599
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:47,860
your butt.

600
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,240
You rascal!

601
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,670
Tell me the truth.

602
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,770
Did you... you see it that day?

603
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,520
I didn't.

604
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,430
You swear.

605
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,530
I... I can't swear.

606
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,770
It was foggy that day.

607
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,500
The atmosphere was quite good.

608
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,800
Rascal!

609
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,830
You... Stop right there!

610
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,110
Stop... Stop it.

611
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,600
Stop running!

612
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,950
Enough. Come here.

613
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,880
Stop it. Be good.

614
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,830
You are playing when you are on duty.

615
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,160
I'll teach you a lesson.

616
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,520
You know what?

617
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,740
Mai and General Shang are very close.

618
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,000
Really?

619
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,150
Of course.

620
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,990
Last night, Big Bro saw them having fun together

621
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,770
when he was on patrol.

622
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,440
Has he ever done that with anyone else?

623
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,400
Listen.

624
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,100
Mai hasn't suffered much

625
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,500
since he came to the military camp.

626
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,360
Because of him,

627
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,310
even Battalion Commander Lu was scolded.

628
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,710
They are neither relatives nor old friends. Why would he treat him so well?

629
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,100
How would we know?

630
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,390
General cares a lot about him now.

631
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,420
Now that you mentioned it,

632
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,670
I think you're right.

633
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,760
Bro.

634
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,810
Tell them to keep a close eye on him when they are free.

635
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,480
I want to have something on him

636
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,690
and kick him out of the military coalition.

637
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,840
Beimo's main force entered the border from Jingyang.

638
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,590
I'm afraid the armies of the cities along the way

639
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,230
are no match for them.

640
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,480
It's like they are unhindered.

641
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,320
The emperor is inept,

642
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,450
and there are no capable generals in the court.

643
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,390
Otherwise, at least we could protect ourselves.

644
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,960
The Beimo Army is very aggressive this time.

645
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,700
Their next targets must be Qingzhou and Yuzhou.

646
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,050
Counsellor Xu,

647
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,150
what should we do?

648
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,350
Judging from the current situation,

649
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,110
only the Qingyu military coalition

650
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,570
is powerful enough to fight with the Beimo Army.

651
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,320
If we can find out

652
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,550
where the main force of the Beimo Army is in advance

653
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,880
to gain the initiative,

654
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,510
maybe we can stand a chance.

655
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,830
Sir,

656
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,430
I'm willing to go.

657
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,070
Okay.

658
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:50,560
Tang Shaoyi,

659
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,440
I'm sending you to gather information.

660
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,430
Okay.

661
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,570
What's wrong, Mai?

662
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,060
I'm here to deliver clothes to General.

663
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,660
Young Marquis is still in a meeting. Wait here.

664
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,640
Thank you, Brother Mu.

665
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,680
Don't worry.

666
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,510
Mai,

667
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,420
Young Marquis is very busy.

668
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,710
You should be self-reliant in the military camp.

669
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,440
I'm leaving.

670
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Lieutenant Tang.

671
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,550
Sir.

672
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,210
You are going to gather information on the Beimo Army.

673
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,590
If you meet their scouts,

674
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,270
don't fight with them.

675
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,190
I would prefer you to come back empty-handed

676
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,710
rather than letting them know our location.

677
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,920
If you can't find their traces,

678
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,090
come back to the camp immediately to report.

679
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,790
And we'll think of another way.

680
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,830
Yes, Sir.

681
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:44,910
I understand.

682
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,830
Mai.

683
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,260
I have a mission. I'm leaving.

684
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,510
Lieutenant Tang,

685
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,840
please show your token.

686
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,640
General Shang ordered me

687
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,830
[Shang]

688
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,110
to gather information on the Beimo Army's camp.

689
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,000
Thank you, Lieutenant Tang.

690
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,590
Okay.

691
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,820
Who are you? Show me your token.

692
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,480
I'm with the guy who just left.

693
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,790
Where is your token?

694
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,310
I'm just a nobody. I don't have a token.

695
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,780
He is Lieutenant Tang

696
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,650
and he is going to gather information on the Beimo Army, right?

697
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,830
Just let me go.

698
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:42,630
Who will be responsible if the mission is delayed?

699
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:00,800
Brother Tang.

700
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,720
Brother Tang.

701
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,740
Mai.

702
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
Why are you here?

703
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,670
The military camp is too stuffy.

704
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,990
I want to go with you to get some fresh air.

705
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,830
Did you sneak out?

706
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,200
Let's go.

707
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,430
Mai.

708
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,500
Erdan,

709
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,090
what are you doing here?

710
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:43,950
Yes, Sergeant.

711
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,990
Where's Mai?

712
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,150
I don't know.

713
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,930
You really don't know?

714
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,910
He said he went to return the clothes.

715
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,930
He hasn't come back yet.

716
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,190
He didn't have dinner.

717
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,650
I don't know where he went.

718
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,540
I just went to the gate of the camp.

719
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,470
I heard from the guards on duty that

720
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,500
not long after Lieutenant Tang left the camp,

721
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,470
a cavalry went out with him.

722
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,230
If my guess is right,

723
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,490
this cavalry is Mai.

724
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,430
Bro,

725
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,140
teach him a lesson.

726
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,820
He left the camp without permission.

727
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,670
I must teach him a lesson this time.
