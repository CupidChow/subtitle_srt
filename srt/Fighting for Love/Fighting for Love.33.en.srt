[Episode 33]

4
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,710
To inherit the throne,

5
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,470
one should be of royal blood.

6
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,910
Your Majesty, we know you have the legitimate right to be the emperor,

7
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,190
but other people do not know this.

8
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,750
If people question the legitimacy of you being the emperor,

9
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,070
there will be chaos in our country.

10
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,310
Besides,

00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,070
Prince Qi Yu is alive.

What are your thoughts?

14
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,210
I'll listen to you, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,720
I'll never disobey you.

16
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,520
Don't mention this thing again.

17
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,830
Let me think about

18
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,640
whether there'll be some other way to solve the problem.

19
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,990
You may leave.

20
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,550
I've met His Majesty.

25
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,750
Please let me in.

26
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,630
Marquis Zhongyong, it's so kind of you.

27
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,110
His Highness appreciates your kindness.

28
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,440
But it's not convenient for His Highness to see you anymore.

29
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,430
Go back and tell His Highness

30
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,110
that the nobles of Huainan Army

31
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,190
are all followers of the former Crown Prince.

32
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,910
His Majesty used to serve in the Zhenbei Army

33
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,360
so he will promote lots of soldiers of the Zhenbei Army.

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,340
We don't mean to trouble His Highness

35
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,110
but the nobles of Huainan Army cannot be dismissed.

36
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,590
But His Highness is too young.

37
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,400
Whether he's young or old, he needs to help us.

38
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,590
Go back and tell His Highness

39
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,190
that I'll be waiting here.

Marquis Zhongyong won't leave.

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,030
How about

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,670
you eat first?

45
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,880
Marquis Zhongyong is my elder.

46
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,870
Anyway, I can’t let him starve.

47
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,790
Give this to him.

48

Tell him

49
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,950
that I appreciate his kindness

50
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,310
but I am too young

00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,790

How is Marquis Zhongyong?

He died on the spot.

73
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,990
It's said that those from Crown Prince's Mansion poisoned him

74
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,320
because he disturbed them too many times.

75
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,750
But some people said

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,010
Prince Qi Yu had almost had that fish soup

77
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,110
so they suspected that someone was trying to kill Prince Qi Yu.

78
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,240
It was an accident that Marquis Zhongyong had that soup.

79
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,150
You may leave.

80
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,710

What happened to the palace recently?

82
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,190
So many accidents have happened.

How about we let her live in our mansion for some time?

87

Nonsense!

88

She is the empress. How can she leave the palace?

89
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,400
Those from Crown Prince's Mansion must have offended someone.

90

Prince Qi Yu is too smart.

We don't know whether Rou is pregnant with a boy or girl.

96
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,790
Qi Yu is a threat to the Lin family.

It has nothing to do with him.

104
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,190
I did everything on my own.

105
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,590
As long as Qi Yu is still alive...

106
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,320
How dare you!

107

Why don't you be the emperor?

108
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,910
I dare not.

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,190
I think you dare.

What should we do?

116
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,190
If His Majesty had really got angry,

117
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,430
he would have punished us.

128
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,040
You prepared some snacks for Qi Yu?

129
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,110
You father asked me to do it.

130
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,710
He said

131
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,750
you had hit the kid too hard last time.

132
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,470
You should be more friendly to Qi Yu.

133
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,230
Otherwise, people will say

134
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,190
you're a bad aunt

135
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,909
who treats a child badly.

136
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,480
If you and Qi Yu become enemies,

137
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,070
it won't be good for your child.

138
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,070
You’re right, Mother.

139
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,510
Is Mai really waiting for me outside the palace?

140
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,150
Of course.

141
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,870
Marshal Mai doesn’t want to be noticed so she didn't come.

142
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,130
She asked us to take you out of the palace.

143
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,800
Why hasn't Xing come yet?

144

We can serve you.

145
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,620
There is no need to let others follow.

Let him go!

What should we do about him?

159
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,950
Take him away.

160
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,510
Okay.

161
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,990
Your Ladyship, he's already in the carriage.

162
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,990
Is he resisting?

163
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,360
No, he's been quiet.

164

Have you searched the other rooms in the palace?

171
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,870
Yes, we have searched the whole palace.

172
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,710
Prince Qi Yu and his valet

173

are both missing.

174
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,750
The palace is heavily guarded.

175
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,010
How come they got missing all of a sudden?

Go to Prime Minister's Mansion.

Wait.

Don't worry, Your Majesty.

188
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,300
I'll take action only after I fully investigate it.

189
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,260
Leave.

Son.

192
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,020
You've lost weight.

193
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,870
Is your life difficult?

194
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,810
I haven't seen you for a long time.

195
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,490
So I got so emotional.

196
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,000
Son.

197
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,880
Take a seat.

198
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,830
Have a meal at home today.

199
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,430
I'll cook some dishes for you.

200
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,960
Mother, please wait.

201
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,750
I'm here today

202
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,730
to ask you a few questions.

203
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,310
What questions?

204
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,890
Why did you use two carriages when you came to the palace today?

205
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,910
Your sister is pregnant.

206
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,510
I brought her some snacks.

207
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,990
I knew it was not easy to go to the palace

208
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,430
so I brought a lot.

209
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,630
Son.

210
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,670
Why are you asking me this?

211
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,510
Mother.

212
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,470
You could bring things into the palace.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But you shouldn't have taken things out of the palace.

214
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,280
No matter what happened,

215
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,370
please be honest with me.

216
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,580
All right.

217
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,370
Get up.

218
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,210
Make a horse stance.

219
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,120
Hold it.

220
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,220
Straighten your waist.

221
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,750
Marshal Mai.

222
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,350
We found a letter at the door.

223
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:12,910
Bro.

224
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,390
Open it.

225
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,550
Bad news.

226
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,950
Prince Qi Yu is in danger.

227
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,720
[Come to the stage station next to the Ershili Shop in the south of the city if you want to save Prince Qi Yu.]

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,640
Mai.

229
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,590
Is it a trap?

230
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,110
[Come to the stage station next to the Ershili Shop in the south of the city if you want to save Prince Qi Yu.]

231
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,640
[Come to the stage station next to the Ershili Shop in the south of the city if you want to save Prince Qi Yu.]

232
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,960
We'll know if it is a trap only when we get there.

233
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,550
Okay.

234
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,240
I'll get some men in the camp to go with us.

235
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,880
Bro.

236
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,230
What if it's true?

237
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,990
Too many people will alert the enemies.

238
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,340
I'm afraid Qi Yu will be hurt by them.

239
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,690
Just the two of us go there.

240
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,120
Okay.

241
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,170
Prime Minister.

242
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,230
Is everything done?

243
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,370
Yes, Prime Minister.

244
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,500
Everything is done.

245
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,280
Both sides are on their way.

246
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,440
But...

247
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,990
Say it.

248
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,030
I'm worried that he'll be hurt...

249
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,270
I believe in Minshen's ability.

250
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,190
Go.

251
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,310
Yes.

252
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,270
Mu Bai.

253
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,270
It's not Prince Qi Yu.

254
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,170
Let's go to East Market

255
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,480
and see if we can find any odd jobs.

256
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,950
How I wish Mai were here.

257
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,630
If she were, we wouldn't need to do manual labor to get money for food.

258
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,230
Look.

259
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,040
If we set up a gambling stall in East Market

260
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,430
and swindle two rich foreigners,

261
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,990
we'll get enough money to buy food that we need for half a month.

262
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,480
Why did you hit me?

263
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,550
Stop talking nonsense.

264
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,150
Let's go.

265
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:54,990
Okay.

266
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,570
It smells good.

267
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,560
Yu.

268
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,780
Isn't that Liu?

269
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,849
I remember he had no money for food a few days ago.

270
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,369
Why did he buy so much food today?

271
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,200
He's also wearing new clothes.

272
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,930
It's a little strange.

273
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,589
Let's go.

274
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,329
Mr. Liu.

275
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,119
What are you doing? You scared me.

276
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Don't touch them.

277
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,400
You're rich!

278
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,710
You're a rich guy now.

279
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,950
How did you manage to make so much money?

280
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,910
Can you tell us how to become rich?

281
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,020
-Please.
-I don't know how to become rich.

282
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,510
I don't know how to become rich.

283
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,870
You two go away.

284
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,070
Get lost.

285
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,990
Get lost.

286
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,990
Get lost.

287
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,390
Who cares?

288
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,120
Let's go.

289
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,950
Let's go.

290
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,730
[Duke Sheng's Mansion]

291
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,010
Looks like Mu Bai

292
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,790
didn't try his best when fighting against me.

293
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,350
That's not true.

294
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,750
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

295
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,390
Sit down.

296
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,120
People outside are listening.

297
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,250
Mai.

298
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,160
Stay out of this matter.

299
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,050
Stay out of it?

300
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,280
Isn't it obvious?

301
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,560
No one

302
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,970
could get Mu Bai to do that but him.

303
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,320
Now your relationship with him

304
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,670
is already so bad.

305
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,030
You'd better

306
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,830
stay out of this.

307
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,820
Have some tea.

308
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,210
I can stay out of other things.

309
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,190
But this is about Qi Yu and I must save him.

310
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,070
I'm his master.

311
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,760
How's the investigation going?

312
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,990
I was afraid that I'd get them alerted,

313
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,780
so I sent someone to investigate it secretly

314
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,240
but we couldn't find them.

315
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,480
I interrogated the two who had been saved by us.

316
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,950
They are brothers.

317
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,190
Someone gave them money and asked them to leave the city in disguise.

318
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,390
That's all they know.

319
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,120
Who gave them the money?

320
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,170
According to what the elder man said,

321
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,840
that man looked ordinary.

322
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,910
I think he was just on an errand.

323
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,550
Shengdu is so big.

324
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,470
It's not easy to find the culprit.

325
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,270
Bro.

326
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,560
Let's split up

327
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,520
and make everyone know we're looking for Prince Qi Yu.

328
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,800
Why

329
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,980
should we make everyone know we're looking for him?

330
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,310
If he really did it,

331
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,960
Qi Yu must still be alive.

332
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,490
So,

333
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,560
the more people know we're looking for Qi Yu,

334
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,870
the safer Qi Yu will be.

335
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,230
Okay, Mai.

336
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,800
I’ll get it done right now.

337
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,330
I'm here to ask you a question.

338
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,670
Was Mu Bai under your order

339
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,100
to assassinate Qi Yu last night?

340
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,350
I didn't give any order to Mu Bai.

341
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,350
Mu Bai is your guard.

342
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,770
If it wasn't you,

343
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,640
who else could it be?

344
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,870
Tell me then.

345
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,510
That child is not a member of the royal family.

346
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,310
Why do you think I would kill him?

347
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,950
Because only you and me

348
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,550
know Qi Yu's identity

349
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,600
while other people don't.

350
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,870
Let me tell you the truth.

351
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,710
I haven't decided what to do with him.

352
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,050
You shouldn't even have the slightest idea of hurting him.

353
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,830
If you hurt that child,

354
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,740
you’re no different from Qi Jing.

355
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,390
Mai.

356
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:10,950
I…

357
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,080
No matter what you're thinking about,

358
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,060
let me tell you,

359
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,910
I'll always protect that child.

360
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,890
-Have you ever seen him?
-No.

361
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,990
Have you ever seen these two?

362
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,790
No.

363
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,270
Have you ever seen these two?

364
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,080
No.

365
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,190
No.

366
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,030
You two,

367
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
have you ever seen these two people?

368
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,750
No.

369
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,570
Attention, everyone.

370
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,860
These two

371
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,480
are very important persons in the palace.

372
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,750
Anyone who helps us find them

373
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,500
will be given 500 taels of silver.

374
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,380
500 taels?

375
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,790
500 taels?

376
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,190
Come to me if you have ever seen them.

377
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,320
-I've never seen them.
-I've never seen them.

378
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,460
Let's go.

379
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,090
Let's take a look.

380
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,150
Yu.

381
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,550
Are we really going to eavesdrop on them?

382
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,510
The reward is 500 taels of silver.

383
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,510
Don't you want it?

384
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,360
Yes.

385
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,590
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

386
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,710
I won't put them on.

387
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,710
Buy me a new pair.

388
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,390
Sorry, Young Master.

389
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,150
Behave yourself, or I'll tie you up again.

390
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,770
I'm not afraid of you.

391
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,350
You want to be punished?

392
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,910
Let's go.

393
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,310
I must teach you a lesson.

394
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,750
Did you hear that?

395
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,400
It's the important person.

396
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,860
It is suspicious

397
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,220
that he keeps the door closed in daylight.

398
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,020
Besides, he got rich overnight.

399
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,820
There must be something wrong.

400
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,410
But we don't know what's going on inside.

401
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,880
I'll go check again.

402
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,170
No, wait.

403
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,510
Those who dared to kidnap the important persons from the palace

404
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,310
are definitely not good people.

405
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,480
Let's report it to the government.

406
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,680
Go to the government now.

407
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,630
I'll stay here.

408
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,930
Come back soon.

409
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,900
-Okay.
-Go.

410
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,630
I feel that my father

411
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,550
has been different recently.

412
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,750
Go out of the palace and go to the Prime Minister's Mansion.

413
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,080
Try to get some information from my mother.

414
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,030
Ask her where my father has been

415
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,350
and who he has met recently.

416
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,090
Qi Yu must be in one of those places he has been to recently.

417
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,420
Be careful. Don't make others notice you.

418
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,550
Okay.

419
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,670
Move!

420
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,280
Step back! Step aside!

421
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,310
Move! Move!

422
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,990
Move! Move! Step back.

423
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,670
Step back.

424
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,270
Are you sure it was Prince Qi Yu?

425
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,910
Yes.

426
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,540
I saw him clearly.

427
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,390
Both His Highness and his valet were here.

428
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,260
They were guarded by two martial artists.

429
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,480
I couldn't beat them.

430
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,630
They escaped.

431
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,450
Do you know where they went?

432
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,790
Sorry.

433
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,600
Rise.

434
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,660
It's not your fault.

435
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,790
Take him to a doctor.

436
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,510
Yes.

437
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,550
Mai.

438
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,210
Be careful with your words.

439
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:23,900
Mrs. Zhang.

440
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,080
It’s me.

441
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,630
You're really Mai!

442
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,520
Mai’s back.

443
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,450
Mai.

444
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,500
Mai’s back.

445
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,030
It’s really you.

446
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,540
It’s Mai. It’s Mai.

447
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,670
Mai is back.

448
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,050
Hello, everyone.

449
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,600
It’s me.

450
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,350
I’m Mai.

451
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,230
I'm busy today.

452
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,390
So I have no time to have a good chat with you.

453
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,840
I’ll visit you later.

454
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,150
Mai.

455
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,400
Mai.

456
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,750
Mai.

457
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,070
I know where the person you’re looking for is.

458
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,270
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

459
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,350
Bring more people.

460
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,210
There're many of them.

461
00:25:59,210 --> 00:25:59,770
Okay.

462
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,000
Your Majesty, I'm back.

463
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,240
Have you got any information?

464
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,030
According to Her Ladyship,

465
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,630
Prime Minister only went to the villa outside the city once or twice recently.

466
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,380
He didn't go to any other special places.

467
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,990
Who has he met recently?

468
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,020
Her Ladyship said she didn't know.

469
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,520
Jinchu.

470
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,630
Let's spend some time outside the palace tomorrow.

471
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,300
Okay.

472
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,090
Mai.

473
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,690
It’s here.

474
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,390
I reported the case to the government this afternoon.

475
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,450
After they knocked out two officers,

476
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,990
they got a child and a servant into a carriage

477
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,750
and came here.

478
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,250
The two people being held by them

479
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,470
looked like the people in the portrait.

480
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,790
Find out whose villa this is.

481
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,920
Marshal Mai.

482
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
No need to do that.

483
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,110
This is Prime Minister Lin's villa.

484
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,450
Prime Minister Lin's?

485
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,210
Yes.

486
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,610
Let's go.

487
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,400
Be alert.

488
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,960
If anything happens to the people in the room,

489
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,620
you will be held accountable.

490
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,330
Yes.

491
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,580
What are you doing?

492
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,180
Pouring the water.

493
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,340
Let him do it.

494
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,430
Young Master.

495
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,260
There's a group of armed guards outside.

496
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,060
There're seven or eight of them.

497
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,090
But there're no special symbols on their uniforms.

498
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,640
I will try to find

499
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,590
more information about them tomorrow.

500
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,480
Xing, you must be careful.

501
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,800
I don't understand

502
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,600
why they all wanted to catch you.

503
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm worried that

504
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,430
I won't be able to protect you even if I sacrifice my life.

505
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,560
If so, I would let the former Crown Prince and the Crown Princess down.

506
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,000
Xing, it's okay.

507
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,070
They will come to save us.

508
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,380
You're right.

509
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,430
You must be tired.

510
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,800
Have a good rest.

511
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,820
I'll watch you tonight.

512
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,790
Your Majesty.

513
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,470
Why did you ask me to come?

514
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,300
I want you to tell me

515
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,350
how Qi Yu is now.

516
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,300
He's fine.

517
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,790
Your child will be born soon.

518
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,950
But Crown Prince's Mansion is still occupied by someone else.

519
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,160
So I did you a favor.

520
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,280
But that child has lost his parents.

521
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,780
I feel sorry for him.

522
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,470
Besides, he has been living in the palace since he was born.

523
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,470
I'm afraid he's not used to living outside the palace.

524
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,950
Your Majesty, you're so busy every day.

525
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,590
The empress is pregnant.

526
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,310
You two have no time to take care of that child.

527
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,870
I'll take care of him for you.

528
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,910
With you taking care of him, I can rest assured.

529
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,700
But he is the son of the deceased Crown Prince.

530
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,960
If he lives outside the palace,

531
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,720
people will say I dislike him.

532
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,240
Who dares to say that?

533
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,410
Mai.

534
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,280
Greetings, Your Majesty.

535
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,580
The living room is still being cleaned.

536
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,520
Could you please go to the flower hall first?

537
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,480
No need.

538
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,030
Where is he?

539
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,670
What?

540
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,250
I'm sorry.

541
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,710
I have no idea who you're talking about.

542
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,790
Qi Yu.

543
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,740
Your Majesty, you must have misunderstood.

544
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,410
There are no others in the villa.

545
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,150
If my father hadn't told me about it,

546
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,430
how would I know he is here?

547
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,410
Get up and lead the way.

548
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,250
Yes.

549
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,220
He got missing.

550
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,620
Mai suspected that I had hidden him.

551
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,940
If the child is found in your place,

552
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,700
she will believe that I asked you to hide him.

553
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,800
The empress is like the mother of the people.

554
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,330
How about we let the empress

555
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,970
take care of the child?

556
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,500
What do you think, Prime Minister Lin?

557
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,070
Okay.

558
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,190
Let Qi Yu move to Kunning Palace.

559
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,900
That'll be great.

560
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,390
You're a very good official.

561
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

562
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,990
Bro.

563
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,990
Mai.

564
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,070
Is everyone ready?

565
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,840
Yes.

566
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,230
Are we really going to use violence?

567
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,460
We won't be punished

568
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,590
for using violence this time. It's rare.

569
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,040
But it’s Prime Minister Lin’s villa.

570
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,430
That’s why we shouldn't be afraid.

571
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,620
He is hiding a prince.

572
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,670
Even if we destroy his villa,

573
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,410
he won't dare to do anything to us.

574
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,090
Fine.

575
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,910
Let's destroy his villa.

576
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,430
Your Majesty.

577
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,430
He's inside.

578
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,460
You may leave.

579
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,370
Jinchu.

580
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,710
Wait for me here.

581
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,110
Yes.

582
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,910
Your Majesty.

583
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,050
You may leave.

584
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,580
Sorry I can't leave.

585
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,110
Qi Yu.

586
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,910
Believe it or not,

587
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,900
I'm not the one who forced you to stay here.

588
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,950
I'm here to take you back.

589
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,340
Where are you taking me?

590
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,390
To take you back to the palace.

591
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,100
Or I can take you anywhere you want to go.

592
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,880
I don't want to go anywhere.

593
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,630
You don't trust me?

594
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,310
Is it because I punished you last time?

595
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,970
You punished me

596
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,920
because I did something wrong.

597
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,660
But I can't go with you.

598
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,960
Why not?

599
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,030
If you take me away secretly,

600
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,200
you might get into trouble.

601
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,940
Are you worried about me?

602
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,850
I believe Master Mai will find me.

603
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,330
Take good care of your master.

604
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,210
Is everyone here?

605
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,070
Yes.

606
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,949
Okay, let's go.

607
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:14,909
Yes.

608
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,110
Qi Yu, grandson of the former emperor,

609
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,429
is now in a villa of Lin's outside the city.

610
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,840
Send a team to get him back to the palace.

611
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,139
Yes, Your Majesty.

612
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,040
Make sure he comes back unscathed.

613
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

614
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,110
Move!

615
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,179
Stay still.

616
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,920
Stay still. Stay still.

617
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:46,989
Stay still.

618
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,750
Come here. Hurry.

619
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,810
Stay still. Hurry!

620
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,920
Master Mai.

621
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,850
Sorry.

622
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,420
I'm late.

623
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
I knew you would come to save me.

624
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,680
Let's go home.

625
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,640
What are you doing here?

626
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,150
I'm under His Majesty's order

627
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,310
to take Prince Qi Yu back to the palace.

628
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,550
Tell His Majesty

629
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,430
that it's safer for him to stay with me than to stay in the palace.

630
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,110
Your Majesty.

631
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,830
Greetings, Your Majesty.

632
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,040
How have you been?

633
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,730
Good.

634
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,560
I asked you to come today

635
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,670
to ask you a few questions.

636
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,320
Please go ahead, Your Majesty.

637
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,670
Father.

638
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,990
Why on earth

639
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,240
did you hide Qi Yu?

640
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,660
I did it for your own good.

641
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,000
And also for the good of the descendants of the Lin family.

642
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,320
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

643
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,670
I've made all the necessary arrangements.

644
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,430
You just need to have a good rest.

645
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,090
Don't think too much or be too worried.

646
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,900
Take good care of your health.

647
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,080
Are you really planning on something?

648
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,480
I'm making some preparations in advance.

649
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,550
Though His Majesty promised that your son would be the Crown Prince,

650
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,770
I cannot wait too long and I don't trust him.

651
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,310
Father.

652
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,210
You're already the most powerful official in the country.

653
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,190
And your daughter is the empress.

654
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,880
Why are you still not satisfied?

655
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,730
Because I want the Lin family

656
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,260
to be prosperous forever.

657
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,360
To make the Lin family prosperous, you don't need to...

658
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,710
You don't need to rebel.

659
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,490
Rou.

660
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,190
Do you know

661
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,500
why I assisted and supported Qi Huan?

662
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,520
Because he had the legitimate right to be the emperor and he had no much talent.

663
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,140
So it would be good for us if I helped him become the emperor.

664
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,070
But he has been interested in getting more power lately.

665
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,400
Even if I don't rebel,

666
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,770
he will kill all the people of the Lin family in the near future.

667
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,150
Don't you care about me

668
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,160
when planning on rebelling?

669
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,840
I'm doing everything for your sake.

670
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,500
As a member of the Lin family,

671
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,490
you also have the responsibility to make the Lin family prosperous.

672
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,890
Only when the Lin family is prosperous

673
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,770
can you be safe and carefree.

674
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,470
You and the Lin family are closely related.

675
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,710
I understand.

676
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,320
So you have prepared two plans.

677
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,800
Whether I'm pregnant with a girl or boy, you'll take action.

678
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,260
If the imperial physician's guess is wrong,

679
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,910
you'll use Qi Yu,

680
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:53,890
right?

681
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
You may rest assured, Your Majesty.

682
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,760
No matter who ascends the throne,

683
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,560
you'll be the Empress Dowager.

684
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,660
Aren't you afraid that I won't be on your side

685
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,470
and that I'll tell His Majesty about your plan?

686
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,460
By then,

687
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,940
everything you've done will be in vain.

688
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,780
Your Majesty, it's okay if you don't care about my life.

689
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,350
It's okay if you don't care about the lives of your mother, your brothers,

690
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,190
or even your unborn child.

691
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,070
I won't stop you.

692
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,070
But you always have a kind heart.

693
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,550
I believe you won't tell on me.

694
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,310
Don't say that again.

695
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:50,880
Father.

696
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,180
Father.

697
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,780
What are you doing?

698
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,850
Get up.

699
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,680
Get up!

700
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,310
Please wait a little longer.

701
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,000
Fine.

702
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,690
I'll wait.

703
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,660
Get up.

704
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,540
What are you...

705
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,550
I'll take my leave.
