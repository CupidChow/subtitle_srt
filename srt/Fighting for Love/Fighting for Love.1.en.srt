189
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,920
Zhao Yuntao, Marquis Yongping's second son,

190
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,680
was also born in the 37th year during the reign of Emperor Yongxi.

191
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,250
[Prime Minister Lin]

192
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,150
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

193
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,680
I already made some arrangements yesterday.

194
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,020
[Qi Jing, Emperor of Nanxia]

195
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,750
As long as I can't find that boy who has escaped,

196
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,030
I won't be able to sleep well.

197
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,040
I will try my best to solve the problems for Your Majesty.

198
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,170
There's one thing I don't understand.

199
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,000
It's been so many years.

200
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,510
But in the name list submitted by you,

201
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,910
how come

202
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,270
one name is always missing from it?

203
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,710
My apologies.

204
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,590
Your Majesty, do you mean Shang Yizhi, the son of Marquis Dingnan?

205
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,230
I once checked it carefully.

206
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,990
Shang Yizhi is really the son

207
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,230
of Marquis Dingnan and a civilian girl who lived at the border.

208
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,440
There's nothing fishy about this thing.

209
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,990
That's why I excluded him.

210
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,750
Prime Minister Lin, do you mean that you want me to believe that

211
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,870
my sister Shenghua, who hasn't had a child for years,

212
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,870
can really treat Marquis Dingnan's illegitimate son

213
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,150
as her own son?

214
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,830
Well...

215
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,030
Maybe Princess Shenghua

216
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,310
has accepted the fact that she didn't give birth to any child.

217
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,870
After all, Her Highness and Marquis Dingnan are deeply in love,

218
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,670
so Her Highness even loves the marquis' illegitimate son.

219
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,520
Even though he's an illegitimate son,

220
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,120
he's still Marquis Dingnan's biological son.

221
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,590
Prime Minister Lin, please get up.

222
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,990
Thank you, Your Majesty.

223
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,220
Marquis Dingnan will return to Shengdu soon.

224
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,750
He came back with a great victory,

225
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,480
which would secure the peace of the southwest for ten years.

226
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,110
After he returns this time,

227
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,150
we must let him have a good rest.

228
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,330
[Sacrifice]

229
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,890
[Shenghua, the Eldest Princess]

230
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,790
Have you seen Yizhi?

231
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,530
Your Highness,

232
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,990
Prince Yizhi went to buy a gift for the marquis.

233
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,320
He must have gone to the Emerald Pavilion.

234
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,450
Your Highness.

235
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,950
What's the matter?

236
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,120
Chunniang sent a message.

237
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,510
Zhao Yuntao, Marquis Yongping's second son,

238
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,170
was assassinated last night.

239
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,990
He was assassinated?

240
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,790
Tell the guards to protect Yizhi,

241
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,320
and ask Yizhi to stay in the Emerald Pavilion.

242
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,230
Master Xiaohong!

243
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Master Xiaohong.

244
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,990
You nearly killed me!

245
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:58,990
How was my performance?

246
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,870
Did I pass the test today?

247
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,990
Your Highness, you didn't pass the test in this ten-day period.

248
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,070
You need to take a test again.

249
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,180
You have to receive training for another three days.

250
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,980
Why?

251
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,630
Didn't I crack

252
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,190
all your martial arts tricks one by one just now?

253
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,990
Besides,

254
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,950
can you change the smell of that knockout incense?

255
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:15,990
I've got tired of it.

256
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,500
Your Highness, you've learned 90% of the skills of distinguishing

257
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,990
knockout incense indeed.

258
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,430
Then tell me

259
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,200
where the remaining 10% is.

260
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,740
For the remaining 10%...

261
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,110
I found it!

262
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,150
Mai.

263
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,790
You always go there.

264
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,530
Is Know-it-all really there?

265
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,750
Go, go, go.

266
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,360
Stop asking.

267
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,190
Go home now.

268
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,030
Can you take me there?

269
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,230
Why do you want to go there?

270
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,630
To look for Know-it-all.

271
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,990
I'm doing a serious thing.

272
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,990
Don't interfere.

273
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,210
Come back soon.

274
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:28,910
Mai.

275
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,710
What did you bring us

276
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,750
this time?

277
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,230
Miss Shuilian, be patient.

278
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,830
I certainly have good things to share with you.

279
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,750
Ladies, don't underestimate

280
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,480
the rouge in this box.

281
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,750
This is a secret formula from the palace.

282
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,840
Ladies, smell it.

283
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,480
Come on.

284
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,360
Just try it.

285
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:45,710
Give it to me.

286
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,110
Okay. Come on.

287
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,840
Let me try it.

288
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,970
I want to try it, too.

289
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,400
After you use this lipstick on your lips,

290
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,540
it can really moisture and nourish your lips.

291
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,110
I want it, too.

292
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,910
It looks nice.

293
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,990
It looks nice.

294
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,330
-Buy it.
-Buy it.

295
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,520
Buy it! Buy it!

296
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,830
Alright. There are enough products for all of you.

297
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,750
There are enough products for all of you.

298
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,790
Ladies, there are enough products for all of you.

299
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,520
Take turns to buy the products.

300
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,840
Alright. There are enough products for all of you.

301
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,900
Here you are, Miss.

302
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,830
This boy hasn't given up yet.

303
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,750
He still wants to find Know-it-all.

304
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,790
Come on.

305
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,780
He's quite smart.

306
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,070
He tries to come inside in different ways every day.

307
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,000
That's too much.

308
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,230
I don't know where he got the news

309
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,390
about Know-it-all.

310
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,670
Alright. There are enough products for each of you.

311
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,510
There are enough products for each of you.

312
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,770
Miss Shuilian, is it true that you've never seen Know-it-all?

313
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,190
You've asked me many times.

314
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,850
There is no such a person here.

315
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,230
It doesn't matter.

316
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,350
I'm just asking.

317
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,830
Miss Shuilian.

318
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,170
The Fairy Lotion.

319
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,370
Thank you, Mai.

320
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,710
I want it.

321
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,770
This necklace. I want this necklace.

322
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,750
Ladies, take your time to choose the products.

323
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,790
I'll be back soon.

324
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,790
He's very good at pestering others.

325
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,750
Stop him for me.

326
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,230
Miss Chunniang! Miss Chunniang!

327
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,110
I want to talk to Miss Chunniang.

328
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,430
Don't stop me, Miss Hongluan.

329
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,210
Chunniang has something important to do.

330
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,160
Just a few words.

331
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,290
Please do me a favor.

332
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,670
Forget it.

333
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,450
Is it you?

334
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,790
The guy who played bowls tricks?

335
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,589
As foes, we are really destined to meet each other.

336
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,569
You mistook me for another person.

337
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,599
You want to run away, right?

338
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,680
In Shengdu,

339
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,270
no one has ever dared to set a trap for me.

340
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,150
You've really mistaken me for another person.

341
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,190
I'm just a businessman who sells cosmetics.

342
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,800
What trap are you talking about?

343
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,390
Wait.

344
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,480
What if I refuse to let you go?

345
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,160
Who do you think you are?

346
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,410
In broad daylight,

347
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,650
you want to bully me just because you're a powerful man?

348
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,740
Who am I?

349
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,220
You've been in Shengdu for so long.

350
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,770
But no one has ever told you who I am?

351
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,710
No one has ever told you who I am?

352
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,520
Mai.

353
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,930
The person in front of you is Marquis Dingnan's son.

354
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,040
Her mother is Princess Shenghua.

355
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,470
Greetings, Your Highness.

356
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,150
No, this...

357
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,070
Since we parted last time,

358
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,670
I've known that you're not an ordinary person.

359
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,950
Your Highness,

360
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,950
you finally solved my problem.

361
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,230
Every time I got home,

362
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,120
I couldn't help

363
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,710
thinking of your

364
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,950
handsome face.

365
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,550
I couldn't sleep at all.

366
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,260
You still need to have a good sleep.

367
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,190
Don't you think the reason why we could

368
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,790
meet today is the fate from our previous lives?

369
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,690
To be honest,

370
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,830
just now, I was still looking for you

371
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,420
on that empty street.

372
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,660
No, that's not right.

373
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,230
I saw you selling cosmetics just now.

374
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,760
You were not looking for me.

375
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,270
Don't fool me.

376
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,330
It was just for making a living.

377
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,990
Your Highness, you know what?

378
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,990
At my home,

379
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,790
I still have an 80-year-old mother who is sick in bed,

380
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,590
and some young siblings who are waiting to be fed.

381
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,270
The whole family depends on me.

382
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,870
Wait.

383
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,810
At your home, you have an 80-year-old mother who is sick in bed.

384
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,750
But how come you have so many

385
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,010
young siblings who are waiting to be fed?

386
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,920
Is it because your father is quite healthy?

387
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,680
His Highness is so funny.

388
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,450
My father died long ago.

389
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,230
Alright.

390
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,350
Stop talking about these useless things with me.

391
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,150
I don't have time to listen to your family affairs.

392
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,670
Today, in front of everyone,

393
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,550
just tell me clearly

394
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,810
how we'll settle the grudges between us.

395
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,340
How do you want to settle the grudges?

396
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,670
How about

397
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,210
you play a game with me?

398
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,330
Really?

399
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,750
Gentlemen, choose cups respectively

400
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,990
and throw copper coins into the cups.

401
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,150
If you throw coins into the cups successfully,

402
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,090
the opponent will drink all the good wine in the bowl.

403
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,310
If you fail,

404
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,510
you'll have to drink the wine yourself.

405
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,630
I didn't expect that

406
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,290
Mai would be so good at throwing coins into cups.

407
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,110
It's not that he's very good at it.

408
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,470
He's just so smart.

409
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,550
Look at him.

410
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,030
He threw coins into the cup for the bowl in the middle every time.

411
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,830
In fact, he won't need to drink much wine if he fails.

412
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,390
Look at His Highness.

413
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,950
He's eager to achieve quick success.

414
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,280
He wanted to throw coins into that small cup every time,

415
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,680
but he failed every time.

416
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,510
Should we stop him?

417
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,830
No.

418
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,030
Just let him learn his lesson this time.

419
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,860
Your Highness.

420
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,250
Your Highness.

421
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,340
Send His Highness back to his room.

422
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,190
Chun...

423
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,030
Miss Chunniang! Miss Chunniang!

424
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,140
Miss Chunniang, please stay.

425
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,070
Miss Chunniang.

426
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,830
What's the matter, Mai?

427
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,880
Miss Chunniang,

428
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,100
please help me.

429
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,390
I want to ask Know-it-all about someone.

430
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,350
You're so stubborn.

431
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,550
I've told you many times.

432
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,280
I really don't know where he is.

433
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,130
In order to find him,

434
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
I've been in Shengdu for over a year.

435
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,030
Every time I came here,

436
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,310
you always said that you didn't know where he was.

437
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,670
But I heard that Know-it-all would

438
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,980
show up in the Emerald Pavilion in each even-number month.

439
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,840
How could you not know where he is?

440
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,200
As you said,

441
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,360
you came here every time.

442
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,890
But have you seen this guy named Know-it-all?

443
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,640
How do you know your information is not wrong?

444
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,970
Miss Chunniang.

445
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,700
May I use your toilet?

446
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,690
Your Highness.

447
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,880
The marquis is back.

448
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,800
Yes.

449
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,280
It's him.

450
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,640
[Shang Wei, Marquis Dingnan]

451
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,320
Your Highness.

452
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,140
I'm back.

453
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,750
You didn't take good care of yourself.

454
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,180
Why do you look so haggard?

455
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,040
Your Highness.

456
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,230
The conditions in the army camp are not as good as our home's.

457
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,160
It's windy here.

458
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,050
Let's talk in the carriage.

459
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,040
The older your elder brother is,

460
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,820
the more suspicious he gets.

461
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,930
He summoned me back to Shengdu this time.

462
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,370
Superficially, he wants to reward me for my merits.

463
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,620
In fact, he wants to take away my military power.

464
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,330
Do you have any solutions?

465
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,440
It's not that I don't want to give my military power to him.

466
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,150
But if I lose the military power,

467
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,760
he will have no fear for me.

468
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,410
It'll be bad for Yizhi.

469
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,480
Those who were born in the 37th year during the reign of Emperor Yongxi

470
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,690
almost all died.

471
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,770
We need to protect Yizhi well.

472
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,550
I have my own way.

473
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,140
I've never seen this lady before.

474
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,940
She's doing something so indecent to him in broad daylight.

475
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,250
I need to get some water to wash my eyes.

476
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,520
Leave now!

477
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,670
Let's go!

478
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,270
Step aside! Step aside!

479
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:08,670
Step aside!

480
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,390
Stop her!

481
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,110
Miss Chunniang.

482
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,770
It's her! She wants to kill me!

483
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,220
Should we go help them?

484
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,190
No.

485
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,890
These three ladies are highly skilled at martial arts.

486
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,720
If they can't defeat her,

487
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,130
we'll only cause trouble by helping them.

488
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,290
Let's go.

489
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,350
Are you hurt, Your Highness?

490
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:14,940
I'm fine.

491
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,790
Where did the assassin come from?

492
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,970
She even risked her life to assassinate Prince Yizhi.

493
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,030
You asked me?

494
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,680
I just want to ask you two

495
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,390
how come you let the assassin come inside.

496
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,290
Sorry for our negligence.

497
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,320
Please punish us, Chunniang.

498
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,450
I'm fine now, right?

499
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,070
Don't blame them.

500
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,130
However, Mai

501
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,750
saved my life.

502
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,950
Mai,

503
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,630
please accept my bow.

504
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,510
Your Highness, if you bow to me, my good luck will be reduced.

505
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,510
You saved my life.

506
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,580
You deserve my bow.

507
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,510
No need to thank me, Your Highness.

508
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,440
Have a good rest.

509
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,480
I have something important to do. Bye.

510
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,160
You're injured.

511
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,830
It's just a minor injury.

512
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,390
I'm fine.

513
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,210
You can't leave if you're injured.

514
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,600
I have the best medicine for treating wounds.

515
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,260
Don't bother, Your Highness.

516
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,050
I really have something important to do.

517
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,870
Bye. Bye.

518
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,780
Chunniang.

519
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,170
Look. He saved my life after all.

520
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,170
You should let him stay and have fun.

521
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,880
I should leave here now.

522
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,090
The less trouble, the better.

523
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,090
Mai.

524
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,350
Mai, you want to find Know-it-all, don't you?

525
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,520
Come with me.

526
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,360
Miss Chunniang.

527
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,270
We've had some tea.

528
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,720
You've also thanked me.

529
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,360
Can you tell me where Know-it-all is?

530
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,230
I am Know-it-all.

531
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,140
I don't believe it.

532
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,140
How can I make you believe it?

533
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,150
In order to find Know-it-all,

534
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,030
logically speaking, I should be the one begging you.

535
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,870
But now you beg me to believe it.

536
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,070
This is quite abnormal.

537
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,470
You're really smart.

538
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,560
That's why I want to ask you to do me a favor.

539
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,000
I'll tell you a piece of news when it's done.

540
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,100
Let's make it clear first.

541
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,370
It's okay to trick others,

542
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,030
but it's not okay to risk my life.

543
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,600
Don't worry.

544
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,550
I won't ask you to risk your life.

545
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,260
I want you to send

546
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,520
His Highness back to Marquis Dingnan's Mansion for me.

547
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,950
Are you joking, Miss Chunniang?

548
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,500
I saw what happened just now.

549
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,600
Don't you think I need to risk my life to fulfill your request?

550
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,610
If even I can't get the news,

551
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,930
no one else can get it

552
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,890
within the borders of Nanxia.

553
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,670
Deal.

554
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,400
I wonder what news you want to ask about.

555
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,060
I want to look for someone.

556
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,530
Who do you want to look for?

557
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,950
The person I'm looking for

558
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,320
was once the adopted son of Han Huaicheng, namely Duke Shengguo.

559
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,380
His name is Chen Qi.

560
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,340
[Marquis Dingnan's Mansion]

561
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,230
My Lord.

562
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,110
The damp toxin inside your body is much less than before.

563
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,440
Do you still feel itchy?

564
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,290
I didn't feel it when I fought on the battlefield every day.

565
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,760
After you mentioned it,

566
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,530
I feel much better now.

567
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,970
It seems that this herb bath prescription is quite effective.

568
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,840
Where is Yizhi?

569
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,500
I've been back home for half a day,

570
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,140
but I haven't seen Yizhi yet.

571
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,950
The situation in Shengdu has been unstable in recent years.

572
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,090
I always thought that

573
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,150
I should let Yizhi learn how to protect himself,

574
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,390
so I used the Emerald Pavilion as an excuse

575
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,670
and asked Chunniang to teach him some self-defense skills.

576
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,100
You're quite meticulous about the things you do.

577
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,970
In that case,

578
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:09,190
I'll personally go pick Yizhi up later.

579
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:09,960
Okay.

580
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,820
My Lord!

581
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,630
Help!

582
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,430
Your Highness!

583
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,030
Help!

584
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,910
Your Highness!

585
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,040
Your Highness, remember.

586
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,050
My Lord!

587
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,510
My Lord!

588
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,880
Greetings, Your Majesty.

589
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,610
Prime Minister Lin, come here.

590
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,680
[Shang]

591
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:08,390
Yesterday, Han Zheng'an, Marquis Pingyang's second son, went out of the city for hunting.

592
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,120
He accidentally met some bandits on his way back.

593
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,110
Even Pan Yu, the illegitimate son of the Secondary Assistant Minister

594
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,890
of the Ministry of Revenue, and the others

595
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,370
died on the spot.

596
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,140
How irritating!

597
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,910
I'm not a bloodthirsty tyrant.

598
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,470
Why did you have to kill those several useless people?

599
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,590
I'm really worried about Your Majesty's health.

600
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,870
Although those several people were not like him,

601
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,180
they were all born

602
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,070
in the 37th year during the reign of Emperor Yongxi.

603
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,790
[Shang]

604
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,590
[Shang]

605
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,170
I'll obey Your Majesty's order.

606
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,760
I won't ask you to do the mission this time.

607
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,030
Shi Yuan.

608
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,080
I'm here.

609
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,830
That assassin failed to kill him in the Emerald Pavilion.

610
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,280
Send two men to keep an eye on them.

611
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,660
Yes.

612
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:39,910
Buddy.

613
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,070
Let's discuss it.

614
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,460
Can you let me out first?

615
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,270
It might kill me soon by knocking my head.

616
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,530
I've never suffered like this in my life.

617
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,440
Your Highness,

618
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,290
I also don't want to get involved in this trouble

619
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,950
and waste my engery to do this.

620
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,490
I just want to send you back safely.

621
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,650
Just sit inside for a while.

622
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,510
Can you let me out first?

623
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,050
Then we can think of another way.

624
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,650
Shut up!

625
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,450
Why is there really no movement now?

626
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,700
Your Highness.

627
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,480
Your Highness.

628
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,880
Your Highness!

629
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,560
Your Highness.

630
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,330
Are you really not afraid?

631
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,430
What's there to be afraid of?

632
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:29,990
No.

633
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,510
Be careful.

634
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,510
Who can recognize me

635
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,440
when I'm wearing makeup like this?

636
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,310
Fine. Just come out.

637
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,210
I can take this chance to have a rest.

638
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,700
You don't know how tired I am.

639
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,160
You can try it another day.

640
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,030
No need to do it another day.

641
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,030
Let's do it today.

642
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,490
Please go inside, sir.

643
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,350
Stop joking.

644
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,310
You're like a female ghost now.

645
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,990
Stop talking.

646
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,390
Otherwise, you'll scare others.

647
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,280
I'm not joking.

648
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,670
I'm starving now.

649
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,950
I need to go home and eat at once.

650
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,850
Just go inside.

651
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,590
Well...

652
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,520
Are you not afraid at night?

653
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,710
What's there to be afraid of at...

654
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,650
The thing I'm afraid of is really happening.

655
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,040
Who are they?

656
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,620
Run!

657
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:21,909
Keep up!

658
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,060
-Stop! -Hurry up!

659
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,230
Save me!

660
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,570
Run!

661
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,120
Stop!

662
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,780
Your Highness!

663
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,870
What should we do? We're surrounded.

664
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,330
Wait for me.

665
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,360
Come on! Do it!

666
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,190
Do it! Come on!

667
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,790
Come on!

668
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,400
Go!

669
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,130
Come on!

670
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,440
No, this...

671
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,380
Come on!

672
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,860
No, he...

673
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,590
Come on!

674
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,380
Go!

675
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,250
He's on my side.

676
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,010
Your Highness.

677
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,910
Is there something wrong with your friend?

678
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,600
Please forgive him.

679
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,870
My buddy is a fierce man by nature.

680
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,990
As long as the atmosphere is right,

681
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,230
he can even beat himself.

682
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,060
Alright. We can't stay here for long. Let's go.

683
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,150
-Let's go at once.
-Wait.

684
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,310
Can you ask your good buddy

685
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,250
to send my trolley to the Emerald Pavilion?

686
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:10,990
I'll buy you a new one.

687
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,630
It's full of good stuff inside.

688
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,160
Let's go.

689
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,000
It's full of good stuff inside.

690
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,150
Buddy! Buddy!

691
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,880
[Marquis Dingnan's Mansion]

692
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,360
From now on, just listen to me.

693
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,350
No matter which of us is older,

694
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,030
you are my elder brother now.

695
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,990
Your Highness.

696
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,190
You're finally back.

697
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,630
Is my father looking for me?

698
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,560
His Lordship travelled a long way.

699
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,880
You'd better go greet him tomorrow.

700
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,050
Arrange a guest room for my distinguished guest.

701
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,480
Pepare some hot water and bring him some clothes so that he can get changed.

702
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:39,950
Okay.

703
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,410
Then he can relax himself.

704
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,950
Sir, this way, please.

705
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,580
Then I'll do as you said.

706
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,790
I'll get going, Your Highness.

707
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,590
See you later.

708
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,240
This way, please.

709
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,670
I'm Xia Zhu.

710
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,430
I'll serve you to take a bath.

711
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,870
Miss Xia Zhu, I…

712
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,790
Well…

713
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,470
Miss Xia Zhu.

714
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,220
-I…
-Sir.

715
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,760
You'd better go out.

716
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,350
I...

717
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,140
I can do it myself.

718
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:16,690
Your Highness.

719
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,350
The prescription from the Imperial Hospital

720
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,300
is very suitable for His Lordship's illness.

721
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,790
[Birthwor Root, Wrinkled Giant Hyssop, Mastiche, Agilawood, Clove: 100 grams for each herb]

722
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,790
[Boil them with five liters of water and take a herb bath]

723
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,110
But among all the herbs, if there is an overdose

724
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,510
of Birthwor Roots,

725
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,110
it will definitely cause kidney failure.

726
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,710
To remove damp toxin,

727
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,670
other than taking a herb bath every day,

728
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,310
His Lordship also needed to take a Douling Pill
for detoxication and reducing the swelling.

729
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,190
Douling Pills contain Birthwor Roots, too.

730
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,390
If they're combined with the herb bath prescription,

731
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,790
the dosage is big enough to cause a disease.

732
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,880
[Birthwor Root, Wrinkled Giant Hyssop, Mastiche, Agilawood, Clove: 100 grams for each herb]

733
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,880
[Boil them with five liters of water and take a herb bath]

734
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,950
I wonder what news you want to ask about.

735
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,430
I want to look for someone.

736
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,480
His name is Chen Qi.

737
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,880
Nanxia is a vast country.

738
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,250
There are many people with the same name.

739
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,330
How can I find him for you if you only told me his name?

740
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,600
[Ten years ago]

741
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,710
Dear.

742
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,120
Although Qi is your adopted son,

743
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,140
he's not Mai's biological brother.

744
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,760
Why can't they get married?

745
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,200
But I don't want to get married.

746
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,760
I just want to play with my brother Chen Qi every day.

747
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,880
[Han Huaicheng, Duke Shengguo]

748
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,490
Dear.

749
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:00,170
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

750
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,690
Who are you? How dare you break into my mansion?

751
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,110
I'm late. Please forgive me, Father.

752
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,890
It's all right.

753
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,200
Qi, be careful.

754
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,270
Father!

755
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,710
Why does Mai

756
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,110
keep the door open while he's taking a bath?

757
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,770
After I go back, I'll take a bath, too.

758
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,610
What did I see just now?

759
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,510
Mai is a girl?

760
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,110
Did she pretend to be a man

761
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,230
in order to plot against me?

762
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,690
No, no.

763
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,440
It's not that simple.

764
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,930
I must confirm it again.

765
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,930
Your Highness.

766
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,230
Your Highness.

767
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,320
What's wrong?

768
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,890
Her Highness wants you to go to her room.

769
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,350
She said that His Lordship wanted to see you.

770
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,750
Didn't they tell me to see him tomorrow as he's sick?

771
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,910
His Lordship is in critical condition.

772
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,630
Father.

773
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,910
Father.

774
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,620
Didn't they say that you merely had a common cold?

775
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,480
Why is your condition so serious?

776
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,680
Yizhi, you're here.

777
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:58,550
There's something I should tell you today.

778
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,750
I'm not your father.

779
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,350
What do you mean?

780
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,780
You were adopted by my wife and me.
