[Fighting for love]

3
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,050
(Episode 10)

4
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,800
Young Marquis, you came suddenly.

5
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,550
I didn't prepare well.

6
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,630
This room is mine.

7
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,830
I've changed all the equipment.

8
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,830
Sorry for the inconvenience.

9
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,360
Uncle Shi, to be honest,

10
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,470
after I came here,

11
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,350
I fell in love with your room at first sight.

12
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,070
I'll do as you say.

13
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,669
Is Princess Shenghua in good health?

14
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,759
My mother is not in good health.

15
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,310
When the season changes,

16
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,770
she's easy to catch a cold.

17
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,550
By the way,

18
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,710
I got a batch of

19
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,440
good poria and Sichuan pepper.

20
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,670
I'll send someone to take them to Shengdu.

21
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,470
It’s a token of my gratitude.

22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,510
Thank you, Uncle Shi.

23
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,360
I’ve been with the late Marquis for years.

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,630
When I heard that he passed away,

25
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:35,950
I was heartbroken.

26
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,040
But I have the Tiger Tally.

27
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,510
I can't return to Shengdu without an edict.

28
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,430
I didn't offer incense to the late Marquis or keep vigil.

29
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,430
I hope you and Princess Shenghua can forgive me.

30
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,510
Uncle Shi.

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,030
How could my mother blame you?

32
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,990
Besides, when I was young,

33
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,350
you were so nice to me.

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,430
You were naughty when you were little.

35
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,430
You made fun of us guards.

36
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,790
Uncle Shi, since you

37
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,110
still treat me as what you did when I was young,

38
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,230
I'm relieved.

39
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,270
Actually, I came here

40
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,800
to ask you a favor.

41
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,630
I just took charge of the Qingzhou Army.

42
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,680
I still have many problems to deal with.

43
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,040
I’m here to borrow provisions from you.

44
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,000
Provisions?

45
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,220
No problem.

46
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,800
Young Marquis,

47
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,829
have you reported to the higher-ups?

48
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:41,910
Do I need to?

49
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,070
How about this?

50
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,260
Mu Bai, report now.

51
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,340
Uncle Shi.

52
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,510
You can lend me the provisions today.

53
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,390
How about we act at the same time?

54
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,310
Young Marquis.

55
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,590
The provisions are not trivial.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,860
I just chatted with Brother Tang.

57
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,870
He's on night duty today.

58
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,000
He has no time for us.

59
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,680
In just a few words,

60
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,670
Brother Tang has been talking about you.

61
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,589
He asked

62
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,150
whether you're sick,

63
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,670
and whether you can stand

64
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,310
the bumpy roads.

65
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,470
No wonder.

66
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,990
You're so cute.

67
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,190
No wonder Brother Tang cares about you.

68
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,870
Xiu'er.

69
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,950
If Brother Tang marries you,

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,110
isn't this a blessing for him?

71
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,310
Stop!

72
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,909
I’m fine.

73
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,360
Brother Mai, stop walking around.

74
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,600
Why can't she be persuaded?

75
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,510
I can only be the villain.

76
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,510
Xiu'er.

77
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,430
You're not the type I like.

78
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,630
I didn’t tell you the truth

79
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,470
because I didn’t want to hurt you.

80
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,630
What kind of girl do you like?

81
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,270
Go to Shengdu with me.

82
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,680
Check the ladies in the brothel.

83
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,159
They are so...

84
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,110
They're the best in the world.

85
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,970
Brother Mai, you've gone too far.

86
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,550
Even if you don't like me,

87
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,110
you can't compare me to women like them.

88
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,590
This girl

89
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,720
is quite heavy-handed.

90
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,950
This child...

91
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,670
Why is she...

92
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,210
Do you have a toothache?

93
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,990
Let me see.

94
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,870
Why is it stuck?

95
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,030
She hit you?

96
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,030
That little brat.

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,780
What are you doing?

98
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,150
I provoked her first.

99
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,270
You don't have to force her.

100
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,800
What're you talking about?

101
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,659
I just reproached her a few words.

102
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,760
What did you say?

103
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,150
I said she's not in good shape.

104
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,040
she is indeed a child.

105
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,550
She likes me.

106
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,040
She can't get your love.

107
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,960
I understand.

108
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,470
Xiu'er woke me up with this slap.

109
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,830
If I tell her now

110
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,830
that Uncle Shi didn't agree to help.

111
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,960
Wouldn't she leave?

112
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,140
No.

113
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,510
I have to go.

114
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,830
I'll get going then.

115
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,050
Wait.

116
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,870
Make it clear.

117
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,630
You heard that?

118
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,710
You do have something to say.

119
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,040
I tricked the truth out.

120
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,190
Tell me.

121
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,230
We should understand

122
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,270
that Uncle Shi doesn't want to help us.

123
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,790
He must have his reasons.

124
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,980
But...

125
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,810
Are you talking about borrowing provisions or the passport?

126
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,390
Both.

127
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,750
But it's not decided yet.

128
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,320
I’m still trying.

129
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,270
General Shi is the late Marquis's subordinate.

130
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,070
The late Marquis saved his life.

131
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,070
He should help us.

132
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,590
Yes.

133
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,750
I'm trying to figure out a way.

134
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,230
You don't need to be so upset.

135
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,560
It’s the first day here.

136
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,070
If General Shi is a loyal man,

137
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,110
he must have had no choice.

138
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,549
Honey.

139
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,700
Honey.

140
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:41,309
Why is the son of Marquis Dingnan here?

141
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,320
The war is coming.

142
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,870
He came to me to borrow some provisions.

143
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,830
I know

144
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,430
Marquis Dingnan saved your life.

145
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,200
But Honey,

146
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,590
we've heard about

147
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,030
what happened in Shengdu.

148
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,070
Marquis Dingnan and his family were in trouble.

149
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,600
Although we don't know why,

150
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,770
His Majesty doesn't like the Young Marquis.

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,950
Besides,

152
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,430
the Crown Prince's schemer is in the city.

153
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,830
He's keeping an eye on us.

154
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,190
If you agree to Young Marquis,

155
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,750
I'm afraid you'll offend both His Majesty

156
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,190
and the Crown Prince.

157
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,310
Darling.

158
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,550
How could I not think of what you're thinking?

159
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,550
I didn't promise them.

160
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,110
Darling.

161
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,430
You are not in good health.

162
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,710
Don't worry about it.

163
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,930
Go to sleep.

164
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,430
Go to sleep.

165
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,110
Honey.

166
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,910
I'm worried about you.

167
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,560
Why are they targeting Yuzhou now?

168
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,750
All right.

169
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,400
Go to sleep.

170
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,800
You're still alive.

171
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,110
Don't be afraid. I'll take you away.

172
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,670
Come.

173
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,230
Bro. What's your name?

174
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,520
I'm Shang Wei.

175
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,110
Shi... Shi Dachun.

176
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,070
What’s wrong, Mai?

177
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,230
You scared me.

178
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,670
You scared me.

179
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,580
When did you come in?

180
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,790
It's been a while.

181
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,160
You didn't close the door,

182
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,250
so I came in.

183
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,750
General Shi has agreed.

184
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,710
He said that I could spend more time with you when we're not training.

185
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,950
Let's go out.

186
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,010
Let's go shopping.

187
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,670
Brother.

188
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,230
I haven't worn my clothes yet.

189
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,290
I need to pee later.

190
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,760
Wait for me outside.

191
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,970
You need to pee?

192
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,810
Here, brother.

193
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,810
The urinal.

194
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,920
What? Are you shy?

195
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,160
If you're shy, I won't look.

196
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,710
Well.

197
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,790
Brother, I...

198
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,910
I have a habit since childhood.

199
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,900
I can't pee with outsiders around.

200
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,510
What are you afraid of?

201
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,150
It's always like this in the barracks.

202
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,610
Come, I'll hold it for you.

203
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,630
Brother! Brother!

204
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,590
I'm sick.

205
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,150
What's wrong, Bro? Are you sick?

206
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,310
Okay, hurry up.

207
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,470
I'll take you to a doctor later.

208
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,360
Okay, thank you.

209
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,710
Wait for me.

210
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,020
So scaring.

211
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,900
[City Guard Mansion]

212
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,710
Be careful.

213
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,390
What should we do now?

214
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,350
I can't read.

215
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,870
Who knows where these invitations should be sent to?

216
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,750
It's all your fault.

217
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,110
Otherwise, I wouldn't be confused.

218
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,230
You fell and failed your job.

219
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,350
You're blaming me instead.

220
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,770
Why don't you go back and ask Her Ladyship?

221
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,990
Don't cause harm to me.

222
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,150
A couple of days ago, I was penalized for miscalculating the accounts.

223
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,370
I don't dare to irritate Her Ladyship anymore.

224
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,230
Well, well, wish you luck.

225
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,270
I have to go.

226
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,870
Madam.

227
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,350
If you don't mind me being nosy,

228
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,590
why don't you show it to me?

229
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,990
Thank you, Miss Xu.

230
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,430
Miss Xu.

231
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,790
This is a letter of invitation from Mr. Yao, from the eastern part of the city,

232
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,030
inviting the City Guard to go hunting

233
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,960
on the second day of the next month.

234
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,310
This is an invitation from the Lieutenant Wu of the western part of the city,

235
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,630
inviting Her Ladyship to a birthday banquet.

236
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,150
I don't know

237
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,830
where you should send them.

238
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,610
Exactly, these are the two.

239
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,420
Thank you, Miss Xu.

240
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,520
It's nothing.

241
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,910
Ask someone to find out

242
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,110
who Miss Xu is

243
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,250
and who else is in her family.

244
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,400
Yes, Your Ladyship.

245
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,440
Look, the Yuzhou soldiers are training.

246
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,210
Is this an extra training?

247
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,510
The martial arts competition

248
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,230
is going to be held in Yuzhou.

249
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,640
Everyone will watch it.

250
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,190
They all want to practice more

251
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,230
and showcase in front of General Shi.

252
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,470
Brother Tang, will you join the competition?

253
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,910
I'm not from the Yuzhou Army.

254
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,750
I can’t.

255
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,070
Mai.

256
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,240
Look at this.

257
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,730
Date Red Horse.

258
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,550
How is it?

259
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,910
How is it? Let me see.

260
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,470
Not bad.

261
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,000
It's quite strong.

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,670
Of course.

263
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,140
I trained it myself.

264
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,750
You trained it yourself?

265
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,620
Is he a wild horse?

266
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,110
Not exactly.

267
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,590
It came here with a western horse dealer.

268
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,710
It's very impatient.

269
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,750
When it arrived at the horse relay station,

270
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,830
it jumped out of the fence for no reason.

271
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,390
Many men couldn't stop it.

272
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,990
The horse dealer was anxious, so he posted a notice,

273
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,990
saying that anyone who could tame it

274
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,550
could get it at 30% of the price.

275
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,030
I liked it,

276
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,270
so I tamed it.

277
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,260
Impressive.

278
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,630
Brother.

279
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,750
Look at it.

280
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,100
30% of the price is still high, right?

281
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,830
Yes, it's not cheap.

282
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,960
So,

283
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm raising money.

284
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,990
Are you trying to set me up?

285
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,300
How can I set you up?

286
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,990
Take it.

287
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,850
200 taels.

288
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:42,840
This...

289
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,230
Is this true?

290
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,310
Don't worry.

291
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,790
Of course, it's true.

292
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,990
I haven't had a chance to repay the friendship you showed

293
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,550
when you gave me the dagger back then.

294
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,990
I’ll give you this horse.

295
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,610
I'll pay you back later.

296
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,500
How about this?

297
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,130
Each of us

298
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,760
owns half of its ownership?

299
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,830
Sure.

300
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,040
Let me ride it with you.

301
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,600
Okay.

302
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,680
This horse is wild.

303
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,750
Of course.

304
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,880
Of course, the horse I trained is wild.

305
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,640
Brother.

306
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,870
You trained your horse so well.

307
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,600
Why don't you get yourself an official position?

308
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,550
I have been here for a while.

309
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,160
I don't like some people in the Yuzhou Army.

310
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,240
I think you are close to General Shang.

311
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,390
Why don’t we join the Qingzhou Army?

312
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,830
I don't want to join the army.

313
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,160
Why?

314
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,510
It's a chaotic era now.

315
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,070
It's a good time for us men

316
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,730
to make contributions and protect the country.

317
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,150
I’m not ambitious.

318
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,750
I’ll leave when General Shi

319
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,150
did me the favor.

320
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,750
Are you still going to Beimo?

321
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,560
All right.

322
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,349
Let me take a great ride with you.

323
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,470
I'll bring you here next time.

324
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,390
Okay.

325
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,360
Greetings, Mrs. Shi.

326
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,070
Don't be polite, Miss Xu.

327
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,430
You may leave.

328
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,470
Yes.

329
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,660
May I know why you want to see me?

330
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,350
I saw Miss Xu in the garden today.

331
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,910
I liked you.

332
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,870
So I asked someone to inquire about your background.

333
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,990
I heard you lost your parents.

334
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,050
You have nowhere to go.

335
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,300
Coincidentally,

336
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,280
I have no children.

337
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,430
So I want to keep you company.

338
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,710
Help me copy Buddhist scriptures and letters in ordinary times.

339
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,690
You don't need to do any other work.

340
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,870
As for the monthly salary,

341
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,430
I will pay you according to the standards of a first-class maid in my mansion.

342
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,310
What do you think, Miss Xu?

343
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,030
You're so kind.

344
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,790
I'm flattered.

345
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,670
I just casually

346
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,200
helped those two servants.

347
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,870
It's not a difficult thing to do.

348
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,440
How can I bear your kindness?

349
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,240
I know

350
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,710
it's rude to ask this.

351
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,900
You must have some doubts.

352
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,400
To be honest,

353
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,550
I had a sister.

354
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,750
We grew up together.

355
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,310
We never separated.

356
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,390
But not long after I got married,

357
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,830
she suddenly died of a serious illness.

358
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,960
I didn't even see her for the last time.

359
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,170
I still feel upset about that.

360
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,320
My sister

361
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,960
is just like you,

362
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,960
who also has a pair of apricot-shaped eyes.

363
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,390
She's also obedient, clever,

364
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,670
and can read.

365
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,590
You make me feel familiar.

366
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,550
You're just like my sister.

367
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,750
It's my fault.

368
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,230
I made you recall the sad past.

369
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,990
I'm not bringing this up

370
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,850
to make things difficult for you.

371
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,310
You can stay if you want.

372
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,230
Forget it if you don't want to.

373
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,610
Your Ladyship, you're so kind.

374
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,300
Of course, I'm willing.

375
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,100
You don't need to stand on ceremonies.

376
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,510
Just call me Xiu'er.

377
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,110
Sure.

378
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,060
Darling, you're back.

379
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,110
I'm back.

380
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,550
This is Xiu'er.

381
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,920
She came with Young Marquis's friend.

382
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,050
She can write and calculate and has no family to rely on.

383
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,940
I want her to stay here to help me.

384
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,940
It's up to you.

385
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:08,990
Xiu'er.

386
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,150
I'll ask someone to help you pack up.

387
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,590
You can move in today.

388
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,390
Yes.

389
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,510
I'll take my leave.

390
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,550
Darling.

391
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,280
Didn't you go to see Young Marquis?

392
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,470
I won't go.

393
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,470
Mr. Yang sent someone to inform me

394
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,390
to go to Tongxi Inn where he lives

395
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,850
to discuss something important.

396
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,570
Now Young Marquis is also in the city.

397
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,270
I'm afraid Mr. Yang got some news.

398
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,490
What should we be afraid of?

399
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,950
I brought Young Marquis into the city to entertain him.

400
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,840
I didn't agree to lend him provisions.

401
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,350
Why should I be afraid of what he, a Crown Prince adviser would say?

402
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,780
If you really don't want to help Young Marquis,

403
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,910
after entertaining him for a few days,

404
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,050
you should try your best to send him away.

405
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,870
He's always making me feel uneasy by staying here.

406
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,500
What are you talking about?

407
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,770
The late Marquis was my benefactor.

408
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,540
It's fine if I don't lend him provisions.

409
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,170
But I still want to kick him out of the city?

410
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,630
If this gets out, how can I establish myself?

411
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,040
I was reckless.

412
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,190
General Shi, you're busy.

413
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,120
I suddenly invited you here.

414
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,310
Am I interrupting you?

415
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,710
Mr. Yang, don’t say that.

416
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,590
It's my honor to drink with you.

417
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,960
It was very lively in Yuzhou last night.

418
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,120
I heard the people in the inn say

419
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,910
that it was a group of Qingzhou soldiers who entered Yuzhou.

420
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,790
That's true.

421
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,160
Why didn't these Qingzhou soldiers stay in Qingzhou,

422
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,020
but come to Yuzhou?

423
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,270
These Qingzhou soldiers

424
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,270
are here to escort the Guard General of Qingzhou.

425
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,190
So it's true that Shang Yizhi, the Guard General of Qingzhou,

426
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,280
is in the city now.

427
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,270
Yes.

428
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,510
General Shi.

429
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,510
Do you know that harboring a criminal against the court

430
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,260
is a serious crime?

431
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,630
Don't joke, Mr. Yang.

432
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,030
I'm a guard general of the city.

433
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,590
How can I break the law

434
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,540
and hide the criminal of the court?

435
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,510
Who is the criminal?

436
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,950
Didn’t you say

437
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,160
you invited Young Marquis Shang into the city?

438
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,790
Within one month of taking office in Qingzhou, Young Marquis Shang

439
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,750
executed the deputy commander, released prisoners privately,

440
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,080
and abandoned his post.

441
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,110
Now you have brought him into the city.

442
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,570
Isn't this harboring a criminal?

443
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,510
If this gets to Shengdu,

444
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,590
I’m afraid you...

445
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,830
I don’t know.

446
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,630
I don't know

447
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,110
Marquis Dingnan committed such a crime.

448
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,550
Mr. Yang,

449
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,560
we shouldn't jump to conclusions

450
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,330
about this kind of thing easily.

451
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,430
I knew you would say that.

452
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,560
I have a secret order from the Crown Prince.

453
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,920
General Shi.

454
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,870
Xiu'er.

455
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,090
Young Marquis.

456
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,920
Xiu'er.

457
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,110
Have you seen Mai?

458
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,570
I’ve been looking for her.

459
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,470
He went out with Brother Tang this morning.

460
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,630
Him again?

461
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,920
Since you brought up this topic,

462
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,320
let me ask you this.

463
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,050
Who is Brother Tang?

464
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,830
What does he do?

465
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,290
What does he look like?

466
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,610
He's quite manly

467
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,820
and quite tall.

468
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,070
He's quite manly?

469
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,010
How tall is he? Is he taller than me?

470
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,520
I don't remember the exact height.

471
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,980
Probably,

472
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,420
this high.

473
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,910
Oh no.

474
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,190
Where did they go?

475
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,480
I don't know.

476
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,790
He just arrived in a new place

477
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,850
and already gone for a private meeting with a stranger.

478
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,390
Young Marquis, if there's nothing else,

479
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,590
I'll get back to work.

480
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,300
Go.

481
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:24,920
Mr. Yang.

482
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,950
The secret order didn't say that I should do it.

483
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:36,400
It ordered you to kill Marquis Dingnan.

484
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,840
What's the difference?

485
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,850
Then hand over Shang Yizhi.

486
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,590
I'll take orders to deal with it.

487
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,800
I can give Young Marquis to you.

488
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,020
But Mr Yang,

489
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,670
there are two things I need to tell you.

490
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,470
First,

491
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,860
Marquis Dingnan is the only son of Princess Shenghua.

492
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,280
If he dies in Yuzhou,

493
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,070
I have the responsibility to

494
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,350
report the details to Princess Shenghua.

495
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:10,080
Princess Shenghua will definitely hate you.

496
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:16,720
Second,

497
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,310
when Marquis Dingnan came,

498
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,110
he brought many elite soldiers of Qingzhou.

499
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,470
These elite soldiers

500
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,150
are the late Marquis, Shang Wei's men.

501
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,790
They were loyal to Marquis Dingnan.

502
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,680
Let alone being beheaded,

503
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,230
even if a single hair of his is harmed,

504
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,830
these Qingzhou elite soldiers

505
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,230
won’t let you off easily.

506
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,910
General Shi.

507
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,830
This is the Crown Prince’s order.

508
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,990
Don't fool me.

509
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,310
How dare I?

510
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,750
Mr. Yang.

511
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,350
We've been very close these days.

512
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,510
That's why I'm telling you this.

513
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,030
Handling this matter

514
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,590
is indeed delicate.

515
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,190
You can take orders.

516
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,190
But you can't

517
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,230
risk your own life.

518
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,630
Mr. Yang.

519
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,150
I have a way to compromise.

520
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,070
Would you like to hear it?

521
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,080
Little Marquis.

522
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,310
Why are you here?

523
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,950
I had so much fun.

524
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,390
Yes.

525
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,030
Guess what?

526
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,750
Tang said he missed me.

527
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,640
and almost cried.

528
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,150
Do you miss him?

529
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,710
Of course, I do.

530
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,770
What's wrong?

531
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,330
My liver hurts.

532
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,720
My liver hurts.

533
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,800
I won't talk to you anymore.

534
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,390
If I keep talking to you,

535
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,040
I will faint.

536
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,150
Yes, he missed you.

537
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,830
He's tall and strong.

538
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,070
I'm nothing.

539
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,150
I'll stop.

540
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,250
Wait a minute.

541
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,270
How can you compare with him?

542
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,010
Is it comparable?

543
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,660
Can't I even compete with him?

544
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,930
The liver is on the other side.

545
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,270
Then what is this?

546
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,080
Let's get down to business.

547
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,400
Why did you come wandering over here

548
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,830
instead of borrowing provisions from the mansion?

549
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,920
Mr. Shi seems to be out for something.

550
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,050
I don’t know

551
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,590
if he's hiding from us.

552
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,810
This is indeed strange.

553
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,390
Don't go.

554
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,920
Let’s discuss it together.

555
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,120
General Shi went to see the Crown Prince’s advisor.

556
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,960
Someone called Mr. Yang.

557
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,750
Before General Shi went out today, I happened to be around.

558
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,170
I overheard part of their conversation.

559
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,570
Xiu'er, what are you doing?

560
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,560
I'm here to move my things.

561
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,910
Move?

562
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,670
Where are you going?

563
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,190
From today on,

564
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,510
I'll work for the City Guard's wife.

565
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,310
These days,

566
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,230
thank you for taking care of me.

567
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,990
I'm grateful.

568
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,990
Are you going to stay in the City Guard Mansion?

569
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,710
The City Guard's wife has invited me to help with some tasks by her side.

570
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,870
I'm alone and helpless.

571
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,810
It's good to stay here.

572
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,030
I don't want to be thrown away as a burden.

573
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,310
Xiu'er.

574
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,580
Who treats you as a burden?

575
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,680
Don't make reckless decisions.

576
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,310
Think about it.

577
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,270
You and I have no relationship.

578
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,560
I don't need your care.

579
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,080
Why didn't you help me just now?

580
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,990
Me helping you?

581
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,230
I can't even protect myself.

582
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,320
What's wrong, Young Marquis?

583
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,330
The Crown Prince's advisor came to Yuzhou.

584
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,730
Uncle Shi went to see him.

585
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,070
Do you think his refusal to lend us provisions

586
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,870
might be related to this matter?

587
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,500
Let's leave Yuzhou as soon as possible.

588
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,350
Why?

589
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,470
We were hunted all the way,

590
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,710
with dangers at every turn.

591
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,160
Now that the Crown Prince's influence has also extended to Yuzhou.

592
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,110
I'm afraid he wants to kill you.

593
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,440
I can't leave.

594
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,650
You won't leave?

595
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,990
Do you want to die?

596
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,350
I'm here to borrow provisions.

597
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,550
I didn't get them yet,

598
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,450
how can I face the Qingzhou Army?

599
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,580
It's none of my business.

600
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,150
My duty is to protect you.

601
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,430
Stop it.

602
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,650
Let’s wait until Mai comes back.

603
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,220
M...

604
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,090
Young Marquis.

605
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,790
Please come with me.

606
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,750
Uncle Shi, I’ll go with you.

607
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,510
Mai.

608
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,030
Why did you buy so many things at night?

609
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,140
You'll know later.

610
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,400
Sirs. Please enjoy.

611
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,820
Sir.

612
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,670
Are you staying overnight or just passing through?

613
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,470
I’m from General Shi’s mansion.

614
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,240
General Shi has prepared a gift for Mr. Yang.

615
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:46,610
Mr. Yang lives in the private room at the innermost part of the second floor.

616
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,210
Thank you.

617
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,140
You're welcome.

618
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,200
Brother.

619
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:50,910
Follow me.

620
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,260
Brother.

621
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,570
You said the Crown Prince's advisor came alone?

622
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,140
Yes.

623
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,760
I heard it from the soldiers guarding the city.

624
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,000
Why do you want to know about the Crown Prince's advisor?

625
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,280
I'm afraid he might harm Young Marquis.

626
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,940
So I came to check on him first.

627
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,050
Brother,

628
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,620
I want to find a time

629
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,200
to check Mr. Yang's room.

630
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,780
Okay, leave it to me.

631
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,670
How is the military power of Yuzhou?

632
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,320
The Qingzhou Army didn't listen to me.

633
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,190
Try to acquire the military power of Qingzhou and Yuzhou.

634
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,230
Take care.

635
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,320
Mr. Yang, you're back.

636
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,460
Why are you so careless?

637
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,520
What're you talking about?

638
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,120
You bumped into me.

639
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,710
Sir.

640
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,710
I'm really sorry.

641
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,230
I didn't see you just now.

642
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,360
Go away.

643
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,389
Go away.

644
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,480
Where are you from?

645
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,200
What are you doing?

646
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,290
You sit still in front of me.

647
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,730
Are you rebelling?

648
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,200
Do you think I won’t kill him?

649
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,070
if you act like this?

650
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,230
General Shi

651
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,910
is ungrateful.

652
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,270
The late Marquis treated him so well.

653
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,870
But he treated you like this.

654
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,270
Enough, Mu Bai.

655
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,430
Stop shouting.

656
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,190
Uncle Shi didn’t mean it.

657
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,190
He must have his reasons.

658
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,650
Young Marquis, you're still defending him?

659
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,650
Young Marquis.

660
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,950
Young Marquis, I'm sorry.

661
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,150
I'm sorry.

662
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,790
Yang Xuan gave me a secret order from the Crown Prince.

663
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,590
It listed three crimes you committed in Qingzhou.

664
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,790
All of them are capital crimes.

665
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,550
Shi Dachun.

666
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,440
Don't slander him.

667
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,270
What did Young Marquis do wrong?

668
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,090
Let Uncle Shi speak.

669
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,230
The Crown Prince

670
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,740
announced that you killed the deputy general in Qingzhou

671
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,910
released the prisoners in private,

672
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,730
and left your post without permission.

673
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,590
Now, while the Crown Prince has not

674
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,880
yet arrived in Yuzhou,

675
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,390
I'll immediately send someone to inform Princess Shenghua.

676
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,760
Perhaps only by doing so, there might be a turning point in this matter.

677
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,470
Shi Dachun.

678
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,520
Is this just your excuse?

679
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,390
He is the Crown Prince.

680
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,280
You’re just a guard general. What can you do?

681
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,550
Uncle Shi.

682
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,900
There's a man called Mai

683
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,430
who came with me.

684
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,690
She wants to go to Beimo.

685
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,630
Can you promise me

686
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,150
to find some people to follow her

687
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,110
to protect her?

688
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,610
Young Marquis.

689
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,150
Young Marquis.

690
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,500
Young Marquis.

691
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,150
Wait.

692
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,710
Where did Young Marquis go?

693
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,230
Our master brought a team here

694
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,700
and took Young Marquis away.

695
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,500
Took him away?

696
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,200
Where?

697
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,910
I don't know.

698
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,140
Oh no.

699
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,840
Mai.

700
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,430
I’ve arranged someone

701
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,830
to send you out tomorrow.

702
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,710
As for how to go to Beimo,

703
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,980
you can figure it out yourself.

704
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,640
What do you mean, General Shi?

705
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,840
Where did you take Young Marquis?

706
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,800
I didn't mean to arrest him.

707
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,790
The Crown Prince wants to kill him.

708
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,750
[How is the military power of Yuzhou? The Qingzhou Army disobeyed my order]

709
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,750
[Try to acquire the military power of Qingzhou and Yuzhou as soon as possible]

710
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,750
I don't know how to rescue

711
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,640
Young Marquis tonight.

712
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,120
General Shi, wait.

713
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,760
Since Young Marquis is my friend,

714
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,140
I won’t leave him alone.

715
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,590
As far as I know,

716
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,490
the Crown Prince is here for military power, right?

717
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,890
You even know that?

718
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,830
Yes.

719
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,310
The Crown Prince has no military power.

720
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,580
His position in the court is very awkward.

721
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,110
He tried to win me over and over again.

722
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,660
I didn't want to participate in the royal power struggle.

723
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,220
So I didn't answer.

724
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,740
Young Marquis has just left Shengdu.

725
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,920
His foundation is unstable.

726
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,920
Young Marquis has little foundation,

727
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,010
which is the bargaining chip for you and I to rescue him.

728
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,130
Do you have an idea?

729
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,510
Is there going to be a martial arts competition in Yuzhou?

730
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,070
Yes.

731
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,240
Take a look.

732
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,980
General Shi is so kind.

733
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,340
He invited me to watch the play and even assigned two guards to accompany me.

734
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,230
What's going on?

735
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,880
Mr. Yang,

736
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,620
Why are you not in a good mood today?

737
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,950
General Shi.

738
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,220
They are not Yuzhou soldiers.

739
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,760
They're Qingzhou soldiers led by Shang Yizhi, aren't they?

740
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,230
Don't mention it.

741
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,440
These people have been surrounding me since I went out in the morning.

742
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
They didn't talk.

743
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,640
It's scary.

744
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,190
Could it be

745
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,570
that they found out that we've

746
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,180
captured Shang Yizhi?

747
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,730
The walls have ears.

748
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,750
We made such a big fuss.

749
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:30,080
And these guards would risk their lives to protect Shang Yizhi.

750
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,470
It's not surprising even if they know.

751
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,480
What should I do?

752
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,550
Mr. Yang.

753
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:40,030
I have an idea. Would you like to hear it?

754
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,250
Young Marquis.

755
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,850
Young Marquis.

756
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,000
Mai.

757
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,920
Do you know I’ve been waiting for you?

758
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,090
Young Marquis, I'm glad you're fine.

759
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,740
Don't worry.

760
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,290
I'm here to get you out.

761
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,310
I know.

762
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,800
You must have an idea.

763
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,600
Don't get too excited.

764
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,310
My idea is risky.

765
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,430
What risk?

766
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,470
Our Yuzhou

767
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,060
is going to hold a martial arts competition.

768
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,590
We'll let the Qingzhou Army battle with the Yuzhou Army.

769
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,340
Our Yuzhou Army is strong and robust.

770
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,010
With you as the commander,

771
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,130
it'll be easy for us

772
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,670
to defeat Qingzhou Army.

773
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,920
After Qingzhou's military power is disintegrated,

774
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,690
we can deal with Shang Yizhi as we wish.

775
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,750
Without the Qingzhou Army as his backer,

776
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,130
even if we force him to commit suicide,

777
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,330
what can he do about it?
