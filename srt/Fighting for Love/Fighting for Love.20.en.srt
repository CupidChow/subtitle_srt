00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,009
Episode 20

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,960
Mai.

5
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,670
Did you miss me again?

6
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,830
In my opinion,

7
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,890
the war should be over soon.

8
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,979
Then I'll marry you and take you back to my home.

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,640
Who said I would marry you?

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,840
You kissed me, so you have to be responsible for me, right?

11
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,360
Then you can be my matrilocal husband.

12
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,910
It's okay.

13
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,580
I'll be your matrilocal husband.

14
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,480
Then give me your sabre as your dowry.

15
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,800
Send it to the Seventh Battalion.

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,670
Who would give his fiancee a sabre as a betrothal gift?

17
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,670
How ominous it is.

18
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,250
I like it.

19
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,840
Give a sabre to each member of the Seventh Battalion.

20
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,640
It'll be better if you give them two respectively.

21
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,990
I see.

22
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,550
The reason why you came here to see me isn't that you missed me.

23
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,480
You came here to ask me for weapons.

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,810
Will you give them to me or not?

25
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,579
Yes, I will.

26
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,990
Ma'am,

27
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,829
I'll approve the request for you later.

28
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,829
I'm leaving then.

29
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,130
Then shouldn't you

30
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,470
kiss me forcibly?

31
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,070
Thank you, sir.

32
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,030
General, have you made a decision after thinking about it?

33
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,670
Sir,

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,150
although in the battle of Yelanggou,

35
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,780
the Beimo Army was defeated by us,

36
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,550
they still have many soldiers

37
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,150
who are stationed in Yuzhou.

38
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,950
The total number of our soldiers

39
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,990
is not even half of the number of the Beimo soldiers.

40
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,310
If I were Chen Qi,

41
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,670
I would go north at once when the Zhenbei Army's vitality

42
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,710
was greatly sapped.

43
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,790
As long as they cross the Wanjiang River,

44
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,870
Shengdu will be in danger.

45
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,610
But before that,

46
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,550
we must take back Yuzhou first.

47
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,230
Yuzhou is located on a plain where there is abundant food.

48
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,940
By occupying this city,

49
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,710
the Beimo Army is a threat to our territory on the north of the Wanjiang River.

50
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,440
Besides, since Yuzhou was occupied by our enemy,

51
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,230
we haven't heard from Lord Shi till now.

52
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,990
In the Zhenbei Army, the family members of those soldiers who are from Yuzhou

53
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,870
have been captured by the Beimo Army

54
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,780
because Shi Dachun surrendered to the enemy.

55
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,240
As time goes by, I'm afraid the morale of our army might change.

56
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,960
Our top priority now

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,480
is to get in touch with General Shi.

58
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,750
Therefore, I want to ask Lieutenant Tang to go there personally.

59
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,680
That's exactly what I want.

60
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,970
I'll follow the order.

61
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,430
Thank you, Lieutenant Tang.

62
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,589
Set out now.

63
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,620
I'll see you off.

64
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,190
Okay.

65
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,750
Come on.

66
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,490
Marshal Shang.

67
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,310
I have some concerns.

68
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,170
I know what your concerns are.

69
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,590
Few people know the truth

70
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,640
about Uncle Shi's fake surrender.

71
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,750
If I were Chen Qi,

72
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,800
I would also threaten or tempt him.

73
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,230
Instead of being scolded by the later generations for thousands of years,

74
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,070
I'd rather surrender to the enemy sincerely

75
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,110
and be a meritorious minister who contributes to founding the State of Beimo.

76
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,750
Marshal Shang,

77
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,350
that's exactly my concern.

78
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,200
If General Shi really wants to surrender,

79
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,310
I'm afraid I can't complete the task

80
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,580
when I'm going to Yuzhou alone this time.

81
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,440
Marshal Shang, please arrange an assistant for me.

82
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,080
Mai!

83
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,190
Are you regretting it?

84
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,740
What do you mean by regretting it?

85
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,750
You mean the dowry? No.

86
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,960
You mean the weapons?

87
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,390
I want to arrange a more important task for you.

88
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,910
If you finish this task successfully,

89
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,510
you can have all the weapons.

90
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,370
Take her away.

91
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,790
Thank you, Marshal Shang.

92
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,310
General Shi, don't blame me for being suspicious.

93
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,920
I thought you didn't surrender sincerely.

94
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,750
I was wary of you at first.

95
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,310
But later, I saw that all the departments in the city were quite cooperative

96
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,910
and there were no obstacles.

97
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,310
We could take over the defence of the city so smoothly.

98
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,800
It was all due to your help.

99
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,790
When I return to the capital, I'll fulfill my promise

100
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,250
and ask for a title for you.

101
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,110
It's my duty.

102
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,430
I dare not take credit.

103
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,520
Don't refuse, General Shi.

104
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,190
Although I have taken over Yuzhou,

105
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,380
I don't know much about the families in the city.

106
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,440
If His Majesty asks about it,

107
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,840
I don't know how to explain to him properly.

108
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,110
So, General Shi, please do me a small favor.

109
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,830
Please say it, Marshal Chen.

110
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,270
I wonder how many rich and famous merchants

111
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,510
there are in this city,

112
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,920
and which families have granaries that are full of food

113
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,910
and have the habit of hoarding food.

114
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,240
General Shi, please write down their names one by one for me.

115
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,670
Marshal Chen.

116
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,620
I used to be the City Guard indeed.

117
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,050
But I was

118
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,630
mainly in charge of city defence.

119
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,100
I really don't know such trivial matters

120
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,310
as people's livelihood.

121
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,430
Just tell me about three or five households, and it'll be fine.

122
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,510
I really don't know.

123
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,820
Then seven or eight households.

124
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,860
Ten households.

125
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,020
Please forgive my incompetence.

126
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,750
Fine.

127
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,530
In that case, I won't give you a hard time.

128
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,190
But the weather has been dry recently.

129
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,030
I'm just worried that it might lead to a fire in the city at night easily.

130
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,340
Two households.

131
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,100
Mr. Wang in the south of the city

132
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,770
used to get rich by selling illegal salt.

133
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,570
Mr. Zhang in the east of the city used to be a bandit at sea.

134
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,360
Both of them have earned their money illegally.

135
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,790
If you want me to talk about more households,

136
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,590
I don't know even if you kill me.

137
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,470
Okay.

138
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,350
Guards!

139
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,630
Yes.

140
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,040
Ask Deputy General Jiang to come here.

141
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,680
By the way,

142
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,710
I've heard that you like listening to operas.

143
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,190
It's boring to stay at home all day.

144
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,230
How about this?

145
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,030
Go to the Mingchun Garden and ask them to put on an opera here

146
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,750
in order to divert General Shi's attention from boredom.

147
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,720
Besides, go to my private vault

148
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,420
and fetch a box of Eastern Pearls so that Mrs. Shi can enjoy the fun of appreciating them.

149
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,350
Marshal Chen.

150
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,710
It's not the right time to listen to an opera now.

151
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,880
How about this?

152
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,080
My wife has been with me for many years.

153
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,070
I've never given her any jewelry.

154
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,390
I'd like to thank you on behalf of my wife.

155
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,950
Okay.

156
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,430
Stop.

157
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,940
Cui,

158
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,150
there are a few steamed buns left after we paid homage to the Buddha.

159
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,750
Just give those buns to them.

160
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,040
But Madam,

161
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,910
they won't accept the things from our mansion.

162
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,310
Both they and we are the people of Yuzhou.

163
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,440
We can't ignore them since we saw them.

164
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,490
-Yes.
-Just go.

165
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,750
Here you are.

166
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,950
Thank you. Thank you.

167
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,390
-Thank you. -Thank you.

168
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,120
Here you are.

169
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,350
There are enough buns for everyone.

170
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,110
No hurry. Here you are.

171
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,260
Even if I starve to death, I won't accept the food given by a traitor.

172
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,830
Go away!

173
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,150
Go away!

174
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,950
Go away, poor woman!

175
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,630
Officer, please let me in.

176
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,030
My family is waiting for me.

177
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,590
I beg you, officer!

178
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,640
Let me in.

179
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,190
-Next one.
-Officer!

180
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,270
Let me in.

181
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,950
My child is waiting for me at home, officer!

182
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,510
-Ma'am. -Ma'am.

183
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,790
-Ma'am, stand up.
-Stand up.

184
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,850
-Come on.
-Come on.

185
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,840
Ma'am, here you are.

186
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,510
Thank you.

187
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,070
Ma'am.

188
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,390
Have the people in the city been bullied and insulted like this all the time?

189
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,470
Don't mention it.

190
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,210
These cruel bastards pretended to be kind before they entered the city.

191
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,470
They said they wouldn't hurt the people.

192
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,790
But not long after that, they changed.

193
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,070
They robbed whoever they saw.

194
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,840
Didn't General Shi stop them from doing that?

195
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,850
He's just a traitor who is afraid of death.

196
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,710
If he had not defected to the enemy,

197
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,350
we wouldn't have suffered like this.

198
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,030
Come on. Let's enter the city first.

199
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,050
Officer.

200
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,120
Here you are.

201
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,190
Thanks for your hard work, officer.

202
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,960
Here you are.

203
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,450
Guys, take the money to have some tea.

204
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,230
Moisten your throats.

205
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,710
Go.

206
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,160
Thank you, officer.

207
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,190
Let's go.

208
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,670
-Go away! -Go away!

209
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,540
Go away!

210
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,940
Officers, don't do this!

211
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,810
Officers!

212
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,110
These Beimo bastards

213
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,390
have bullied and suppressed the people so badly.

214
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,850
It was lucky that they didn't slaughter the people in the city.

215
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:36,950
Let's go.

216
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,960
Bro.

217
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,070
Chen Qi insists on living with you.

218
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,730
He's so disrespectful to you.

219
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,510
You're a general after all.

220
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,590
You should have your own mansion.

221
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,310
It's good enough to have a place to live when we're fighting at war as soldiers.

222
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,950
Why should I have so many requirements?

223
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,310
I just don't like Chen Qi and his faction,

224
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,920
especially that coward Jiang Chengyi.

225
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,070
If he had not hidden in the barracks without coming out,

226
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,950
I would have chopped his head off.

227
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,960
Bro, I know that

228
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,430
I need to calm down.

229
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,950
Chen Qi is weird, too.

230
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,610
He insists on living with you.

231
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,230
He seems to be close to me,

232
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,030
but he's actually trying to keep an eye on my every movement.

233
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,350
Though Yuzhou was conquered by me,

234
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,150
in fact,

235
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,290
it was Chen Qi who negotiated with the local defending troops.

236
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,310
He was determined to occupy Yuzhou.

237
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,160
I see.

238
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,860
But didn't our family say that...

239
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,850
Don't talk about this topic outside.

240
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,380
You are in charge of the patrol in the city.

241
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,750
When we walked all the way here just now,

242
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,150
I didn't see you carefully check

243
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,030
the surrounding people.

244
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,790
Don't let any spy enter the city.

245
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,430
Bro,

246
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,600
just look at the people of Nanxia who are so listless.

247
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,730
What's wrong, bro?

248
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,390
Nothing.

249
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,630
Be more careful on the next patrol.

250
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,490
Report to me if anything happens.

251
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,270
Yes.

252
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,840
Over there.

253
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,940
My dear husband.

254
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,430
Just let our second child take a bite, too.

255
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,230
I beg you.

256
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,110
-My dear husband.
-Mother.

257
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,830
-I beg you.
-Eat it yourself.

258
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,310
Nearly all the valuable things

259
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,560
at our home have been taken away by them.

260
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,720
Our eldest son is more likely to survive.

261
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,410
Otherwise,

262
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,000
our whole family will starve to death.

263
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,970
Big Brother, let's go take a look.

264
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,700
My dear wife.

265
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,720
You also need to stay alive.

266
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,810
Eat it.

267
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,970
My dear husband!

268
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,560
Spit it out.

269
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,930
Come on. Spit it out.

270
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,270
This is not edible.

271
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,110
Take the money

272
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,910
to buy some food for the kids.

273
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,180
Thank you, benefactor.

274
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,110
Thanks, benefactor.

275
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,630
You're welcome. Please get up.

276
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,670
-Thank you, benefactor. -You're welcome.

277
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,270
Thank you.

278
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,040
Okay.

279
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,710
Thank you.

280
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,790
Mai.

281
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,250
Is it still necessary for us to go to see Shi Dachun?

282
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,580
Lord Shi may not know the situation of this place.

283
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,180
Since he's an official in Yuzhou, doesn't he know the situation of the people here?

284
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,830
I think he has probably colluded with the Beimo people.

285
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,950
Big Brother.

286
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,900
When we see Lord Shi,

287
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,420
let's collaborate with each other to persuade him.

288
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,630
Let’s talk while walking.

289
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,630
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

290
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,510
Dear,

291
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,270
did you encounter any trouble when you went out

292
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,480
of the city to worship the Buddha with joss sticks today?

293
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,430
No.

294
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,310
Everything was fine.

295
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,470
Okay.

296
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,950
Chen Qi forced me to accept their gift.

297
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,430
Dear, just put it away.

298
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,030
There are precious jewels in this room.

299
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,350
General Shi and Mrs. Shi

300
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,000
are living such a good life.

301
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,070
Mai, you're here.

302
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,360
Hurry up.

303
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,590
General Shi, Mrs. Shi.

304
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,870
So this is Young Marquis's...

305
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,470
Yes.

306
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,330
This is the Mai, whom Young Marquis trusts the most.

307
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,750
I'll guard the door for you outside.

308
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,390
Okay.

309
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,990
Gentelmen,

310
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,840
please accept my bow.

311
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,240
Please get up, General Shi.

312
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,560
Why did you bow to us?

313
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,220
You are the closest people to Marshal Shang.

314
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,430
Seeing you is like seeing Marshal Shang.

315
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,010
I'm living a humble life in Yuzhou

316
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,710
and muddling along under the control of the enemy.

317
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,550
How can I live up to Marshal Shang's expectations?

318
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,670
How can I live up to

319
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,070
the efforts of the soldiers who fought so hard on the front line?

320
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,430
I feel ashamed.

321
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,550
General Shi.

322
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,830
Beimo people are barbarous.

323
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,550
You must have suffered a lot

324
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,690
while staying here to communicate with them.

325
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,290
I wonder whether the Beimo people made things difficult for you.

326
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,730
They know nothing about city defence and civil affairs.

327
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,790
Sometimes, they have to ask me about these things.

328
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,110
Thus, they're kind of polite to me.

329
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,590
The Beimo people let you eat abundant fish and meat

330
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,120
and gave you so many treasures for amusement.

331
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,990
They're just too polite.

332
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,270
Marshal Shang suspects that I've defected to the enemy?

333
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,350
I refused to accept nearly eighty or ninety percent

334
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,200
of the gold and silver given by the Beimo people.

335
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,750
But I just couldn't refuse to accept all their gifts.

336
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,470
They might get suspicious easily.

337
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,670
They've even confined me in this house.

338
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,890
Don’t worry, General Shi.

339
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,030
Marshal Shang has always believed in your loyalty.

340
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,290
This time, we came here

341
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,190
to discuss with you

342
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,070
about how to retake Yuzhou.

343
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,580
Yuzhou is like a granary of the Central Plains.

344
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,710
We can't let it be occupied by the Beimo people.

345
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,150
Does Marshal Shang have any good solutions?

346
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,790
No, he doesn't.

347
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,110
Then I'm afraid I can't follow his orders.

348
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,270
General Shi,

349
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,800
I'm sorry for our offence just now.

350
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,130
Please forgive us

351
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,050
and think more about the people in the city.

352
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,910
I'm doing this for the sake of the people.

353
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,590
It's normal for Marshal Shang to suspect me of defecting to the enemy.

354
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,590
I don't blame him.

355
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,240
But those defending soldiers from Beimo are powerful, and their horses are strong.

356
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,270
If Marshal Shang has no good solutions,

357
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,270
I can't risk

358
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,270
the lives of the people in the city.

359
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,430
General Shi,

360
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,920
do you know the current situation

361
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,320
of the people in the city?

362
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,870
Don't use the people as an excuse.

363
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,630
Do you know that the people of Yuzhou City

364
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,270
have become lambs that are waiting to be killed?

365
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,750
How dare you mention them?

366
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,130
The people are in trouble?

367
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,510
General Shi, would you like to go out with me to take a look?

368
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,390
My dear husband.

369
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,540
What should I do after you passed away?

370
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,990
Wake up, dear husband!

371
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,830
What should I do after you passed away?

372
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,510
Dear!

373
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,630
How can I live?

374
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,940
If General Shi had really wanted to defect to the enemy,

375
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,110
you and I would have been arrested.

376
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,110
General Shi.

377
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,990
We just wanted you to see clearly

378
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,390
how the Beimo people bullied our people.

379
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,990
You are right.

380
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,990
I stayed at home like a coward without caring about what was happening outside.

381
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,030
I've disappointed the people by doing this.

382
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,270
General Shi.

383
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,330
Don't blame me for saying this to you bluntly.

384
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,090
Although we don't have

385
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,630
a thorough plan now,

386
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,580
for the sake of every citizen in this city,

387
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,810
we must do something

388
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,750
to save them from difficult situations.

389
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,510
What do you think?

390
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,060
General Shi, please make a decision.

391
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,030
I have an idea.

392
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,390
I don't know whether we can give it a try.

393
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,150
Please say it.

394
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,990
I need to talk to Marshal Shang face to face.

395
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,510
You don't trust me?

396
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,730
It's not like that.

397
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,510
All the people in the city

398
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,620
can only live once.

399
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,270
I can't risk their lives.

400
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,790
I understand.

401
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,000
We'll go back to Pingjia'ao at once and report it to Marshal Shang.

402
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,120
[Chen Qi is powerful now and has made the Empress Dowager always follow his advice.]

403
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,120
[Now we need to occupy Yuzhou as soon as possible, and then we can consider withdrawing the troops. It's urgent.]

404
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,660
Bro.

405
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,430
If I hadn't been caught in Pingjia'ao,

406
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,490
you wouldn't be in such a dilemma now.

407
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,250
Since you know that,

408
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,370
you should be more careful next time.

409
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,980
The most important thing now

410
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,820
is to take back the commanding rights of Yuzhou City as soon as possible.

411
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,590
Only in this case can our family carry out the plan well in the imperial court

412
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,750
in order to make Chen Qi withdraw the troops and return to the imperial court.

413
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,010
That's easy, isn't it? Just take his troops away directly.

414
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,090
Forget it. Let's take our time to figure out a way to withdraw the troops.

415
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,470
You've finished your patrol?

416
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,440
Don't worry, bro.

417
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,110
I've checked the city very carefully.

418
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,590
I'm here to tell you that

419
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,460
I took some men to take a look around Yuzhou City.

420
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,230
We didn't find anything unusual.

421
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,540
Did you go to Shi's Mansion and check that place?

422
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,300
No.

423
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,430
That old man follows Chen Qi's orders.

424
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,090
Why should I investigate him?

425
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,480
No, I'm still worried.

426
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,060
I'll go investigate him myself.

427
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,790
Big Brother.

428
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,760
There's no time to lose.

429
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,990
We need to go back to our barracks at once and report it.

430
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,390
How I wish we could have two fast horses now.

431
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,620
How about this, Mai?

432
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,870
I'll go get two horses from the Beimo Army and bring them here.

433
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,930
Let's go together.

434
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,510
It's safer to let me go alone.

435
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,150
Just wait for me here.

436
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,070
If I don't come back within an hour,

437
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,750
go back to the barracks yourself to report the news.

438
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,480
Big Brother,

439
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,240
if you don't see me after you come back,

440
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,110
you should also go back to the barracks yourself to report the news.

441
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,110
No need to worry about me.

442
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,400
Okay. It's a deal.

443
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,430
It's a deal.

444
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,730
Screw you!

445
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,230
I knew it.

446
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,960
This poor guy wouldn't have money to buy food.

447
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,540
Arrest them for me!

448
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,120
Come with us.

449
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,130
Let's go!

450
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,130
-My dear husband!
-I'll kill you!

451
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,880
My dear husband!

452
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,840
Why did you kill my parents?

453
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:32,790
Who did it?

454
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,550
Please spare my life, General.

455
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,450
I told you

456
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,110
not to harass or bully the people.

457
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,560
What? Don't you understand my military order?

458
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,630
General, I'm sorry.

459
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,160
Get lost!

460
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,670
It's really you.

461
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,010
You didn't come here alone.

462
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,490
Don't worry.

463
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,590
I'll make arrangements for these two kids.

464
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,830
Don't worry?

465
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,580
Can you people from Beimo really care about others?

466
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,760
I'll make arrangements personally.

467
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,970
Since we parted in Pingjia'ao,

468
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,700
have you ever regretted it?

469
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,410
Of course I have.

470
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,480
If I hadn't let the tiger return to the mountain,

471
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,700
the people of Yuzhou wouldn't have ended up

472
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,160
being bullied and slaughtered by the enemy!

473
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,450
Take him away.

474
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,600
Do you think that I was the one who did this?

475
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,880
The city gate of Yuzhou was opened by your cavalry.

476
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,310
If your soldiers weren't the ones who did this,

477
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,970
whose soilders could they be?

478
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,140
They were Chen Qi's soldiers.

479
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,270
Believe it or not,

480
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,600
though Yuzhou was conquered by me,

481
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,870
before the middle troops retreated from Yelanggou,

482
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,730
my soldiers

483
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,830
had never hurt any innocent civilians.

484
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,250
How can I trust you?

485
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,160
What do you want?

486
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,070
Send me to the Marshal's Mansion

487
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,670
so that I can kill him myself.

488
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,490
Then I'll trust you.

489
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
You won't be able to kill him.

490
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,880
I'll help you this time.

491
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,550
After I kill him,

492
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,960
you'll be the Marshal.

493
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,260
Okay. Let's take a bet.

494
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,240
You won't be able to kill him.

495
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,440
How do you know if you don't let me give it a try?

496
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,950
What are you doing?

497
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,650
Will you stop questioning me after I did this?

498
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,190
Chen Qi has gained the current position step by step.

499
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,230
How would he be scared by just a dagger?

500
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,160
Don't be stupid.

501
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,200
Thank you for your advice, General Chang.

502
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,030
But I know him better than you do.

503
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,590
Besides,

504
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,730
this is a personal grudge between him and me.

505
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,420
You don't have to interfere.

506
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,110
Thank you.

507
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,030
Put it down.

508
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,270
You're finally here, Sister.

509
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,380
You killed all the members of my family.

510
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,440
I surely have to come.

511
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,950
I didn't expect that you'd rather join the army

512
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,370
just in order to see me.

513
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,710
I've been missing you all these years.

514
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,740
Why?

515
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,440
My father personally taught you military strategies and martial arts skills.

516
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,370
My mother even loved you so dearly.

517
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,400
They treated you so nicely.

518
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,370
Why did you kill them?

519
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,210
Why?

520
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,330
I've never meant to hurt you.

521
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,360
I've never wanted to kill you, either.

522
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,870
I just hope that you can live well.

523
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,020
You hope I can live well?

524
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,040
Do you know how I've lived all these years?

525
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,340
Why don't you just kill me?

526
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,140
Why don't you just kill me?

527
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,730
Tell me why.

528
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,980
Tell me why.

529
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,200
Tell me why!

530
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,790
Mai.

531
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,280
You can't kill me.

532
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,940
If you kill me, you'll be killed, too.

533
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,420
Then let's die together!

534
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,930
Do you think that the people whom I took there that day

535
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,820
were really from Beimo?

536
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,000
Don't move!

537
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,870
Stop!

538
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,100
Marshal, be careful.

539
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,750
Don't hurt my woman.

540
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,660
Your woman?

541
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,670
She's obviously an assassin.

542
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,150
Today,

543
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,190
I took a fancy to this Nanxia woman on the street,

544
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,390
so I brought her back.

545
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,070
This dagger

546
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,360
is the love token I gave her.

547
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,990
But unexpectedly, this woman was so hot-tempered that

548
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,860
when I wasn't paying attention to her,

549
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,550
she took this opportunity to sneak out and disturb you.

550
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,510
How could a woman

551
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,330
be capable of assassinating others?

552
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,540
Could you please show me some respect

553
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,000
and let go of her?

554
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,390
Since it's a misunderstanding,

555
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,440
just let go of her.

556
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,830
Marshal.

557
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,720
Let go of her!

558
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,020
Let's go!

559
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,840
Let's go!

560
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,740
Let go of me!

561
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,760
Let go of me! Let me ask him clearly!

562
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,710
Let go of me! Let go of me!

563
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,590
Put me down!

564
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,000
Put me down now!

565
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,130
Are you crazy?

566
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,389
Do you want to die?

567
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,030
That's the Marshal's Mansion.

568
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,429
If I had not saved you just now,

569
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,489
you would have died. Do you know that?

570
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,280
I don't care what the big grudge is

571
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,610
between you and Chen Qi.

572
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,070
I'm not interested in it at all, either.

573
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,330
You know what?

574
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,790
I want to kill Chen Qi, too.

575
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,070
I thought of every possible way to kill him.

576
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,820
But it's not easy to kill him.

577
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,270
It's not something as simple

578
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,330
as you thought you could do like this.

579
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,500
Now no matter what you want to do,

580
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,150
we must discuss it and think about it carefully first.

581
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,270
Just stay in this room.

582
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,910
Don't go anywhere else.

583
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,870
Just let me handle the matter

584
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,520
between you and Chen Qi.

585
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,970
Did you hear me?

586
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,300
♫The cold wind blew across the land, and I sang a sad song with it♫

587
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:34,730
♫The mountains are extensive and the seas are vast, but how much joy can we get?♫

588
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,780
♫It's getting dark in the desert, and the mighty soldiers are fighting on horses among the blown sand♫

589
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,150
♫Whose happy song are they protecting?♫

590
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:55,300
♫If my ending has been decided♫

591
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,190
-Mai! -Go!

592
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,950
-Go! -Go!

593
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:02,180
♫How can my lifetime pass so quickly?♫

594
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:08,900
♫Time flies like rain, and it's scattered all over the ground♫

595
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,280
I can't find her.

596
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,630
Where is she?

597
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,430
Look for her carefully!

598
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:14,850
♫The shaking flames of war are about to extinguish, and there will be partings again♫

599
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,990
Let me search this area.

600
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,830
You guys can search the area over there.

601
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:15,390
Okay.

602
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,480
♫I hoped for it and I became speechless♫

603
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,760
♫I sank into the ruined city and watched myself♫

604
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,380
♫I'd rather not hide from it♫

605
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,740
♫It'll never stop growing for the rest of my life♫

606
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,080
♫Time flies like rain, and it's scattered all over the ground♫

607
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:41,880
♫The shaking flames of war are about to extinguish, and there will be partings again♫

608
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,440
♫I hoped for it and I became speechless♫

609
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,920
♫I sank into the ruined city and watched myself♫

610
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,570
♫I'd rather not hide from it♫

611
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:58,440
♫It'll never stop growing for the rest of my life♫

612
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,440
Keep an eye on her closely.

613
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,030
You'll be held responsible if she's missing.

614
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,590
Yes.

615
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,270
What?

616
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,510
Mai was abducted by Chang Yuqing?

617
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,370
It was my fault.

618
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,590
But there was news from General Shi.

619
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,790
I had no choice but to come back to the barracks first.

620
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,310
Marshal Shang, calm down.

621
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,360
What did General Shi say?

622
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,100
General Shi said he had a way to retake Yuzhou,

623
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,500
but he must talk to Marshal Shang face to face personally.

624
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,790
I must go.

625
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,950
I'm afraid there might be a trap.

626
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,010
Marshal Shang.

627
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,560
Don't be impulsive.

628
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,150
Sir.

629
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,430
Uncle Shi won't hurt me.

630
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,590
Besides,

631
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,470
how can we let Mai fall into the hands of the enemy?

632
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,150
He's our army’s Charming Yama.

633
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,070
Even so,

634
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,790
the army should still be managed by a leader here.

635
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,790
You don't have to go personally.

636
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,270
I was thinking exactly the same thing.

637
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,270
You can stay here.

638
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,750
I'll ask the Personal Guards Battalion to go with me.

639
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,310
Mu Bai.

640
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,670
Tell everyone to get changed to disguise themselves.

641
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,710
We'll set off in 15 minutes.

642
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,260
Yes.

643
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,310
My Lady, have you got up?

644
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,860
My Lady.

645
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,270
I'm coming in.

646
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,630
The general has prepared some clothes for you.

647
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,560
Please change into these clothes.

648
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,510
I'm Mo Yu,

649
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,510
General Chang's personal guard.

650
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,110
I'm here to protect you under his order.

651
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,510
You're here to protect me?

652
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,110
Yes.

653
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,930
You'll protect me only by yourself?

654
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:19,710
Yes.

655
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,190
You don't have to accompany me.

656
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,590
I need to go to the toilet.

657
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,310
Miss.

658
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,070
I still have to follow you when you go to the toilet.

659
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,270
What? You even need to accompany me when I go to the toilet?

660
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,070
If I want to take a bath,

661
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,600
will you also need to accompany me?

662
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,860
I've got the order that

663
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,930
I have to follow you wherever you go.

664
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,960
Miss.

665
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,670
I've prepared some food for you.

666
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:09,950
Where are you going now, Miss?

667
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,320
I'm not going anywhere.

668
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,250
I just want to take a walk casually.

669
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,040
You don't have to accompany me.

670
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,450
Lieutenant Tang and Mu Bai should enter the city with me.

671
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,200
You guys can stay outside the city.

672
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,870
Okay.

673
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,510
No.

674
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,830
The situation in the city is complicated.

675
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,400
Just let more people go with you to protect you.

676
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,390
We can only use our wisdom this time. We can't do it forcibly.

677
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,920
It'll be a burden if there are too many people.

678
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,000
They can enter the city in batches.

679
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,630
Alright. Let's take a step back respectively.

680
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,310
Zhao Zhong is good at martial arts. Take him with you.

681
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,570
Right, Young Marquis.

682
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,710
Fine.

683
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,270
The four of us will go.

684
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,300
The rest of you should take care of the horses outside the city first,

685
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,070
and wait for the signal at any time.

686
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,000
Yes.

687
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,630
Let's go.

688
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,630
Bro.

689
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,750
Are you really going to protect that woman?

690
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,270
She's a trouble maker.

691
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,510
Currently, your Chang Family can't afford any trouble.

692
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,550
The imperial court already knows about this.

693
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,230
Besides, if Chen Qi knows this,

694
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,360
he won't let you off.

695
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:25,950
Bro.

696
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,580
You should either kill her or let go of her.

697
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,270
Or you can hand her over to Chen Qi.

698
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,150
But you...

699
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,350
No.

700
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,470
I think this is an opportunity.

701
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,190
We can use this person

702
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,710
to eliminate the Nanxia Army and Chen Qi at the same time.
