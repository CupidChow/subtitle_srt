00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,310
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,670
His Highness is back.

6
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,950
Grandfather.

7
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,110
Grandfather.

8
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,230
What's wrong?

9
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,070
Okay.

10
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,070
Grandfather.

11
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,600
What happened to your hand?

12
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,430
Okay.

13
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,870
What’s wrong?

14
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,640
[The birth date of the eldest son of Marquis Dingnan's Mansion, Shang Yizhi, is listed below]

15
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,790
Look.

16
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:31,990
Father.

17
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,960
Are you anxious?

18
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,430
I'm not in a hurry to get married.

19
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,030
A grown girl can’t stay.

20
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:49,030
Prime Minister, I'm sure you've given a lot of thought to

21
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,150
Zerou's choice of husband.

22
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,270
But Young Marquis is often in the army.

23
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,250
The couple will be away from each other a lot.

24
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,910
It's not good.

25
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,790
But look at Zerou's demeanor,

26
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,660
she's already very satisfied.

27
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,030
How could I not know her feelings?

28
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,270
But I only have Zerou to look after.

29
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,550
I hope you can understand my feelings as a mother.

30
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,280
This will affect Zerou's life.

31
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,590
I don't want her to regret it in the future.

32
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,590
Madam, remember.

33
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,950
This matter not only concerns her life,

34
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,060
but also the Prime Minister's Mansion.

35
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,590
There must be no mistakes.

36
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,430
Yes, I understand.

37
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,670
What are you...

38
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,770
Mother, what brings you here?

39
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,970
This is the red wedding dress I prepared for Mai.

40
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,980
Today,

41
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,510
I exchanged Bazi with Zeruo for you.

42
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:21,670
Mother,

43
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,350
why did you exchange Bazi with her?

44
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,590
Today, I officially

45
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,570
asked to marry Lin Zerou, the daughter of Prime Minister Lin, on your behalf.

46
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,710
Prime Minister Lin is very satisfied with you.

47
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,990
I don’t agree to this.

48
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,030
I only love Mai.

49
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,310
Mother.

50
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,909
I will only marry her.

51
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,030
I know.

52
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,310
But Mai has a blood feud with our family.

53
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,870
She’ll hate you more once she knows the truth.

54
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,190
I will keep it from her.

55
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,430
She will never know.

56
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,270
That's easier said than done.

57
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,310
She is so smart.

58
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,670
She might find out the truth in other ways.

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,550
You can hide it from her for a while, but can you hide it for the rest of your life?

60
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,390
Besides,

61
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,830
are the lives of Mother

62
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,720
and everyone in the mansion

63
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,430
not worth your love for her?

64
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,030
Mother,

65
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,150
I only love Mai.

66
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,170
If I have to get married,

67
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,080
I can only marry her.

68
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,070
I know.

69
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,590
Think about it.

70
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,640
Think it through.

71
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,270
What should we do?

72
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,330
Your Highness.

73
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,700
There's something

74
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,150
I need you to do.

75
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,610
Don't worry, General Mai.

76
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,190
I'll keep an eye out for you, General Mai.

77
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,790
Thank you.

78
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,870
Let me tell you.

79
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,150
I punched someone at Li's Tavern yesterday.

80
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,550
He had a couple of broken fingers

81
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,280
and a big scar on his face.

82
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,510
He insisted on bragging about being part of the Xuanwu Army.

83
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,510
I've never heard of such an army.

84
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,070
That's crazy talk.

85
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,190
Can you even enter a tavern?

86
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,310
I'm not talking crazy, that's all...

87
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,840
Brother.

88
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,510
I want to ask you about someone.

89
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,710
Give me some money if you have money.

90
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,510
Ask about someone? I don't know.

91
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,110
Speak.

92
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,670
I heard you mention the Xuanwu Army.

93
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,280
Did he have a scar on his face?

94
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,790
Yes.

95
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,310
It's a long one.

96
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,950
Where is he now?

97
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,150
He said he's living in Zhaojia Village outside the city.

98
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,150
Zhaojia Village?

99
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,590
Thank you.

Let's go.

104
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,630
Hurry up.

106
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,440

What's going on?

130
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,030
The Xuanwu Army isn't in the military register

131
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,830
and isn't under the authority of the Ministry of War.

132
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,960
Naturally, you won't hear or find out anything about it.

133
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,110
Why did you fake your own deaths?

134
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,590
Back then,

His Grace picked us from the Xuanwu Army.

136

It's not the first time we've done this,

and the higher-ups won't explain it to us.

138
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,370
His Grace's only order

139
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,870
was to kill them all.

Marry me.

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,670
What's wrong?

152
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,310
I caught Liu Qi today.

153
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,670
He said he never set up a stall in the market.

154
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,750
I knew someone was up to something.

155
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,380
The person who doesn't want me to find out the truth

156
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,650
and who's causing trouble is you,

157
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,150
right?

158
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,550
Let me explain.

159
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,470
You knew everything

160
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,830
but you watched me join the army,

161
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,950
look for Chen Qi

162
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,870
and go back to Shengdu to investigate the case

163
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,470
but you didn't say anything.

164
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,520
The reason why I kept it from you

165
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,830
is because I'm afraid of losing you.

166
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,670
Also,

167
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,280
I also...

168
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,920
I don't want to see you again.

169
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,510
Get out.

170
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,710
Get out.

171
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,070
Get out!

172
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:53,950
Mother.

173
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,830
Did you tell Mai about Uncle Qi?

174
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,810
It was only a matter of time

175
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,120
before Mai found him.

176
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,730
But if you didn't tell her,

177
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,710
I could have hidden it from her forever.

178
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,850
Do you think it's that easy?

179
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,830
You really haven't experienced

180
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,830
what it's like to worry all the time.

181
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,710
Your father and I worried about you

182
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,950
all your life.

183
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,950
No one understands this feeling better than me.

184
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,560
It's like having a million knives hanging in front of you

185
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,590
and you don't know which one's gonna fall one day.

186
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,350
If you marry Mai,

187
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,230
she’ll be the one holding the knife.

188
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,590
So everything you did

189
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,560
was to separate us?

190
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,350
I did it to save you.

191
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,830
Your father killed her father.

192
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,590
Now you insist on marrying her.

193
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,550
Do you want to die in front of her?

194
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,410
I don't believe it.

195
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,770
I don't believe it.

196
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,950
My father couldn't have stabbed her father.

197
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,080
There must be another reason for this.

198
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,710
Mother.

199
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,510
From what I know about my father,

200
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,730
there's no way he'd kill innocent people.

201
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,760
Why did that happen?

202
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,470
I'm begging you, okay?

203
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,030
I'm begging you, please?

204
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,920
Tell me!

205
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,470
What's the point of telling you?

206
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,000
Do you want to kill the king?

207
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,870
So you know

208
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,560
you shouldn't blame Shang Yizhi for this.

209
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,910
I just want to know

210
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,670
why his father killed my father.

211
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,570
Your Highness.

212
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,260
I haven't figured out why,

213
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,510
on the day Yu was kidnapped,

214
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,950
Your Highness asked me to report to Father later.

215
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,330
If on that day,

216
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,460
I had been quicker to report to Father,

217
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,880
would Your Highness

218
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,390
not have died?

219
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,390
I hate that those scourges

220
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,350
are still talking about Yu's parentage

221
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,710
after Your Highness died.

222
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,310
I don't have a better solution.

223
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,910
When I see you again,

224
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,150
I hope Your Highness won't blame me.

225
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,150
Your Majesty,

226
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,070
it's time to take your medicine.

227
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,190
Where is Yu?

228
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,350
His Highness is asleep.

229
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,160
Your Majesty.

230
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,630
Take your medicine on time and get well soon

231
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,630
so that you can protect the kingdom for your grandson.

232
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,230
Why are you panicking?

233
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,950
Sir.

234
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,590
Something happened.

235
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,590
The Crown princess...

236
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,590
The Crown princess has passed away.

237
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,990
What?

238
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,730
Prime Minister.

239
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,510
The Crown princess passed away last night.

240
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,560
I have to go to the palace.

241
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,790
You should get ready too.

242
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,990
I think the decree will be issued soon.

243
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,470
Everyone from the third-rank and above must go to the palace to observe the wake.

244
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,790
Yes, I'll get ready.

245
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,310
What else can I do for you?

246
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,600
The Crown prince passed away

247
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,470
and now the Crown princess has gone with him too.

248
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,670
The Crown Prince's Mansion is in chaos.

249
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,660
Marshal Shang was so close to the Crown prince too.

250
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,080
If he gets into trouble,

251
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,670
Zerou would be implicated too.

252
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,910
Don't worry.

253
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,110
Marquis Shang has military power.

254
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,990
No matter who ascends the throne, they'll need to win him over.

255
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,830
But now,

256
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,520
the competition for being queen is getting stronger.

257
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,830
It's inevitable that there will be a day when she loses her usefulness and gets discarded.

258
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,390
Zerou has a pure heart.

259
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,910
How can we protect her?

260
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,630
But don't forget the word "stability"

261
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,390
has long since ceased to exist for this family.

262
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,550
In the midst of turbulent waves, if you don't advance, you'll retreat.

263
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,510
Since Zerou was born here,

264
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,590
her marriage

265
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,790
is not only about her life,

266
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,120
it's also about the future of the Prime Minister's Mansion.

267
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,040
Yes.

268
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,760
I understand.

269
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,800
I'm going to the palace.

270
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,870
You should get ready too.

271
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,070
Yes.

272
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,020
Marshal Shang.

273
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,970
Marshal Shang.

274
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,390
General Tang.

275
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,040
Have you seen Mai recently?

276
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,960
I'm on my way to see her, too.

277
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,790
Can you take me to see her?

278
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,250
From what I know about Mai,

279
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,840
she must be in a bad mood now.

280
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,890
She just wants to be alone.

281
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,430
Fine.

282
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,430
Could you please

283
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,270
give her a message for me?

284
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,830
Tell her

285
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,990
she can come see me when she figures it out.

286
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,230
I have something to tell her face to face.

287
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,600
Okay.

288
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,030
I'll see her now

289
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,310
and talk to her.

290
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,360
Thank you, General.

291
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,360
I finally found you after looking for so long.

292
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,710
Come on, let's play.

293
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,930
I'm not in the mood.

294
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,190
What does playing have to do with your mood?

295
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,110
Hurry up.

296
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,630
Go!

297
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,490
Take the sword.

298
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,590
Your Majesty.

299
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,470
You are suffering from exhaustion

300
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,460
and your meridians are blocked due to a stroke.

301
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,030
I'll use silver needles on your body once in the morning and once in the evening.

302
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,910
This method is hard on you

303
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,300
but it works the fastest.

304
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,910
I'll try to reduce the discomfort.

305
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,630
Do it.

306
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

307
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,920
Has His Majesty made any arrangements

308
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,780
for the Crown princess' funeral?

309
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,970
His Majesty wants Princess Shenghua to preside.

310
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,030
His Majesty is thoughtful.

311
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,590
Does Prince Qi Yu know?

312
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,010
In this situation,

313
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,650
His Majesty would never allow his grandson to show his face.

314
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,940
There's no one in charge in the Crown Prince's Mansion.

315
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,200
Princess Shenghua is coming in to take charge of the Crown princess's funeral.

316
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,470
Prime Minister Lin, please take care of her.

317
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,190
This is what I should do.

318
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,510
Your Majesty,

319
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,390
the acupuncture is done.

320
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,470
You still need to take your medicine on time

321
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,030
and have a light diet.

322
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,430
Don't get angry.

323
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,390
I'll take my leave.

324
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,710
Yu.

325
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,310
Grandfather.

326
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,790
I’m here.

327
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,390
Grandfather! Grandfather!

328
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
That was a good fight.

329
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,880
Before I came to you,

330
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,050
Shang Yizhi came to me.

331
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,590
What did he say to you?

332
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,560
What could he possibly have to say to me?

333
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,760
He's looking for you.

334
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,830
But I know you haven't made up your mind

335
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,550
so I stopped him.

336
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,480
Thank you, Big Brother.

337
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,750
For what?

338
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,590
I'm your Big Brother.

339
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,730
Your business is my business.

340
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,390
This place is nice.

341
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,470
It's quiet and comfortable.

342
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,280
If you are not in a good mood these days,

343
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,970
I can come here with you every day.

344
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,630
As for that man,

345
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,440
if he really wants to come to you,

346
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,390
let him find you himself.

347
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,510
What is this matter

348
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,070
that has to be done in front of me?

349
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,110
Your Majesty.

350
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,790
Take a seat.

351
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,110
Go ahead.

352
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,390
Speak.

353
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,470
This matter can only be decided by Your Majesty.

354
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,150
The Crown prince has been dead for several days.

355
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,950
The country is in turmoil, and all the ministers are in fear,

356
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,870
but not a single letter has been sent from the palace,

357
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,530
leaving the Prince Kang to oversee the country.

358
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,150
Recently, the Crown princess left with the Crown prince.

359
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,270
There must be something strange going on.

360
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,800
Your Majesty, please investigate the Crown prince's death.

361
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,750
The Crown prince died of illness.

362
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,910
His Majesty lost his son

363
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,270
and had conferred the Crown prince the title of Emperor Shengxiao.

364
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,870
What secrets could there be?

365
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,600
That's not what I heard.

366
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,750
Your Majesty,

367
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,060
I heard that the Crown prince didn't die of illness in the Crown Prince's Mansion.

368
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,870
He went to Prince Kang's mansion

369
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,300
and died of illness here.

370
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,250
How dare you!

371
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,450
The Crown prince was wronged.

372
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,250
The Crown Prince's Mansion too.

373
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,590
If this goes on, the country will be ruined.

374
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,190
I ask Your Majesty

375
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,010
to imprison Prince Kang and investigate this matter thoroughly.

376
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,110
Zeng Imperial Censor.

377
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,350
Don't slander me.

378
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,670
The Crown prince is my brother.

379
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,070
The Crown prince death

380
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,990
has also caused me great pain.

381
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,070
His Highness is in great pain?

382
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,830
I noticed that His Highness has been in and out of the palace lately.

383
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,340
He's overjoyed

384
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,130
and he bosses his subjects around

385
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,590
as if he were the Crown prince himself.

386
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,910
Your Highness.

387
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,590
Are you crying sadly

388
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,210
in your beautiful dreams?

389
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,070
Take him down.

390
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,870
Take him down!

391
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,730
Your Majesty,

392
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,880
It's a shame that I've lost my honor before you.

393
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,070
The court must not fall into the hands of a villain,

394
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,870
Your Majesty.

395
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,980
I'm deeply grateful to Your Majesty.

396
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,570
Today, I shamelessly tell you that

397
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,640
injustice was done to the Crown prince, Your Majesty.

398
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,570
Please investigate this thoroughly, Your Majesty.

399
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,440
Your Majesty!

400
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,670
Imperial physician!

401
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,870
Hurry, summon the imperial physician!

402
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,310
What should we do?

403
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
[Practice what you preach]

404
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,930
[Memorial tablet of Crown princess Wen]

405
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,390
Investigate.

406
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,910
Investigate him carefully.

407
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,970
Find out who is behind this Lord Zeng.

408
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,710
According to the spy,

409
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,270
a day ago, Lord Zeng

410
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,390
had sent his wife and children

411
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,910
out of Shengdu in a hurry.

412
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,310
No one knows their whereabouts.

413
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,550
It seems that Lord Zeng has long been determined.

414
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,870
So who's he been seeing for the last two days?

415
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,300
Lord Zeng is just a minor official.

416
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,430
Our people

417
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,110
didn't pay attention to him before this.

418
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,830
So what you're saying is,

419
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,970
I'm going to have to swallow this?

420
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,830
Which one of you

421
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,820
messed with our Prince Kang?

422
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,090
You heard everything?

423
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,440
Yes, I did.

424
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,550
Of course I did.

425
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,550
I heard it,

426
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,510
along with everyone

427
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,790
with a name in Shengdu.

428
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,870
The late Crown prince's injustices have not been righted,

429
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,730
and Zeng Imperial Censor died in front of the court.

430
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,120
This show in the morning

431
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,600
is as good as the grand finale of the opera.

432
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,910
Are you here to piss me off?

433
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,790
I dare not.

434
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,240
Your Highness.

435
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,960
I went out in the morning

436
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,430
and I bumped into Princess Shenghua

437
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,090
walking through the city with a big honor guard.

438
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,110
I heard she's going to the Crown Prince's Mansion to pay her respects to the Crown princess.

439
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,990
Judging from the size of the guard,

440
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,630
she clearly wants to show that she cares about the Crown Prince's Mansion.

441
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,950
I came to inform you as soon as I saw that.

442
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,040
She didn't go earlier or later

443
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,080
but chose to go now.

444
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,470
What is she trying to do?

445
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,970
Your Highness.

446
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,310
Our priority

447
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,000
is to find the person behind Lord Zeng.

448
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,110
Princess Shenghua is not our enemy.

449
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,510
I know what to do.

450
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,430
Look at you.

451
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,100
You were so happy when you just came back.

452
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,390
How come

453
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,710
you look so haggard now

454
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,350
all because of love?

455
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,920
Mother, you worry too much.

456
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,830
Do you know

457
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,190
how many people

458
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:32,070
sacrificed their lives

459
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,470
for this love of yours?

460
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,950
I understand.

461
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,350
Since young,

462
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,310
how many people have gone to great lengths

463
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,420
to protect me?

464
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,870
It's hard for me

465
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,070
to express my gratitude with words.

466
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,590
But now,

467
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,670
I've found the one.

468
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,950
Shouldn't I be blessed by my mother?

469
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,560
Being part of the royal family,

470
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,880
our fate

471
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,400
isn't in our own hands

472
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,670
and doesn't just affect ourselves.

473
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,470
Then I'll just hide my identity.

474
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,870
Being an ordinary man

475
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,750
is also a kind of happiness, no?

476
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,680
Do you think you still have a chance to be a normal man?

477
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,030
As long as you are alive,

478
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,070
there will always be a pair of eyes

479
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,390
on you, waiting to kill you,

480
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,910
no matter how many times the dynasty changes.

481
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,540
Mother.

482
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,060
We've been through the turbulent times.

483
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,470
Just be careful in the future.

484
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,280
If you keep retreating,

485
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,590
there'll be nowhere left to retreat to.

486
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,120
Qi Huan.

487
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,230
Do you want your throne back?

488
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,790
[Huan]

489
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,760
Mother, why do you say that?

490
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,110
I

491
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,870
[Huan]

492
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,320
never thought about it.

493
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,190
You know

494
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,870
when I established the Zhenbei Army,

495
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,330
I did it to protect myself.

496
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,280
If I take the throne back now,

497
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,910
there will be more bloodshed.

498
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,050
I don't like fighting in the first place.

499
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,330
If that's the case,

500
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,880
isn't that against my intentions?

501
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,670
I know

502
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,860
you are generous and benevolent.

503
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,230
But do you think

504
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,700
you can protect yourself if you don't fight?

505
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,960
How did the Crown Prince's Mansion get emptied?

506
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,350
You know

507
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,280
what kind of person Prince Kang is.

508
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,510
If he becomes the heir one day,

509
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,520
our Marquis Dingnan's Mansion

510
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,770
will certainly experience a bloodbath.

511
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,000
Mother, you worry too much.

512
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,070
Prince Kang doesn't even have military power.

513
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,470
I am now the Grand Marshal of the Zhenbei Army.

514
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,000
He wouldn't dare to hurt us.

515
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,190
Even your father couldn't protect Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

516
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,670
What can you do?

517
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,670
What is this?

518
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,830
This is the prescription

519
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,030
that I went to the palace to get for your father.

520
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,410
Your father died because of this.

521
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,480
Your father was remarkable back then.

522
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,640
My brother got suspicious

523
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,430
and used me to kill him.

524
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,000
That way,

525
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,470
he could deal with you without any fear.

526
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,830
Now,

527
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:36,090
it's not just Marquis Dingnan's Mansion that needs you

528
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,030
but the people of the world.

529
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,660
His Majesty is addicted to power.

530
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,390
He has no regard for the rise and fall of the court,

531
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,030
and the lives of the people.

532
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,070
And Prince Kang is just like my brother.

533
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,070
Do you think he can be a wise emperor?

534
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,950
The court, the civil and military officials

535
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,870
and the people

536
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,830
are all longing for a wise ruler like you

537
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,440
to lead them to prosperity.

538
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,830
Don't worry.

539
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,760
I've prepared everything for you.

540
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,550
Prime Minister Lin is an important official in the court.

541
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,070
He is willing to serve a wise ruler like you.

542
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,949
Now, the military power and ministers

543
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,310
are ready for you.

544
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,310
All you have to do is go with the flow.

545
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,480
Prime Minister Lin.

546
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,550
That's why Mother

547
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,440
insisted on me marrying Lin Zerou.

548
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,389
But my heart already belongs to someone else.

549
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,469
Mother.

550
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,949
My thoughts are too messy today.

551
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,070
Let's

552
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,800
discuss this later.

553
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,270
Please think about

554
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,840
what is more important,

555
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,250
love or the plan for the world.

556
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,430
But if I

557
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,230
can't even protect the one I love,

558
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,310
how can I protect the people?

559
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,980
I'll take my leave.

560
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,820
[Huan]

561
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:58,740
Mai.

562
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,600
I’m sorry.

563
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,250
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

564
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,830
When did you start hiding it from me?

565
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,510
When Crown prince mentioned Uncle Qi,

566
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,320
I suddenly remembered that

567
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,280
that person might have been from my father's camp.

568
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,850
I knew it was you who was causing trouble.

569
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,830
You made me search for him like a fool.

570
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,270
I'm sorry.

571
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,950
I did that

572
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,610
because I was blinded by love.

573
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,550
That's why I did it.

574
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,670
I know the truth now.

575
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,710
It was Qi Jing.

576
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,230
He ordered my father

577
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,940
to kill your whole family.

578
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,310
Actually,

579
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,160
Princess Shenghua is not my birth mother.

580
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,130
My birth mother

581
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,250
is one of the late Crown prince's attendants.

582
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,990
And the late Crown prince Qi Xian

583
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,190
was my biological father.

584
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,490
I just learned from my mother that

585
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,070
that both my father and foster father were killed by Qi Jing.

586
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,970
Qi Jing is not only your father's murderer,

587
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,220
but also mine.

588
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,310
Mai.

589
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,720
Our destinies

590
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,290
are completely tied together.

591
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,550
I promise you.

592
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,350
I will always be with you.

593
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,790
Let's avenge them together,

594
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,150
okay?

595
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,540
Your Highness has been embroidering for a long time.

596
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,200
Take a break and have some tea.

597
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,910
The only son is getting married.

598
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,710
The more I embroider, the more love it shows.

599
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,670
Has Bing set off?

600
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,530
Your Highness,

601
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,720
he is on his way.

602
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,980
Did he bring everything?

603
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,030
Don't worry, Your Highness.

604
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,390
Zhang Bingren is the best matchmaker in the city.

605
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,710
He has checked all the gifts to be prepared.

606
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,710
It can't go wrong.

607
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,710
Okay.

608
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,760
Where is the Young Marquis?

609
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,990
Young Marquis is wandering around the market.

610
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,830
With whom?

611
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,430
With General Mai.

612
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,160
Fine.

613
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:37,400
I'm embroidering the real mandarin ducks.

614
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,240
I'll leave the one on the side to rest for a while.

615
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,820
[Gift list]

616
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,710
One gold coral necklace.

617
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,950
Three large gold hairpins with pearls.

618
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,070
Three small gold hairpins.

619
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,430
Three pairs of gold earrings.

620
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,010
[Land deed]

621
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,630
Two gold bracelets.

622
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,590
20 otter skins.

623
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,040
20 white fox skins.

624
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,390
20 Least weasel skins.

625
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,150
100 pieces of silk.

626
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,280
[Geng tie]

627
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,930
[Officiant Zhang Gengju hereby lists the birth date of the eldest son of Marquis Shang, Shang Yizhi, below]

628
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:29,140
[Geng tie]

629
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,670
So

630
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,560
these two families are well-matched?

631
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,710
To be honest Your Grace,

632
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,630
I’ve been a matchmaker in Shengdu City all my life.

633
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,560
I don't know how many newlyweds I've married.

634
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,550
To be so compatible, this is a match made in heaven.

635
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,770
[Letter of betrothal]

636
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,350
Madam, this is the letter of betrothal.

637
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,830
Please have a look.

638
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,670
Your Grace,

639
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,290
is there anything wrong with the betrothal letter?

640
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,710
These things are nothing more than gifts.

641
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,200
A little more or a little less won't make a difference.

642
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,880
But I only have one daughter.

643
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,550
Although it's her fortune

644
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,990
to marry into Marquis Dingnan's Mansion,

645
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,250
she has been spoiled since she was young.

646
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,430
I’m afraid she’ll be mistreated

647
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,510
when she's at Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

648
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,110
As her mother, I can't protect her either.

649
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,890
I won't take that lightly.

650
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,710
His Highness will also treat Her Grace

651
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,700
like his own daughter.

652
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,550
And His Highness has made arrangements.

653
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,720
After Her Grace enter the house, she doesn't need to do her morning and evening prayers.

654
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,110
She only needs to accompany His Highness

655
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,470
on the first and fifteenth of each month

656
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,240
to pay her respects.

657
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,690
It's rare that His Highness is so kind.

658
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,230
I'm grateful.

659
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,150
On the wedding day,

660
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,590
I'd like to invite you to have a glass of wine.

661
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,230
Thank you, Your Grace.

662
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,040
Thank you very much.

663
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,070
I'll take my leave.

664
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,630
See you.

665
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,190
In three days,

666
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,080
we'll do it when Doctor Du's horse groomer is buying pancakes.

667
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,370
That's right.

668
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,560
Why are you hesitating?

669
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,070
Do you think the three days of preparation

670
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,080
is not enough?

671
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,990
I'm thinking,

672
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,110
even use Doctor Du

673
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,310
to enter Hehuan Hall,

674
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,150
we still have to get past the Longyin Guards.

675
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,610
There's always some risk.

676
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:41,480
Come in.

677
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:44,940
Your Grace.

678
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,350
General Mai.

679
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,940
Madam wants to see you.

680
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:48,910
Let's go.

681
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,630
But Madam only asked General Mai.
