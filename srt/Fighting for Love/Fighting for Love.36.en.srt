[Episode 36]

4
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,000
Only the imperial guards in Shengdu can stand a chance.

5
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,370
Your Majesty,

6
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,300
I hope you can make a decision on what will happen tomorrow.

7
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,300
Make a decision?

8
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,050
Why should I?

9
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,940
The Zhenbei Army is my army.

10
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,750
Mai is my favorite general.

11
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,490
Why would they start a rebellion?

12
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,430
Then tomorrow...

13
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,810
I'll talk to her properly.

14
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,950
Mr. Xu, go back and rest.

15
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

16
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,710
Report!

17
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,110
Your Majesty,

18
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,670
a guard at the city gate reported

19
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,870
Han Maisui broke into the palace alone.

20
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,680
She'll be outside the hall soon.

21
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,840
Your Majesty,

22
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,610
you should hide for now.

23
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,080
This is not the time to act on impulse.

24
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,790
Forget it.

25
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,360
It's time to put an end to it.

26
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,270
-Marshal Mai.
-Marshal Mai.

27
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,480
Who allowed you to come?

28
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,330
We will follow you through thick and thin.

29
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,630
My life is yours.

30
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,070
We'll voluntarily accept our punishment after we go back.

31
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,870
I'm giving you my final warning.

32
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,370
Wait outside the gate.

33
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,470
Don't do anything stupid.

34
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:26,950
Okay.

35
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,460
Okay.

36
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,230
Mai.

37
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,150
You're the marshal of the Zhenbei Army,

38
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,310
not a rebel.

39
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,040
Just because I'm the marshal of the Zhenbei Army,

40
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,550
I must see him.

41
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,600
I won't let you in today.

42
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,790
You will.

43
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,550
Otherwise,

44
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,110
you will face

45
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,040
the entire Zhenbei Army tomorrow.

46
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,950
It's up to you

47
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,650
whether the state will break into pieces

48
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,650
and whether there will be great casualties.

49
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,350
Let her in!

50
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,960
Marshal Mai.

51
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,690
His Majesty hasn't summoned you yet.

52
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,710
Why did you barge in?

53
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,710
I want to talk to him.

54
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,390
Mu Bai,

55
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,150
who asked you to let her in?

56
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,070
-It has nothing to do with him.
-Prime Minister Xu.

57
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,070
You guys leave.

58
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,750
Mai,

59
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,430
what do you want?

60
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,990
Mr. Xu,

61
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,950
you may leave too.

62
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,630
Where were the reinforcements?

63
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,630
Mai,

64
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,230
are you okay?

65
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,950
I'm asking you where the reinforcements were.

66
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,000
There were no reinforcements.

67
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,240
Why did you lie to me?

68
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,960
Do you remember

69
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,270
I went to see Qi Jing that day?

70
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,790
Do you want to know

71
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,310
why I killed Duke Sheng, Han Huaicheng?

72
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,000
Do you want to know?

73
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,730
Come here.

74
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,760
Do you dare?

75
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,910
Everyone thought

76
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,670
I was afraid of Han Huaicheng

77
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,990
and jealous of his bravery.

78
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,910
If you think so,

79
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,910
I won't be surprised.

80
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,080
In fact,

81
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,030
it was true, but not entirely true.

82
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,510
Why?

83
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,680
Back then, I just ascended the throne.

84
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,910
I didn't want to just maintain the achievements of the late emperor.

85
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,470
But when I led an army to attack Beimo,

86
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,950
I was desperate.

87
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,350
Nanxia

88
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,070
had been weak for a long time.

89
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,070
It was no match for Beimo.

90
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,530
I needed to recuperate the state.

91
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,800
But Beimo kept invading us every year.

92
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,350
Nanxia could only

93
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,430
use a lot of energy, manpower, and money

94
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,070
to resist Beimo's attacks.

95
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,710
Fortunately,

96
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,030
there was someone Beimo was afraid of.

97
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,430
That person was Han Huaicheng.

98
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,190
So

99
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,230
I used Han Huaicheng

100
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,190
to make a deal with Beimo.

101
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,830
What deal?

102
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,270
Kill Han Huaicheng

103
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,190
to keep Nanxia safe for 10 years.

104
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,990
Don't think it's easy to be an emperor.

105
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,780
Today,

106
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,430
I'm giving the throne back to you

107
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,080
and entrusting the responsibility to you.

108
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,690
Qi Huan,

109
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,910
you have to figure out a way to keep Nanxia safe for the next 10 years.

110
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,410
This is your responsibility.

111
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,600
Keep Nanxia safe.

112
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,680
So,

113
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,990
you knew the truth long ago

114
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,890
but you kept me in the dark.

115
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,550
So,

116
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,230
you colluded with Chen Qi long ago

117
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,830
and gave Jingyang to them.

118
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,710
So,

119
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,550
you knew we would lose and could never come back

120
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,850
before the army set off.

121
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,750
Chen Qi promised me

122
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,630
he would protect you.

123
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,300
I would rather you let me die with them.

124
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,090
The soldiers of the Zhenbei Army

125
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,190
are all your brothers.

126
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,510
Do their lives mean nothing to you?

127
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,630
They risked their lives to protect you.

128
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,630
But now, you abandoned them like trash.

129
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,390
But I did that to keep Nanxia safe for 10 years.

130
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,720
We can spend the 10 years

131
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,440
rebuilding

132
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,120
a more powerful army.

133
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,310
We can make a comeback.

134
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,270
Shut up!

135
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,550
When did you become like this?

136
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,320
A general's victory is built upon the bodies of numerous soldiers.

137
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,710
You

138
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,600
taught me this, right?

139
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,880
Yes.

140
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,110
My father taught me this.

141
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,670
As the commander of the army,

142
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,510
I can die on the battlefield.

143
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,430
But we can't be betrayed

144
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,770
or deceived by our own people.

145
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,710
Do you know

146
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,550
there are tens of thousands of Jingyang people behind the Zhenbei Army?

147
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,670
We can die,

148
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,990
but what about the people?

149
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,800
Should they die

150
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,430
because of your betrayal?

151
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,830
Don't you understand?

152
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,670
You win some, you lose some.

153
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,790
But their deaths could have been avoided!

154
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,240
Do you still remember their names?

155
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,600
Liu Qing

156
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,710
from Qingzhou.

157
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,990
Wang Mian

158
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,630
from Yuzhou.

159
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,350
And Tang Shaoyi

160
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,390
from Yinbao.

161
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,050
Enough. Can you stop talking?

162
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,630
They were soldiers.

163
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,710
It's their duty to die for the state.

164
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,570
Also, I will make it up to them.

165
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,720
What did you say?

166
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,670
Listen carefully.

167
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,050
I won't hand over the military power.

168
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,310
I will lead the Zhenbei Army to guard Jingyang Pass.

169
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,920
Let's make the river the boundary.

170
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,310
You are not allowed to enter the area north of Wanjiang River.

171
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,800
And I will never return to Shengdu.

172
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,590
From now on,

173
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,240
the Zhenbei Army will still listen to your deployment, but won't listen to your summons.

174
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,070
What about me?

175
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,790
You and I

176
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,320
should never meet each other again

177
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,510
in this life.

178
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,630
Come on.

179
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,520
You're cold when I say you're cold.

180
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,770
Here. Put it on.

181
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,200
Mai.

182
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,530
Be careful.

183
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,600
An imperial edict has been delivered.

184
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,670
Chen Qi, accept the imperial edict.

185
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,180
According to the emperor's edict,

186
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,030
Chen Qi has to take over Jingyang City tomorrow

187
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,470
and take over Shengdu within three days.

188
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,270
Anyone who disobeys the order will be executed.

189
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,069
Respect this.

190
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,710
Mai,

191
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,790
let's talk. What do you think?

192
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,320
What's there to talk about?

193
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,560
If you want to take over Jingyang City,

194
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,550
you'll have to step over my body.

195
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,960
You've always wanted to ask me something, right?

196
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,350
Once the war starts,

197
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,760
I'm afraid you won't have a chance.

198
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,910
Attention!

199
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,910
Do not attack

200
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,470
without my order.

201
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,910
Yes!

202
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,000
Marshal Mai.

203
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,850
Think twice, Marshal Mai.

204
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,290
Attention!

205
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,880
Do not attack

206
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,040
without my order.

207
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,110
Yes!

208
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,040
You've always wanted to take revenge, right?

209
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,980
I killed all your family members.

210
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,350
Come and avenge them.

211
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,430
Come on.

212
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,170
♫The cold wind blew across the land, and I sang a sad song with it♫

213
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,500
♫The mountains are extensive and the seas are vast, but how much joy can we get?♫

214
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,550
♫It's getting dark in the desert, and the mighty soldiers are fighting on horses among the blown sand♫

215
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:55,900
♫Whose happy song are they protecting?♫

216
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,590
Mai.

217
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:03,150
♫If my ending has been decided♫

218
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,330
You've always wanted to know the truth, right?

219
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,980
♫Maybe I'm no longer a moth flying into the fire♫

220
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,230
I'm going to tell you the truth now.

221
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:17,600
♫Time flies like rain, and it's scattered all over the ground♫

222
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,550
Go kill Han Huaicheng,

223
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,530
and I'll send you back to Beimo.

224
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,430
I can't.

225
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,660
♫The shaking flames of war are about to extinguish, and there will be partings again♫

226
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,070
Han Huaicheng killed your parents.

227
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,270
You are their son.

228
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,270
If you don't take revenge,

229
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,150
how can you face your parents?

230
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,200
♫I hoped for it and I became speechless♫

231
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,310
But he raised me for eight years.

232
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,790
He has to die.

233
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,510
Han Huaicheng is so successful that he has become a threat to His Majesty.

234
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,670
♫I sank into the ruined city and watched myself♫

235
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,470
Except him,

236
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,090
♫I'd rather not dream♫

237
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,470
everyone else in Duke Sheng's Mansion has to die too.

238
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,570
♫I want to wander in the world without happy or sad feelings♫

239
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,190
No one can change it.

240
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:39,670
If you won't do it,

241
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,350
someone else will do it.

242
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,930
But if that's the case,

243
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,470
all his family members will die,

244
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,130
and you can't survive either.

245
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,590
I know you love your sister very much.

246
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,400
I just want Han Huaicheng and his wife to die.

247

♫When the storm rises again, I'll fight again on the battlefield♫

248

Think about it carefully.

♫Where can I find the mountains and rivers of my hometown?♫

Two coins for a round.

Awesome.

Marshal Mai,

338
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,150
it's just a small business.

339
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,230
You can't let me suffer losses, right?

340
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,380
I win, right?

341
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,750
If I win, you should give me a gift.

342
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,590
-That's right.
-That's right.

343
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,650
You should give her a gift if she wins.

344
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,030
I'm just kidding.

345
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,080

346
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,310
-Give him more money.
-Here.

347
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,910
Marshal Mai is just kidding.

348
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,470
Thank you, Marshal Mai.

349
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,530
I know these tricks

350
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,270
very well.

351
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,530
You can make a living by them.

352
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,240
But you can't use them to deceive people.

353
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,790
Okay.

354
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:17,960

You've been here six times within half a year.

365

It must have been hard for you.

366
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,190
It's His Majesty's order.

367
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:38,920
It's my duty.

368
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,870
Marshal Mai,

369
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,930
let's go back to the mansion and talk.

370
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:45,790
Yu,

371
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,510
your teacher has been waiting for you.

372
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,310
Go study.

373
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,280
Take your big tiger.

374
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,750
Are you happy?

375
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,150
Yes.

376
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,590
Go.

377
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,190
Go.

378
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,780
Marshal Mai, please accept the imperial edict.

379
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,320
Go ahead.

380
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,720
Han Maisui has been guarding the border for three years.

381
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,470
The people live and work in peace and contentment.

382
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,730
And the state is prosperous.

383
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,590
Considering her loyalty,

384
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,110
I appoint Han Maisui, Marshal of the Zhenbei Army,

385
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,830
as Grand General Zhenbei.

386
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,150
Besides, I reward her with a set of the Four Books and the Five Classics,

387
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,790
a set of the Hundred Schools of Thought,

388
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,920
10 writing brushes,

389
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,160
10 inksticks,

390
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,670
200 pieces of tribute paper,

391
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,800
and one ink slab,

392
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,310
plus 10 pieces of tribute silk

393
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,550
and 1,000 taels of gold and silver.

394
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,210
The responsible department shall carry it out.

395
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,170
Grand General.

396
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,790
As usual,

397
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,630
give the brushes, inksticks, paper, and ink slab to Qi Yu.

398
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,150
Give the silk to Xiu'er.

399
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,630
And give the silver and gold to the brothers.

400
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,350
Okay.

401
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,510
Grand General, do you have a message that you want me to deliver?

402
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,030
No.

403
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,540
I'll take my leave.

404
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,160
Wait.

405
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,910
I don't think it was you who came to deliver imperial edicts.

406
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,110
He has been replaced?

407
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,350
Grand General,

408
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,470
Attendant Liu

409
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,110
made a mistake by arbitrarily speculating about His Majesty's thoughts

410
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,110
and was flogged to death.

411
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,870
His Majesty thought I'm honest,

412
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,600
so he asked me to take his place.

413
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,830
I see. Go back.

414
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,570
I'll take my leave.

415
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,710
You women

416
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,530
can be more ruthless than men.

417
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,310
Which woman?

418
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,350
I'm too ignorant.

419
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,690
[Marshal's Mansion]

420
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,310
Prime Minister Xu.

421
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,990
Come.

422
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:41,840
Come.

423
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,710
Prime Minister Xu,

424
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,000
you came all the way here. You must be tired.

425
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,060
Prime Minister Xu.

426
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,910
No need for this.

427
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,460
Is Mai inside?

428
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,310
She's been waiting for you inside.

429
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,790
Okay.

430
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,150
I almost forgot.

431
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,550
I haven't been feeling well lately.

432
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,070
So I brought an attendant to take care of me.

433
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,630
Can I take him...

434
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,510
Prime Minister Xu,

435
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,170
you are making things difficult for me.

436
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,510
Marshal Mai specially said

437
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,150
you can only go in alone.

438
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,150
The carriage has to wait at the door.

439
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,070
But I'm old.

440
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,390
I won't be used to it if I don't have an attendant to take care of me.

441
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,850
Prime Minister Xu, you are right.

442
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,950
Come on.

443
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,010
What are you doing?

444
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,510
-You are so heavy.
-What are you doing?

445
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,370
I'm going to take good care of you.

446
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,180
-Put me down.
-Marshal Mai said

447
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,190
we must take good care of Prime Minister Xu.

448
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,000
[Marshal's Mansion]

449
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,230
Don't worry.

450
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,790
I'm here.

451
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,840
If you need anything, just tell me.

452
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:34,990
Here.

453
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,990
Mr. Xu, please have some tea.

454
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:00,830
Mr. Xu.

455
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,470
Enough.

456
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,670
I'm not having more.

457
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,860
You've been asking me to drink tea since I came in.

458
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,780
My stomach would burst if I keep drinking.

459
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,710
It's fine if it's good tea.

460
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,230
But it smells musty.

461
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,670
Mr. Xu,

462
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,630
Jingyang City doesn't have abundant products.

463
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,430
I have nothing good to treat you.

464
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,710
I exchanged something for the old tea

465
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,150
outside the border a few days ago.

466
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,270
Come on.

467
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,870
I know

468
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,880
your tricks.

469
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,110
You are doing this because I brought someone here

470
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,150
without your permission, right?

471
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,870
What?

472
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,230
Are you going to ask someone

473
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,480
to drive him away with a stick?

474
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,870
I'm not going to do that.

475
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,390
But I'm not going to see him either.

476
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:52,790
You...

477
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,250
If this happens again,

478
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,270
even you can't cross Wanjiang River.

479
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,230
Mai,

480
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,070
you are an official after all.

481
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,030
I know.

482
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,400
That's why I have never crossed the river.

483
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,850
It's been three years.

484
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,550
How many times have I been here?

485
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,140
Why are you still so stubborn?

486
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,470
Let me make it clear.

487
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,750
If you're here to see me,

488
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,590
I'm very grateful.

489
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,650
If you're here to speak for someone else,

490
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,030
don't blame me...

491
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:34,950
Forget it.

492
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,550
Forget it.

493
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,190
I'm not going to argue with you anymore.

494
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,110
If we keep arguing,

495
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,590
you'll piss me off.

496
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,870
I've been here for a while.

497
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,710
Why haven't I seen Qi Yu?

498
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,080
He's naughty.

499
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,530
I asked someone to take him to hunt outside the city.

500
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,310
Mr. Xu, you came all the way here and must be tired.

501
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,770
Leave after having a meal.

502
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,790
Xiu'er is so thoughtful.

503
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,940
Mr. Xu is very busy.

504
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,240
He has so many government affairs to deal with.

505
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,040
He doesn't have time to eat here.

506
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,190
Mr. Xu,

507
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,080
go back.

508
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,770
You are cold-hearted.

509
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,950
You are really driving me away.

are you interested in being my wife?

00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,560
Why did you come?

534
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,560
I came to see you.

535
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,429
With an army?

536
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,960
If I hadn't brought an army,

537
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,030
you wouldn't have come to see me.

538
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,909
I'm here to tell the emperor of Nanxia

539
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,699
that everyone in the four states

540
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,230
admires Mai, the God of War.

541
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,590

I have something else to tell you.

546
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,470
The young emperor of Beimo has been stoic for three years.

547
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,200
He is now competing for the throne with his uncle.

Over the next few years,

It's okay.

556
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960

565
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,230
Mr. Xu.

566
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,670
Let's go.

567
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,750
A war is coming again?

568
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,980
Your Majesty,

569
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:41,070
it was Chang Yuqing.

570
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,510
How is...

571
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:55,590
Mai?

572
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,870
With all due respect,

573
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,830
actually, the current situation is the best result because there is a balance among all the parties.

574
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,790
The God of War is guarding Jingyang Pass.

575
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,030
Thus, Nanxia can be in peace for the next few years

576
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,830
without being invaded by Beimo.

577
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,950
And you can focus on ruling the state.

581
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,150
Marshal Mai,

582
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,680
when will you leave?

583
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,410
Tomorrow morning.

584
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,750
If you leave,

585
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,550
what should Qi Yu do?

586
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,910
I'll leave him to you.

587
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,550
He has grown up.

588
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,630
He can't stay in Jingyang City forever.

589
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,990
You should take him out to gain more experience.

590
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,590
Are you...

591
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,080
really not taking us with you?

592
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,840
I finally have a chance to go out alone.

593
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,590
You still won't let me go?

594
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,430
Fine.

595
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,080
I'll take Qi Yu to practice tomorrow morning.

596
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,670
I'm not going to see you off.

597
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,030
I'm old now.

598
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,960
I can't stand this kind of parting.

599
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,460
Send me a message

600
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,950
if there is anything important.

601
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,550
Okay.

602
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,510
I'm leaving.
