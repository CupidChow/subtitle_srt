[Barracks of the Zhenbei Army, Wulan Mountains]

5
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,470
Why are you fanning my legs with your hand?

6
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,270
You're awake.

7
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,070
I have to fan your legs with my hand, don't I?

8
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,470
If I didn't do so, your wound might have attracted some flies.

9
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,829
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

10
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,960
It hurts.

11
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,430
Now you know it hurts?

12
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,850
What were you doing earlier?

13
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,630
Did you forget all the things I had told you

14
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,430
before we went to the battlefield?

15
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,829
You rushed to the front alone

16
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,110
and wanted to kill the enemy's chief commander.

17
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,030
You were just risking your life, weren't you?

18
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,230
Weren't you the same?

19
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,750
As the commander-in-chief,

20
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,280
you also rushed into the enemy's formation, didn't you?

21
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,350
Whom did I do this for?

22
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,630
I did it for you.

23
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,710
With my personality, would I rush forward?

24
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,270
It was good that I didn't run away.

25
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,550
Let me tell you, Mai.

26
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,390
In terms of leading the army to fight on the battlefield, I have to learn from you.

27
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,350
In terms of escaping, you have to learn from me.

28
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,390
You're a deserter?

29
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,310
What deserter?

30
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,670
It's called an outflanking tactic.

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,310
It looks as if we had run away.

32
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,510
But in fact,

33
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,310
we'll hide in a secret corner, waiting to play tricks on them.

34
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,710
All you know is showing off your eloquence.

35
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,690
How's your hand?

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
How should I describe it?

37
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,590
It's up to fate

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,040
whether I can keep it.

39
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,530
It's that serious?

40
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,829
Let me help you

41
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,090
disable the other arm.

42
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,750
Why?

43
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,720
For symmetry.

44
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,350
What?

45
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,640
You've learned to be bad, haven't you?

46
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,290
Stop making jokes.

47
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,070
We've arrived in Yuzhou, right?

48
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,950
We're at the Wulan Mountains.

49
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,950
Wulan Mountains?

50
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,850
Shouldn't we go to Yuzhou?

51
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,660
Enough.

52
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,310
This is not what you should be concerned about.

53
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,390
Leave the rest to me.

54
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,350
Take a good rest to recover. Drink the medicine.

55
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,390
No, I... Well...

56
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,390
By the way,

57
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,510
now your nickname in the army

58
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,670
is Charming Yama.

59
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,910
Charming Yama?

60
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,320
Your performance in the army has been spread among the soldiers.

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,290
Even the petty soldier who decocted the medicine

62
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,600
is waiting to see you.

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,010
Then which part is the key, Charming or Yama?

64
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,940
The key is to drink the medicine.

65
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,149
Drink the medicine now and take a good rest to recover.

66
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,980
Otherwise, can you still be Charming Yama?

67
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,910
You'll just be Lame Mai at most.

68
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,350
General Zhou.

69
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,510
You have countless cavalrymen under your control.

70
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,240
Why didn't you stop Shang Yizhi from entering the Wulan Mountains?

71
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,240
It was not General Zhou's fault.

72
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,010
Shang Yizhi was full of cunning tricks.

73
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,470
Previously, Fu Chong's elite cavalrymen

74
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,200
seemed to be eliminated by him.

75
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,630
Since we didn't expect that

76
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,030
the Nanxia Army would ambush in Yelanggou,

77
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,090
it was not strange that we couldn't foresee that

78
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,950
they would enter the Wulan Mountains.

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,350
Am I right, Marshal Chen?

80
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,980
Since Shang Yizhi has led the army to go into the mountains,

81
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,070
before he regains his vitality,

82
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,240
we should take this opportunity to

83
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,840
kill him as soon as possible.

84
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,220
Marshal,

85
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,970
there are only some wounded soldiers under Shang Yizhi's control now.

86
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,060
They won't become a threat to us.

87
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,520
Besides, they're short of food and medicine in the mountains.

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,260
I guess half of the Nanxia Army

89
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,230
might have died or escaped.

90
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,290
Marshal,

91
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,160
our army should still go south.

92
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,270
How is it going with the preparation of weapons and provisions?

93
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,800
Here is the thing, Marshal.

94
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,670
The archives room in Yuzhou was all burnt by Secretary Qiu

95
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,470
who was in charge of managing the archives there.

96
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,230
Secretary Qiu also killed himself to escape punishment.

97
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,350
I still need some time to

98
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,409
prepare provisions and weapons.

99
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,670
Dismiss now. We'll discuss it later.

100
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,430
Yes.

101
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,070
My Lord.

102
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,460
Eat something.

103
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,470
I have no appetite.

104
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,740
Lord Qiu...

105
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,880
committed suicide.

106
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,260
When he died,

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,300
he burned down the entire archives room.

108
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,370
No archive was left to those bandits from Beimo.

109
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,800
Qiu was a real man.

110
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,120
I owe it to him.

111
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,030
Have you heard about it?

112
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,310
The Beimo Army escaped to our place

113
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,770
because they were defeated by the Qingyu Military Coalition.

114
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,900
Sir.

115
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,150
Two bowls of noodles.

116
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,830
Okay.

117
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,280
It should be called the Zhenbei Army now, right?

118
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,810
In the battle of Yelanggou,

119
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,100
General Shang from the Zhenbei Army used a clever trick

120
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,430
to defeat the Beimo Army, whose number of soldiers was five times larger than ours.

121
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,090
The most amazing thing is that

122
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,490
there is someone called Charming Yama in the Zhenbei Army.

123
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,830
He was invincible on the battlefield.

124
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,310
He killed

125
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,630
over 200 enemies just by himself.

126
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,990
You're just bragging.

127
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,190
I'm not bragging.

128
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,560
That Charming Yama has a real name.

129
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,960
His name is...

130
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,140
Maisui.

131
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,580
Gentlemen, the noodles are ready.

132
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,830
How come this person looks so familiar?

133
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,090
Is she a girl from the City Guard Mansion?

134
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,050
She looks like a maid from that place.

135
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,990
None of those who serve the Beimo people

136
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,110
are good people.

137
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,990
Madam, Miss Xiu'er is missing.

138
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,909
What's wrong?

139
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,790
I went to Miss Xiu'er's room to change the cotton curtains

140
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,630
for her.

141
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,430
But I found this note on her desk.

142
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,050
[I'm going to leave Yuzhou because I have something on my mind. I'm imprudent. Don't miss me, Madam.]

143
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,600
Prepare a carriage for me.

144
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,060
Go to the city gate with me.

145
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,800
Yes.

146
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,910
All the people with no official duties

147
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,350
are not allowed to go out of the city without permission.

148
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,270
Understand?

149
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,790
You're not allowed to go out of the city!

150
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,800
You can't do this.

151
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,730
Step back!

152
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,170
Step back! Step back!

153
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,840
No one is allowed to go out of the city without permission.

154
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,590
Xiu'er.

155
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,040
Get into the carriage.

156
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,000
Madam.

157
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,240
I'll send you out of the city.

158
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,190
Xiu'er.

159
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,150
Change into these clothes now.

160
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,710
Stop.

161
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,150
Who are you?

162
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,350
Don't you know the city has been sealed?

163
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,310
What?

164
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,060
You even want to stop me?

165
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,120
It’s you, Mrs. Shi.

166
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,550
Let's go.

167
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,710
Wait.

168
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,120
Who else are inside?

169
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,390
Do you even dare to search my carriage?

170
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,990
I'm just following orders.

171
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,750
Please understand.

172
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,590
I'm going out of the city to burn joss sticks piously.

173
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,650
There are only two of my maids inside.

174
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,730
Go.

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,830
Brother.

187
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,390
Haven't I told you that

188
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,790
I'll show up as soon as you blow the whistle?

189
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,550
Brother.

190
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,560
♫How can my lifetime pass so quickly?♫

191
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,410
I'd like to give this to you. Okay?

192
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,390
Sure.

193
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,720
Go investigate that soldier from Nanxia.

194
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,750
Yes.

195
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,580
I can only send you here.

196
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,710
Take this.

197
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,500
Hire a carriage.

198
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,810
Thank you, Madam.

199
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,390
Just go.

200
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,200
Have a safe trip.

201
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,390
Mai!

202
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:28,990
Mai!

203
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,030
You're finally back, Mai.

204
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,860
Did you miss me?

205
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,830
Yes.

206
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,220
Don't move.

207
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,030
Give me a chance to embrace the hero.

208
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,030
Okay. I'll give you this chance.

209
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,830
Come on. Let me hug you.

210
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,710
Do it slowly.

211
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,480
Be careful not to hurt his legs.

212
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,030
Come on.

213
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,230
Come on. Do it slowly.

214
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,790
Come on.

215
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,670
One, two, three!

216
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,590
Come here.

217
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,150
Do it slowly.

218
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,110
Be careful.

219
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,150
I'm fine.

220
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,560
Do it slowly.

221
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,260
I'm fine.

222
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,670
I'm fine.

223
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,270
Lie down.

224
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,670
I'm fine.

225
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,530
Put some cushions under his feet.

226
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,990
How are you, Bro?

227
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,400
Do you feel good now?

228
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,120
Our messy dorm is actually more comfortable.

229
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,760
Right?

230
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,230
Bro,

231
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,230
do you know what your nickname is

232
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,160
in the army?

233
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,750
Charming Yama.

234
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,500
Charming Yama.

235
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,750
Well, you were not the one who gave me this nickname?

236
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,030
I'm not well-educated to have given you this nickname, am I?

237
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,190
I heard that you had rushed into the Beimo Army alone

238
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,230
in order to kill their marshal.

239
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,030
Did you cut him 50 times or...

240
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,080
-No, no, no. -He cut him 100 times, didn't he?

241
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,210
He cut him 100 times.

242
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,550
More than 200 times.

243
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,710
Over 250 times?

244
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,590
Enough.

245
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,030
You haven't given me any water since you came in a long time ago.

246
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,750
I'm hungry.

247
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,550
Right.

248
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,610
How about this?

249
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,430
I'll make you a bowl of handmade noodles.

250
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,110
Just wait.

251
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,950
Qi.

252
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,750
Fry two eggs. I want their yolks to be soft.

253
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,410
No problem.

254
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,750
I'll go, too.

255
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,910
I'll go help them, too.

256
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,840
Have a good rest.

257
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,230
Mai.

258
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,790
Big Brother, why are you here?

259
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,270
I just finished the military training, so I came to see you.

260
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,400
How are you feeling?

261
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,400
Much better.

262
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,880
You can take it off after wearing it for two more days.

263
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,940
Let me see your leg.

264
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,910
Who bandaged it for you?

265
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,040
Did those brats from the 7th Battalion bandage it for you?

266
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,970
The gauze is so thick that it's not breathable at all.

267
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,770
Does it hurt?

268
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,980
A little.

269
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,950
Your wound almost recovered.

270
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,680
Let me bandage your leg for you.

271
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,920
I'll take you out of bed for a walk later.

272
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
We'll take a walk?

273
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,550
I just felt I could walk.

274
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,080
So I can really walk now?

275
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,710
Come on. Stand up.

276
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,030
Come on. One, two, three.

277
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,150
Can you do it?

278
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,820
Sure. No problem.

279
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,900
I knew you couldn’t lie in bed for a long time.

280
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,270
But honestly speaking, Mai,

281
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,990
when you’re a soldier, it's inevitable to get hurt.

282
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,190
But you must learn to protect yourself.

283
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,830
I'm free today.

284
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,990
I'll take a walk with you for some more time.

285
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,400
But don't worry when I'm not free.

286
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,420
I've made a pair of walking sticks for you.

287
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,030
Look.

288
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,600
Mai.

289
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,370
General Shang.

290
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,430
Have I come here too early?

291
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,150
General, you're late.

292
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,030
I helped Mai bandage her leg again.

293
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,430
I also brought him a pair of walking sticks.

294
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,350
Lieutenant Tang, you must be busy now.

295
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,590
Since you are so busy,

296
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,520
just get back to work.

297
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,580
Leave the trivial matters here to me.

298
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,310
General, I'm not busy.

299
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,770
I've finished the military training today.

300
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,710
It's not dark yet, and you've finished the training?

301
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,580
Can't you have more training?

302
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,180
Mai, I have to go.

303
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,830
Big Brother, you've just come here.

304
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,550
Although the Beimo Army has just retreated,

305
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,830
it's still very dangerous.

306
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,560
I must give them more training.

307
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,230
General.

308
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,830
I'll entrust my buddy to you.

309
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,790
Just go. Leave this to me.

310
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,310
General.

311
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,610
Thank you for your advice.

312
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,590
I'm working for the right leader this time.

313
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,160
He's working for the right leader.

314
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,160
You came without any gifts?

315
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,750
Alright. Alright.

316
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,390
Okay.

317
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,470
[Beimo]

318
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,570
General, you're back.

319
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,790
How is Mai's injury?

320
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
It's not serious.

321
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,830
Okay.

322
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,430
But there's one thing

323
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,590
I don't understand all the time.

324
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,070
You're smart.

325
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,760
But there's something you don't understand?

326
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,000
In your opinion,

327
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,930
Mai's power wasn't big enough when he was alone,

328
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,150
but he risked his life

329
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,350
to attack the chief commander of Beimo.

330
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,030
What was his purpose?

331
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,630
He wanted to catch the leader first in order to capture all the enemies.

332
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,110
Mai must have wanted to kill Chen Qi.

333
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,010
Judging from his aggressive attack,

334
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,110
it seemed there were grudges

335
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,950
bewtween Chen Qi and him.

336
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,650
I just don't understand

337
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,590
why you always doubt this loyal soldier

338
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,630
who risked his life

339
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,910
for the territory

340
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,070
and the people of our Nanxia.

341
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,920
Here's some news, General,

342
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,550
A girl named Xu Xiu'er

343
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,080
came from Yuzhou to see Mai.

344
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,010
Why is Xiu'er here?

345
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,450
Bring her here now.

346
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,150
Yes.

347
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,550
Big Brother.

348
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,569
There's a girl.

349
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,540
Have you gone crazy because you always thought about women?

350
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,940
There's really a girl. Look. She's coming.

351
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,950
Alright. She's not here for you.

352
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,260
How can a woman enter the barracks without permission?

353
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:29,950
Battalion Commander Lu.

354
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,110
This is Mai's wife.

355
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,250
She's here to visit Mai.

356
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,110
She's going to see General Shang.

357
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,070
Let’s go.

358
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:36,850
Mai?

359
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,210
When did he get married?

360
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,480
I don't know.

361
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,200
No one told me about it.

362
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,930
If I had such a beautiful wife,

363
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,150
I wouldn't have told others about it, either.

364
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,750
It's impossible that you would have such a beautiful wife.

365
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,270
Why do you think it's impossible?

366
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,600
Mai has been injured for so long. It's such a torment for him.

367
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,310
Now there's finally a happy event

368
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,310
to delight him.

369
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:56,830
Wang Qi.

370
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,390
Yes.

371
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,730
Go tell Mai that

372
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,750
his wife is here.

373
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,320
Yes.

374
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,510
I'll go, too

375
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,550
I... I'll go, too.

376
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,710
I couldn't stand being worried about Mai

377
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,590
in Yuzhou City anymore.

378
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,890
General Shang, please let me stay

379
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,740
so that I can take care of Mai.

380
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,870
I will be careful with my words and actions.

381
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,870
I won't cause him any trouble again.

382
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,310
But Xiu'er,

383
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,710
there are rules in the army.

384
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,350
General,

385
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,750
The barracks are full of rough men.

386
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,070
Besides, Mai is injured so seriously.

387
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,710
If there's a scrupulous person taking care of him,

388
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,230
he will definitely recover better and faster.

389
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,690
Mai is seriously injured?

390
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,870
I beg you, General Shang. Just let me stay.

391
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,670
Fine.

392
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,750
Xiu'er, please help to take care of Mai.

393
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,630
Thank you, General Shang.

394
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,830
Roasted chicken legs and stewed goose.

395
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,940
I'm starving now.

396
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,810
I'm starving.

397
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,710
You are finally back.

398
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,830
If you still didn't come back,

399
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,540
I would eat this bamboo slip.

400
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,510
Enough.

401
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,270
You can feel that you're hungry?

402
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,270
As a full man,

403
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,710
you don't know how hungry men like us feel.

404
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,350
Right.

405
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,150
Well,

406
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,300
you left me here early in the morning

407
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,880
without giving me any food.

408
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,310
Can't I be hungry?

409
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,910
Since you have a wife, would you still feel hungry?

410
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,670
Whose wife?

411
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,590
Get me some food now.

412
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,590
Your wife.

413
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,230
The guards took your wife to see the general.

414
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,590
She'll come here later.

415
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,230
Mai.

416
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,270
Good for you.

417
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,470
You didn't even tell us that you had got married.

418
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:39,990
We are so close.

419
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,510
We're good friends, aren't we?

420
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,230
But you didn't tell me about it, did you?

421
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,430
-You should have told me about it.
-Are we friends or not?

422
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,030
No.

423
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,590
I don't even know when I got married.

424
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,290
What could I have told you?

425
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:47,940
So you really don't have a wife?

426
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,070
I really don't have a wife.

427
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,720
Oh no.

428
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,790
Is she a spy?

429
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,070
There's no such a beautiful spy.

430
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,950
Oh no!

431
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,550
Could it be...

432
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,030
Mai.

433
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,030
Look. She's here.

434
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,950
-Xiu'er!
-Mai!

435
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,430
Xiu'er.

436
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,750
Mai.

437
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,510
Mai, why are you so badly injured?

438
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,670
Well...

439
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,350
There are still some weapons we haven't wiped yet.

440
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,070
We'll continue to wipe the weapons.

441
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,910
Sergeant, I've finished wiping the weapons.

442
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,390
Can't you do it again after you've finished?

443
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,400
Why should I do it again after I've finished?

444
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:18,920
No.

445
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,310
-Why should I do it again after I've finished?
-Let's go.

446
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,950
Xiu'er.

447
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,710
Why are you here?

448
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,000
Did you come here alone?

449
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,510
The situation is quite chaotic outside because of the war.

450
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,640
How dangerous it is.

451
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,590
I heard that you got hurt.

452
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,880
I was worried about you.

453
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,430
I'm fine.

454
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,250
I've recovered. I'm fine now.

455
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,990
Xiu'er.

456
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,350
Did you tell them that

457
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,070
you are my wife?

458
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,830
No, I didn't.

459
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,340
I just said that I came to see you.

460
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,070
They

461
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,220
misunderstood it.

462
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,990
But I didn't explain.

463
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,970
Mai.

464
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,360
Have I caused you trouble?

465
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
No.

466
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,160
However,

467
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,350
now the barracks

468
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,010
are full of stinky rough men.

469
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,900
Where do you sleep at night?

470
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,700
I'll ask them to send you home.

471
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,070
Come on.

472
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,910
-I'll go ask...
-I’m not leaving.

473
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,910
Don’t move, Mai.

474
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,350
General Shang promised

475
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,170
to arrange a residence for me.

476
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,830
How can I leave when you're injured like this?

477
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,590
Alright.

478
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,830
Don't cry.

479
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,990
Alright.

480
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,190
Since General Shang has agreed,

481
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,790
you can stay here for a few days.

482
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,950
Don’t cry.

483
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,590
Mai, you know what?

484
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,030
Now people all over Yuzhou City

485
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,550
are talking about Charming Yama who has great talent in martial arts.

486
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,680
He killed over 200 enemies by himself.

487
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,710
How many? Over 200?

488
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,720
Everyone says that Charming Yama is a hero.

489
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,900
As this rumor is spread more and more widely, they're...

490
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,030
exaggerating it more and more.

491
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,930
Mai.

492
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,070
I'm fine.

493
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,630
I'm fine.

494
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,560
Mai.

495
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,990
Are those dirty clothes all yours?

496
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,530
Mai, have a good rest.

497
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,480
I'll go wash the clothes for you.

498
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,080
Xiu'er, take a rest for a while.

499
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,230
No need, Xiu'er.

500
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,980
Xiu'er, I can wash them myself.

501
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,110
It's okay.

502
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,990
Those are socks.

503
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,560
Xiu'er.

504
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,070
Xiu'er! Xiu'er!

505
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,790
Xiu'er, take a rest for a while. Xiu'er!

506
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,350
Xiu'er, do you know where it is?

507
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,770
Little girl.

508
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,110
Thank you for speaking up for me, Mr. Xu.

509
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,670
I will take good care of Mai.

510
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,150
Miss Xu, you came to the Wulan Mountains alone.

511
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,710
I really admire your sincerity.

512
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,320
But I wonder whether that brat inside

513
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,700
is grateful to you.

514
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,110
Mr. Xu, don't make fun of me.

515
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,640
Mai and I are not predestined to be a couple.

516
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,970
I just did what I wanted to do.

517
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,150
Sometimes, it's not necessarily a bad thing

518
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,430
if two people are not predestined to be a couple,

519
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,430
in case you should find that your sincere affection

520
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,670
has been given to the wrong person in the end.

521
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,430
Sir, are you here to see Mai?

522
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,470
Okay. I'll go inside myself.

523
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,210
Go on washing the clothes.

524
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,670
Mr. Xu.

525
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,430
Don't move.

526
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,710
I'm here to see

527
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,230
whether your wound is recovering well.

528
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,960
Thank you for your concern.

529
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,200
I guess I'll be able to walk without the walking sticks in a few days.

530
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,950
You're recovering so fast.

531
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,830
It's all due to Miss Xu's help.

532
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,240
When are you going to

533
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,950
marry her and spend the wedding night with her?

534
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,800
You must be joking, sir.

535
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,790
As long as those enemies from Beimo don't retreat from our borders,

536
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,190
how would I have the mood?

537
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,310
You two haven't spent the wedding night together yet.

538
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,230
There are many things which Miss Xu

539
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,100
might find it inconvenient to do for you.

540
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,230
Just think about it.

541
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,790
You've been lying here for several days continually.

542
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,190
You probably have got some bedsores.

543
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,720
Xiu'er is still an unmarried girl.

544
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,520
It's inconvenient for her to clean your body for you.

545
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,470
Forget it.

546
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,710
Let me help you.

547
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,990
I wouldn't dare to trouble you, sir.

548
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,850
It's nothing. No need to thank me.

549
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,590
It's just a small favor.

550
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,080
My leg is bleeding again.

551
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,590
It can't get wet.

552
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,710
I'm fine.

553
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,550
Mai.

554
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,510
Didn’t the military doctor say that you would recover soon?

555
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,710
Why is your leg bleeding again?

556
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,510
Don’t move, Mai.

557
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,310
I'll go get the military doctor.

558
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:05,910
I'm fine.

559
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,830
I didn't expect that though you were quite ruthless to the enemies on the battlefield,

560
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,110
you would be so cruel to yourself, too.

561
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,350
I don’t know what you're talking about.

562
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,400
I can't be too straightforward about something.

563
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,350
Do you

564
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,230
want to force me to help you get changed?

565
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,270
You won't do that.

566
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,830
How do you know I won't?

567
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,750
You always make allowances for others while doing things.

568
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,880
Since you know that I always make allowances for others,

569
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,080
why don't you tell me the truth now?

570
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,760
I'll give you one last chance.

571
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,790
If you don't tell the truth,

572
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,870
I will immediately cancel your military status

573
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,600
and take you out to execute you.

574
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,560
General Shang.

575
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,070
Why are you in such a hurry?

576
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,270
I'm here to look for the military doctor.

577
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,870
Mai's leg is bleeding again.

578
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,080
His leg is bleeding?

579
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,550
Bai.

580
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,430
Take her to the military doctor. I'll go check on Mai.

581
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,990
Let’s go.

582
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,280
I didn't lie.

583
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,600
My purpose was to kill the enemies.

584
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,110
Chen Qi.

585
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,620
You know him?

586
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,470
Yes.

587
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,650
I know I can't hide it from you.

588
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,310
There is a big grudge between Chen Qi and me.

589
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,540
As far as I know,

590
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,640
in the entire Nanxia, there's only one person who has a big grudge

591
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,790
against Chen Qi.

592
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,110
I'll take it as a yes.

593
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,860
Please allow me to

594
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,530
stay in the army.

595
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,430
It’s not hard to stay in the army.

596
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,180
However,

597
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,140
do you understand it might lead to the domino effect?

598
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,910
That day in Yelanggou, you almost ruined

599
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,380
the operation plan of our army.

600
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,750
There were many soldiers from our army

601
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,400
who died on the battlefield because of your unauthorized action.

602
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,950
Sir.

603
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,590
Mai.

604
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,060
I know you're so eager to take revenge.

605
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,430
But do you know the consequences of doing this?

606
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,750
I'm sorry.

607
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,070
Sir.

608
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,050
Now I know what's more important.

609
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,690
Please give me another chance.

610
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,020
I understand that as a soldier of Nanxia,

611
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,680
I should protect the people of Nanxia.

612
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,940
I won't commit a mistake like this again.

613
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,070
Mai.

614
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,100
I hope that you'll remember what you said today.

615
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,170
I'll keep it in my mind.

616
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,230
Mai!

617
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,000
General.

618
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,030
Mai's injury…

619
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,910
There's nothing serious with her injury.

620
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,380
I have something important to tell you.

621
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,780
-Let me check…
-Let's talk somewhere else.

622
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,330
You've sensed it?

623
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,010
Mai is a woman,

624
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,520
and it's inconvenient for her

625
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,690
to stay in the barracks.

626
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,760
Besides, she's badly injured.

627
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,190
it's inevitable that she might make a mistake

628
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,520
and arouse suspicions.

629
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,110
There happened to be a woman who claimed to be her wife

630
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,770
and stayed to take care of her.

631
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,130
It can help to eliminate many suspicions.

632
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,860
I didn't expect you to understand her so well.

633
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,720
I misunderstood you.

634
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,630
Actually, on the battlefield, she...

635
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,870
You don't have to say more about it.

636
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,350
I'm clear about it now.

637
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,110
As an orphan girl,

638
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,020
she saw the person who killed her father on the battlefield.

639
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,030
It's understandable that

640
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,000
she rushed into the enemy to kill that man without permission.

641
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,790
But she can't be exempt from her liability for her faults.

642
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,110
Since she's a soldier of Nanxia,

643
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,770
she must abide by the military rules of Nanxia.

644
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,290
The punishment for her

645
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:15,030
will be conducted after she recovers.

646
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,360
Although Mai has promised not to commit a mistake like this again,

647
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,290
I still feel a bit uneasy.

648
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,940
In that case,

649
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,990
with her meritorious service this time, why don't we take this opportunity

650
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,910
to transfer her to the barracks of my personal guards directly?

651
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,840
I'll keep an eye on her personally.

652
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,570
Are you trying to use your
official power for personal benefits?

653
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,230
What kind of person do you think I am?

654
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,960
What I think isn't important.

655
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,470
But your words and actions

656
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,960
will be heard and seen by all the soldiers.

657
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,550
If you say or do something inappropriate, and people gossip about it,

658
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,390
I'm afraid all your efforts

659
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,430
will be wasted.

660
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,070
Don't worry, sir.

661
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,390
I'll be careful with my words and actions.

662
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,250
I won't say much about it, either.

663
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,990
I believe that you're clear about

664
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,030
what's more important.

665
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,870
However, after all,

666
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,750
Mai was brave and did a good job on the battlefield this time.

667
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,710
If we teach and train her for some time,

668
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,910
she will become a fierce tiger in the future.

669
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,790
A tigress?

670
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,750
Everyone, for the battle in Yelanggou, just tell me

671
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,350
whether I should reward or punish the soldiers.

672
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,430
Your Majesty,

673
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,290
I think we should punish Marquis Dingnan severely.

674
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,720
Marquis Dingnan changed the Qingyu Military Coalition's name

675
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,400
to Zhenbei Army without permission.

676
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,350
It’s obvious that he wants to rule his area by dividing the territory.

677
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,030
His wild ambition is so obvious.

678
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,030
Please issue a decree at once to order

679
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,030
Marquis Dingnan to hand over the military power,

680
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:04,830
and to bring Marquis Dingnan to the Ministry of Justice for a severe interrogation.

681
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,670
I agree.

682
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,910
Me, too.

683
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,670
Your Majesty.

684
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,630
The Zhenbei Army defeated the Beimo Army

685
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,600
and established prestige for our country.

686
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,470
Not only do you not approve of rewarding them,

687
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,280
but you also want to put the chief commander into prison.

688
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,430
Aren't you afraid that you will disappoint all the soldiers in our country?

689
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,230
Your Majesty,

690
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,710
the Zhenbei Army just consists of the troops from two prefectures for the time being.

691
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,990
How powerful can it be?

692
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,230
They defeated the Beimo Army.

693
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,150
But who knows whether there was anything fishy about their victory?

694
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,950
Your Majesty,

695
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,630
they have no evidence and they're slandering them.

696
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,110
They just want to use their eloquence to

697
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,790
wipe out the military achievements which tens of thousands of soldiers have got

698
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,390
by sacrificing their lives.

699
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,150
What is their intention?

700
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,750
Then how do you explain the incidents that the City Guard of Yuzhou

701
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,870
surrendered to the enemy, and the special envoy from Jinling was killed?

702
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,350
The Beimo Army did it clearly.

703
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,110
How could you frame our soldiers?

704
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,910
The military order was sent and reported by the City Guard.

705
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,560
But even the City Guard surrendered to the enemy himself.

706
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,430
Were his words really trustworthy?

707
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,310
Maybe he colluded with others both internally and externally.

708
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,710
Your Majesty, please investigate this case thoroughly.

709
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,510
Your Majesty,

710
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,630
the war has started.

711
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,470
We can't change the chief commander during the war.

712
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,670
Otherwise, the army will be disunited,

713
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,290
and Shengdu will be in danger, Your Majesty.

714
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,950
Minister Lin.

715
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

716
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,230
Regardless of other things,

717
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,550
the special envoy from Jinling was killed in Yuzhou City.

718
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,990
Young Marquis Dingnan

719
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,990
can't be exempt from the liability of his failure in protecting the envoy.

720
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,310
But now we're trying to quell the disturbances at the southwest border.

721
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,550
The Huainan Army can’t dispatch any troops to

722
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,830
support the central regions.

723
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,070
Currently, only the Zhenbei Army is capable of

724
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,230
resisting the Beimo Army.

725
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,630
If the imperial court doesn't handle it properly,

726
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,510
in a less serious situation, the morale of the army will be unstable,

727
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,710
and in a more serious situation, it will endanger Nanxia.

728
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,230
You all know Young Maquis Shang's

729
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,430
personalities well.

730
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,470
If we make things so difficult for him that he just gives up fighting against the enemies,

731
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:03,070
I'm afraid there'll be no turning back.

732
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,030
Besides, we won't be able to explain it to the Eldest Princess.

733
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,500
Then in your opinion,

734
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,360
what should we do?

735
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,830
In my opinion,

736
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,360
firstly, we should neither reward nor punish them, and we should wait and see.

737
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,350
After the Beimo Army is completely expelled from our territory,

738
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,750
we can use the excuse of rewarding him to take back the military power.

739
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,130
If he doesn't hand it over,

740
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,660
then he'll become a traitor to our country and we can arrest him.

741
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,110
Secondly...

742
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,130
Secondly, I think

743
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,990
we can withdraw the Imperial Guards outside Marquis Dingnan's Mansion

744
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,650
so that Young Marquis can fight against the enemies with no worry.

745
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,350
What do you all think?

746
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,630
In that case,

747
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,949
let's do as Prime Minister Lin said.

748
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:22,520
[Marquis Dingnan's Mansion]

749
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,199
Retreat!

750
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,659
[Marquis Dingnan's Mansion]

751
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:26,710
Yes!

752
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:44,830
Your Highness.

753
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:48,030
The Imperial Guards outside our mansion have retreated.

754
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,480
It was really not easy to gain victory in this battle.

755
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,060
May Buddha bless that

756
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,630
my son can return safely.

757
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,990
Marshal,

758
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,950
I've found a military registration file which that Nanxia soldier filled in

759
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,110
when he joined the army.

760
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,010
[Military Report: The people of Yuzhou are very obedient. Nothing happened in the city.]

761
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,790
I still need time to verify

762
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,950
the authenticity of this military registration file.

763
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,510
Read it.

764
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,190
Maisui, 19 years old,

765
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,630
comes from Shengdu, Nanxia.

766
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,950
He lost his parents when he was a kid.

767
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,520
His elder brother is his only family who is still alive.

768
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,670
But he has been missing for many years.

769
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,400
His whereabouts have remained unknown till now.

770
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,590
Mai.

771
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,590
Did you miss me?

772
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,270
Yes.

773
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,670
You really missed me?

774
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,510
Who are you?

775
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,350
Mai.

776
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,460
This is your brother Chen Qi.

777
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,590
He'll play with you from now on, okay?

778
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:02,770
Okay.

779
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,150
Can you climb trees?

780
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Then can you catch fish in the river?

781
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,940
Let me take you to play.

782
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,590
Brother,

783
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,750
I'd like to give this to you. Okay?

784
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,670
Sure.

785
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,780
Look.

786
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,390
If you're in danger,

787
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,790
just blow the whistle.

788
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,010
I'll appear by your side anytime.

789
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,570
I'll protect you forever.

790
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:41,920
Marshal.

791
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,670
Marshal!

792
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,080
Marshal.

793
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,150
General Chang is outside and asks to see you.

794
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,070
Let him in.

795
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,870
Yes.

796
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,530
[Military Report: The people of Yuzhou are very obedient. Nothing happened in the city.]

797
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,900
Greetings, Marshal.

798
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,280
It's late now.

799
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,720
What's the matter, General Chang?

800
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,670
I've heard that your birthday is coming,

801
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,660
so I came here to ask for a military order.

802
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,670
Please let me go to the Wulan Mountains.

803
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,390
I will catch Shang Yizhi alive, who is the chief commander of the Zhenbei Army,

804
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,470
so as to help you avenge the humiliation and celebrate your birthday.

805
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,190
Okay.

806
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,190
General Chang, you always do things in your own ways.

807
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,510
I'll wait here for your precious gift then.

808
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,990
I'll take my leave.

809
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,520
General Chang, please.

810
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,190
[Chang Yuqing has gone to the Wulan Mountains. Please keep an eye on his movements closely and report them to me regularly.]

811
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,830
Give it to Jiang Chengyi.

812
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,070
Yes.

813
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,150
Get changed first before you go.

814
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,110
Yes.
