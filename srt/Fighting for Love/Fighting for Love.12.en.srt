so that in the heat of battle, they won't be easily startled.

561
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,270
Those who lose their horses in the face of the enemy

562
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,270
will be executed.

563
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,680
However, those who fight valiantly and lose their horses

564
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,940
won't face penalties.

565
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,190
Lieutenant Tang.

566
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,550
Someone outside the camp wants to see you.

567
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,950
It's training time. I don't want to see him.

568
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,490
They brought this.

569
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,940
[Liu] [Dong]

570
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,200
Liu.

571
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,830
There are so many people with the same name.

572
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,640
Are you sure Brother Tang is here?

573
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,680
We'll know soon.

574
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,590
Calm down.

575
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,790
You're so impatient.

576
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,940
Brother Tang!

577
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,230
It's Brother Tang!

578
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,840
It's really you.

579
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,170
Boss, you really are here.

580
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,110
It's good that you're alive.

581
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,830
Both of you have lost weight.

582
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,150
I asked around for a long time, but I couldn't find you.

583
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,630
How did you find this place?

584
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,160
When Yinbao was destroyed,

585
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,070
only the two of us survived

586
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,000
among the guarding soldiers.

587
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,510
We wanted to live an ordinary life.

588
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,420
But when the Beimo Army invaded,

589
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,080
how can we soldiers sit still?

590
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,430
So we came together to join the army again.

591
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,470
After inquiry, we heard that

592
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,800
there's someone with the same name as you.

593
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,450
We wanted to try our luck.

594
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,790
You're lucky.

595
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,230
You're lucky.

596
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,710
Brothers.

597
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,040
Let's get drunk tonight.

598
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,880
Come with me.

599
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,660
-Let’s go.
-Okay.

600
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,260
-Let’s get drunk!
-Let’s go.

601
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,190
We didn't believe it was you at the door.

602
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,700
I just recognized...

603
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,030
Guard Mu.

604
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,030
Lieutenant Tang.

605
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,160
These two look unfamiliar.

606
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,340
They are good friends I met in Yinbao.

607
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,740
Hurry up. Greet Guard Mu.

608
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,190
Greetings, Guard Mu.

609
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,120
Nice to meet you.

610
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,630
They came to join the army today.

611
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,490
By the way, is General Shang here?

612
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,070
General Shang hasn’t entered the camp yet.

613
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,400
But it's not difficult.

614
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,910
Just tell Counsellor Xu when you see him.

615
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,350
I thought General Shang would be here

616
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,410
since you are here.

617
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,800
Just like you,

618
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,280
I came to send someone to join the army.

619
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,590
You know this person.

620
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,470
Who?

621
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,070
Mai.

622
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,950
Mai joined the army?

623
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,210
Where is he?

624
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,630
Eighth Squad, Fourth Platoon of the Seventh Battalion.

625
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,270
Okay.

626
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,950
I’ll take you to Mai.

627
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,150
Mai just joined the army today.

628
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,010
He must be busy.

629
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,390
Take care of these two brothers

630
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,230
and go later.

631
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,230
Okay.

632
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,200
Thank you, Guard Mu.

633
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,280
Let's go.

634
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:19,840
Let's go.

635
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,310
Let's go.

636
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,760
[Shang]

637
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:43,990
Move.

638
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:47,840
Move.

639
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,390
Move.

640
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,880
Move.

641
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,630
Move.

642
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,540
Chen Qi.

643
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,810
I’ll kill you.

644
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,630
Mai.

645
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,400
Mai. Enough.

646
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,720
Stop. Stop.

647
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,510
Stop it.

648
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,490
Mai.

649
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,110
Are you crazy?

650
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,130
Do you have to be like this in the training?

651
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,870
Let's go to the barracks.

652
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,800
Aren't you full of energy?

653
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,200
I'll let you climb as much as you can today!

654
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,800
Go!

655
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,430
Yes.

656
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,310
Hurry up.

657
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,390
Hurry up.

658
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,110
Erdan.

659
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:40,750
Can you do it?

660
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,270
Yes.

661
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,200
Hurry up.

662
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,150
Shang Yizhi silently took away

663
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,030
the military power of Yuzhou.

664
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,670
His ambition is obvious.

665
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,990
I have to guard against him.

666
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,980
It's better to clear a passage than to block.

667
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,710
The Beimo army is heading south.

668
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,190
They will attack Qingzhou and Yuzhou first.

669
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,470
Your Majesty, why don't you allow the Qingyu military coalition

670
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,630
to fight the enemy?

671
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,070
You mean...

672
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,630
At the beginning of leading troops,

673
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,190
it's natural for Shang Yizhi not to handle it with ease.

674
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,630
Besides, he's young and passionate.

675
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,550
He is bound to be eager for achievements.

676
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,510
If he dies on the battlefield,

677
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,270
it would be a good story.

678
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,430
Let me think about it.

679
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,110
Please leave.

680
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,190
I shall take my leave.

681
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,550
Pass my order.

682
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

683
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,750
Order Shang Yizhi, Marquis Dingnan,

684
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,640
to return to Shengdu immediately.

685
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,150
Block the Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

686
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,430
No one is allowed to go out without an edict.

687
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,010
Don't let even a pigeon

688
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,230
fly out.

689
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,830
Yes, Your Majesty.
