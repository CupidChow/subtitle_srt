[Fighting for love]

3
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,990
[Episode 28]

4
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,550
Greetings, Your Highness.

5
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,430
General Mai.

6
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,850
Please have a seat.

7
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:47,990
Here.

8
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,150
Try the tea I made myself.

9
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:55,150
I haven't made tea for a long time so it is not as good as before.

10
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,190
Sorry about that, General Mai.

11
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,410
Your Highness is as beautiful

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,230
as the goddess in the painting.

13
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,510
I feel inferior.

14
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,280
General Mai,

15
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,789
I'm flattered by your words.

16
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,730
Thank you, Your Highness.

17
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,240
I should thank you.

18
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,670
You risked your life with Yizhi.

19
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,870
But for you,

20
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,230
Yizhi

21
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,550
wouldn't have come back safely to me.

22
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,670
I am deeply indebted to you.

23
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,870
Tell me, what gift do you want?

24
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,430
By the way, I've bought

25
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,550
an excellent mansion in Shengdu

26
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,750
for you.

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,340
Thank you, Your Highness.

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,190
But I don't need you to give me anything.

29
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,730
I protected Young Marquis

30
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,550
not because I wanted you to give me any gifts.

31
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,510
I know.

32
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,030
I wanted to give you the gifts

33
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,230
because I hoped to express my gratitude to you.

34
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,440
Besides,

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,230
Yizhi will need your help in the future.

36
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,470
Only when you're willing to help us

37
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,400
can our people live a peaceful life

38
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,150
and our country be stable.

39
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,470
Your Highness, it's so nice of you to say that.

40
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,510
But I was just an orphan girl.

41
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,870
I don’t have a big ambition.

42
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,470
Then General Mai,

43
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,390
what do you want?

44
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,550
I want the dead

45
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,320
to rest in peace.

46
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,390
And I want the alive

47
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,760
to live a peaceful life.

48
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,200
How can we get the alive to live a peaceful life?

49
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,990
In my opinion,

50
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,150
only by letting go of the past

51
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,670
can one live a peaceful life.

52
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,850
Letting go of the past?

53
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,560
It's easier said than done.

54
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,310
But you should know that two wrongs don't make a right.

55
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,910
I don't know

56
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,710
how to make things right.

57
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,079
I only know I need to find my true enemy to take revenge on.

58
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,990
Don't worry, Your Highness.

59
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,350
I'll only take revenge on the culprit.

60
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,930
I'll take my leave.

61
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,330
Your Highness.

62
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,390
Mr. Deng has entered the mansion with the emperor's oral instruction.

63
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,709
He's coming.

64
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,590
Your Majesty.

65
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,000
I've done acupuncture.

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,320
I'll come again at 7 p.m.

67
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,950
Thank you.

68
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,270
My pleasure.

69
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,110
Let me take my leave.

70
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,830
It's a sunny day today.

71
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,190
Let me ask some people to set up a stage outside

72
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,390
and get some singers and dancers to perform for you

73
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,250
so that you won't feel very bored.

74
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,690
Your Majesty, I have to say

75
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,550
that you should follow the doctor's advice

76
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,710
and take good care of your health.

77
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,790
Other problems will be solved.

78
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,510
I know

79
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,110
I won't be

80
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,150
fully recovered.

81
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,190
Your Majesty, please don't be too worried.

82
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,630
You need to rest.

83
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,220
Zeng...

84
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,310
His family...

85
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,150
To ensure that Zeng Imperial Censor doesn't feel lonely,

86
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,350
I've made his family go with him.

87
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,909
I killed too many people.

88
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,750
Yu...

89
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,190
All the things were done by me.

90
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,510
If there is karma,

91
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,590
it'll happen to me.

92
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,430
Your grandson won't be effected.

93
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,690
I'm sorry that I made you have a hard time.

94
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,830
No.

95
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,770
I'm not having a hard time.

96
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,440
Your Majesty, you're having a hard time.

97
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,160
You know Prince Kang is...

98
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,270
But you had to turn a blind eye to it

99
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,430
and try to get Marquis Dingnan to help you.

100
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,150
Your Majesty,

101
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,230
I'm willing

102
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,470
to do everything for you.

103
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,870
Your Majesty,

104
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,230
please don't be too worried.

105
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,670
Take good care of your health.

106
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:53,040
Please bless us.

107
00:06:54,159 --> 00:07:02,590
Please bless us.

108
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:13,400
Please bless us.

109
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
If it's useful to pray for blessing,

110
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,440
what's the point of having an army?

111
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,470
One without awe

112
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,670
will be punished by God.

113
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,510
You can go back now.

114
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,470
You...

115
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,550
He was our sibling.

116
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,990
How could you do that?

117
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,990
Don't worry.

118
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,630
I...

119
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,320
I won't hurt you.

120
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,270
After all, you are now the only family member of mine.

121
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,070
Let her go.

122
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,970
Did my mother give you a hard time?

123
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,480
Of course not.

124
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,910
I know what she might have said to you even if you don't tell me.

125
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,110
Listen to me. Let's go back to Qingzhou.

126
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,240
Go back to Qingzhou?

127
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,590
You want me to give up revenge?

128
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,990
I mean after the revenge,

129
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,520
let's go back to Qingzhou and get married.

130
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,670
Let's first think about how we can

131
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,710
stay unscathed after we take the action in the palace.

132
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,510
You've got an idea?

133
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,670
I'll assassinate Qi Jing after I enter the palace.

134
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,150
Then you come and save him.

135
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,910
I...

136
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,730
As long as I'm captured by you,

137
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,080
I'll have a chance to stay alive.

138
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,480
By then, you'll be able to control all officials

139
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,030
and prevent people from rioting.

140
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,150
I think it'll work.

141
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,560
But we need to discuss details.

142
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,230
Greetings, Your Majesty.

143
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,710
Skip the formalities.

144
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,990
I'm glad you're here.

145
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,510
Have a seat.

146
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,350
Yes.

147
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,550
Sister.

148
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,670
Recently,

149
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,250
I've been reminiscing about the days

150
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,230
when we had fun together in our childhood.

151
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,390
Back then,

152
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,850
you would laugh out loud

153
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,350
when you were happy.

154
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,630
And after we had a quarrel,

155
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,490
you would look angry and unhappy.

156
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,530
You always wore your heart on your sleeve in front of me.

157
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,110
I miss those days.

158
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,310
If you have anything to tell me,

159
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,110
please say it directly.

160
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,110
I

161
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,950
didn't expect

162
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,590
that we would be so estranged from each other now.

163
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,190
Of all my sisters,

164
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,550
I loved you most

165
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,280
when I was a child.

166
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,870
You always begged me

167
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,750
to take you around.

168
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,190
Back then, you often got sick

169
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,490
and had to take medicine three times per day.

170
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,030
Mother could only rest assured

171
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,510
after she saw you take the medicine.

172
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,270
Although she was not my birth mother,

173
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,510
I felt that she always showered me with motherly love.

174
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,190
I remember once,

175
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,630
I couldn't convince you,

176
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,650
so I took you out of the palace.

177
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,390
I didn't dare to go far

178
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,920
and my study partner of martial arts was a Shang so we went to the Shang family's house.

179
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,990
At that time,

180
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,110
the members of the Shang family were not given noble titles

181
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,630
and they had never had guests from the royal family.

182
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,910
So they panicked

183
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,630
and we caused a big mess.

184
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,400
It was at that time

185
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,510
I met my future husband.

186
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,190
When I saw that you were so happy,

187
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,450
I felt that everything I did was worth it.

188
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,570
I never regretted taking you out.

189
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,370
At that time, I vowed silently

190
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,120
that I would get everything you wanted

191
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,630
for you.

192
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,190
Later,

193
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,150
Mother found out about it

194
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,860
and punished me severely.

195
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,390
But I never regretted taking you out.

196
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,920
At that time,

197
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,250
I made a decision that I'd get Shang Wei

198
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,380
to come to the palace

199
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,640
and be your husband.

200
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,390
You made it.

201
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,130
But then you took him away from me.

202
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,720
I

203
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,470
am so sorry.

204
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,470
I'm not the only one

205
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,230
you should say sorry to.

206
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,710
I know what you mean.

207
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,670
But after all,

208
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,280
we're brother and sister.

209
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,270
I want you

210
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,020
to help me for the last time.

211
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,110
I've decided to abdicate.

212
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,320
I'll abdicate in favor of Qi Huan.

213
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,390
Get up.

214
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,470
Get up. Hurry.

215
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:20,910
Get up.

216
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,350
Get lost!

217
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,870
What's the matter, Master Pang?

218
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,980
Your Highness.

219
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,640
His Majesty summoned Princess Shenghua.

220
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,480
The old man has been seriously ill for a long time.

221
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,950
He doesn't even want to see me.

222
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,670
I didn't expect that the first person he met after he got sick was her.

223
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,120
And His Majesty is making Qi Yu keep him company all the time.

224
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,200
His Majesty doesn't let him be away from him for a single moment.

225
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,150
Forget it.

226
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,150
A woman and a child

227
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,990
won't have a big impact on the situation.

228
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,470
Come on, keep dancing.

229
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,550
Yes.

230
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,420
If Doctor Du cooperates with us, it'll work.

231
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,210
What if he doesn't cooperate?

232
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,910
Doesn't he care much about

233
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,030
his old and bedridden mother?

234
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,000
You want to threaten him with his mother?

235
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,110
That's not good thing to do.

236
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,520
I'll just bluff him

237
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,050
into cooperating with us.

238
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,350
By the way,

239
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,400
when the emperor is being assassinated,

240
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,790
the Longyin Guards must be the first group of people to go save the emperor.

241
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,910
You haven't told me

242
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,910
how you'll get the Zhenbei Army

243
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,270
to enter the palace to save the emperor

244
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,600
before Longyin Guards.

245
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,260
I promise you'll be unscathed.

246
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,880
We'll talk about it when we meet Mu Bai.

247
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,430
Right now, we need to go back to the barracks

248
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,270
and assign tasks to them.

249
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,319
General Mai.

250
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,630
Is His Grace here?

251
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,710
Yes. Come in.

252
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:27,849
Your Grace.

253
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,610
Her Highness wants to see you.

254
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,910
Go back and tell my mother

255
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,070
that I have something important to do now.

256
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,600
I'll go to her when I'm back.

257
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,790
Her Highness said

258
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,430
you must go to her now.

259
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,240
I’ll go to the barracks and inspect the soldiers right now.

260
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,040
I’ll come back to report to you as soon as possible.

261
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,670
Okay, I'll go.

262
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,990
You're a maid from Zeng's mansion?

263
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,930
Did anyone visit Lord Zeng

264
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,210
when that thing happened in Zeng's Mansion?

265
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,390
Your Highness...

266
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,390
I don't have time to waste here.

267
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,190
Tell me!

268
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,880
Princess Shenghua went there.

269
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,530
Your Highness!

270
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,680
Your Highness!

271
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,080
You're about to kill her.

272
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,430
Does she want to die?

273
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,170
Your Highness.

274
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,590
Princess Shenghua

275
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,990
is not an ordinary woman.

276
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,040
She did those things

277
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,470
for a reason.

278
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,430
What did Min do when he saw Lord Zeng's maid?

279
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,120
Prince Kang got furious.

280
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,800
He even wanted to kill Princess Shenghua.

281
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,470
But

282
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,870
he has got a wise helper.

283
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,430
Pang Fu?

284
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,680
He must die.

285
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,550
Prince Kang trusts him very much.

286
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,030
It's not easy to kill him.

287
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:29,080
[Passport]

288
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,710
[Passport]

289
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,630
After you finish this task,

290
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,630
you can go back to Beimo.

291
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,270
Greetings, Mother.

292
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,390
You may leave.

293
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,270
Yes.

294
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,390
Get up.

295
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,910
All these years, I've been cautious with my words and actions

296
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,550
to protect you.

297
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,630
Unexpectedly,

298
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,310
it has got us

299
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,650
so estranged from each other.

300
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,620
Mother, I'm sorry.

301
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,690
What are your thoughts

302
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,530
about getting the throne?

303
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,470
Mother,

304
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,390
didn't I make myself clear?

305
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,230
His Majesty

306
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,570
wants to abdicate in favor of you.

307
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,310
How is that possible?

308
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,430
He tried his best to kill me.

309
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,670
He's always afraid

310
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,270
I would be a threat to his throne.

311
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,390
How come he's willing to abdicate in favor of me?

312
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,120
Maybe it's because he's too old

313
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,510
and sick.

314
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,380
I don't care whether he is pretending to be sorry

315
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,810
or he really wants to make up for our loss.

316
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,270
This is a rare opportunity

317
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,190
for us.

318
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,150
Don't you know what situation we're in?

319
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,710
There is chaos in our country.

320
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,830
And our foreign enemies are waiting for a chance to invade.

321
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,070
Nanxia has lasted for over a hundred years.

322
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,270
Are you really going to let Qi Min

323
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,950
get our country ruined?

324
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,150
You'll regret when you see

325
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,190
that the people of Nanxia

326
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,960
suffer because of your inaction.

327
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,430
Mother.

328
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,100
Qi Min won't make a good ruler,

329
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,800
but Qi Yu is still there.

330
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,840
Qi Yu is too young

331
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,230
to be the emperor that'll stabilize the country.

332
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,070
So I can stabilize the country?

333
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,030
You can.

334
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,950
Because you have Prime Minister Lin and me to help you.

335
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,950
Because the people and the officials long for a good ruler.

336
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,790
Let me tell you, you'll be able to rule and stabilize the country.

337
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,720
Enough, Mother.

338
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,750
Stop.

339
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,310
Don't you know me?

340
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,630
I don't want to rule the country.

341
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,370
I won't be a good emperor of Nanxia.

342
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,910
Why are you so heartless?

343
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,790
If you give up the chance to be the emperor,

344
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,190
how will you repay

345
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,510
your parents who were unfairly killed?

346
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,830
How will you repay

347
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,170
those who risked their lives to protect you?

348
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,940
Have you thought about it?

349
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,030
Fine.

350
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,110
You don't care about them at all.

351
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,080
How about me and your foster father?

352
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
He and I

353
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,310
tried our best to bring you up.

354
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,830
Do you see us

355
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,830
as dirt in your eyes

356
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,230
and want to get rid of me as soon as possible?

357
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,030
Mother, don't say that.

358
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,550
You and I both know

359
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,660
all our misfortune

360
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,920
was brought by Qi Jing.

361
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,750
He's too old to be the emperor now.

362
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,030
So he wants me to be the emperor.

363
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,390
If I just accept his offer,

364
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,120
it means he won't be punished the way he should be.

365
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,550
Besides,

366
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,830
all our loved ones

367
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,430
were killed by Qi Jing.

368
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,390
And

369
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,080
because of him,

370
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,150
Mai lost all her family.

371
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,750
If I accept his offer,

372
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,710
it means I'll betray

373
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,770
the people wrongly killed by him.

374
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:15,830
After all,

375
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,510
you only care about Mai.

376
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,790
You really think Mai

377
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,920
is more important than the well-being of all the people in our country?

378
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,480
Mother.

379
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,720
I don't want to be a ruler.

380
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,510
I just want to protect

381
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,270
all my loved ones in my life.

382
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,400
As long as I can be with Mai,

383
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,470
I'm willing to be impoverished and live in a shabby house.

384
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,930
As long as I can be with her,

385
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,410
I'm willing to face all the difficulties

386
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,830
and bear all sufferings.

387
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,820
You can

388
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,030
sacrifice everything for Mai?

389
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,750
In your eyes,

390
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,230
she's the only important person, right?

391
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,790
Fine.

392
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,550
If you want to leave,

393
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,550
just leave.

394
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,630
Leave.

395
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,710
I don't want to see you again.

396
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,070
Get lost!

397
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,910
Get lost!

398
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,320
Prime Minister.

399
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,320
This is a letter from Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

400
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,620
[7:45 a.m., Liuyun Temple]

401
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:50,430
[Daxiong Hall]

402
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,910
Greetings, Your Highness.

403
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,030
Prime Minister Lin, have a seat.

404
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,960
Do you know that

405
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,590
His Majesty summoned me

406
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,490
and told me that he wanted to abdicate in favor of Yizhi.

407
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,910
Abdicate?

408
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,370
It's for the sake of the emperor's grandson.

409
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,870
It's good that there won't be a coup.

410
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,910
Yes.

411
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,070
I asked you to come today

412
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,220
because I want you to do me a favor.

413
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,830
Prime Minister Lin, do you and your wife hope

414
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,750
to marry your daughter soon?

415
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,710
Your Highness, do you want to hold the wedding for them ahead of schedule?

416
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,280
Yes.

417
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,790
Why?

418
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,070
Our children are bound by the engagement document.

419
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,130
They'll get married sooner or later.

420
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,950
It'll be better if their wedding is held on the day when Yizhi ascends the throne.

421
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,210
Then they'll be the emperor and the empress on the same day.

422
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,710
Yes.

423
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,590
Your Highness, if you have met any problems, just tell me.

424
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,190
Does Yizhi

425
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,460
not want to marry my daughter?

426
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,460
Not exactly.

427
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,390
The situation is not stable now.

428
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,150
What if

429
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,930
something goes wrong,

430
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,460
there will be more trouble for us.

431
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,510
Your Highness, even if you didn't tell me about it,

432
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,150
I can understand.

433
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,990
Who is able to surpass my daughter

434
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,760
and win Yizhi's affection?

435
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,790
Who is she?

436
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,110
Mai.

437
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,430
Mai?

438
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,270
The Mai from the Zhenbei Army?

439
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,270
Mai is a woman?

440
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,030
I didn’t mean to hide it from you.

441
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,170
After all, we are like family and should be honest with each other.

442
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,310
I invited you to come here today

443
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,470
to tell you

444
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,070
that even though Yizhi has a crush on Mai,

445
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,310
I'll only allow

446
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,990
Yizhi to marry Zerou.

447
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,070
But

448
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,350
I'm afraid Yizhi is too young

449
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,630
and immature,

450
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,170
so he'll be impulsive.

451
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,870
Yes.

452
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,710
Zerou will be the empress in the future.

453
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,590
She should accept the fact that his husband will have concubines.

454
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,220
Since Yizhi likes Mai,

455
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,040
after the wedding,

456
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,400
Yizhi can let Mai be his concubine.

457
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,430
No.

458
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,270
Mai can never be a member of my family.

459
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,990
Why not?

460
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,910
Because

461
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,870
Mai is Han Huaicheng’s daughter.

462
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,250
She is Han Huaicheng's daughter?

463
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,470
[Lin's Mansion]

464
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:47,650
[Your Excellency: An emperor should consider it his priority to pay tributes to God and ancestors.]

465
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:47,650
[An emperor should protect the interests of his people and be kind to his people.]

466
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,850
[Your Excellency]

467
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,130
[Your Excellency]

468
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,360
[Your Excellency: An emperor]

469
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,340
[Your Excellency: The way an emperor rules its country]

470
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,750
[Virtue]

471
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,270
[I'll abdicate in favor of my grandson Qi Yu.]

472
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,060
[I'll abdicate in favor of my grandson Qi Yu. Qi Yu will be the legitimate emperor of Nanxia.]

473
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,060
[All the people in my country should be informed of this decision.]

474
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,120
[I'll abdicate in favor of my grandson Qi Yu. Qi Yu will be the legitimate emperor of Nanxia.]

475
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,120
[All the people in my country should be informed of this decision.]

476
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,900
[Your Excellency: An emperor should consider it his priority to pay tributes to God and ancestors.]

477
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,900
[An emperor should protect the interests of his people and be kind to his people.]

478
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,900
[An emperor should protect his country from foreign invaders and develop his country.]

479
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,560
[However, my grandson Qi Yu is too young to be the new emperor.]

480
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,560
[So I'll abdicate in favor of Shang Yizhi, son of the former Crown Prince. All the people in my country should be informed of this decision.]

481
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,880
Prime Minister Lin, do you know

482
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,350
why

483
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,510
I asked you

484
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,790
to return the document of edict?

485
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,240
No.

486
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,990
Have a guess.

487
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,010
I'll forgive you for anything you might say.

488
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,150
I venture to guess

489
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,310
that you want to

490
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,610
appoint someone as Crown Prince.

491
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,430
Then guess

492
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,440
who I'll appoint.

493
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,270
I dare not.

494
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,540
I dare not guess who the Crown Prince should be.

495
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,270
Yu

496
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,310
is too young.

497
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,830
If I let Qi Min be the Crown Prince,

498
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,950
Yu

499
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,350
will be killed.

500
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,340
Your Majesty.

501
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,110
The dilemma happens again.

502
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,230
It's karma.

503
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,429
Your Majesty.

504
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,720
I'm here to save His Majesty.

505
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,550
Father.

506
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,460
-I...
-Your Highness.

507
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,190
Go away.

508
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,590
I'm here to save His Majesty.

509
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,230
His Majesty was too tired. He has just fallen asleep.

510
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,910
Who is making so much noise?

511
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,070
Your Highness...

512
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Prime Minister Lin, nice to see you.

513
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,590
I felt bored

514
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,990
so I was joking with Mr. Deng.

515
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,590
Right?

516
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,290
Prime Minister Lin, you talked to my father for a long time.

517
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,950
Were you discussing something very important?

518
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,810
Your Highness.

519
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,290
His Majesty and I discussed some state affairs.

520
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,510
My policy proposal has been sent

521
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,630
to the Cabinet for a long time.

522
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,160
But I haven't received any feedback.

523
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,750
I don't know who I should ask about it.

524
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,700
It's my fault. Please forgive me, Your Highness.

525
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,270
As you know, the officials have got many things to deal with recently.

526
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,360
It's understandable that they forgot to deal with your proposal.

527
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,030
But they shouldn't have just ignored it.

528
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,470
I will go to the Ministry of Revenue now.

529
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,510
No need, no need.

530
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,240
Prime Minister Lin, you don't have to do that.

531
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,540
As you said,

532
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,950
you have many other things to deal with.

533
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,750
I can wait.

534
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,350
But I heard that

535
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,190
your found a husband for your daughter.

536
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,470
I guess

537
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,150
you must be busy with making arrangements for that.

538
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,460
My apologies.

539
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,830
You're right.

540
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,440
What a pity.

541
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,030
If I knew

542
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,170
you were marrying your daughter,

543
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,790
I would come to your mansion in person and propose to your daughter.

544
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,270
Your Highness, you must be joking.

545
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,360
My daughter is naughty.

546
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,230
I did a bad job in disciplining her.

547
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,950
You're way out of her league.

548
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,590
Well said.

549
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:54,630
Actually,

550
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,030
though my cousin is naughty,

551
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,890
he is a handsome and talented man.

552
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,680
Prime Minister Lin.

553
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,390
You should be satisfied with him.

554
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,950
Since my father is asleep,

555
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,270
I'll come later.

556
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,580
See you, Your Highness.

557
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,370
Where’s Mai?

558
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,750
Your Grace.

559
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,040
General Mai hasn’t gone to the barracks and hasn't returned yet.

560
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,880
Okay.

561
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,450
Young Marquis.

562
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,910
Put it down.

563
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,110
I'll leave now.

564
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,240
What is this?

565
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,320
It'll help you escape.

566
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,270
How?

567
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,480
If His Majesty sees that the assassin

568
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,750
is in a Longyin Guard's uniform,

569
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,670
what will come to his mind?

570
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,130
He'll definitely believe

571
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,510
that the assassin is a Longyin guard.

572
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,680
Then His Majesty

573
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,270
won't let

574
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,270
the Longyin Guards look for the assassin.

575
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,050
The Longyin Guards will be busy with proving their innocence.

576
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,180
This trick will undoubtedly

577
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,380
make it easier for us to take the action.

578
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,910
That's a good idea.

579
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,620
A thief cries "Catch the thief!"

580
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,300
Longyin Guards try to find the fake Longyin Guard.

581
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,840
If everything goes as planned,

582
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,970
who do you think

583
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,410
will be the right group of people to protect His Majesty and investigate the case?

584
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,150
The Zhenbei Army, of course.

585
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,150
When the Zhenbei Army is ordered to protect His Majesty,

586
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,810
it'll be easy to get you out of the palace safely.

587
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,070
Is there anything else I need to pay attention to?

588
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,440
There's one thing you need to do.

589
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,950
Keep telling yourself

590
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,070
that you're a Longyin Guard.

591
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:38,950
Mai.

592
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,350
Why were we

593
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,750
asked to get ready to go to the palace and protect His Majesty?

594
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,120
Is Marshal Shang going to stage a coup?

595
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,130
Marshal Shang doesn’t want to be the emperor.

596
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,460
There'll be an assassin

597
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,860
who wants to assassinate the emperor.

598
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,150
But why were we asked to enter the palace to protect His Majesty

599
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,080
and then get the assassin out of the palace secretly?

600
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,660
Because this assassin

601
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,270
knows you well.

602
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,280
Mai.

603
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:23,960
Will you be the assassin?

604
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,470
Yes.

605
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,710
Because I know why Marshal Shang’s father

606
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,000
killed my family.

607
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,640
Because of the emperor?

608
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,830
No way.

609
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,670
Duke Shengguo made great contributions to winning battles

610
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,870
and was loyal to His Majesty.

611
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,150
Why was he so cruel

612
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,870
as to kill his great helper, a protector of the country?

613
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,870
I also want to ask him this question.

614
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,750
Mai.

615
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,460
I don't mean to throw cold water on your plan.

616
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,190
But have you ever thought about

617
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,950
how you're going to escape

618
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,680
if you fail this time?

619
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,390
Don't worry.

620
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,220
If that critical moment comes,

621
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,990
I will die with him.

622
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,990
By then, Marshal Shang will take the Zhenbei Army

623
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,120
to save His Majesty.

624
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,160
They'll be rewarded for it.

625
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,400
The Zhenbei army

626
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,150
will not be suspected and implicated in the assassination.

627
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,480
But in order to kill him,

628
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,480
you'll probably die. Is it worth it?

629
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,470
How many times

630
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,950
have we risked our lives all these days?

631
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,390
We saved ourselves from danger every time.

632
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,500
With you and the Zhenbei Army,

633
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,790
I believe this time I'll still be fine.

634
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,450
I firmly believe I'll be fine.

635
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,490
Mai.

636
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,510
Don’t worry.

637
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,990
I will get you out the palace safely.
