I'm going to save another person.

117
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,510
Who?

118
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,310
A... A boy called Mingge.

119
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,190
Mingge.

120
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,430
He's my brother.

But you can't save him now.

122

You have to wait till night.

123

There is nothing you can do now.

124

137
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,550
I'll deal with you tomorrow.

138
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,990
Shang Yizhi, what's wrong with you?

139
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,710
Why did you say hello to him

140
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,190
at that critical moment?

141
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,310
Couldn't you just walk away with your head down?

142
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,190
Now we're both tied up here.

143
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,750
I just ran into him.

144
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,680
Just ran into him?

145
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,390
Didn't you know what occasion it was when you said hello?

146
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,450
What were we doing?

147
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,590
We were trying to escape. Escape.

148
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,790
So what?

149
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,870
Listen.

150
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,230
My biggest strength is being polite.

151
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,070
You...

152
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,630
If I die here today

153
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,670
for being polite,

154
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,310
I wouldn't regret it.

155
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,120
Also,

156
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,050
what do you women know?

157
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,310
Men are very polite

158
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,040
especially when we get up in the night to urinate.

159
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,550
What did you just say?

160
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,290
Men are polite.

161
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,390
I mean what you said before this.

162
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,830
You know.

163
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,710
What?

164
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,090
Did you peep at me taking a shower?

165
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,910
Since you've found out,

166
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,510
I'm gonna be honest with you.

167
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,560
It indeed was me that night.

168
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,230
I accidentally saw it.

169
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,910
But I already forgave you at that time.

170
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,310
If you didn't mention it,

171
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,670
I would have forgotten about it.

172
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,330
I would have kept it to myself.

173
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,720
I'm warning you.

174
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,220
If you tell anyone,

175
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,300
I won't let you go.

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,330
Are you threatening me?

177
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,870
Listen.

178
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,920
Everyone in the Ghost Camp knows

179
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,670
I'm a virgin.

180
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,880
Anyway, I saw everything I should.

181
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,400
If there is no other way,

182
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,910
I'll make do

183
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,840
with spending the rest of my life

184
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,680
with you.

185
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,270
What do you mean by that?

186
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,520
Hurry.

187
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,470
Hurry up.

188
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,110
Hurry!

189
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:49,990
Hurry.

190
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,110

Marquis Dingnan, we are here to welcome you back to the mansion.

197
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,150
Mai.

198
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,990
What's this?

199
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,230
My gift for you as an apology.

200
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,070
Tell me. What did you do wrong?

201
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,110
That night,

202
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,870
I shouldn't have watched you taking a shower...

203
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,630
for so long.

204
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,310
You shouldn't have watched me taking a shower.

205
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,670
I'll be more careful next time.

206
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,670
Next time?

207
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,720
It hurts so much.

208
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,230
Is your arm okay?

209
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,990
Nothing serious.

210
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,870
We're even then.

211
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,470
Don't mention it again, okay?

212
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,030
What will you do with the three lieutenants tomorrow?

213
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,360
Have you figured it out?

214
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,030
I almost forgot.

215
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,710
I came to ask you this.

216
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,200
What should I do?

217
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,830
Did Mr. Xu tell you?

218
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,630
No, right?

219
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,390
As the commander-in-chief,

220
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,760
you have to make your own decision in this kind of matter.

221
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,350
Go back.

222
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,660

Qian Yu, Zhao Zhi, and Sun Tao,

226
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,670

227
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,390
They have violated many military rules.

228
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,670
Considering their crimes, they shall be beheaded according to the law.

do you guys have any last words?

231
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,710
I deserve it.

232
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,230
I just hope you can spare my wife and child.

233

Don't worry.

I have sent someone to help your family members settle down.

237
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,320
Thank you, General.

238
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,290
It's time. Take them away.

239
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,530
General, I dare not do it again.

240
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,790
Please spare my life, General.

Next, let's welcome General Shang to say something.

245
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,510
Go.

246
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,550
Go.

247
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,110
Next, let me ask you

248
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,110
why we joined the army.

249
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,810
To protect our country and families.

250
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,230
It's... It's good to protect our country and families.

251
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,750
Yes...

252
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,270
Next, I'm going to announce three things.

253
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,830
This is all my own money.

254
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,430
First,

255
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,480
I will build a school.

256
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,350
This school will accommodate not only children,

257
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,680
but also old people and beggars.

258
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,310
The school

259
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,950
will guarantee everyone can have a warm meal

260
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,150
and sleep well.

261
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,470
What do you think?

262
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,750
Good.

263
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,790
Second,

264
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,830
I will use my own money

265
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,150
to give all the soldiers a 30% pay raise.

266
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,870
If someone makes a contribution, he will gain an extra reward.

267
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,510
Good.

268
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,430
Third,

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,670

You are still thinking about them now?

After all, they didn't starve me to death.

If they have repented,

286
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,830
being imprisoned for 10 years is enough to atone for their sins.

287

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,860
Send a message to Qingzhou immediately.

380
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,340
Okay.

381
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,750
Make sure they receive the message before the crown prince arrives there.

382
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,310
Okay.

383
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,550
God bless us.

384
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,810
The way you looked just now is quite uncommon.

385
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,230
I should set an example for the kid.

386
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,230
That's not what I'm talking about.

387
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,350
I mean your tears fell down so easily.

388
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,190
What tears?

389
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,110
Didn't I tell you?

390
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,510
The... The wind blew sand into my eyes.

391
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,440
I was not crying.

392
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,550
Fine.

393
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,310
But honestly,

394
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,350
you

395
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,710
have many strengths.

396
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,750
Really?

397
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,310
Be more specific.

398
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,830
You are kind, gentle, smart, and funny.

399
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,590
Most importantly,

400
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,830
you are courageous at critical moments.

401
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,090
You act without delay.

402
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,950
Then do you think girls nowadays

403
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,230
would like such a man?

404
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,800
How would I know?

405
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,130
Come on. We are just chatting.

406
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,350
I think... it depends.

407
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,760
Let's... take you as an example.

408
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,990
Do you like such a man?

409
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,670
Are you asking me if I like you?

410
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,950
No.

411
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,750
I... I have a friend.

412
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,630
I see.

413
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,390
You want to introduce your friend to me.

414
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,190
How old is your friend? What does he do?

415
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,190
Is he a gentleman

416
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,990
or a tough guy?

417
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,600
If he is too tough, I can't stand it.

418
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,430
No, no.

419
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,910
It's not the time yet.

420
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,550
I should think about getting married

421
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,670
after I return from Beimo.

422
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,790
Can your friend wait?

423
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,040
How about this?

424
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,710
Ask him out.

425
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,640
We can be friends first.

426
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,670
Where is your friend?

427
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,730
I'm asking you where your friend is.

428
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:06,950
He's dead.

429
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,790
Dead?

430
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,710
When did he die?

431
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,550
Just now.

432
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,530
Young Marquis.

433
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:16,950
Young Marquis,

434
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,410
I have something important to report to you.

435
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,330
You two talk.

436
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,050
Young Marquis,

437
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,400
I checked the supplies in Qingzhou today.

438
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,510
I'm afraid

439
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,350
they can't last a month.

440
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,350
Then we should report to the court

441
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,550
and ask them for food.

442
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,400
All the cities are asking for food from the court.

443
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,670
Besides, the court has negotiated for peace a few times in recent years

444
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,270
by giving them food and land.

445
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,110
We have lost plenty of supplies.

446
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,990
Sir, what should we do?

447
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,590
Yuzhou is the only city that is the closest to us.

448
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,240
The army is strong and their supplies are always sufficient.

449
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,800
Yuzhou is a good choice.

450
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,030
Shi Dachun, the city guard of Yuzhou,

451
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,510
used to work for my father.

452
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,560
My father saved his life back then.

453
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,070
I don't think he will refuse us

454
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,530
if we borrow food from him.

455
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,070
This plan was feasible.

456
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,590
But there is a tricky problem now.

457
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,510
According to Princess Shenghua's secret message,

458
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,110
the crown prince will arrive in Qingzhou soon.

459
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,360
The crown prince is coming?

460
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:22,910
Yes.

461
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,730
If we are not here when the crown prince arrives,

462
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,920
I'm afraid we'll be guilty of dereliction of duty.

463
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,330
Please make a decision quickly, Young Marquis.

464
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,430
If the crown prince is coming,

465
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,030
I'm afraid I'll be in danger.

466
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,900
But even if I stay in the city,

467
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,110
this problem can't be solved

468
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,190
very quickly.

469
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,390
It's a turbulent situation currently.

470
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,440
Beimo people just took over Yinbao.

471
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,270
Maybe they will attack Qingzhou one day.

472
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,030
Sir, listen to me on this matter.

473
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,160
Go to Yuzhou.

474
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,550
Okay.

475
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,250
By the way,

476
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,230
is Mai's passport

477
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,670
ready?

478
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,870
Mai.

479
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,990
What's wrong?

480
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,870
Mu Bai delivered a message

481
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,110
about the friend you asked me to ask about last time.

482
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,870
Mr. Four

483
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,750
already died.

484
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,940
Also,

485
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,150
my brother indeed was in charge

486
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,110
of the passport things.

487
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,430
But we had a war with Beimo, right?

488
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,710
So the situation has changed.

489
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,790
It's fine.

490
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,510
I'll think of a way to go to Beimo myself.

491
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,870
We'll go to Yuzhou to borrow food tomorrow.

492
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,030
I suggest

493
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,480
you go with us.

494
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,870
I won't go to Yuzhou with you.

495
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,020
I need to think of a way to go to Beimo.

496
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,820
Listen to me.

497
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,510
You have to pass Yuzhou if you want to go to Beimo.

498
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,270
Besides, the guard general is Shi Dachun.

499
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,710
He used to work for my father.

500
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,990
Maybe he can

501
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,850
solve your passport problem.

502
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,440
Okay.

503
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,110
Then let's leave together tomorrow.

504
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,710
Thank you.

505
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,410
Young Marquis,

506
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,030
you are going to borrow food.

507
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,490
Go and return quickly.

508
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,150
Sir, don't worry.

509
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,750
Uncle Shi is there.

510
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,470
I'll leave the camp to you.

511
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,030
Don't worry, Young Marquis.

512
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,230
With the help of Wei Peng and Liang Shao,

513
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,870
I will guard Qingzhou.

514
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,790
Wait for my good news.

515
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,330
Let's go.

516
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,570
[Yuzhou City]

517
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,790
I received information today.

518
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,910
[Shi]

519
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,310
There is no trace of the Beimo Army near Yinbao City.

520
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,450
No trace?

521
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,270
Impossible.

522
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,030
Could it be the target of Beimo's elite cavalries

523
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,150
is Qingzhou?

524
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,310
You mean the Beimo Army consists of elite cavalries?

525
00:29:59,310 --> 00:29:59,990
Yes.

526
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,480
The commander is Chang Yuqing from Beimo.

527
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,270
But elite cavalries can only give full play

528
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,870
to their abilities when they are on the plains.

529
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,730
This time, the Beimo Army used elite cavalries to attack the city.

530
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,430
You know cavalries too?

531
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,070
General Shi,

532
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,990
I was once Yinbao City's deputy general

533
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,390
and cavalry lieutenant.

534
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,650
Good.

535
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,000
Yuzhou City now happens to need a cavalry general

536
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,190
who has dealt with Beimo's elite cavalries before.

537
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,190
What do you think?

538
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,670
Are you willing to stay here

539
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,750
to train cavalries for Yuzhou?

540
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,950
General.

541
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,160
[Shi]

542
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,270
Didn't you tell me

543
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,990
to prepare for training cavalries a few days ago?

544
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,790
Did I say that?

545
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,030
Yes.

546
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,070
Lieutenant Tang

547
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,230
has dealt with Beimo's elite cavalries before.

548
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,590
If we combine his practical experience

549
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,110
with training,

550
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,520
it will be very good

551
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,320
for the rapid development of Yuzhou's cavalries.

552
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,990
I'm willing to do my best for Nanxia.

553
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,790
You come from a small city,

554
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,280
yet you are here showing off. Aren't you ashamed?

555
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,210
What did you say?

556
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,190
What? Am I wrong?

557
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,270
I've never heard

558
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,890
[Shi]

559
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,990
of that Yinbao City you mentioned.

560
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,160
You are lucky that you had a chance

561
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,780
to fight with Beimo's cavalries.

562
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,510
Although Yinbao City is small,

563
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,250
it's a territory of Nanxia.

564
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,980
The people of Yinbao City

565
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,640
are also the people of Nanxia.

566
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,470
The city has been taken over.

567
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,790
Do you know

568
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,600
what the people there are going through?

569
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,110
Well, you...

570
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,910
Wang Xun.

571
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,070
Watch your mouth.

572
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,740
Lieutenant Tang,

573
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,050
how about this? You go back first.

574
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,670
Well... if I have something I don't understand in the future,

575
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,470
I'll send someone to invite you.

576
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,360
Okay.

577
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,770
I'll take my leave.

578
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:51,890
[Shi]

579
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,070
Wang Xun,

580
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,750
how many times have I told you?

581
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,990
You are capable, but you are arrogant.

582
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,320
You should know that there's always someone better.

583
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,680
When can you stop being like this?

584
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,030
General,

585
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,670
I'm just not convinced.

586
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,390
What ability does he have

587
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,920
to help us train cavalries?

588
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,710
Considering his status, is he qualified?

589
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,790
Fine, I'm not going to talk about this with you.

590
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,240
You won't listen anyway.

591
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,070
Let's talk about the war.

592
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:19,290
[Shi]

593
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,070
Is there any news from the Qinshan sentry?

594
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,550
No.

595
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,990
No news at all?

596
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,750
No news is good news.

597
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,110
I hope I think too much.

598
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,870
Time to eat.

599
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,660
Take it.

600
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,670
What dishes?

601
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,230
Yours.

602
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:39,890
Thank you.

603
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,790
Thank you.

604
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,070
Take it.

605
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,360
Thank you.

606
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,490
What do you want?

607
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,790
Someone is here.

608
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,390
I didn't see you just now.

609
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,590
You want to fight?

610
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,010
This is your trick?

611
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,170
Jerk, I'm better than you at playing this trick.

612
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,940
Who did you just call a jerk?

613
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,070
The one who is making trouble.

614
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,670
You're asking for a beating.

615
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,230
Not bad.

616
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,870
You are not bad.

617
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,710
You're not that capable, yet you are here making trouble.

618
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,060
Stop.

619
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,590
Tang Shaoyi,

620
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,300
you were so righteous that day.

621
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,190
But today, you're fighting with your comrade.

622
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:54,910
Well, you are a hypocrite,

623
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,710
yet you are still in the Yuzhou Army.

624
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,590
Aren't you shameless?

625
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,190
Lieutenant Wang,

626
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,830
so you are jealous of me.

627
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,510
Nonsense.

628
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,270
Why would I be jealous of you?

629
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,429
I'm a lieutenant of the Yuzhou Army.

630
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:11,159
Of course you are jealous of me.

631
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,510
I know how to guard a city and I'm good at horse riding and archery.

632
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,570
Maybe my character is not that noble,

633
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,800
but I think

634
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:18,920
my character is nobler than yours.

635
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:22,190
You're worried that I would be favored by General Shi

636
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,190
and replace you.

637
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,440
If General Shi hadn't kindly taken you in,

638
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,909
you

639
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,270
would have become a lonely ghost somewhere.

640
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,389
Here's my advice.

641
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,710
Behave yourself.

642
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,710
Otherwise, you will suffer.

643
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,949
Just bring it on.

644
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,080
You are smug.

645
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:43,820
Come on.

646
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,389
Tang Shaoyi,

647
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,550
he is supposed to guard the city gate today.

648
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,270
But you beat him up.

649
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,670
You'll have to take his place.

650
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,870
Guard the city gate tonight, okay?

651
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,870
Okay, Lieutenant Wang.

652
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,630
I promise I'll complete the task.

653
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,750
Shang Yizhi, the Guard General of Qingzhou,

654
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,150
is domineering and committed many crimes.

655
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,070
During his one-month tenure,

656
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,110
he killed subordinates without permission. He shall be executed.

657
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,870
He left the camp without permission. He shall be executed.

658
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,990
He released the prisoners without permission. He shall be executed.

659
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,150
The crown prince is here to cleanse Qingzhou.

660
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,750
All the officials in the city

661
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,680
should listen to the crown prince.

662
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,480
[The Acme of Perfection]

663
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,590
Mr. Yang, you came all the way to Yuzhou.

664
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,870
Have you adapted to the life here?

665
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,030
If you need anything,

666
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,630
just tell me.

667
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,630
I'll ask someone to do it right away.

668
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,740
Yuzhou is not like Shengdu.

669
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,790
I'm worried you might be neglected.

670
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,800
General Shi, you're very thoughtful.

671
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,870
It seems that Yuzhou is indeed a good place.

672
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,210
These dancers are not simple.

673
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,830
And the guests here

674
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,910
are relaxed and leisurely.

675
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,430
It means General Shi has done a great job in guarding the city

676
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,670
and the people trust General Shi.

677
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,110
Thank you.

678
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,230
I'm flattered.

679
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,290
Don't be modest, General Shi.

680
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,830
I'm an attendant of the crown prince.

681
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,230
I often heard the crown prince praise General Shi.

682
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,590
Among all the armies,

683
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,190
the Yuzhou Army has strict rules

684
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,850
and enjoys a good reputation.

685
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,590
I'm flattered.

686
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,510
Although the Yuzhou Army is strong,

687
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,520
it's far away from Shengdu.

688
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,310
The situation in Shengdu City keeps changing.

689
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,990
Yuzhou is actually in a passive situation.

690
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,120
Mr. Yang, why are you sighing?

691
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,320
The world is in chaos.

692
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,790
The Beimo Army has been invading us again and again.

693
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,850
The crown prince wants to share His Majesty's burdens.

694
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,270
But without military power,

695
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,870
he is worried every day and can't sleep well.

696
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,330
The crown prince is hardworking.

697
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,150
I'm ashamed.

698
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,000
Yuzhou has received His Majesty's order.

699
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,390
We are fully prepared

700
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,110
and will protect Nanxia's land with our lives.

701
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,550
That's great.

702
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,110
Have some tea.

703
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,350
Here.

704
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,750
Honey,

705
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,730
why do you look so worried?

706
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,790
Didn't you go to watch an opera with Mr. Yang today?

707
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,830
We did go to watch an opera.

708
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,990
It's more difficult to deal with him

709
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,510
than performing on the stage.

710
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,350
He came with a purpose.

711
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,510
Why did Mr. Yang come alone from Shengdu?

712
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,710
Who asked him to come?

713
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,790
He is the crown prince's advisor

714
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,510
and he has a token of the crown prince.

715
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,370
Who do you think asked him to come?

716
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,590
Although I don't live in Shengdu,

717
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,990
I know

718
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,610
the emperor is old.

719
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,030
Although he has appointed a crown prince,

720
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,990
it's just a title.

721
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,320
The crown prince has no military power.

722
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,670
Moreover, the second prince is increasingly ambitious.

723
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,000
He has traveled around.

724
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,930
If one day, His Majesty really...

725
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,750
what should the crown prince do?

726
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,310
So he wants to win me over

727
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,770
to prepare for the future.

728
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,430
Honey,

729
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,270
what should we do?

730
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,450
If we choose the wrong side

731
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,930
amid the princes' competition,

732
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,860
it will be a disaster in the future.

733
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,230
Don't worry, Honey.

734
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,430
Today, I managed to fool him

735
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,310
by using the emperor as an excuse.

736
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,200
I really don't want to get involved in this

737
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,950
if I don't have to.

738
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,230
Report!

739
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,920
General, there is an urgent report.

740
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,110
We found enemies' traces outside the city.

741
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:34,590
Let's go.

742
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,110
Okay.

[Protect the country and the people]

General,

746
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:42,750
it's me.

Lieutenant Wang asked me to guard the gate tonight.

Why did you wait till they have arrived here to report?

751
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,880
I already delivered a message

752
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,920
an hour ago.

753
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,250
I don't know why you didn't know until now.

754
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,100
That fool ignored my words again.

755
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,270
Shang Yizhi, City Guard of Qingzhou,

756
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,720
is here to visit General Shi.

757
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,180
Please open the city gate.

758
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,950
Shang Yizhi?

759
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,040
Didn't he just become the Guard General of Qingzhou not long ago?

760
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,590
Why did he come to Yuzhou?

761
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,050
[Protect the country and the people]

762
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,040
Convey my order.

763
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,550
Guard the city gates carefully.

764
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,480
Maybe they are the Beimo Army in disguise.

765
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,040
Okay.

766
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,590
You talk to them.

767
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,110
Okay.

768
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,510
If you are the Qingzhou Army, what proof do you have?

769
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,070
Why does his voice sound so familiar?

770
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,070
What do they mean?

771
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,030
Do they want to see my seal?

772
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,950
If it's really General Shang,

773
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,450
[Protect the country and the people]

774
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,720
please show us the seal to prove your identity.

775
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,430
I'll go.

776
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,360
Give me the seal.

777
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,230
Show it to him.

778
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,830
I'll go.

779
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,310
Let me talk to him.

780
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,310
Don't cause trouble.

781
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,390
I know him.

782
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,310
How do you know someone in the Yuzhou Army?

783
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,310
You have so many questions.

784
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,070
Do you want to enter the city or not?

785
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,470
You...

[Protect the country and the people]

787
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,870
Is it Tang Shaoyi up there?

788
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,430
Mai.

789
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,990
It's me, Brother Tang.

790
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,430
Mai, it's really you.

791
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,240
Brother Tang,

792
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,590
I came with General Shang's carriage.

793
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,590
This is General Shang's seal.

794
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,590
Please ask Mr. Shi to verify it.

795
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,270
Okay.

797
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,510
General,

798
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,590
Mai is the one

799
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,350
who escaped from Yinbao City with me.

800
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,390
I came to Yuzhou.

801
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,870
Mai went to Qingzhou to report.

802
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,070
The people outside the city are indeed not the Beimo Army.

803
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:50,950
Are you sure?

804
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,740
Yes.

805
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:56,770
General.

[Seal of General of Qingzhou]

807
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,270

[Protect the country and the people]

809
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,870
Uncle Shi.

810
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,070
It's been years.

811
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,110
Young Marquis, you have grown up.

812
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,670
If we run into each other on the street,

813
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,080
I wouldn't dare to recognize you.

814
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,830
Uncle Shi,

815
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,560
how do I look?

816
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,520
How do I look compared to my father?

817
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,510
I see. I'm not as good as him.

818
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,240
Young Marquis,

819
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,310
you must be tired.

820
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,270
Stay in my mansion for a few days,

821
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,310
so that I can welcome you with warm hospitality.

822
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:08,790
Okay.

823
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:09,260
Let's go.

824
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:09,790
Let's go.

825
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,390
Let's go.

826
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,470
Why did he go to Yuzhou too?

827
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,500
Yes.

828
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,990
Shi Dachun, the Guard General of Yuzhou,

829
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,390
was a former subordinate of Marquis Shang.

830
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,950
He took him back from the battlefield.

831
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,910
I'm afraid the new Guard General of Qingzhou went there to ask him to repay his father's kindness.

832
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,350
Then the crown prince

833
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:36,670
has failed this time.

834
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,630
Your Majesty, you care about the crown prince

835
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,910
and always think for him.

836
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,110
This prevents him from gaining more experience.

837
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,590
Prime Minister Lin, when do you think

838
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:53,240
the crown prince can assume major responsibilities?

839
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,030
Kill.

840
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,080
Prime Minister Lin.

841
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,590
Kill.

842
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,370
Your Majesty, you're making fun of me again.

843
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,270
This is a serious matter.

844
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,910
I dare not express my ideas easily.

845
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,910
This is just a casual chat.

846
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,590
Although Shi Dachun from Yuzhou

847
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,790
was a former subordinate of Shang Wei,

848
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,750
he won't be a problem.

849
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,590
This person is paranoid.

850
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,590
He's just a fence-sitter.

851
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,590
But when I'm in front of him,

852
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,390
he will take the initiative to be on my side, right?

853
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,790
Then that man will surely die this time.

854
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,120
You don't have to worry about the crown prince anymore.

855
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,070
I'm still worried about him.

856
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:59,390
No matter how many advantages he has,

857
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,150
if he is a poor player,

858
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,750
he can't

859
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,590
win.

860
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,240
Prime Minister Lin,

861
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,240
you should teach him more.

862
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,710
I'm not good at playing Go.

863
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,310
I'm not as good as you.

864
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,510
No, no.

865
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,450
You are still using this trick

866
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,350
after so many years?

867
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,230
Do you think I don't know

868
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,360
you let me win?

869
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,510
If I'm really better than you at playing Go,

870
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,790
I wouldn't have let you know

871
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,790
I let you win, right?

872
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,030
You...

873
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,760
-You...
-Your Majesty,

874
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,940
do you want to have another round?

875
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,220
Do your best this time.

876
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,990
Okay.

877
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:54,630
Come on.
