It's so cute.

7
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,350
Can you give it to me?

8
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,430
It means a lot to me.

I'll make you another one, okay?

12

It's a deal then.

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,490
It's a deal.

14
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,390

Please don't lose your temper.

22
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,370
Please behave yourself before the imperial edict.

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,110

Fortunately, Han family orphan Mai Sui has been found,

30
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,010

Yes, Your Majesty.

42
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,000
Your Majesty got up before dawn

43

and made this bird's nest porridge yourself.

44
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,030
If His Majesty finds out,

45
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,270

64
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,910
I'm afraid that'd be inappropriate.

66
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,490

to leave with others.

127
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,890
So you want to cut off my wings

128
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,540
and lock me up in the cage you gave me?

129
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,950
What are you talking about?

130
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,070
How could I cut off your wings?

131
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,730
As long as you are willing,

132
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,350
I'll prepare a carriage to send you out of the palace

133
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,390
and let you live in your own mansion.

134
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,490
You don't like all the formalities, right?

135
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,010
Then we won't follow them.

136

But I just have one small request.

137
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,450
I hope

you can stay where I can see you.

139

Well,

151
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,830
I'll ask my men to prepare some good wine and dishes

152
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,710
to welcome you.

153
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,480

Thank you, Your Majesty.

157

His Majesty asked Her Majesty to go to bed.

158
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,730
No need to wait.

159
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,340
Thank you, Mr. Zhang, for coming.

160
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,120
A few days ago,

161
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,980
I sent someone to Xuzhou.

162
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,470
In your name,

163
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,510
he purchased 165 acres of sacrificial land and five courtyards.

164
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,390
Your father and younger brother have been taken there.

165
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,430
They are doing well now.

166
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,670
Don't worry.

167
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,260
I'm not worthy of the Empress' compassion.

168
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,440
I don't know...

169
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
how to repay Your Majesty.

170
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,420
You're His Majesty's right-hand man.

171
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,360
Serving the Emperor with all your heart and soul

172
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,420
would be the greatest reward for me.

173
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,510
That is my duty.

174
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,760
Then why isn't His Majesty here today?

175
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,810
Your Majesty.

176
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,910
His Majesty left the palace just now.

177
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,730
I got it.

178

Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

179
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,490
Thank you.

180
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,780
I'll take my leave.

181
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,090
Fill it up.

182

Guys,

183
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,180
I suggest that we let our Marshal Mai

184
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,170
say a few words.

185
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,880
Alright?

186
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
Okay.

187
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,550
Say a few words.

188
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,720
Fill it up.

189
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,110
All these years,

190
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,280
thank you for taking care of me.

191
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,250
I deeply cherish all our

192
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,910
little memories.

193
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,220
Especially you, Wang Qi.

194
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,860
From now on,

195
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,650
we can't fight together again,

196
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,740
but we brothers

197
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,000
have been through hell together.

198
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,670
You mustn't forget me in the future.

199
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,430
We only follow Marshal Mai.

200
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,510
Yes, we follow Marshal Mai!

201
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,950
Well said.

202
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,070
Follow Marshal Mai. Follow Marshal Mai.

203
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,020
Drink. Drink.

204
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,940
In the south are the trees with curved drooping branches,

205
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,550
with the doliches creepers clinging to them.

206
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,590
Soldiers beat the drum.

207
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,710
-In the south are the trees with curved drooping branches,
-Yes!

208
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,240
with the doliches creepers clinging to them.

209
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,830
The green grass is fresh.

210
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,870
My friend picks it.

211
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,850
Soldiers beat the drum.

212
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,830
It sounds brilliant.

213
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,190
Spears and blades...

214
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

215
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,470
You may leave.

216
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,890
Yes, Your Majesty.

217
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,000
Why didn't you invite me for good food?

218
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,750
Let's sit down and talk.

219
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,090
What are you doing here?

220
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,150
You scared everyone away.

221
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,830
Who will drink with me?

222
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,780
If you really want to drink,

223
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,000
I can accompany you.

224
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,730
I just don't understand.

225
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,650
I've told you everything.

226
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,540
Why are you still avoiding me?

227
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,780
What do you want to say?

228
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,020
I want to say,

229
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,720
you would rather stay in this shitty camp

230
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,960
and hook up with them

231
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,470
than come back to accompany me?

232
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,770
The dog is back.

233
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,390
You're married.

234
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,830
Why are you pestering me?

235
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,240
Why are you pestering me?

236
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,590
Mai, who’s coming back?

237
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,430
No.

238
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,470
Mai.

239
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,710
Who’s back?

240
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,580
Can you make it clear?

241
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,230
Father.

242
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,950
Your Majesty, why are you back?

243
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,810
Father, don't stand on ceremony.

244
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,550
Please.

245
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,930
Please, Your Majesty.

246
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,470
I have something to tell you.

247
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,430
It's not convenient in the palace.

248
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:04,160
Your Majesty, are you worried about the Imperial Honored Consort?

249
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,800
My thoughts

250
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,710
can't escape your wise eyes.

251
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,730
How did a man become a woman?

252
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,690
She's even been conferred the title of consort, yet she lives outside the palace,

253
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,310
worrying His Majesty

254
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,670
and making him leave the palace all the time.

255
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,280
Please make a decision for me, Father.

256
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,320
Your Majesty is still young.

257
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,470
The other concubines haven't entered the palace yet.

258
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,470
That's why you don't know what to do.

259
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,000
It's not difficult.

260
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,870
Since she's outside the palace, it's hard for Your Majesty to exert control.

261
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,190
Why don't you summon her to the palace?

262
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,600
But the Imperial Honored Consort is like a vice Empress

263
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,590
and she's the Emperor's favorite.

264
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,030
His Majesty personally allowed her

265
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,670
to not live in the palace.

266
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,150
My daughter,

267
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,110
you are the Empress.

268
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,950
It's your duty to take charge of the six courts.

269
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,000
So what if she's the Imperial Honored Consort?

270
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,150
With me around,

271
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,330
the position of the Empress will always belong to you and you only.

272
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,080
I understand.

273
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,060
Father, have some tea.

274
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,670
Why is Your Majesty here?

275
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,950
It's late.

276
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,300
You should go back and rest.

277
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,760
I guess

278
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,740
I'll sleep in the Imperial Study tonight.

279
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,500
Your Majesty has so much work.

280
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,990
My heart aches to see it.

281
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,830
I want to share your burden.

282
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,150
But the policy proposals are all about matters of state.

283
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,500
How can Your Majesty share the burden?

284
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,230
As the Empress,

285
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,510
I should shoulder the responsibility of managing the six palaces for you

286
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,630
so that you won't have any worries.

287
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,110
I know you and the Imperial Honored Consort

288
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,550
have known each other since childhood.

289
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,710
You share weal and woe.

290
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,820
I dare not compete.

291
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,310
But Your Majesty is busy with state affairs every day

292
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,710
and you still have to take time to visit the Imperial Honored Consort.

293
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,310
How can you rest well?

294
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,430
You worry too much.

295
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,110
I know what I'm doing.

296
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,030
I'm not trying to meddle in your business.

297
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,550
I just feel sorry for you.

298
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,850
Besides,

299
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,910
since the Imperial Honored Consort belongs to Your Majesty,

300
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,310
she can't stay outside the palace forever.

301
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,750
I'm afraid it's not good for the prince's reputation in the future either.

302
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,750
What do you think?

303
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,830
So, Your Majesty wants to...

304
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,430
I want to borrow someone from Your Majesty.

305
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,110
Okay, I got it.

306
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,790
Miss Xiu'er.

307
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,990
Who are you?

308
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,510
Her Majesty has summoned

309
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,670
Xu Xiu'er to the palace to accompany Her Majesty.

310
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,230
Her Majesty summoned me?

311
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,510
Her Majesty has always enjoyed listening to stories.

312
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,530
She heard that Miss Xiu'er is knowledgeable

313
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,730
so she invited you to the palace to talk.

314
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,710
This is a good thing.

315
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,830
Miss, please.

316
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,550
I have to tell Mai.

317
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,070
Please wait a moment.

318
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,240
Miss, the carriage is waiting outside.

319
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,830
We can't keep Her Majesty waiting.

320
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,310
Come with me.

321
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,150
Marshal Mai.

322
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,540
You're finally back.

323
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,070
Her Majesty sent someone

324
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,070
to summon Miss Xiu'er to the palace!

325
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,090
Miss Xiu'er, your background is rather embarrassing.

326
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,950
So you and Mai

327
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,680
went through so much together.

328
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,340
Yes.

329
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,490
I don’t understand.

330
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,990
You married Mai

331
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,310
to hide her identity as a woman.

332
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,710
Didn't it ever occur to you

333
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,440
that this could ruin your life?

334
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,050
I know.

335
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,490
But I don't regret it.

336
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,590
Miss Xiu'er, you're really admirable.

337
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,960
I like you very much.

338
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,280
I want to make you a court lady

339
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,700
so you can stay by my side.

340
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,550
Would you like to stay with me?

341
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,480
Greetings, Imperial Honored Consort.

342
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,550
Her Majesty sent me here specially to congratulate you...

343
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,480
Where is Xiu'er?

344
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,790
Miss Xiu'er is having tea with Her Majesty.

345
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,290
Here comes the Imperial Honored Consort.

346
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,600
Mai.

347
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,640
Imperial Honored Consort, you came at the right time.

348
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,300
Miss Xiu'er is smart,

349
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,280
educated and well-mannered.

350
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,650
I like her very much.

351
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,090
I just discussed with Miss Xiu'er

352
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,390
to keep her by my side

353
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,350
as a court lady.

354
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,760
I...

355
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,510
Right, Miss Xiu'er?

356
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,340
Your Majesty wants to keep my Xiu'er

357
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,640
in the palace?

358
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,660
Of course.

359
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,370
Since Her Majesty is so enthusiastic,

360
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,350
and you like my Xiu'er so much,

361
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,570
I'll stay, too.

362
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,120
I'm just worried that Xiu'er doesn't know the rules

363
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,040
and accidentally offends the other sisters.

364
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,030
I'll stay and teach her.

365
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,060
I hope Your Majesty won't mind.

366
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,350
Since you're so righteous,

367
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,660
I'm very happy.

368
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,280
Changle Palace has long been...

369
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,750
Xiu'er.

370
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,360
Let’s go.

371
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,510
Mai, you decided to stay?

372
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,070
Your Majesty.

373
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,070
There's one more thing.

374
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,950
Go ahead.

375
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,270
Since His Majesty ascended the throne,

376
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,670
the six palaces have been vacant.

377
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,790
Besides me,

378
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,600
there's only the Imperial Honored Consort.

379
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,500
I'm afraid that's inappropriate.

380
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Why not?

381
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,230
Your Majesty has a lot of work.

382
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,750
Naturally, you have no time to worry about these trivial matters.

383
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,190
As the Empress,

384
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,070
it's my duty to spread the seeds of the royal family.

385
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,380
That's why I selected a few women

386
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,590
from the noble families

387
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,230
and invited them to the palace.

388
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,290
Your Majesty, do you want to see them?

389
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,190
I don't think

390
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,990
I need to see them.

391
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,950
Their names and titles.

392
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,970
Your Majesty, please decide.

393
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,750
I don't care about that.

394
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,390
It's up to you.

395
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,060
I don't know why

396
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,470
but I’ve been so annoyed these days.

397
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,200
What has Changle Palace been up to these days?

398
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,990
I heard that she's still practicing punching and kicking

399
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,100
with Prince Qi Yu every day.

400
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,160
She hasn't even left the palace much.

401
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,800
What time is it now?

402
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,950
Your Majesty,

403
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,510
it's just past nine.

404
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,710
Go take a look.

405
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,730
If the chestnut cake is ready,

406
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,720
send it to His Majesty personally.

407
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,430
Yes.

408
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,120
Your Majesty is so considerate of His Majesty.

409
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

410
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,230
Her Majesty is worried that Your Majesty

411
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,970
would miss your morning meal due to court affairs

412
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,190
so she ordered someone to make

413
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,590
these chestnut cakes that are easy to digest.

414
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,270
Put it down.

415
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,240
What?

416
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,970
Do you have something else to say?

417
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,710
Yes.

418
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,230
Her Majesty said

419
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,510
since Your Majesty ascended the throne,

420
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,230
you've been busy with state affairs every day.

421
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,470
Your Majesty, please prioritize your health.

422
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,310
Only then will the kingdom endure.

423
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,680
If Your Majesty is free,

424
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,280
why don't you visit the harem?

425
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,150
Even if it's to talk to Her Majesty

426
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,910
or the other new concubines,

427
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,220
you can relieve your fatigue.

428
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,230
I see.

429
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,560
You can leave.

430
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

431
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,270
Her Majesty is right.

432
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,510
It's time for me to rest.

433
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,510
[Be diligent and virtuous]

434
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,830
[Be diligent and virtuous]

435
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,990
Xing, who is she?

436
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,390
Young Master,

437
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,470
that is Consort Ning.

438
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,510
I don't like her.

439
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,570
Xing, come with me.

440
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,590
I'm so mad.

441
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,070
I was kind enough to teach the Imperial Honored Consort the manners of the court.

442
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,990
Yet, she responded by scolding me.

443
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,510
How dare the Imperial Honored Consort humiliate you in public?

444
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,760
If it were me,

445
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,290
I would ask Her Majesty to seek justice for me.

446
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,910
Who was that? Who hit me?

447
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:02,630
Who's that?

448
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,760
Who is hiding there?

449
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,710
Guards!

450
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,830
Qi Yu?

451
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,880
Mai.

452
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,350
I heard them say

453
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,910
Prince Qi Yu was flogged.

454
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,830
Flogged?

455
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,530
What's the matter?

456
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,250
Let's go and have a look.

457
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,810
Young Master.

458
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,910
Let Xing take a look

459
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,070
and apply some medicine, okay?

460
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,920
No, it hurts.

461
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,150
You can't recover without the medicine.

462
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:31,990
Master.

463
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,910
What happened?

464
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,270
I was practicing with my slingshot in the Imperial Garden.

465
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,110
I accidentally missed

466
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,630
and almost hurt someone.

467
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,090
You deserve it.

468
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,550
Who told you to practice your slingshot there?

469
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,750
Master, I know I was wrong.

470
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,530
Don't think you can stop practicing

471
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,530
just because you've been hit twice.

472
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,930
Don't be late

473
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,550
for your class tomorrow morning.

474
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,870
Master, don't look!

475
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,120
Who hit you?

476
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,740
It's all my fault.

477
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,310
I said, who hit him?

478
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,990
I-I-It was the chief executor of Kunning Palace.

479
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:15,990
Don't be rash.

480
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,170
I know what I'm doing.

481
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,500
Stay and take care of Yu.

482
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,780
Prince Qi Yu is just a child.

483
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,170
Why did he

484
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,800
use his slingshot in the Imperial Garden?

485
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,640
Someone must be behind this.

486
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,720
Who do you think

487
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,490
is behind this?

488
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,410
After thinking about it,

489
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,110
I only offended the Imperial Honored Consort.

490
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,560
Besides, she's the one who taught

491
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,020
Prince Qi Yu martial arts.

492
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,610
Besides her...

493
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,020
You're talking about me?

494
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,310
Hello, ladies.

495
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,240
What are you doing?

496
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,260
How dare you disrespect me?

497
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,240
Do you know the court etiquette?

498
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,200
No, I don't understand.

499
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,550
Qi Yu is a kid.

500
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,560
Why are you taking it out on him?

501
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,310
How could you do that?

502
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,400
I'm asking you a question.

503
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,910
How could you do that?

504
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,200
Imperial Honored Consort.

505
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,030
In the palace...

506
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,630
Louder. I can't hear you.

507
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,790
Qi Yu was armed and wounded someone in the palace.

508
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,720
What did you say?

509
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,320
As the Empress,

510
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,590
and his aunt,

511
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,260
I had reason to discipline him strictly.

512
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,880
Otherwise, he'll grow up to be arrogant

513
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,680
and he'll be in trouble.

514
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,260
Look, I forgot.

515
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,350
You are Qi Yu's aunt.

516
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,900
I don't have an aunt. Don't blame me.

517
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,570
Because I didn't know

518
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,660
this is how it feels to be an aunt.

519
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,330
What are you trying to hide?

520
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,480
Aren't you after me?

521
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,800
Don't make it hard for the child.

522
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,030
Listen,

523
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,030
If you dare to touch my people

524
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,390
or Qi Yu again,

525
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,300
just wait and see.

526
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,650
Your Majesty!

527
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,550
Your Majesty!

528
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,470
-Your Majesty.
-Call the imperial physician!

529
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,430
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

530
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,310
Your Majesty!

531
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,950
Your Majesty.

532
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:01,050
The Imperial Honored Consort caused Her Majesty to faint from anger.

533
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,880
What are you talking about?

534
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,460
Can you make it clear?

535
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,430
Just now, the Imperial Honored Consort rushed into Kunning Palace

536
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,650
and contradicted the Empress

537
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,870
in front of the other concubines.

538
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,270
Now Kunning Palace

539
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,920
is a mess because of the Imperial Honored Consort.

540
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,160
In the end, Her Majesty passed out.

541
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,310
If you're not going to tell the truth,

542
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,910
you're going to have to go out and get punished.

543
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,270
Your Majesty, I dare not lie.

544
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,750
The cause

545
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,720
was Prince Qi Yu

546
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,140
who was unruly and pranked a few consorts.

547
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,150
Her Majesty punished Prince Qi Yu according to the rules.

548
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,810
She didn't do anything wrong.

549
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,800
But after the Imperial Honored Consort found out,

550
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,670
she...

551
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,830
she...

552
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,590
She's still so protective of children.

553
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,240
Let's go.

554
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,640
Let's go and see the Empress.

555
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

556
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,590
Greetings, Your Majesty.

557
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,750
Please rise.

558
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,150
Thank you, Your Majesty.

559
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,670
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

560
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,620
Her Majesty has been pregnant for more than a month.

561
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,350
Pregnant?

562
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,150
Yes.

563
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,989
The palace is so boring.

564
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,030
Greetings, Imperial Honored Consort.

565
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:34,850
Her Majesty instructed that

566
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,949
from today onwards,

567
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,429
visits from the six palaces are suspended.

568
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,590
If there's nothing important,

569
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,100
you can't enter Kunning Palace without permission.

570
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,230
This is to prevent disturbing Her Majesty's pregnancy.

571
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,730
I have to take care of Her Majesty.

572
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,940
Please excuse me.

573
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,070
Mai.

574
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,630
Mai.

575
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,070
Mai.

576
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,550
I’m fine.

577
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,420
It's good that Her Majesty is pregnant.

578
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,810
She won't have time to trouble us.

579
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,820
Once Yu recovers,

580
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,400
I'll take you out of the palace.

581
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,750
Is His Majesty here?

582
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,280
Imperial Honored Consort.

583
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,550
Imperial Honored Consort.

584
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,350
You can't go any further.

585
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,790
Leave us.

586
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,070
Your Majesty.

587
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:23,950
You may leave.

588
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,910
Yes.

589
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,760
Mai.

590
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,330
You've come to your senses. You're willing to see me now?

591
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,060
Do you have time, Your Majesty?

592
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,570
Yes.

593
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,520
Actually, I've been thinking a lot lately.

594
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,400
I keep having strange feelings

595
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,380
but I don't know

596
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,510
what's wrong.

597
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,470
I think everything here

598
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,920
isn't for me.

599
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,660
How should I put it?

600
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,040
I don't just mean this place.

601
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,630
I mean...

602
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,830
The life I'm living now,

603
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,830
it doesn't belong to the current me.

604
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,940
Do you understand what I'm saying?

605
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,520
You're leaving?

606
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,990
I came here today

607
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,500
to say goodbye.

608
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,790
Take care.

609
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,850
Take care of yourself.

610
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,470
Mai.

611
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,560
What can I do

612
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,990
to make you stay?

613
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,970
♫Autumn feelings linger, how empty it is♫

614
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:02,330
♫Apricot flowers fall, and people still gather♫

615
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,560
♫Many partings in this world♫

616
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,900
♫Unintentional acquaintance, fateful encounter♫

617
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:18,960
♫Several rounds of sorrow with the bright moon♫

618
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,270
I was born here

619
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,260
♫Moon is in sight, but the person is distant♫

620
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,870
but I'm not meant to be here.

621
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,960
♫Walking slowly, I've long♫

622
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,720
I don't want to fight against fate.

623
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,020
♫Forgotten his appearance♫

624
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,070
Because only when I see these scars

625
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,470
do I know who I am.

626
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,340
♫Recalling the joy and sorrow between us♫

627
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,280
I'm Han Maisui.

628
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,890
♫How many laughs and tears did we once own?♫

629
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
I should be where I'm supposed to be.

630
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,910
♫In the vast sea of people♫

631
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,160
♫My thoughts are like vast smoke♫

632
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,110
♫Endless pursuit with bitterness♫

♫Recalling the joy and sorrow between us♫

638
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,950
Go, then.

639
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,820
♫How many laughs and tears did we once own?♫

640
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,000

647
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,240
Your Majesty, do you want to wash up?

648
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,900
All of you, leave.

649
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,340
Yes.

650
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,610
Your Majesty, news from the palace gate.

651
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,790
Early this morning,

652
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,830
the Imperial Honored Consort left the palace with Miss Xiu'er.

653
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,760
Left the palace?

654
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,150
What for?

655
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,580
I've sent someone to inquire.

656
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,170
Last night, the Imperial Honored Consort

657
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,770
entered the Imperial Study.

658
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,150
Why did she go to the Imperial Study?

659
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,310
The people in the Imperial Study

660
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,040
were all kicked out last night.

661
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,750
I couldn't find out anything.

662
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,870
But the Imperial Honored Consort left

663
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:53,730
within an hour.

664
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,220
Fine.

665
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,440
My top priority now

666
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,820
is to keep my baby safe.

667
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,970
I have no time

668
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,100
to worry about other things.

669
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,320
It's good that you think so, Your Majesty.

670
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,150
Please lie down.

671
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,880
Your Highness, sorry for being late.

672
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,450
Please rise, Marquis Zhongyong.

673
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,850
Your Highness.

674
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,960
How have you been?

675
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,470
Your Grace, you came from afar,

676
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,470
you must be tired.

677
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,270
Rest early today

678
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,280
and talk to His Highness later?

679
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,230
It's fine.

680
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,360
I need to visit His Majesty too.

681
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,590
Your Grace, I know

682
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,840
you care about the old emperor and his grandson.

683
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,360
But we are under a different rule now.

684
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,760
It's taboo

685
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,250
for you to do this.

686
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,530
Don't be afraid, Your Highness.

687
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,370
I won’t make things difficult for you.

688
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,820
Marquis Zhongyong came to the Crown Prince's Mansion

689
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,750
and went in

690
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,070
without even saying hello.

691
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,690
I was left out there alone

692
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,090
feeling so awkward.

693
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,440
Your Majesty, look.

694
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,460
His gift to Prince Qi Yu

695
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,800
is ten times more than what he gave you.

696
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,750
Let me ask you.

697
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,030
When you were little,

698
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,760
did you eat, drink and play too?

699
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,350
Why are you comparing yourself to a kid?

700
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,400
Alright.

701
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:27,510
Leave.

702
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,520
Your Majesty,

703
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,630
although what he said just now

704
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,070
may be petty,

705
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,950
but it's got some truth in it.

706
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,350
Sir, please go ahead.

707
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,990
In everyone's hearts,

708
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,190
the Emperor's throne

709
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,750
was stolen from Prince Qi Yu.

710
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:59,420
The late emperor

711
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,310
publicly recognized you as the emperor before his death.

712
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,150
But I heard that there has been rumors in the court

713
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,150
that in time,

714
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,550
it'll be possible to use Prince Qi Yu

715
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,270
to revolt against Your Majesty.
