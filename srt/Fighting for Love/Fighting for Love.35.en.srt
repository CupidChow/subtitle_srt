[Episode 35]

4
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,110
You should... listen to the officials

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,430
and be a good emperor.

6
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,670
Mother.

7
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,070
Mother!

8
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,390
Mother!

9
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:10,990
Mother!

10
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,230
Empress Dowager.

11
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,430
Mother.

12
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,950
Mother!

13
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,200
Your Majesty,

14
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,230
you still need to handle court affairs.

15
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,590
For the sake of the people,

16
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,590
please don't be too sad.

17
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,990
Lords,

18
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,710
His Majesty is so sad

19
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,680
that he can't handle court affairs.

20
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,230
Please understand.

21
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,470
I will be with His Majesty for the next few days.

22
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,920
Everyone, go home.

23
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,310
It's against the rules

24
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,990
that an adult prince lives in the palace.

25
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,050
I am His Majesty's biological uncle.

26
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,829
It's during the national days of mourning.

27
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,490
Why can't I live in the palace?

28
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,150
You may leave.

29
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,310
Okay.

30
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,220
What time is it now?

31
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,150
Your Majesty,

32
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,720
it's just past 9:30 a.m.

33
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,790
Imperial Honored Consort hasn't come to the palace for a few days.

34
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,790
What has she been busy with?

35
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,590
Your Majesty,

36
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,850
Imperial Honored Consort hasn't come to see you for five days.

37
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,690
She went for a horse ride in the suburbs today.

38
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,910
Who went with her?

39
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,040
It's...

40
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,150
It's...

41
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,030
It's General Tang.

42
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,590
Tang Shaoyi.

43
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,190
Go deliver a message.

44
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,070
Ask Imperial Honored Consort to see me.

45
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,930
It's been a long time since we enjoyed horse riding.

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,950
How are you feeling, Mai?

48
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,670
You've been reinstated

49
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,960
and you've got your ancestral house back.

50
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,360
You are happy now, right?

51
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,000
What?

52
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,480
You are still not satisfied?

53
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,470
Tell me if you want anything else.

54
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,720
I'll go to him again.

55
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,350
Prime Minister Lin asked me to see him in prison

56
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,680
before he was executed.

57
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,200
Why did he ask you there?

58
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,630
He said His Majesty has conspired with Chen Qi.

59
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,830
Impossible.

60
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,990
Everyone knows

61
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,920
you holds a grudge against Chen Qi.

62
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,230
Why would Shang Yizhi collude with him?

63
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,909
Could it be like this?

64
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,630
That old man failed in the rebellion.

65
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,290
So he wanted to use you to overthrow Shang Yizhi.

66
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:46,909
No.

67
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,670
No.

68
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,950
He's already dead.

69
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,310
If this is his purpose,

70
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,370
it is not good for his daughter at all.

71
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,310
Let me think about it again.

72
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,110
Brother Tang.

73
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,450
You believe it?

74
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,140
It doesn't matter.

75
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,030
Considering the current situation,

76
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,670
we'd better stay put.

77
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,140
Don't believe anyone.

78
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,600
You can only believe me.

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,520
Do you hear me?

80
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,740
Marshal Mai,

81
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,110
His Majesty wants to see you.

82
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,710
Me?

83
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,480
Go take a look first.

84
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's go.

85
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,590
Imperial Honored Consort is here.

86
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,130
Greetings, Your Majesty.

87
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,310
How many times have I told you?

88
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,440
You don't have to do this in front of me.

89
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,470
You may leave.

90
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:57,990
Okay.

91
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,430
Right.

92
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,190
I prepared a gift for you.

93
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,280
Open it

94
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,910
and see if you like it.

95
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,950
I don't like it.

96
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,550
You haven't even seen it yet. Why are you saying you don't like it?

97
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,450
The nine-head hairpin

98
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,480
is for the empress.

99
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,560
You know clearly

100
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,300
the current empress is not the one I want.

101
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,150
I just had no choice.

102
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,590
In other words,

103
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,950
if you're mad at me because of this,

104
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,440
we can

105
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,350
depose her immediately.

106
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,310
If you are still mad,

107
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,310
when we wake up tomorrow,

108
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,790
we can discuss a solution.

109
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,200
We can even kill her.

110
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,270
If I wear it,

111
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,500
will I be the next one to be killed?

112
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,160
Mai, you know clearly what I mean.

113
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,310
As long as you change your mind,

114
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,710
I can do whatever you say.

115
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,830
If you

116
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,070
don't like

117
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,430
those women in the harem,

118
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,230
we can kill them all.

119
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,760
I believe it's something you would do.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,260
I also believe that you're really crazy.

121
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,350
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

122
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,750
If there's nothing else important,

123
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,770
I'll take my leave.

124
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:38,950
Stop.

125
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,610
You won't marry me.

126
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
Is it because of Tang Shaoyi?

127
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,960
Or Chang Yuqing?

128
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,240
Do you want to kill them too?

129
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,670
You're right.

130
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,230
If you really have feelings for someone else,

131
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,430
I'll kill them all.

132
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,550
Listen,

133
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,030
I don't allow you to touch my men.

134
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,190
Understand?

135
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,790
Let me ask you.

136
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,440
Do you still love me?

137
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,920
It was over between us long ago.

138
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,640
Someone.

139
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

140
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,510
Take Imperial Honored Consort to Changle Palace.

141
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,450
Yes, Your Majesty.

142
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,310
You want to put me under house arrest?

143
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,309
You're right.

144
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,230
It was over between us long ago.

145
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,750
So,

146
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,990
it takes time to develop a relationship.

147
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,710
Good.

148
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,630
I haven't seen His Majesty so happy for a long time.

149
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,550
Your Highness, you are impressive.

150
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,880
If His Majesty is happy,

151
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,350
we officials

152
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,150
can be happy too.

153
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,920
Marshal Chen, you came to the palace today

154
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,350
still for attacking Nanxia, right?

155
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,310
I submitted a memorial five days ago.

156
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,700
But I don't know why the Cabinet hasn't submitted it.

157
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,910
The opportunity for combat is rare, and we can't delay it.

158
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,310
Your Highness, can you give me some advice?

159
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,270
Those old men in the Cabinet

160
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,280
only know how to get in the way.

161
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,790
They know nothing about opportunities for combat.

162
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,520
They just focus on the competition for their benefits in the court.

163
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,230
But I'm curious.

164
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,400
Marshal Chen, you've insisted on launching an attack in the court.

165
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,990
Why

166
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,750
are you so confident?

167
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,830
Nanxia just went through a riot.

168
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,650
Now is the best time to gain benefits.

169
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,830
Marshal Chen, if you are giving me this empty talk,

170
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,610
there will be nothing I can do to help you.

171
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,710
I'm not giving you empty talk.

172
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,370
To win a battle,

173
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,950
the right time, right place, and right people are necessary.

174
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,520
The weather is nice now.

175
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,120
It's not snowing or raining.

176
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,680
It's the right time.

177
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,030
Nanxia has complicated internal affairs.

178
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,030
They don't have time for other things.

179
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,230
It's the right place.

180
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,750
What about the right people?

181
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,800
If you know both the enemy and yourself,

182
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,600
you can fight 100 battles with no danger of defeat.

183
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,730
I can definitely

184
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,790
win this war.

185
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,850
What's the use of keeping you?

186
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,390
Calm down, Your Majesty.

187
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,510
Except Han Maisui, is there no one else in Nanxia

188
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,910
who can lead an army on the battlefield?

189
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,920
You want a woman to fight on the battlefield.

190
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,470
I feel ashamed for you.

191
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,750
With all due respect,

192
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,990
it's not that Nanxia has no one else to lead an army.

193
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,070
It's just that only Marshal Mai

194
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,020
can command the Zhenbei Army smoothly.

195
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,820
That's right.

196
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,890
Chen Qi is coming back to attack us again.

197
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,910
No one else knows his tactics better than Marshal Mai.

198
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,710
Your Majesty,

199
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,110
this concerns our country. It's very important.

200
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,830
We can't afford any mistakes.

201
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,170
Prime Minister Xu,

202
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,700
can't you say something?

203
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,530
If you won't let Marshal Mai go,

204
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,440
we will go to the border

205
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,070
and never return to Shengdu.

206
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,400
We don't want to take the blame for endangering the country.

207
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,910
Now I understand.

208
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,750
You all are threatening me, right?

209
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,860
We dare not.

210
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,710
Your Majesty,

211
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,810
we are facing a war. We can't delay it any longer.

212
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,070
Let her go.

213
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,390
What brings you here?

214
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,490
The Beimo Army is on its way to Jingyang Pass.

215
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,430
And Jingyang is of great importance to us.

216
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,670
If we lose it,

217
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,270
I'm afraid we'll be in danger.

218
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,230
Everyone said only Mai

219
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,770
can protect Jingyang.

220
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,070
So...

221
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm a citizen of Nanxia.

222
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,270
Now that the enemy is coming,

223
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,040
how can I just sit by and do nothing in Shengdu?

224
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,950
I'll go.

225
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,590
Get up.

226
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,440
Give me the Tiger Tally.

227
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,230
Right.

228
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
After you set off,

229
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,920
don't worry too much.

230
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,280
I've asked the Huainan Army

231
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,070
to send an elite troop there in advance.

232
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,590
They will protect you.

233
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,750
Thank you, Your Majesty.

234
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,990
Marshal.

235
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,590
Why haven't you sent troops yet?

236
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,270
The army has been encamping here for seven or eight days.

237
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,070
The good weather on the day before yesterday was rare.

238
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,000
It was the most suitable for a raid.

239
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,510
Marshal, why wouldn't you send troops?

240
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,900
Marshal,

241
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,230
Nanxia's army has arrived in Jingyang.

242
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,030
The leader

243
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,290
is Marshal Han Maisui.

244
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,950
Report!

245
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,680
Marshal Mai,

246
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,390
Chen Qi's army is 5 km away.

247
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,510
Go collect more information.

248
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:12,990
Okay.

249
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,440
Why haven't the reinforcements arrived here yet?

250
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,030
They will be here. Wait a little longer.

251
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,920
It's getting dark.

252
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,470
The war is about to start.

253
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,040
We have to stop Chen Qi in advance.

254
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,170
Or it'll be too late.

255
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:33,750
Mai.

256
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,360
Let's go.

257
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,200
Let's go.

258
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,090
Okay.

259
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,750
General,

260
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,960
I found this outside the tent

261
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,890
when I took over the shift just now.

262
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,440
[Come to Yuelai Inn in the city at 5 p.m. today]

263
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,520
[Come to Yuelai Inn in the city at 5 p.m. today]

264
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,340
Don't tell anyone else.

265
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,310
You may leave.

266
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,050
Mai,

267
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,600
I don't want to fight with you on the battlefield.

268
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,230
I managed to take over Jingyang Pass once.

269
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,890
I can take over the city again.

270
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,990
You can't

271
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,800
win this battle.

272
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,470
There's no need to cause more casualties.

273
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,530
Take your soldiers

274
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,230
and leave Jingyang City.

275
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,230
Are you afraid?

276
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,829
I'm thinking for you.

277
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,630
I have spies everywhere in the city.

278
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,510
And there are explosives everywhere in the city.

279
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,770
You have no choice now.

280
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,109
[Yuelai Inn]

281
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,910
You're despicable.

282
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,450
All is fair in war.

283
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,990
I taught you this.

284
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,590
Have you forgotten?

285
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,390
Chen Qi,

286
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,470
can you spare the people in Jingyang City?

287
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,330
It's time for you to make a choice.

288
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,720
Mai,

289
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,550
leave this to me.

290
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,010
You go back to the city now.

291
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,310
What are you waiting for?

292
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,600
Wang Qi, Erdan, listen.

293
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,870
Go back to the city with Mai.

294
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,230
Okay.

295
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,730
Okay.

296
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,480
Go now!

297
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,070
Guys,

298
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,920
protect Jingyang City.

299
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,520
Defeat Beimo people.

300
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,400
Charge!

301
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,750
Charge!

302
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,750
Charge!

303
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,630
Charge!

304
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,430
-Charge!
-Kill!

305
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,240
Sir,

306
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,230
the explosion happened inside.

307
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,370
Be careful, everyone.

308
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,460
Marshal Mai,

309
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,500
it's so dark here.

310
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,800
We need to light it up.

311
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,310
Light it up now.

312
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,320
Luckily, I brought a flint.

313
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,650
Don't light a fire.

314
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,530
Why not?

315
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,430
The explosion was caused by the flour.

316
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,270
Flour can cause an explosion?

317
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,880
Aren't flour used to make steamed buns?

318
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,680
That's right.

319
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,420
When the dust mixture reaches a certain concentration,

320
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,340
a single spark can cause an explosion.

321
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,030
Oh my God.

322
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,470
Boss.

323
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,390
Yes.

324
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,890
How many granaries are there

325
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,590
for storing flour in Jingyang City?

326
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,310
Three.

327
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,070
Oh no.

328
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:51,950
Wang Qi, Erdan.

329
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,610
Yes.

330
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,920
The three of us will go look for these granaries respectively.

331
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,030
Remember not to light a fire.

332
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,470
Evacuate the people nearby.

333
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,630
And pass my order.

334
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,750
Capture all the spies in the city.

335
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,030
Don't let any of them escape.

336
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,420
Okay.

337
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,390
Let's go.

338
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:03,950
Let's go.

339
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,810
Come on. Stand up.

340
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,630
Deputy Marshal Tang,

341
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,510
why haven't our reinforcements arrived yet?

342
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,630
Let's retreat.

343
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,750
What are you talking about?

344
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,680
We have to guard this place even if we are going to die.

345
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,060
Mai,

346
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,910
I'll drink with you in the next life.

347
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,950
Wait here.

348
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,830
Okay.

349
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,080
Come out.

350
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,320
Why are you here?

351
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,970
Chen Qi asked you to come here, right?

352
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,980
How do you know?

353
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,940
I received a letter

354
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,790
with the token I gave you.

355
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,850
Don't worry too much.

356
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,710
I've asked the Huainan Army

357
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,190
to send an elite troop there in advance.

358
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,240
Chen Qi's army is 5 km away.

359
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,790
Why haven't the reinforcements arrived yet?

360
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,110
Where is the pass...

361
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,900
the love token Chang Yuqing gave you

362
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,650
when he left?

363
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:09,820
Marshal Mai.

364
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,630
Marshal Mai.

365
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,430
Both granaries are under control.

366
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,710
Yes.

367
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,750
We've been tricked.

368
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,680
-Report!
-What?

369
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,470
Marshal Mai,

370
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,570
Deputy Marshal Tang...

371
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,760
died in the battle.

372
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,730
Mai,

373
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,250
why don't we

374
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,020
become sworn brothers here?

375
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,830
Okay.

376
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,660
After you and I gain some military merits,

377
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,470
we'll retire

378
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,640
and go to the countryside.

379
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,400
I'll get you a wife.

380
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,630
One is not enough.

381
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,640
I'll get you eight or 10 wives.

382
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,720
Do you know what it means to be a soldier

383
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,450
and what a battlefield means?

384
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,630
If one day,

385
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,760
I die in a battle against Beimo,

386
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,830
Brother Tang, can you help me collect my body?

387
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,310
Brother Tang,

388
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,950
you don't have to stand on ceremony.

389
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,460
You could have told me if you have no money.

390
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,290
You don't even have decent clothes.

391
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,510
I searched everywhere but only found these two sets.

392
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,250
Forget it.

393
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,780
Just make do with them.

394
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,870
I'll burn them for you after I buy you new clothes.

395
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,350
If you see me like a sissy,

396
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,830
you would laugh at me again.

397
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,120
You said after we defeat Beimo people,

398
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,860
you'll retire.

399
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,220
You'll go home, get married, and have 10 children.

400
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,690
You took care of me

401
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,700
and thought for me.

402
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,320
But I...

403
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,160
I failed to protect you.

404
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,970
You promised me

405
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,190
if I die on the battlefield one day,

406
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,350
you'll help me collect my body.

407
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,050
Why did you die before me?

408
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,680
Do you remember this? During the battle at Yelanggou,

409
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,070
I was seriously injured.

410
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,660
You came and made a pair of crutches for me.

411
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,270
Without the crutches,

412
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,610
I would have been covered with lice.

413
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,790
It's a long way.

414
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,270
You need something to protect yourself.

415
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,270
Thank you.

416
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,430
I made you a pair of crutches.

417
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,490
It's inevitable for soldiers to get hurt.

418
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,040
But you must learn to protect yourself.

419
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,750
Brother Tang,

420
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,540
are you going to take this sword with you too?

421
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,110
Leave something for me, okay?

422
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,770
Brother Tang,

423
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,150
I'll take your silence as a yes.

424
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,820
I'll keep this sword.

425
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,770
You took care of me.

426
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,300
How should I repay you?

427
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,570
Marshal Mai,

428
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,120
Prime Minister Xu wants to see you.

429
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:57,680
Marshal Mai.

430
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,530
Do something for me.

431
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,210
Prime Minister Xu,

432
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,790
Marshal Mai... asked me to escort you back to Shengdu.

433
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,230
Your Majesty,

434
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,429
I didn't see Marshal Mai.

435
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,070
But I saw that the soldiers of the Zhenbei Army

436
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:49,110
are wearing their armor day and night

437
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,370
and the saddles are always on the horses.

438
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:52,920
The Zhenbei Army

439
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,710
is still brave and battlewise.

440
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,750
But you are no longer the marshal of the Zhenbei Army.

441
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,070
I am the emperor.

442
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,030
A virtuous man does not stand next to a wall about to collapse,

443
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,520
let alone an emperor.

444
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,430
Your Majesty,

445
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,040
the Zhenbei Army is ready for battle.

446
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,710
Shouldn't we be wary of them?

447
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,960
Your Majesty.

448
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,960
According to the guards at the city gate,

449
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,300
Wang Qi led a batch of elite soldiers of the Zhenbei Army

450
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,960
to escort Qi Yu out of Shengdu.

451
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,780
What?

452
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,710
Also,

453
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,340
the Huainan Army reported

454
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,150
the Zhenbei Army has crossed Wanjiang River and is coming southward.

455
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,950
They'll arrive in Shengdu soon.

456
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,080
Mai is…

457
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:44,080
[The Zhenbei Army]

458
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,040
Marshal Mai,

459
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,920
he's here.

460
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,670
Mai,

461
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,750
Wang Qi said you want to take me away.

462
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,230
Do you want to leave with me?

463
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,110
Yes.

464
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,010
Stay in the camp first.

465
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,760
We'll leave in a few days.

466
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,700
Yu,

467
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,160
you'll live with me from now on.

468
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,190
Xing,

469
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,190
let's go play.

470
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,640
Except Shengdu City,

471
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,550
I've never been anywhere else.

472
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,700
Think about what we should bring.

473
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,700
We'll leave soon.

474
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,730
I'm not very smart.

475
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,030
Why don't you think about it first?

476
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,870
I want to stay here and talk to Marshal Mai.

477
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,110
Well... Okay.

478
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,590
Come quickly.

479
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,550
I can't carry anything on my own.

480
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,310
Do you want to ride a horse with me?

481
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,110
Okay.

482
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,810
We're leaving.

483
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,950
Let me take you to see them riding a horse.

484
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,470
Okay.

485
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,470
On behalf of the crown prince and the crown princess,

486
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,870
I thank you, Marshal Mai.

487
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,110
If it weren't for you,

488
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,310
I'm afraid Young Master

489
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,990
would be put under house arrest in Shengdu City for the rest of his life

490
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,250
and die of depression.

491
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,910
I'm Yu's teacher.

492
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,630
It's my duty to take care of him.

493
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,670
But...

494
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,980
there is one more thing I'm still worried about.

495
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,720
Go ahead.

496
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,960
Will His Majesty

497
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,830
let him go?

498
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,240
Don't worry about this.

499
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,390
Your Majesty,

500
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,390
the soothing incense brought from the mansion has been used up.

501
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,950
I asked someone to make it long ago,

502
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,280
but they just couldn't make the correct formula.

503
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,650
It has been used up?

504
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,750
Your Majesty,

505
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,350
if you still can't sleep well tonight,

506
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,670
how about...

507
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,110
asking Doctor Du to come to take a look at you?

508
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,790
What's the point?

509
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,310
Now,

510
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,950
I suddenly can understand

511
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,230
how the late emperor felt.

512
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,630
Remove it.

513
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,820
Protect... Protect His Majesty!

514
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,470
Mai.

515
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,710
I can't believe you colluded with Chen Qi

516
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,770
and planted spies for him in the army.

517
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,760
Die!

518
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,390
Your Majesty.

519
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,990
All branches of the Zhenbei Army

520
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,250
have gathered together 5 km from Shengdu City in the north.

521
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,510
Marshal Mai,

522
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,080
someone came to deliver an imperial edict again.

523
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,140
I've detained him.

524
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,260
Is the content still the same?

525
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,630
Yes.

526
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,480
But this time, his attitude has softened a lot.

527
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,070
He asked the Zhenbei Army

528
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,630
to go back to Qingzhou

529
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
and stop marching towards Shengdu.

530
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,590
But he said you

531
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,190
can take the generals and lieutenants of the Zhenbei Army

532
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,350
to the palace to receive rewards.

533
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,810
He is more generous this time.

534
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,850
He allows me to bring 200 more people.

535
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,600
I only passed three cities,

536
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,780
but he has issued six imperial edicts anxiously.

537
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,500
When I arrive in Shengdu,

538
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,410
do you think there will still be space

539
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,120
in our military tent to detain his men?

540
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,260
Marshal Mai,

541
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,430
how should we deal with the imperial edict?

542
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,310
As usual.

543
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,670
Okay.
