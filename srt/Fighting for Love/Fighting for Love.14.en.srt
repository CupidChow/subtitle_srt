Let's go.

6
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,150
Go.

Mai.

8
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,060
Except a few fire pits we found,

9
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,520
we can't find any tracks.

10
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,420
Brother.

11
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,200
look up.

12
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,910
Look at the branches.

13
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,540
They are so dense.

14
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,800
Look over there.

15
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,780
It's bald.

16
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,750
They cut down the branches

17
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,590
and tied them behind the heavy truck

18
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,950
to erase all traces.

19
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,440
I know the direction.

20
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,600
Come with me.

21
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,670
Mai.

22
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,540
Where did you learn all this?

23
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,180
I like to study tactics.

24
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,710
If you'd like,

25
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,510
we can discuss it together when we get back to the camp.

26
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,070
Okay.

27
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,150
It is worth bringing you along.

28
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,630
Looks like this is the military camp of the Beimo Army.

29
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,990
Mai.

30
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,010

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,590
are kind in nature.

33
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,110
Their natures are much the same.

Are you okay?

38
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,790
I'm fine.

39
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,310

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,630

The Beimo Army is invading south.

45
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,070
I'm afraid some spies might sneak into Shengdu.

46
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,520
I’m ordered to guard Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

47
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,870
No one is allowed to go in and out.

48
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,300

49
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,910

Greetings, Mr. Xu.

53
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,710
What happened?

54
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,990
Sir,

55
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,310
I’m ordered to deliver the message to you.

56
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,510
Marquis Dingnan's Mansion has been surrounded by the imperial guards.

57
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,630
Princess Shenghua seems to be under house arrest.

58
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,430
His Majesty has ordered Young Marquis to return to Shengdu.

59
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,710
I'm afraid the imperial edict will arrive soon.

60
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,909
It's very dangerous.

61
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,670
Please ask Young Marquis to leave

62
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,270
to avoid emperor's special envoy.

63
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,390
I understand.

64
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,110
Let's go.

65
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,990
Brother, I'm not going.

66
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,150
Why not?

67
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,390
You found the military camp of the Beimo Army.

68
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,590
That's meritorious.

69
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,830
Isn't this the mission Mr. Xu assigned you?

70
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,550

77
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,860
Keep acting up.

78
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,640
Why did you stop?

79
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,880
Leaving the camp without permission?

80
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,850
You are getting bolder.

81
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,790
Pull him up.

82
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,040
Get up.

83
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,790
Same to you.

84
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,850
You're not bad either.

85
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,880
What do you mean?

86
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,380
I guess you haven’t reported it.

87
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,790
Otherwise, it's the patrol camp waiting for me.

88
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,670
If others know there is a deserter in the Eighth Squad,

89
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,030
I will be embarrassed.

90
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,080
If I were a deserter,

91
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,750
I wouldn't have come back to you.

92
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:42,470
Enough.

93
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,190
I don't think you're talented,

94
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,230
but you're the best at making excuses.

95
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,030
Take him away.

96
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,750
Wait.

97
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,900
You don't like me.

98
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,520
Why are you talking so much?

99
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,600
Why am I talking so much?

100
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,150
Because rats like you

101
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,140
got into the military camp,

102
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,990
and weakened Nanxia's military power.

103
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,990
It allows the people of Beimo march straight in.

104
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,250
I don't know how your parents taught you.

105
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,880
What did you say?

106
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,990
I said your parents are cowards.

107
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,030
Princess Shenghua also sent a letter saying

108
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,390
that His Majesty ordered Young Marquis to return to Shengdu.

109
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,909
I'm afraid that emperor's special envoy coming to Yuzhou

110
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,470
is not a good thing.

111
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,150
If we get the information about the enemy,

112
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,880
we must relocate immediately.

113
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,110
If that's the case,

114
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,830
we should fight

115
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,830
the Beimo Army.

116
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,710
Yes.

117
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,310
Only then

118
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,310
we can lead the army and leave Yuzhou above board.

119
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,280
Report!

120
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:58,990
General.

121
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,230
We've found them.

122
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,430
The middle troops of Beimo is hiding

123
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,890
in a valley 300 miles away.

124
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,340
How did you find them?

125
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,550
Thanks to Mai’s intelligence.

126
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,030
We found their camp because of him.

127
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,430
And we didn’t alert them.

128
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,470
Mai.

129
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,430
Yes.

130
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,910
Mai is familiar with wilderness camp defense.

131
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,990
If it weren’t for Mai,

132
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,120
I wouldn’t have come back with this information.

133
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,630
You’re right.

134
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,910
Mai has the skill of a general.

135
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,470
Sir.

136
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,720
Young Marquis better think about

137
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,470
how to deal with Mai.

138
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,530
What?

139
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,830
Why punish Mai when he made a contribution?

140
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,170
He left the camp without permission.

141
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,440
He should be punished for deserting.

142
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,840
He should be executed according to the law.

143
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,390
General.

144
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,910
Lieutenant Tang,

145
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,480
why are you doing this?

146
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,630
Even though Mai doesn’t know the rules,

147
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,490
Lieutenant Tang has been in the army for years.

148
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,350
You should understand that military orders are like a mountain.

149
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,030
Sir.

150
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,110
I understand.

151
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,760
But Mai left the camp to spy on the enemy.

152
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,890
It was meritorious.

153
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,390
Beat him!

154
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,030
Move!

155
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,120
Hit him! Hit him!

156
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,710
Harder! Hit him! Hit him!

157
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,330
Stop right now!

158
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,050
You two split up.

159
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,000
Which camp are you from?

160
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,650
Tell me.

161
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,080
The Seventh Battalion.

162
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,570
Fighting in the military.

163
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,630
Each of you should be flogged twenty times.

164
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,270
Sir.

165
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,270
He started it.

166
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,700
Execute Immediately.

167
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,390
Sir,

168
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,560
he left the camp without permission.

169
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,540
Left the camp?

170
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,710
When?

171
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,190
Five days ago.

172
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,050
I am asking him.

173
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,910
Five days ago afternoon.

174
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,340
Am I right?

175
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,710
He's just a deserter.

176
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,490
Why did you leave the camp?

177
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,280
No comment.

178
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,470
Look, he feels guilty.

179
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,100
Take him away.

180
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,830
No.

181
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,670
Why did you arrest you?

182
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,540
Leaving the camp is a big matter.

183
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,030
It should be reported to the general for punishment.

184
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,830
Take him away.

185
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,290
I want to see General Shang.

186
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,270
Come in.

187
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,030
General,

188
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,630
there were two people fighting in the camp.

189
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,860
And were arrested by the patrol camp.

190
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,590
After inquiry,

191
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,600
both of them belong to the Seventh Battalion.

192
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,870
I was going to punish them according to the military rules,

193
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,590
but I found out that one of them had left the camp for several days.

194
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,690
Please make a decision.

195
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,500
Let them in.

196
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,190
Yes.

197
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,060
Bring him here.

198
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,680
General, you should ask

199
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,240
what happened first.

200
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,310
Mai.

201
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,710
Tell me.

202
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,590
It seems that there's a bias.

203
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,670
General.

204
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,670
I caught him first.

205
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,750
You should ask me first.

206
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,270
What's your name?

207
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,390
Your Excellency,

208
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,470
I’m the sergeant in the Eighth Squad of the Fourth Platoon of the Seventh Battalion.

209
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,470
My name is Wang Qi.

210
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,280
You first.

211
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,480
Will you believe

212
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,910
what I said?

213
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,850
If it's true,

214
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,470
I’ll believe you.

215
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,590
Mai left the camp without permission.

216
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,430
I saw him when he came back.

217
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,630
Then he hit me.

218
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,670
I had no choice but to fight back.

219
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,980
And people from the patrol camp saw me just in time.

220
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,190
He left the camp without permission.

221
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,270
I didn't report it in time.

222
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,220
I also made a mistake.

223
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,350
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

224
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,780
Why do I think

225
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,270
this is unreasonable?

226
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,790
General.

227
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,910
I told you you wouldn't believe me.

228
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,660
Calm down.

229
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,590
Mai.

230
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,760
Is what Wang Qi said true?

231
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,700
Yes.

232
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,160
Did you see that, general?

233
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,990
He admitted it himself.

234
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,570
If you insist on being biased,

235
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,550
I'm afraid

236
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,680
those soldiers will be disappointed.

237
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,910
General will handled this impartially.

238
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,830
But according to military discipline,

239
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,960
leaving the camp and fighting are two different things.

240
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,290
They should be deal with separately.

241
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,250
Do you agree?

242
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,100
Yes.

243
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,350
Okay.

244
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,670
Let’s talk about the fight first.

245
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,760
Mai.

246
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,280
You started it.

247
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:55,870
Yes.

248
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,800
Why did you do that?

249
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,590
It's a military secret.

250
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,010
I can't tell you.

251
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,790
General will handle it impartially.

252
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,250
You may leave.

253
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,420
Yes.

254
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,340
Go ahead.

255
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,990
I followed Lieutenant Tang to investigate the location of Beimo's middle troops.

256
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,120
Due to an emergency,

257
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,660
I didn’t report in time.

258
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,770
Mai is willing to be punished.

259
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,820
Can you make a bigger lie?

260
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,020
General.

261
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,080
I can prove what Mai said is true.

262
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,950
I’ve told you.

263
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,830
Without Mai,

264
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,440
I couldn’t finish the mission.

265
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,930
Mai deserves the credits.

266
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,380
Did you really find the army of Beimo?

267
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,960
How did you find them?

268
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,320
If Mai hadn’t found the campsite of Beimo,

269
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,220
we could have been attacked at any time.

270
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,060
Don’t mind Mai’s leaving.

271
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,270
Lieutenant Tang,

272
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,740
since the truth has come to light,

273
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,910
I will make the verdict.

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,690
Do you agree?

275
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,710
But sir...

276
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,110
I'm sure you'll be fair.

277
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,110
Okay.

278
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,730
Mai, solider in Eighth Squad of Fourth Platoon of Seventh Battalion,

279
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,200
left the camp without permission. He should be executed according to the law.

280
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,510
But considering his merit in investigating military situation,

281
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,630
merits equal demerits.

282
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,200
The death penalty can be exempted. He will be imprisoned for three days.

283
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,780
Sir,

284
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,670
as a lieutenant of cavalry,

285
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,110
I didn’t stop Mai in time.

286
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,600
I’m willing to take the punishment for Mai.

287
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,050
Military orders are like a mountain.

288
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,320
No more pleading.

289
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,200
Yes, sir.

290
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,630
Sergeant Wang Qi

291
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,050
didn't report the army's whereabouts in time.

292
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,220
He should be flogged ten times.

293
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,690
You two will be flogged

294
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,000
twenty times for fighting.

295
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,260
Execute immediately.

296
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,990
Any objection?

297
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,770
No.

298
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:11,790
General.

299
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,570
Stop!

300
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,300
Stop!

301
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,930
The general has ordered that

302
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,130
for the sake of fairness,

303
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,130
I will execute the bludgeon myself.

304
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,500
You may leave.

305
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,350
Your turn.

306
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,950
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,750
I missed.

308
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,390
Why are you here?

309
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,860
I came to see you.

310
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,710
It's all my fault.

311
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,510
It’s not your fault.

312
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
I left the camp without permission.

313
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,440
By the way,

314
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,730
these are all good medicines.

315
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,430
Thank you.

316
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,980
What are you doing?

317
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,270
Let me apply the ointment for you.

318
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,470
I can apply it myself.

319
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,140
Go back.

320
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,260
I thought

321
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,830
that's all I can do for you.

322
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,490
You don't have to feel guilty.

323
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,850
You are the commander in chief.

324
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,350
You have to convince others.

325
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,630
Besides,

326
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,240
if you can't distinguish the reward and punishment,

327
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,700
I’ll suffer in the future.

328
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,880
Mai.

329
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,130
Let me ask you something.

330
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,610
You are lying down like this

331
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,800
and can't move a single step.

332
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,050
What if you want to go to the toilet,

333
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:41,700
what should you do?

334
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,630
Why do you ask?

335
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,950
Are you done? What do you want?

336
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,030
I can help you.

337
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,190
Okay, I'll stop.

338
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,270
I'm just kidding.

339
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,310
Besides,

340
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,870
I can't stand that smell.

341
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,600
Since we've found the Beimo Army,

342
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,150
what's your plan?

343
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,720
My uncle

344
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,280
wants me to take the chance to return to Shengdu.

345
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,290
And Mr. Xu wants me

346
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,300
to take the chance of going to the battlefield to leave Yuzhou.

347
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,680
Even so,

348
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,540
it's my first time

349
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,620
going to the battlefield.

350
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,020
I feel a little...

351
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:31,770
Afraid?

352
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,290
Are you looking down on me from the bottom of your heart?

353
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,580
Fear is the most normal reaction of a person.

354
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,340
I’m afraid too.

355
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,190
When Chang Yuqing attacked Yinbao City,

356
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,030
I was so scared that

357
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,490
I didn't even dare to move.

358
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,660
But if I don't rush forward desperately,

359
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,720
I might not even have a chance to live.

360
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,150
It seems that

361
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,430
Mr. Xu made the right choice.

362
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,230
But Mai,

363
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,950
The number of Qingyu military coalition

364
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,610
is less than Beimo Army's 30%.

365
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,070
How can we fight them?

366
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,310
It's about the quality of the soldiers and horses, not quantity.

367
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,160
If we can make a thorough plan,

368
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,350
we might not lose.

369
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,300
Do you have a plan?

370
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,550
Mai.

371
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,350
Y-Y-Your butt…

372
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,930
Gosh.

373
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,640
Look at you.

374
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,090
Just because of your little trouble,

375
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,620
I even forgot my butt hurts.

376
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,500
I will always remember

377
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,690
your kindness to me.

378
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,580
It's okay.

379
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,560
Let’s get down to business.

380
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,650
After Beimo opens the border of Jingyang,

381
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,910
they will be more cautious while fighting back.

382
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,980
When Brother Tang and I

383
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,910
went for investigation, we found out that

384
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,040
they brought a lot of army provisions.

385
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,530
I'm sure they won't be fast.

386
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,830
If we can get here in advance,

387
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,350
lay in ambush here,

388
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,750
we can just wait for them.

389
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,370
There will be a different result.

390
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,790
Yelanggou?

391
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,830
That's right.

392
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,930
We are fighting for speed.

393
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,900
We give up all the provisions

394
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,500
and only bring food on the way.

395
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,740
What will the soldiers eat?

396
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,190
If we win,

397
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,350
there will be food from the Beimo Army.

398
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,350
What if we lose?

399
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,510
Lose?

400
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,150
Why do you still need food?

401
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,070
You're burning bridges.

402
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,640
Young Marquis,

403
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,470
it's possible.

404
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,470
This plan

405
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,350
is too...

406
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,080
Yes.

407
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,840
But only when you're steady  the morale of the army be stable.

408
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,370
If you have any hesitation,

409
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,320
you'd better give up

410
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,340
and stay in Yuzhou

411
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,220
to save the soldiers.

412
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,560
Think about it.

413
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,840
I don't have time to think about it.

414
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,630
This is the only way.

415
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,790
If I don’t succeed, I’ll die.

416
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,870
Mai.

417
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,320
I trust you.

418
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,640
Not me.

419
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,060
From now on,

420
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,950
trust yourself.

421
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,910
You can do it.

422
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,010
It's all here.

423
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Tie them tightly.

424
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,310
Okay.

425
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,040
Come, give me a hand.

426
00:23:59,310 --> 00:23:59,790
Come on.

427
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,550
One, two, go.

428
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,730
There's more here.

429
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,550
Here.

430
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,350
I didn't expect

431
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,430
Young Marquis to be so decisive.

432
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,350
You can speed up a lot when traveling light.

433
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,590
It’s Mai’s idea.

434
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,550
I was right.

435
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,830
Mai indeed has the captainship.

436
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,510
Sir.

437
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,020
I have a question.

438
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,950
Go ahead, Young Marquis.

439
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,320
During this expedition,

440
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,630
we took all the elites.

441
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,950
There are less than 1,000 soldiers guarding the city.

442
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,620
If we catch up with the enemy's ambush,

443
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,430
we might lose the city.

444
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,690
What about the people in the city?

445
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,310
Young Marquis is kind-hearted.

446
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,470
But as the commander in chief,

447
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,750
you should focus on a bigger picture.

448
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,230
Sometimes, we have to sacrifice

449
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,750
for a greater good.

450
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,550
But the lives of the people are also lives.

451
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,080
They have the right to live.

452
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,910
If we insist to do this,

453
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,110
we are no different from the Beimo Army.

454
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,790
You're wise, Young Marquis.

455
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,090
Chen Qi,

456
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,860
who are you to frame my brother?

457
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,150
Get out!

458
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,190
Marshal.

459
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,150
What are you doing? Let's go.

460
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,150
I'm not going out.

461
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,840
I’d like to ask you.

462
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,230
My brother worked so hard to breach Jingyang.

463
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,500
Not only did the Marshal not reward him,

464
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,150
but also framed my brother

465
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,280
for killing Nanxia captives.

466
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,790
And put the blame on my brother.

467
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,190
Don't treat everyone as fools.

468
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,190
Aren't you afraid that my brother's reputation in the army is too good

469
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,510
and no one will obey you in the future?

470
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,240
How dare you!

471
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,020
Cui Yan.

472
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,550
Get out of here!

473
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,630
Cui Yan,

474
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,630
you have a good uncle.

475
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,870
If you feel sorry that

476
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,670
he's still throwing away pride for you at this age,

477
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,590
let him worry less.

478
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,630
This has nothing to do with my uncle.

479
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,290
I'm talking about my brother.

480
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,550
Your brother?

481
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,590
Chang Yuqing breached Jingyang

482
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,270
was under my order.

483
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,910
What reward do you think he should receive?

484
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,670
Chang Yuqing ignored the military order

485
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,110
and led troops to attack Yinbao without permission.

486
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,310
What he did alert the enemy.

487
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,750
What crime will that be?

488
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,030
Do you really want me to give him justice?

489
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,250
I...

490
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,800
I've already let him off the hook

491
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,260
so that he can make amends.

492
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,510
If you really think it's unfair,

493
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,280
you can make a new decision.

494
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,190
No need.

495
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,660
Greetings, Marshal.

496
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,630
Marshal is fair in rewarding and punishing,

497
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,200
I have no objection.

498
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,110
Brother.

499
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,710
Shut up!

500
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,670
Apologize to the Marshal.

501
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,230
Brother.

502
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,440
Apologize.

503
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,160
I was rude just now.

504
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,840
Please forgive me.

505
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,150
You disrespected the military discipline and disrespected your superior.

506
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,750
Go get ten strokes yourself.

507
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,700
Although the provisions are a few days late,

508
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,230
but it's finally here.

509
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,250
Tell the armies,

510
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,300
we will strike camp tomorrow

511
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,110
and go south.

512
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,160
Yes.

513
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,690
Back then,

514
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,910
I had a quarrel with you

515
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,350
because you couldn't go shopping with me.

516
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,800
Now my wish has come true.

517
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,270
You don't need to lead the army.

518
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,330
You can stay at home with me every day.

519
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,310
Mr. Xu.

520
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,360
Mrs. Shi.

521
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,310
Mr. Xu is here.

522
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,550
Have a seat.

523
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,380
General Shi.

524
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,590
With such a leisure time,

525
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,710
isn't it good?

526
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,270
I don't have to work hard,

527
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,350
it's all good.

528
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,510
Young Marquis can be independent,

529
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,470
I'm very pleased.

530
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,710
I'm here to inform you.

531
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,020
We found the main location of the Beimo Army.

532
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,280
The military coalition will strike camp immediately

533
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,360
and take the lead.

534
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,870
Young Little Marquis is determined to fight the enemy.

535
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,070
I will guard the rear.

536
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,030
But the Beimo Army and military coalition

537
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,630
are quite different in numbers.

538
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,510
How many soldiers does Young Marquis plan to lead?

539
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,570
How many soldiers is he going to keep?

540
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,740
As you said,

541
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:19,670
there is a huge difference in military power between the two.

542
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,580
Sir,

543
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,710
this military coalition fought against the enemy to protect the country.

544
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,960
But we also have to protect the people.

545
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,130
If there are fewer soldiers in Yuzhou,

546
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
what should I do

547
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,090
if the Beimo Army came?

548
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,280
That's exactly what Young Marquis was worried about.

549
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,310
I want to ask you, in your heart,

550
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,470
between securing the country and protecting the people,

551
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,070
which one is more important?

552
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,300
How about this?

553
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,050
Mai.

554
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,830
You’re back.

555
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,480
Erdan.

556
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,630
Do you miss me?

557
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,670
Of course.

558
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,620
You had a hard time.

559
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,270
No, it's not.

560
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,110
Not at all.

561
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,310
Have you had enough rest?

562
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,610
Sergeant.

563
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,150
What is it?

564
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,670
People who know the matter

565
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,390
know that you're in confinement.

566
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,320
People who don't might think you did something good.

567
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,590
Sergeant,

568
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,200
I did do something rewarding.

569
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,000
Sergeant, how could you forget?

570
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,430
My big butt has recovered.

571
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,400
How is yours?

572
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,720
Me too.

573
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,510
Why are you laughing?

574
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,580
To be honest,

575
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,000
we're going to march in two days.

576
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,480
Are you sure you are fine?

577
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,740
Sergeant, don’t worry.

578
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,750
The butt is fine.

579
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,770
It won't embarrass us.

580
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,470
See? See?

581
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,160
Qiang.

582
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,940
See?

583
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,190
You have guts.

584
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,020
Now you look like a soldier in Eighth Squad.

585
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,110
I'm serious.

586
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,910
We are really going to a battlefield.

587
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,440
If your big ass hurts,

588
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,870
just let us know.

589
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,030
We will carry you to the battlefield.

590
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,710
Sergeant,

591
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,560
something is wrong with you.

592
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:14,910
What’s wrong with me?

593
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,590
Why are you so nice to Mai?

594
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,250
What’s so strange about that?

595
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,050
Sergeant has always been like this.

596
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:20,710
Yes.

597
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,230
Yes.

598
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,990
What kind of person am I?

599
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:23,550
Yes.

600
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,870
Besides,

601
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,830
I don’t want to stop Mai from

602
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,810
making contributions for our Seventh Battalion.

603
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,370
Mai.

604
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,560
Come out.

605
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,910
Let's go.

606
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,030
Go.

607
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,510
Sergeant, where are they going?

608
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,150
Coming.

609
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,730
Have you recovered?

610
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,910
Almost.

611
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,080
General Shang asked for me?

612
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,080
I want you to see him.

613
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,800
What's wrong with him?

614
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,110
He's been restless all morning.

615
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,750
He must have something on his mind.

616
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,290
He won't tell me no matter how I ask him.

617
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,090
I want to see if you have any idea.

618
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,550
He is inside?

619
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,850
Okay, I'll go take a look.

620
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,100
We will departure tomorrow.

621
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,320
Is everything ready?

622
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,190
We've also selected

623
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,500
people to guard Yuzhou City.

624
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,240
What's going on?

625
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,300
You are not saying anything.

626
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
It's strange.

627
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,720
After listened to what you said that day,

628
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,320
I thought about it all night.

629
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,540
I found out that

630
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:51,980
I'm more afraid.

631
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,680
I don't know much about the imperial court,

632
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,710
but I can understand one thing.

633
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,590
He used to be very straightforward.

634
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,000
That's because you were just a Marquis with no power.

635
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,330
You don't have the ability to settle down.

636
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,430
But now,

637
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,450
there's a whole Qingyu military coalition stands behind you.

638
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,050
If he wants to hurt you again,

639
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,840
he has to think twice.

640
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Besides, the most urgent thing now is to fight against foreign enemies.

641
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,960
With his position,

642
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,860
of course he won't disregard the overall situation.

643
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,290
What are you afraid of?

644
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,990
I remember everything you said.

645
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,070
I understand.

646
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,770
But I'm not afraid of death.

647
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,830
Then what are you afraid of?

648
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,150
If I only care about my own life,

649
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,430
am I be worthy of

650
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,030
the soldiers that follow me?

651
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,710
You may not believe me.

652
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,490
I'd rather be a soldier that follows order

653
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,430
than a general

654
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,690
who is responsible for everyone's life.

655
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,350
Once I talk,

656
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,680
a decision will be made.

657
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,470
It's fine if it's right.

658
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,590
If it's wrong,

659
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,190
how many soldiers

660
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,830
will die

661
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,490
because of my wrong decision.

662
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,880
My father once said,

663
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,400
a general builds his success on thousands bones.

664
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,790
The so-called great generals

665
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:15,000
are created

666
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,830
from countless flesh and blood.

667
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,920
Among these bones,

668
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,010
there are enemies'

669
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,179
and our own people's.

670
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,120
Since you chose this path,

671
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,760
the only thing you can do is to go on without hesitation.

672
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,520
You know better than me

673
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,480
how fierce the Beimo soldiers are.

674
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,290
Our soldiers following me,

675
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,719
they will have a slim chance of surviving.

676
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,389
There are two reasons

677
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,449
why the soldiers choose to join the army.

678
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,179
First, to protect our country,

679
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,540
and second, bring glory to their ancestors.

680
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,400
Since they chose to join the army,

681
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,389
there is the only way.

682
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,830
Go to the battlefield, forget about life and death,

683
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:58,090
so one day they will be rewarded and conferred with a title.

684
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,500
They chose you and trusted you.

685
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,740
Why don't you trust yourself?

686
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,190
If you can't make a decisive decision,

687
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,520
they will be cowardly on the battlefield.

688
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,660
Then they'll die for sure.

689
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,370
Have you figured it out?

690
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,910
What?

691
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,270
I think I've figured it out.

692
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,460
That's good.

693
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,530
We will strike camp tomorrow.

694
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,030
Go back and get ready.

695
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,550
I-I need more time.

696
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,740
Soldiers,

697
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,740
the people of Beimo breached our gate

698
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,920
and destroyed our home.

699
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,580
They killed 100,000 men of Nanxia.

700
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,510
This blood feud

701
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,560
is irreconcilable.

702
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,170
Now, the elites of the two armies

703
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,600
have formed an alliance.

704
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,750
We will never return until we breach Beimo.

705
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,990
We will never return until we breach Beimo.

706
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,150
We will never return until we breach Beimo.

707
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,910
We will never return until we breach Beimo.

708
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,950
We won't return until we break the Beimo!

709
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:27,590
Cheers!

710
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,870
All of you, go!

711
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,240
Here is the imperial edict.

712
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:59,130
Marquis Dingnan, Shang Yizhi, the Guard General of Qingzhou, accept the edict.

713
00:37:59,130 --> 00:37:59,770
Sir,

714
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,340
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

715
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,470
It's a long journey.

716
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,480
May I know your name?

717
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,640
What are you doing?

718
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,520
My surname is Jin.

719
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,870
Nice to meet you, Mr. Jin.

720
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,070
You don't need to read the imperial edict.

721
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,590
I know what it is.

722
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,210
Nowadays, the Beimo Army is at the border.

723
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,210
Jingyang Pass has been lost.

724
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,680
They will go south in a moment.

725
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,310
We, the Qingyu military coalition, will fight

726
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,440
to protect our home.

727
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,390
Sir,

728
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,650
we're facing an enemy.

729
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,280
let's not talk about

730
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,640
manners and etiquettes.

731
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,890
I'll go to the battlefield first.

732
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:31,510
Wait.

733
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,590
You don't have to tell me.

734
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,450
I know what you're worried about.

735
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,720
The city is well prepared to defense the enemy.

736
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,400
It will protect you.

737
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,800
When I return in triumph,

738
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,810
let's drink three more cups, okay?

739
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,200
Military secrets are the most fleeting of all.

740
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,380
Protecting our country is the priority

741
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,100
Mr. Jin,

742
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,450
protect yourself.

743
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,710
Okay.

744
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,940
Let's go.

745
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,770
What do you mean?

746
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,080
All troops, depart!

747
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,890
Special envoy,

748
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,950
you must be tired from your long journey.

749
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,930
Why don’t you stay in the city for a few days

750
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,990
and wait for General Shang’s return?

751
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,920
Please. Please.

752
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,470
General Shang is a loyal man.

753
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,550
But there is something wrong.

754
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,040
No, no.

755
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,070
How can I wait if I have His Majesty's order?

756
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,440
Let's go after him.

757
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,500
Guards!

758
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,350
General Shi.

759
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,030
W-What are you doing?

760
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,000
I’m trying to protect the special envoy.

761
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,590
General Shang left in a hurry,

762
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,250
so he didn’t explain clearly.

763
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,070
The main force of the Beimo Army

764
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,970
is only a few hundred miles away from Yuzhou.

765
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,720
You didn't see meet them when you came?

766
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,940
No.

767
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,630
You are lucky, thanks to His Majesty.

768
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,150
Yuzhou and Yangshui are the main line of going south.

769
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,640
If no one can stop the main force of the Beimo Army,

770
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,430
they will go straight

771
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,190
to Shengdu and disturbed His Majesty.

772
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,390
What should we do?

773
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,350
Besides,

774
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:41,830
this...

775
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,870
If the Qingyu military coalition successfully stops the enemy,

776
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,600
special envoy is also a part of the contribution.

777
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,470
The Beimo Army is really that close?

778
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,390
How dare I lie to the special envoy?

779
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,470
If it wasn’t too late,

780
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,530
General Shang wouldn’t have risked his life ignoring the edict

781
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,980
to fight the enemy.

782
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,160
The special envoy is here under the order.

783
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,960
I have the responsibility to ensure the safety of the special envoy.

784
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,440
The city is safer than outside.

785
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,370
You'd better enter the city

786
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,910
and let me fulfill my duty as a host.

787
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,450
Thank you, General Shi.

788
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,830
Please.

789
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,260
Let's go.

790
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,710
Where should we go?

791
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:30,590
From the map...

792
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,070
Young Marquis,

793
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,400
This place should be...

794
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,790
Sir.

795
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,740
General Shi sent a letter.

796
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,320
He told us not to worry.

797
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,240
What do you mean?

798
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,480
He kidnapped the special envoy?

799
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,370
He's still alive.

800
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,960
But no information can get out of Yuzhou City.

801
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,630
It's too hasty.

802
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,930
Young Marquis,

803
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,910
I think we should focus on

804
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,380
the current war first.

805
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,000
If the military coalition can win,

806
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,900
there will be rooms to turn.

807
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,910
We must win this battle.

808
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,740
We can’t let Uncle Shi down.

809
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,190
Otherwise, all the efforts

810
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,910
will be in vain.

811
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,070
Yes.

812
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:15,830
Mu Bai.

813
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:16,680
Yes.

814
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,300
Pass my order.

815
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,900
We have to arrive Yelanggou before sunset.

816
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,410
Yes.
