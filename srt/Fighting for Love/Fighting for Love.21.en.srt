[Episode 21]

4
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,190
Chengyi.

5
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,950
How is Shi Dachun doing?

6
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,830
Marshal,

7
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,520
Shi Dachun has been as usual as always.

8
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,560
But he suddenly went out with his wife the other day.

9
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,030
Where did they go?

10
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,750
Not far.

11
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,000
They just went to the nearby alley.

12
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,360
It was reported that

13
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,550
Shi Dachun cried on the spot.

14
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,539
General Shi really loves his people as his son.

15
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,200
Marshal wants to take him under your wing?

16
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,070
Those who love their people as their children

17
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,870
can't be used.

18
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,060
By the way,

19
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,290
is the lady in Chang Yuqing's room

20
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,710
still in the house?

21
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,190
Chang Yuqing said

22
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,310
that woman is his.

23
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,990
Is that true?

24
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,150
How could that woman

25
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,470
appear in the marshal's room?

26
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,870
Chang Yuqing must be lying.

27
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,800
It must be a trap.

28
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:41,150
Marshal,

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,190
should we get her for an interrogation?

30
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,070
No need.

31
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,710
What can she do?

32
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,840
Just send someone to keep an eye on her.

33
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,870
Yes.

34
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,430
Go.

35
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,310
Go. Go.

36
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,630
Uncle Shi asked me to come here.

37
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,230
Do you have any ideas on how to defeat the enemy?

38
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,020
Young Marquis.

39
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,070
Young Marquis, please take a look.

40
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,270
All the generals of the Beimo Army live in Yuzhou City.

41
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,230
We only need send an elite troop

42
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,590
to catch them all,

43
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,670
and we can take back Yuzhou City.

44
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,810
That's a good idea.

45
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,850
But...?

46
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,990
But it's not that easy.

47
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,870
Chen Qi is meticulous.

48
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,590
He has stationed several Beimo soldiers in the city.

49
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,280
He and the other generals of Beimo

50
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,390
led these soldiers

51
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,830
to stay in every corner of the city

52
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,510
to suppress the people.

53
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,150
The Beimo Military Camp

54
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,279
is five miles away from the south gate.

55
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,480
As long as we can get the news inside,

56
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,880
we can reach outside the city in an instant.

57
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,260
If we attack from both inside and outside,

58
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,430
I'm afraid there will be a catastrophe in Yuzhou.

59
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,720
Yes.

60
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,510
We'll discuss this later.

61
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,650
I'm going to the City Guard Mansion to meet someone.

62
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,430
Are you hungry or thirsty

63
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,580
or do you want to go to the toilet again?

64
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,450
I just came out for some fresh air.

65
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,980
You don't have to follow me.

66
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,390
What do you want?

67
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,550
I told you

68
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,270
I'm just walking around.

69
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,150
Can you stop following me?

70
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,720
I was ordered to serve you.

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,980
I dare not neglect you.

72
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,870
Fine.

73
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,150
What's wrong?

74
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,480
Did Mo Yu not serve you well?

75
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,870
He did it very well.

76
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,400
He followed me everywhere.

77
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,590
Maybe he even want to hold my pants

78
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,030
when I go to the toilet.

79
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,960
Isn't that serving me well enough?

80
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,790
If you want to be alone,

81
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,790
you can.

82
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,670
But you have to promise me one thing.

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,130
You can't leave this house.

84
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,030
General,

85
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,470
General Shi wants to see you.

86
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,190
Got it.

87
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,790
Yes.

88
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:55,790
Can you do it?

89
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,940
I'll keep my promise.

90
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:15,910
You,

91
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,510
go to the pharmacy and get the medicine I usually take.

92
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,070
Yes.

93
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,670
What is it, General Shi? Go ahead.

94
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,270
I heard that the Chang family of Beimo is also a noble family.

95
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,159
I don't think there is a rule letting a guest to talk without    any treats.

96
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,520
Go and make a pot of good tea.

97
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,750
Yes.

98
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,670
I heard that the Nanxia girl General Chang captured

99
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,830
is locked in the garden.

100
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,550
She's so fierce.

101
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,830
That's right.

102
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,110
Nanxia girl.

103
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,510
General Shi.

104
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,870
You’ve had the tea

105
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,590
and desserts.

106
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,830
If you don't tell me your intention,

107
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,159
I'll have to see you out.

108
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,070
You have been staying idle at home.

109
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,190
But I have a lot of things to deal with.

110
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,470
Don't worry, General Chang.

111
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,790
I'm thinking about how to say it.

112
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,110
This matter...

113
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,110
It is hard to speak out.

114
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,630
Why don't you go back and think about it?

115
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,600
I have work to do.

116
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Please excuse me.

117
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,510
General Chang.

118
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,190
Calm down.

119
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,000
I heard that

120
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,610
the people in Yuzhou City are greatly bullied by the Beimo soldiers.

121
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,150
The Beimo soldiers are like bandits.

122
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,870
Some even hurt people

123
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,920
in broad daylight.

124
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,030
You shouldn't have come to me.

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,970
You should go to Chen Qi.

126
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,270
I've talked to him.

127
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,320
He told me to come to you.

128
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,880
Do you think I can help you?

129
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,280
I'm a general who kills.

130
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,030
Do you think I care if people die?

131
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,230
General Chang doesn't care.

132
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,870
Neither does Marshal Chen.

133
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,350
The imperial court of Beimo

134
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,550
probably care about it.

135
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,510
The Chang family of Beimo should care about it.

136
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,750
If this goes on and all the people in the city escape,

137
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,950
Yuzhou City will be ruined.

138
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,230
Who will benefit from this?

139
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,920
Go on.

140
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,710
Who?

141
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,350
Miss.

142
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,220
You have to restrain yourself.

143
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,590
I-I-I can't do it.

144
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,140
What are you doing?

145
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,570
It’s me.

146
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,870
Mai.

147
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,920
Why are you dressed like a girl?

148
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,470
I thought I am going to be unfaithful.

149
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,430
Why are you here?

150
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,990
W-Where should I be?

151
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,250
I see.

152
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,560
You're disguising as yourself

153
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,430
and waiting for me to get you out.

154
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,950
I'm here. Let's go.

155
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,950
Wait, let me see.

156
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,660
No, I can't leave now.

157
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
What do you think?

158
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,870
Yes.

159
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,480
I'm asking you what the situation is outside.

160
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,950
O-Outside?

161
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,350
It's like this outside.

162
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,750
Some of the generals of the Beimo Army

163
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,010
are all in the city now.

164
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,510
We planned to

165
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,670
to catch them all.

166
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,470
But later we found Chen Qi was too cunning.

167
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,120
He asked every general

168
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,870
to lead a sub-unit and

169
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,670
scatter to all parts of the city.

170
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,670
So sending an elite troop

171
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,510
to catch them all

172
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,940
might not be easy.

173
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,150
Let's go.

174
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,470
Don't think too much.

175
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,600
I have an idea.

176
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,470
Mai.

177
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,510
Mai.

178
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,670
Mai.

179
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,580
General Mai wants to practice with me?

180
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,670
You can't hurt me.

181
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,190
I want to marry you.

182
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,350
Take a look.

183
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,670
Sugar-coated haws.

184
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,880
Take a look.

185
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,870
Sugar-coated haws.

186
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,720
Pack these two boxes.

187
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,240
One foot nine.

188
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,600
Wingspan is two feet two.

189
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,380
Shoulder width is one foot two.

190
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,420
Two feet three.

Sugar-coated haws.

192
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,580
So high!

193
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,270
If you like it, buy it.

194
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
I don't like them.

195
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,030
What do you like?

196
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,920
Just ask them to wrap them up.

197
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,330
I like this one.

198
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,010
This one.

199
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,860
Wooden one looks better.

200
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,670
Wood material is more gentle that

201
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,400
it will not easily hurt people.

202
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,140
General Chang is so petty.

203
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,950
You are not even giving gold for your wedding.

204
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,620
This is my first gift to you.

205
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,930
You must take it.

[East Street Market]

207
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,950
Why are you laughing?

208
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,110
Looking at you like a woman,

209
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,580
I find it interesting.

210
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,170
I'm a woman.

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,710
Tell me.

212
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,830
Why did you marry me?

213
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,280
Do you regret it?

214
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,930
You set the wedding banquet at the City Guard Mansion.

215
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,590
The City Guard Mansion are full of Chen Qi's men.

216
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,590
Aren't you afraid of death once you fight?

217
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,270
I'm Mrs. Chang.

218
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,120
Get ready to be my bride.

219
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,990
Hurry up.

220
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,550
It's tilted.

221
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,310
Up, up.

222
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,110
Okay.

223
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,540
Here you are.

224
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,910
Down, down.

225
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:20,710
Okay.

226
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,240
Brother.

227
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,370
Why are you here?

228
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,510
She, she...

229
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,630
Isn’t she the battalion commander of the Seventh Battalion of the Zhenbei Army?

230
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,350
She, she...

231
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,220
Why is she a female?

232
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,010
Turn around.

233
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,280
This is your sister-in-law.

234
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,030
What are you talking about?

235
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,630
Brother, brother, brother.

236
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,430
Brother, I...

237
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,730
Sister-in-law is so beautiful.

238
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,710
Don't mind it.

239
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,180
He is immature.

240
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,700
It's okay.

241
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,860
I think he's quite cute.

242
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,920
Men in Beimo are really strong.

243
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,339
Brother, she said I'm strong.

244
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,390
No wonder my brother likes you.

245
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,589
I kind of like you too.

246
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,770
Did you send the invitation?

247
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,579
No.

248
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,349
Get lost if you don't and send them out now.

249
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,180
Brother.

250
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,690
Okay, brother.

251
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,300
A-A long and happy marriage.

252
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,400
How is it? Are you satisfied?

253
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,800
You prepared so well.

254
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,670
Of course I'm satisfied.

255
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,100
That's good.

256
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,750
Absolutely not.

257
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,670
Why not?

258
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,310
During the wedding,

259
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,750
the soldiers of Beimo gathered in the City Guard Mansion.

260
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,950
We'll lead the army there.

261
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,190
Once you give the order,

262
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,150
we'll break into the wedding banquet

263
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,790
and kill the soldiers of Beimo.

264
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,270
This is a great opportunity.

265
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,670
What great opportunity?

266
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,020
Because this girl...

267
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,120
She’s Mai.

268
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,070
Mai is a girl.

269
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,110
Our priority

270
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,550
is to protect Mai.

271
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,630
You always think about killing them all.

272
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,630
Mai may be in danger at any time.

273
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,240
I see.

274
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,290
That's why Young Marquis

275
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,300
insisted on going to the City Guard Mansion.

276
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,050
I'm wondering

277
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,310
if we can come up with other ideas.

278
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,710
There is no other way.

279
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,950
T-This...

280
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,230
The lives of the people in Yuzhou City and a live of a woman,

281
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,270
which one is more important?

282
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,670
Young Marquis, you...

283
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,930
You should think about it.

284
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,020
I shouldn't...

285
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,430
I shouldn't have left her there alone.

286
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,690
None of you are worried about her safety.

287
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,850
Young Marquis.

288
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,910
Listen to General Shi.

289
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,990
Do it at the wedding.

290
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,190
If Mai were here,

291
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,190
she would want to take down Yuzhou City with you.

292
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,270
As long as we move fast enough,

293
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,350
we can have both.

294
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,430
But...

295
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,070
We will finish this mission

296
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,230
as soon as possible.

297
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,050

I'll take your people.

299
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,590
Don't be impulsive.

300
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,910
I know what to do.

301
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,810
But I have to see Mai.

302
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,430
It’s good.

303
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,830
Also,

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,020
none of you

305
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,850
knows Mai is a girl.

306
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,980
Understand?

307
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,660
I swear to my life that I'll keep the secret!

308
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,210
I swear to my life that I'll keep the secret!

309
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,100

310
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,910
See you at the backyard of the jewelry store in the east tomorrow.

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,840
What is General Chang trying to do?

312
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,110
To sleep.

313
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,640
Didn't you promise to marry me?

314
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,070
Today is not our wedding day.

315
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,000
It'll be the same sooner or later.

I thought you were special.

I didn't expect you to be a beast wearing clothes.

318
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,710
All men are beasts.

319
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,940
You're wrong.

320
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,800
Shang Yizhi is not.

321
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,880
Forget it.

322
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,710
General Chang, you should rest here.

323
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,970
I'll go out tonight.

324
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,490
I'm leaving.

Are you going to follow me everywhere?

Yes.

Do you have a toilet?

345

Yes.

00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,110
There's a restoom for female guests in the back room.

347
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,520
I'll ask someone to take you there.

348

What are you thinking?

356
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,730
He didn't do anything to me.

You can tell me the truth.

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,430
I'm prepared to hear it.

Don't worry.

361
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,300
I will protect myself.

362
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,540
I'll make it short.

363
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,150
How is the preparation on the wedding day?

364
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,510
I will lead a team of guards

365
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,590
to disguise as vegetable deliveries

366
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,720

You can't go there.

372
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,030

we can't offend our guests.

377
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,330
Whether I can live

378
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,600
depends on whether you can move fast enough.

379
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,490
I gotta go.

380
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,360
Mai.

381
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,080
Trust me.

382
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,060
I'll be quick this time.

383
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,990
After we deliver this,

384
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,220
let's go to the kitchen.

385
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,750
Okay.

386
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:04,890
Marshal.

387
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,230
Shi Dachun may take action

388
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,030
on Chang Yuqing's wedding day.

389
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,440
Make arrangements.

390
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,090
Yes.

391
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,550
They have delivered all the wedding items.

392
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,390
Did you see it?

393
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,920
Yes, they are beautiful.

394
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,200
The schedule is a bit tight. I am sorry.

395
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,780
It is well prepared.

396
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,200
Brother, brother.

397
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,320
Brother.

398
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,810
I'll be right there.

399
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,800
Marshal,

400
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,630
please have a look.

401
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,090
Child-Giving Guanyin.

402
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,400
It fits the scene.

403
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,640
Let's go.

404
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,800
Yes.

405
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:50,590
[City Guard Mansion]

406
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,110
Deputy General Wang of Beimo gave a pair of tri-colored glazed child-giving pottery.

407
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,800
Congratulations, General Chang.

408
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,400
Thank you.

409
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,200
General.

410
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,390
Congratulations, General Chang.

411
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,990
Deputy General Xiao gave a Ruyi gold necklace.

412
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,990
Congratulations, General Chang.

413
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,750
Thank you.

414
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,940
Congratulations.

415
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,150
Congratulations, General Chang.

416
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:58,830
Thank you.

417
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,990
Come in, please.

418
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:00,670
Congratulations.

419
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,950
This way, please.

420
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,650
Is Shi Dachun not here yet?

421
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,510
His mansion is a while away from the City Guard Mansion.

422
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,770
He should be here soon.

423
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,090
Keep a close watch.

424
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,530
Don't worry, brother.

425
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,640
Marshal Chen gave a statue of white-jade Guanyin.

426
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,230
I didn't expect you to come in person.

427
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,150
It's such an honour.

428
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,440
General Chang is getting married.

429
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,110
How can I not come for your wedding?

430
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,970
Thank you.

431
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,710
I'll drink with you later.

432
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,430
Okay.

433
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,550
Everyone,

434
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,190
let's move to the main hall.

435
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:52,920
Yan.

436
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,260
Tell me the truth.

437
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,550
Why did Chang Yuqing

438
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,140
marry a Nanxia girl?

439
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,790
What is he up to?

440
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,270
Uncle,

441
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,590
my brother is getting married today.

442
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,520
He is up to nothing.

443
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,620
Don't try to gloss it over.

444
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,440
Will the Chang family agree?

445
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,870
My brother likes her.

446
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,430
He doesn't care about her identity.

447
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,790
It's not like the Chang family can stop him.

448
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,390
If you have any problem with my brother,

449
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,920
just ask him.

450
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,670
By the way, uncle,

451
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,910
don't call her Nanxia girl anymore.

452
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,370
That's my sister-in-law.

453
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,070
You...

454
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,190
It's the auspicious hour.

455
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,830
Not here yet?

456
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,700
No.

457
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,310
You can go in first.

458
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,670
Don't miss the auspicious hour.

459
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,000
Leave the outside to me.

460
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,750
It is the auspicious hour.

461
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:30,590
Great!

462
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,270
Great!

463
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,030
Bravo! Bravo!

464
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,630
One bow to heaven and earth.

465
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,230
Wait.

466
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,430
Everyone,

467
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,920
I have a favour to ask.

468
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:54,970
General Chang.

469
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,510
Today is your wedding day.

470
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,550
Go ahead.

471
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,050
Please excuse me.

472
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,350
This is my first wedding.

473
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,290
It's inappropriate that no one is sitting in the parents' seat.

474
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,550
My wife had a hard life.

475
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,780
Her parents died when she was young.

476
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,270
And my parents are far away in the capital.

477
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,030
So which general

478
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,070
would like to sit there

479
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,590
for us?

480
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,270
It's fine.

481
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,230
We fought on the battlefield together,

482
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,270
risked our lives,

483
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,710
we're already a family.

484
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,800
I am touched with

485
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,400
General Chang's sincerity.

486
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,870
But in terms of representing General Chang's parents,

487
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,270
the most suitable person

488
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,590
is Marshal Chen.

489
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,960
Please grant my wish.

490
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,670
Is this your idea

491
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,710
or hers?

492
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,520
This is our idea.

493
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,100
Okay.

494
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,310
I'll do my best.

495
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,780
Thank you, Marshal.

496
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,430
Great! Great!

497
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,070
One bow to heaven and earth.

498
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,390
Bravo! Bravo!

499
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,460
Then bow to your parents.

500
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,430
Bravo! Bravo!

501
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,080
Guards!

502
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,290
Catch the spy!

503
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,330
Stop!

504
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,280
Do not try to provoke me

505
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,810
or I'll hurt your marshal.

506
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,870
If you want to live,

507
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,310
don't move.

508
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,560
Do you think I came alone?

509
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,840
Don't move.

510
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:38,720
Don't move.

511
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,360
Let's go.

512
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,240
General Chang.

513
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,060
It's time for your show to end.

514
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,400
It's time to end it.

515
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,920
Drop your weapons.

516
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,090
Marshal,

517
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,750
your troops have been destroyed by us.

518
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,070
I'll take over the mansion.

519
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,330
Don't worry, Marshal.

520
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,080
Have you had enough fun?

521
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,670
Brother, everything is done outside.

522
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,990
You're ready for it.

523
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,240
You beat me so many times.

524
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,510
It's time for me to win.

525
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,440
Archers and guards are ready.

526
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,230
Just in case.

527
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,450
Chang Yuqing.

528
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,230
You colluded with the spies to kidnap the marshal.

529
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,390
Go out and think about

530
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,670
how to report to the court.

531
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,180
About the Nanxia spy assassinating the marshal,

532
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,380
If you don't think it through,

533
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,480
the number of casualties today will only increase.

534
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,679
Take him away.

535
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:13,469
Go!

536
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,489
This is outrageous!

537
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:14,989
Go!

538
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,190
I won't let you go.

539
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:16,830
Let’s go.

540
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,510
Mai, start asking.

541
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,400
What do you want to ask?

542
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,210
Those people who killed my parents with you.

543
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,750
Who are they?

544
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,830
You'd better not know.

545
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,750
You are going to die and you're still denying.

546
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,670
Back then,

547
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,510
it is the Xuanwu Army of Shengdu

548
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,199
went to Duke Shengguo's house with me.

549
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,030
You mean

550
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,800
the one who killed my parents with you

551
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,980
is someone in the imperial court?

552
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,530
Who is the mastermind?

553
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,310
Tell me.

554
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,470
Even if you know it, it will only make you suffer.

555
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,950
Hatred is bad for you.

556
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,630
I hope you can let it go.

557
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,670
Mai.

558
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,290
It’s useless to kill him.

559
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,110
I promise you,

560
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,040
if you hand him over,

561
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,820
I'll let you take his live

562
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,630
whenever you want.

563
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,800
Guards!

564
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,710
Yes.

565
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,110
Tie him to the pillar of the corridor behind the house.

566
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,670
Yes.

567
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,870
Brother, brother.

568
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,950
Shi Dachun hasn't shown up.

569
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,550
Let’s not wait. Just take it.

570
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,030
How do we explain to the court?

571
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,550
The spy sneaked into the city.

572
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,350
We have someone takes the blame.

573
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,220
No.

574
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,350
Do you want me to hand over your sister-in-law?

575
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,270
It's just an excuse

576
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,460
and we can change it later.

577
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,090
You really think I'll hand over my sister-in-law?

578
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,620
Go.

579
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,030
Yes.

580
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,090
What are you doing?

581
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,670
We're halfway through the wedding.

582
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,690
We need to finish what we started.

583
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,750
I never wanted to marry you.

584
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,110
I know.

585
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,930
But I'm serious.

586
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,070
Brother,

587
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,150
there are many soldiers from the Zhenbei Army outside.

588
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,210
We are surrounded.

589
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,190
Go get my spear.

590
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,230
I'll be right there.

591
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,950
Brother.

592
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,640
Go.

593
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,310
What happened?

594
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,550
How’s the preparation on the wedding day?

595
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,190
Uncle Shi said

596
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,330
there is an ancient secret tunnel in Yuzhou City.

597
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,350
It was designed by the city guard

598
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,350
as a way of escape.

599
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,310
As long as we send someone to chisel open the entrance,

600
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,590
our army can go straight to the City Guard Mansion.

601
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,530
Then we can defeat them from inside out

602
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,030
and retake Yuzhou.

603
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,140
I didn't expect to lose to you again.

604
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,050
Have you ever fallen in love with me?

605
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,610
Never.

606
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,000
Fine.

607
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,110
Since you have no feelings for me,

608
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,130
we are enemies, not friends.

609
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,230
Kill me

610
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,840
to prove what you said.

611
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,150
I have no time to joke with you.

612
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,510
This is my dagger.

613
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,430
Don't worry.

614
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,200
I won't force you to stay.

615
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,820
After we part ways,

616
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,690
the next time we see each other will be on the battlefield.

617
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,340
Don't I deserve to drink a glass of wine with you?

618
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,790
Okay.

619
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,980
I drink a toast to you for helping me catch Chen Qi.

620
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,780
Here's to you.

621
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,190
After drinking this,

622
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,580
you don't owe me anything anymore.

623
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,660
[City Guard Mansion]

624
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:08,700
Search!

625
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,610
Stop!

626
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,250
I’ll shoot if you keep running.

627
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,120
Calm down, Marshal Shang.

628
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,260
Why don’t we sit down and talk?

629
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,920
There's nothing to talk about between us.

630
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,070
Surrender.
