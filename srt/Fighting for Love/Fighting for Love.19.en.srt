Mai.

6
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,390
Yes.

7
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,890
I orderyou to be the Battalion Commander of

8
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,170
the Seventh Battalion of Infantry of the Zhenbei Army.

9
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,530
Immediately succeed to the office without a delay.

10
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,990
Why don't you take the order?

11
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,110
Yes.

12
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:14,990
Brother,

13
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,990
when are we going to attack the city?

14
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,770
See for yourself.

15
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,730
What is the imperial court thinking?

16
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,990
The war has come this far,

17
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,090
they are still hesitating whether to withdraw?

18
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,110
There's always a coward who wants to be a deserter.

19
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,490
Look carefully.

20
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,430
Second Uncle Chang is the one in charge.

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,050
He must have his reasons.

22
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,870
Tell me about it.

23
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,390
Second Uncle is very scheming.

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,070
No, no.

25
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,430
What's the word?

26
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,970
The empress dowager promoted Chen Qi as our commander.

27
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,050
The greater Chen Qi contributes,

28
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,670
the deeper our family will be suppressed.

29
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,950
That's why my father wants to withdraw the army.

30
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,150
He needs us to stay in Pingjia'ao, pretending

31
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,680
to be held back by the enemy,

32
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,800
so that Chen Qi in Yuzhou,

33
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,680
can't continue to deploy troops to the south.

34
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,430
Brother,

35
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,160
so you're not here to avenge me?

36
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,990
Idiot.

37
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,550
Prepare to attack tomorrow morning.

38
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,310
Attack!

39
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,750
Report!

40
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,390
General.

41
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,430
The west wall is in danger.

42
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,510
The Fourth Battalion lost more than half of its people.

43
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,550
They ran out of whip arrows.

44
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,350
They are requesting for backup.

45
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,520
It has become a tangled warfare.

46
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,430
Even if we guard the city,

47
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,160
there are not many advantages.

48
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,870
We need to send elite soldiers to support the Fourth Battalion

49
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,990
to withstand the attack.

50
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,320
Understood. You may leave.

51
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,150
Yes.

52
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,110
Sound a retreat.

53
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,000
They retreated.

54
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,790
Report!

55
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,310
General.

56
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,110
The army of Beimo has retreated.

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,630
General.

58
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,270
The injured soldiers of the Fourth Battalion have been taken care of.

59
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,600
After several battles,

60
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,280
the medicine we brought from the Yuzhou City

61
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
is clearly not enough

62
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,380
to continue the fight.

63
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,110
General.

64
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,390
We also ran out of whip arrows.

65
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,030
We need to replenish immediately.

66
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,960
Fortunately, the Beimo Army didn't persist in attacking the city.

67
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,020
Otherwise, our soldiers will suffer more casualties.

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,550
Do you have a plan?

69
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,350
You can't make bricks without straw.

70
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,740
The Beimo Army must know our army is in dire straits.

71
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,510
They will send troops to surround us day and night,

72
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,470
so that we can't cut branches and collect herbs at night.

73
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,110
Sir,

74
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,870
I have a different opinion.

75
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,530
I don't know if I should say it.

76
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,350
Go ahead.

77
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,270
Generals,

78
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,010
don't you think it's strange?

79
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,070
The Beimo Army attacked the city

80
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,950
without any weapons today.

81
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,670
Their casualties

82
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,990
are more than ours.

83
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,030
Moreover,

84
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,150
they seem to be fighting hard,

85
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,860
but they're actually outwardly strong but inwardly weak.

86
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,230
Otherwise, why did they suddenly retreat

87
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,490
after they reached the city wall?

88
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,310
Sir,

89
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,590
if there is nothing suspicious,

90
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,720
there must be something wrong inside.

91
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,150
I bet they won't come tonight.

92
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,460
Battalion Commander Mai reminded me something.

93
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,110
I've fought for half of my life.

94
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,230
I've never been

95
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,560
so clueless like today.

96
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,230
The enemy has breached the city wall already,

97
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,440
but they retreated.

98
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,350
Chang Yuqing is a famous general in Beimo.

99
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,320
He is brave and good at fighting.

100
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,850
He is good at attacking the city with weapons.

101
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,350
The battle in Yinbao and Jingyang are the same.

102
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,150
But today,

103
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,560
it seems like...

104
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,990
What is it?

105
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,830
It seems to be a feign attack.

106
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,230
They didn’t mean to attack our walled city.

107
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,500
Is Jiang Chengyi convinced?

108
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,470
I don't know.

109
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,140
But he impressed me today.

110
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,330
He was very brave with his men.

111
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,630
Everyone here today

112
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,790
are all convinced.

113
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,190
Idiot.

114
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,570
Pass my order.

115
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,830
Jiang Chengyi is so brave.

116
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,550
He will be at the forefront next time.

117
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:12,810
Yes.

118
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,910
Mai.

119
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,770
What are you thinking?

120
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,909
Thinking about what is

121
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,390
Chang Yuqing up to.

122
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,230
It's better to be a general.

123
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,990
His one decision is

124
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,360
wracking countless people's brains.

125
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,350
He can decide whether to sleep in this moldy quilt.

126
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,120
You should have taken it out to dry in the sun.

127
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,320
Look, it's moldy now.

128
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,700
I'll go find you.

129
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,960
I can't help you.

130
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,720
Just stay with the sergeant for one night.

131
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,850
Ser...

132
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,700
You don’t wash your feet.

133
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,670
Mai is the battalion commander now.

134
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,470
You are not going to listen to him?

135
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,710
I just washed my feet last month.

136
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,430
Okay.

137
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,210
Watch out for my hands.

138
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,360
Your feet.

139
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,150
Sergeant.

140
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,570
Move backward.

The enemy has breached the city wall already,

145
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,490
but they retreated again.

146
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,180
Sound to retreat.

147
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,980
It seems to be a feign attack.

148
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,549
They don't really want to

149
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,090

Sound to retreat.

155
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,990
What are you doing? Sound to retreat!

156
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,890
Retreat!

Hurry! Retreat!

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,470
Retreat!

Retreat! Hurry up! Retreat!

161
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,270
This...

162
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,530
Why did General Chang call for a retreat?

163
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,350
If you give me a little more time,

164
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,750
I will take down the walled city for sure.

165
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,280
Give you a little more time?

166
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,510
After a little while,

167
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,200
who knows how many brothers will die?

168
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,840
Mo Yu.

169
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,590
Yes.

170
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,390
In today's battle,

171
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,950
under Deputy General Jiang's leading,

172
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,750
six of the first-level battalion commanders,

173
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,280
eleven decurions,

174
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,170
and eighteen sergeants died.

175
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,870
The casualties of soldiers are far greater than

176
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,630
the casualties when our army attacked the city before.

177
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,290
It's inevitable for casualties to occur when attacking the city.

178
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,230
If you don't want to attack the city,

179
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,490
why don't you go home as soon as possible?

180
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,630
Every soldier in Beimo is our fellow.

181
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,030
Deputy General Jiang wants to brush away by saying that is inevitable.

182
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,670
Guards!

183
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,430
Yes.

184
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,430
Take Deputy General Jiang to the camp where wounded soldiers stay.

185
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,470
Let him live with the wounded soldiers.

186
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,510
So he can recall

187
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,590
how he spent his time while he was a soldier.

188
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,230
Yes.

189
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,680
Don't touch me.

190
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,470
Go and take a look.

191
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,030
You've been officials for too long that

192
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,100
you've forgotten to love the soldiers as your own sons?

193
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,750
Yes.

194
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,790
You are right.

195
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,670
Chang Yuqing feinted the attack.

196
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,000
You can't forget that the enemy is strong and we are weak.

197
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,360
If the Beimo Army

198
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,030
wants to cut off all means of retreat,

199
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,710
we won’t be able to guard our walled city.

200
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,480
Yes.

201
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,130
By the way, Mai,

202
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,430
didn’t you say you have an idea?

203
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,630
Can you tell us today?

204
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,630
I would like to ask General Shang

205
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,920
to lead all soldiers to face death

206
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,240
in order to save the Zhenbei Army.

207
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,150
Mai.

208
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,590
Don’t talk nonsense.

209
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,440
I didn’t ask General Shang to attack the camp.

210
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,470
Then what?

211
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,690
Generals, please have a look.

212
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,030
The entrance of Pingjia'ao looks like a gourd.

213
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,390
It’s easy to defend but hard to attack.

214
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,790
The counsellor brought the Zhenbei Army here

215
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,710
because we can rely on the geography.

216
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,510
Is that right?

217
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,790
I want you to

218
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,670
take the army and leave from the back of the camp.

219
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,000
Leave me one battalion.

220
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,510
We will guard the city every day

221
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,790
and pretend that all of us are still in the city.

222
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,000
And general led the army,

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,750
take this route and go all the way to the back.

224
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,910
Set up an ambush

225
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,230
at the waist of this gourd-shaped place.

226
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,160
When the Beimo Army attacks again,

227
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,040
General Shang can lead his men to attack from the back.

228
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,550
We can attack from both front and back

229
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,350
to defeat Chang Yuqing's army.

230
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,640
Are you gambling?

231
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,910
If our army

232
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,010
doesn't arrive behind Chang Yuqing's army in time,

233
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,000
he will led his army to attack the city.

234
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,950
None of the soldiers in this walled city

235
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,430
will survive.

236
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,690
The war between two armies is a gamble.

237
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,390
If we succeed,

238
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,980
we win this battle.

239
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,720
If we continue lingering here,

240
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,280
we’ll die.

241
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,600
Mai, you guarding here with a battalion

242
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
is too dangerous.

243
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,390
Why don't we change?

244
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,110
You take people to the back and, I guard the city.

245
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,990
Can you guard the city?

246
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,510
I...

247
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,480
It's dangerous to guard the city.

248
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,540
But I'm not afraid.

249
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,040
Actually, I know

250
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,480
whoever takes the back route

251
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,140
might choose to escape

252
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,790
and abandon us.

253
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,950
But you won't.

254
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,320
I believe you’ll come back to pick me up.

255
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,550
Don’t worry, Mai.

256
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,950
I’ll come back to pick you up in five days.

257
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,830
Be careful.

258
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,830
Also,

259
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,550
there are many people here today.

260
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,750
So I won't hug you now.

261
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,830
We are in a war.

262
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,560
And you still have time to joke?

263
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,830
Hang in there.

264
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,090
I'll hug you when I come back.

265
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,800
I'm leaving.

266
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,040
You must come back.

267
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,030
General.

268
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,310
According to the scouts,

269
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,190
when the sun rises,

270
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,790
there are traces of forces coming and going

271
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,170
at the gate of back camp of the Pingjia'ao walled city.

272
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,240
How many are there?

273
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,230
We don't know the specific number.

274
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,910
The scouts we sent were killed.

275
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,170
The Zhenbei Army has cleared the traces.

276
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,010
Did you find anything else?

277
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,690
There are traces of branches being cut off

278
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,750
on the west side of the Pingjia'ao walled city.

279
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,550
They sent troops to cut trees early in the morning.

280
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,070
Guys,

281
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,900
burn the fire up.

282
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:14,870
Okay.

283
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,510
Hurry up.

284
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,110
Mai.

285
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,110
Can you do it?

286
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,300
Yes.

287
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,170
Bring more firewoods.

288
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:26,990
Mai.

289
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,950
Can we fool Chang Yuqing?

290
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,480
No way.

291
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,960
How much wood do we have left this morning?

292
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,770
It's enough for a few days.

293
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,840
Don't burn them all.

294
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,070
Ask our men

295
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,910
to make some whip arrows.

296
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,510
We only have one battalion left guarding the city.

297
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,830
We also have to make whip arrows.

298
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,870
Then there's no one guarding the city wall.

299
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,550
Erdan.

300
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,860
Tell me,

301
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,740
what's the difference

302
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,870
when the armies are here and when there are only us?

303
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,790
Mai, I’m Erdan.

304
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,780
I’m not stupid.

305
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,440
The number of soldiers at the wall is different.

306
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,270
You're right.

307
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,630
The people at the city wall suddenly decreased.

308
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,490
Chang Yuqing will be suspicious.

309
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,310
We are doing this

310
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,590
to tell them

311
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,110
that our whole army is here.

312
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,070
So we need to make whip arrows to show them

313
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,590
that we're going to fight a long battle.

314
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,850
You are worth teaching.

315
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,470
We are making whip arrows here.

316
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,830
How can they see us?

317
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,800
Then I'll need you to take a run.

318
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,470
[Pingjia'ao]

319
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,710
[Shihukou Pass] [Lingfengdu River]

320
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,430
Brother,

321
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,070
the Zhenbei Army is chopping off bamboos now.

322
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,660
They are making bows and arrows

323
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,830
to dawdle with us.

324
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,270
Is that all you can see?

325
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,390
Brother, what do you want to test me again?

326
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,110
I'm stupid.

327
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,230
Can you just say it?

328
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,750
You're so stupid.

329
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,710
How are you going to lead troops in the future?

330
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,680
I'll follow you forever.

331
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,750
Look.

332
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,350
Although Pingjia'ao is easy to defend but hard to attack,

333
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,590
it's not natural barrier.

334
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,060
[Shihukou Pass] [Lingfengdu River]

335
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,069
If we try our best,

336
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,040
[Pingjia'ao]

337
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,270
we can take down this city in one day.

338
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,390
But look,

339
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,150
not only did the city tower have no defense today,

340
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,480
but it also had everyone to making arrows.

341
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,270
If we attack in a sudden,

342
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,280
they won't even have time to return.

343
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,410
What does this mean?

344
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,560
They are not afraid of us attacking the city.

345
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,760
You surrendered and leaked the secret?

346
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,700
-Jiang Chengyi is here to see the general.
-Brother.

347
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,270
Come in.

348
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,450
General.

349
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,150
How are you

350
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,630
living in the wounded soldiers' camp these days?

351
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,950
Thank you for your concern.

352
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,830
I'm used to it.

353
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,310
I came here today

354
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,950
because I know that the city wall of Pingjia'ao is empty.

355
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,390
If we attack the city now,

356
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,670
we can take it down.

357
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,270
General, please give the order.

358
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,350
I know what Deputy General Jiang is saying.

359
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,560
The Zhenbei Army has made a lot of whip arrows in the city.

360
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,670
It greatly hurts our army.

361
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,350
If we attack now,

362
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,430
I'm afraid we'll suffer heavy casualties.

363
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,110
I think Deputy General Jiang has learned how to

364
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,890
be considerate toward our soldiers these days.

365
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,070
What's your plan, General?

366
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,910
Please take the soldiers

367
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,630
to strengthen their armor

368
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,290
in order to defend the arrows.

369
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,630
All troops?

370
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,050
Any questions?

371
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,670
Brother.

372
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,950
I don't think he'll do it.

373
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,320
It doesn't matter.

374
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,790
What matters is

375
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,800

00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,510
you can't go back to Shengdu.

570
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,190
Don't worry.

571
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,300
Marquis Dingnan, accept the edict.

572
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,190
Yes.

573
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,810
Your Excellency,

574
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,050
the Zhenbei Army defeated the enemy.

575
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,150
You have performed meritorious service.

576
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,030
You are the hero of Nanxia.

577
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,110
I will name Marquis Dingnan, Chang Yizhi,

578
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,370
as the Grand Marshal of the Zhenbei Army.

579
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,580
I will bestow Qingzhou as the land of Marquis Dingnan's.

580
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,080
The generals of Zhenbei Army will be promoted.

581
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,990
This will be implemented by the officials.

582
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,390
The end.

583
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,070
Yes.

584
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,750
Congratulations, Marshal Shang.

585
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,010
The Beimo Army has shrunk and Yuzhou doesn’t dare to go out.

586
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:24,310
You should return to Shengdu to report yourself.

587
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,330
Sir,

588
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,930
although we just crashed Beimo,

589
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,670
but they didn't retreat.

590
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,830
I’m afraid once I leave the military camp,

591
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,540
Beimo will come back.

592
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,010
If we don't break Beimo,

593
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,790
we can't return it.

594
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,750
It's inappropriate.

595
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,920
I haven't seen my mother for a long time.

596
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,670
I've been missing her.

597
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,070
But in the war,

598
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,820
loyalty and filial piety can't be fulfilled at the same time.

599
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,310
Since you have come to Wulan Mountains,

600
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,320
we must treat you well.

601
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,430
Why don't you stay here for a few more days?

602
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,710
Although it's not bustling,

603
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,970
but there are some beautiful sceneries.

604
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,230
It's okay, Marshal Shang.

605
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,630
I’m here to announce the edict.

606
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,070
I'm going back to Shengdu to report.

607
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,650
Goodbye.

608
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,830
Fine.

609
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,360
Take care.

610
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,350
Spread the news that we defeated

611
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,280
the Beimo today.

612
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,030
The wider the better.

613
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,110
We must let all four states know as soon as possible that

614
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,910
there is a little God of War beside Marshal Shang of the Zhenbei Army.

615
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,670
Yes.

616
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:21,870
Thank you.

617
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,389
For what?

618
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:29,280
Thank you for letting me getting a step closer

619
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,230
to Chen Qi.

620
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,909
Mai.

621
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,620
You’ve met the people you should meet.

622
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,810
In the Yelanggou war,

623
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,830
you almost died.

624
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,620
I mean,

625
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,219
can you stop here?

626
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,260
Meeting him is not enough.

627
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,380
I will kill him myself.

628
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,510
If I can’t,

629
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,740
I’ll disappoint my parents.

630
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,230
Maybe this is

631
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,790
the fate of my life.

632
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:10,890
Fine.

633
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,870
I've been waiting for you to say that.

634
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,800
Your mission is my mission.

635
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,090
I'll attack wherever you point at.

636
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,080
If I see Chen Qi,

637
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,650
I'll be the first to rush up.

638
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,230
I'll stall him first.

639
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,060
Look at that flower,

640
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,880
is it pretty?

641
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,830
It is free from everything.

642
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,970
How great.

643
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,260
Let me put it on you.

644
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,470
Close your eyes.

645
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,860
What are you doing?

646
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,030
I wanted to wear the flower for you.

647
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,070
But I suddenly saw that

648
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,080
you were so beautiful.

649
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,840
I forgot about it.

650
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,310
One more time.

651
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,320
I knew you were trying to kiss me.

652
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,610
What are you talking about?

653
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,540
It is not enough.

654
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,910
Check the provisions in the army.

655
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,310
Report the result to me immediately.

656
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:55,990
Yes.

657
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,350
Sir.

658
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,150
Where are you going?

659
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,680
Can't you see I'm busy with military affairs?

660
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,140
A capable man works more.

661
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,070
You always have military affairs.

662
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,140
Zhang Shiqiang.

663
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,270
Hello, counsellor.

664
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,430
You aren’t training in the military ground,

665
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,270
instead, you are walking around with your battalion commander.

666
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,400
How inappropriate!

667
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,750
I...

668
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,430
Say it.

669
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,110
I...

670
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,140
I don't know.

671
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,190
No one praised your new name?

672
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,230
Yes, yes.

673
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,070
Everyone said Zhang Shiqiang...

674
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,310
Zhang Shiqiang...

675
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,230
Everyone said Zhang Shiqiang sounds well-educated.

676
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,500
Go, go.

677
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,800
Sir.

678
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,600
What do you want?

679
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,830
I miss you.

680
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,550
What's there to think about when we meet every day?

681
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,750
How can I not miss you?

682
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,310
I miss you.

683
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,690
Don't think that I don't know what you're thinking.

684
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,310
Last time you said you missed me.

685
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,790
You took dozens of soldiers away.

686
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,250
If this goes on,

687
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,020
the entire Zhenbei Army will be yours.

688
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,510
Sir.

689
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,390
Although it’s Marshal Shang

690
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,070
filled up the Seventh Battalion,

691
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,670
but without your agreement,

692
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,190
nothing will be done.

693
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,060
Mai.

694
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,120
Ask yourself.

695
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,420
How I treated your camp?

696
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,130
Am I not good enough to you?

697
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,120
You are good to us.

698
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,670
But...

699
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,920
Let’s talk about this.

700
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,850
When you said the Seventh Battalion lost the most,

701
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,320
I arranged everything for you right away.

702
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,030
If you go on like this,

703
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,950
how can I be fair?

704
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,590
Sir,

705
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,830
we have enough people.

706
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,830
But we don't have enough weapons.

707
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,310
There are so many recruits.

708
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,440
We can't give them sticks, right?

709
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,150
We're not monks.

710
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,080
What did you say?

711
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,160
My soldiers are not monks in the temple.

712
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,220
Fine.

713
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,570
No matter what you say this time, it’s useless.

714
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,340
Go to Marshal Shang if you dare.

715
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,570
That’s what I’m waiting for.

716
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,600
If I get from him later,

717
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,290
you can't go back on your word.

718
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,650
We have a deal.

719
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,430
Mai.

720
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,670
Mai.

721
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,480
Mai!

722
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,150
You’re the only one who dares to trick me.
