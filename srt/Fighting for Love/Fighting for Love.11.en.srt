00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,729
Qingzhou Army and Yuzhou Army will have a martial arts competition.

5
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:42,910
If the Qingzhou Army wins,

6
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,229
not only you will get the provisions,

7
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,470
but also have a bargaining chip to negotiate with the crown prince.

8
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,350
What if the Yuzhou Army wins?

9
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,990
Shut up.

10
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,470
What if the Yuzhou Army wins?

11
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,670
You have to die.

12
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,509
Are you crazy?

13
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,880
You gamble with Young Marquis's life?

14
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,160
Why are you shouting?

15
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,560
You're ruining the mood.

16
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,590
Get out and wait for me.

17

18
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,270
I’ll go.

Mai.

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,810
I knew you wouldn’t leave me alone.

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,710
Just say what you want to say.

24
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,079
I don't seem to have anything to say.

25
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,610
I just suddenly feel that

26
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,160
we don't spend much time together.

27
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,510
He shouldn't even be here.

28

Are you out of your mind?

29
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,430
Mr. Yang,

30
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,990
I have an idea.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,710
Would you like to hear it?

32
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,390
General Shi, tell me.

33
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,950
For those who practice martial arts, one's ability is the most important thing.

34
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,930
These Qingzhou soldiers risk their lives to protect Shang Yizhi

35
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,190
because they don't know Young Marquis's reputation

36
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,630
in Shengdu City.

37
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,150
They don’t know he’s a fool.

38
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,910
What do you mean?

39
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,910
Do you want me to compete with Shang Yizhi?

40
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,060
No, no.

41
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,270
There's a military competition in Yuzhou.

42
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,630
We'll let the Qingzhou soldiers and Yuzhou soldiers compete.

43
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,110
This Shang Yizhi is a fool.

44
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,870
Our Yuzhou Army is strong in every aspects.

45
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,070
And with Mr. Yang as the commander,

46
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,270
we can defeat Qingzhou soldiers effortlessly.

47
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,310
After the Qingzhou's military power collapsed,

48
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,910
we can deal with Shang Yizhi freely.

49
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,990
Without Qingzhou soldiers as backers,

50
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,950
so what if we force him to commit suicide?

51
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,390
General Shi,

52
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,310

63

You call that decent?

64
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,600
Compared to the Yuzhou Army,

In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle,

I-Is there anything?

193
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,470
You hesitated.

194
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,530
Put your hand back.

195
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,750
What is it?

196
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,070
Do you like him?

197
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:57,990
No.

198
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,870
Not even a bit.

199
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,390
No.

200
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,230
What about this much?

201
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,070
No.

202
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,720
Does he like you?

203
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,430
Don't talk nonsense.

204
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,460
Calm down.

205
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,670
My biggest strength

206
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,950
is a strong sense of responsibility.

207
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,590
Since everyone asked me,

208
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,950
I have the responsibility

209
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,470
to figure this out.

210
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:19,950
Right?

211
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,830
Now you know, It's not like that.

212
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,350
Fine.

213
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,510
Then swear to me.

214
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,190
I, Mai...

215
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,770
Why should I swear to you?

216
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,230
What does this have to do with you?

217
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,350
If you keep talking nonsense,

218
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,190
I'll beat you up.

219
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,830
Get out!

220
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,030
-Get out!
-Okay.

221
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,710
That's all for today.

222
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,680
I'll tell them.

223
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,100
They are waiting for me.

224
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,850
If I go out now,

225
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,270
will I meet Brother Tang?

226
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,010
Get lost!

227
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,310
I found that they lack of food recently.

228
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,350
Some of them went to Yuzhou to borrow provisions.

229
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,480
Okay. Go back and report immediately.

230
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,190
I also got another information.

231
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,080
The crown prince of Nanxia is in Qingzhou City.

232
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,410
He will also take the route to Yuzhou soon.

233
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,710
Crown prince...

234
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,750
I can see the whole picture just by looking at a small part of it.

235
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,750
The military discipline of Yuzhou Army is strict.

236
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,550
They are obviously trained from the battlefield.

237
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,920
Look at the physical differences.

238
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,750
It seems that Your Grace accept the challenge

239
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,810
because you have some hidden talent?

240
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,760
I've never been a general or lead any soldiers.

241
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,360
How can I be the talented one?

242
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,670
But in my camp,

243
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,900
everyone is brave and good at fighting.

244
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,110
I know that I can

245
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,070
accept the challenge.

246
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,560
Okay.

247
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,950
Let's wait and see on the arena.

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,710
Let's see.

249
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,830
The martial arts competition of Qingzhou and Yuzhou Army begins now.

250
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,000
The first battle is infantry battle.

251
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,950
Each army will send 20 people to close combat.

252
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,440
Use the drum as a signal.

253
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,720
One to get ready and two to go!

254
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,950
Three stops.

255
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,310
Before the third sound,

256
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,110
the one with more people standing wins.

257
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,310
But please remember,

258
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,580
Soldiers in both Qingzhou Army and Yuzhou Army

259
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,390
are the people of Nanxia.

260
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,070
Although we are practicing martial arts, we should be careful.

261
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,270
We shouldn't overdo.

262
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,870
The first round starts.

263
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,130
This...

264
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,430
We're about to lose.

265
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,200
Why are you not worried at all?

266
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,470
Our audience is not here yet.

267
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,710
It's already this hour.

268
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,110
The martial arts competition has begun.

269
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,670
General, should you go now?

270
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,000
No hurry.

271
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,890
We have strong soldiers and horses.

272
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,720
I don't have to go.

273
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,630
What you did today

274
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,430
is really worrying me.

275
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,760
Although I'm a woman,

276
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,910
I can understand some things.

277
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,910
What are you doing?

278
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,070
I have something to ask you.

279
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,330
I'll get up after you answer.

280
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,390
How are you going to ask like this?

281
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,350
Sit on the chair and ask.

282
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,410
Just one question.

283
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,350
Go ahead.

284
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,190
You dragged Qingzhou Army to participate in martial arts competition.

285
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,350
Do you have other intentions?

286
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:48,870
One question.

287
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,950
Come on, get up.

288
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,760
No.

289
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,290
Are you going to help Shang Yizhi?

290
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,870
He's a criminal.

291
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,870
You shouldn't take your old relationship into consideration.

292
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,510
General.

293
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,430
You can't lie to

294
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,790
your wife.

295
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,109
Pass it on.

296
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,150
A win is a win.

297
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,680
Don't push too hard.

298
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,829
If we hurt a few,

299
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,579
people will say our Yuzhou Army bullies the weak.

300
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,310
I picked them myself.

301
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,680
I know what to do.

302
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,350
In the first game,

303
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,150
Yuzhou Army won!

304
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,310
Yes! Yes! Yes!

305
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,190
We won!

306
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,350
Great!

307
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,710
We won!

308
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,550
A bunch of losers.

309
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,710
That's easy.

310
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,430
Report!

311
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,790
Who won?

312
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,590
Yuzhou Army won the first round.

313
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,990
Okay, I got it.

314
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,910
Madam.

315
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,390
One is my old master,

316
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,110
another one is the crown prince.

317
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,110
H-How can I choose?

318
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,350
Who will be the winner of this martial arts competition?

319
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,230
It depends on God's will.

320
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,070
Young Marquis has accepted the fate.

321
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,930
Accept my fate?

322
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,490
Let me put it this way.

323
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,870
Yes, I accept it.

324
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,040
I don’t understand.

325
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,430
Mu Bai is the most skilled among us.

326
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,670
Why don’t you let him go?

327
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,830
Calm down.

328
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,510
Let's follow the plan I told you.

329
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,310
What plan did you tell me?

330
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,430
Didn't I tell you?

331
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,780
I have a better candidate.

332
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,710
Mr. Yang.

333
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,910
General Shi.

334
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,790
You’re not in a hurry.

335
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,270
What's the rush?

336
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,870
The Yuzhou Army is strong in every aspects.

337
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,830
The show is about to start.

338
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,070
The second battle is cavalry battle.

339
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,030
With the drum as the command,

340
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,240
whoever takes the red silk from the other general

341
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,390
wins.

342
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,710
General.

343
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,150
In my opinion,

344
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,600
the Qingzhou Army was scared by us.

345
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,640
What a bunch of cowards.

346
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,390
It's not his fault.

347
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,390
Young Marquis has been favored since he was born.

348
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,920
He has never suffered a day.

349
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,970
It would be strange if he could lead an army well.

350
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,590
That also need you to agree

351
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,350
to play with him.

352
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,630
Wang Xun,

353
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,470
I've told you many times.

354
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Watch your mouth.

355
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,270
General,

356
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,190
If you think I'm an eyesore,

357
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,920
I'll go down and play with them.

358
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,790
Okay.

359
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,700
On behalf of the Qingzhou Army, I'll fight against five.

360
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,030
Tang Shaoyi.

361
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,870
He's alone.

362
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,870
Can he do it?

363
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,520
I forgot to tell you.

364
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,650
He wants to join our Qingzhou Army long ago.

365
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,590
If we can,

366
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,700
take him.

367
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,870
If we fail this time,

368
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,130
Yang Xuan will kill me.

369
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,460
Don't worry.

370
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,770
I haven't told you yet.

371
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,790
He used to be

372
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,230
Yinbao City's lieutenant of cavalry.

373
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,630
Did you see the maroon horse he rode?

374
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,430
He trained it himself.

375
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,910
I saw the maroon horse.

376
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,390
The color of his horse has nothing to do with

377
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,910
he fighting against five.

378
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,110
This move is called "Manipulation."

379
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,840
Remember.

380
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,700
Manipulation.

381
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,890
[Order]

382
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,930
Kill them!

383
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,760
We won!

384
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,680
The Qingzhou Army won!

385
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,670
Yes! Yes!

386
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,950
We won!

387
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,710
Won.

388
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,270
How did he win?

389
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,870
You saw it.

390
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,870
I'm only half dead now.

391
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,390
Can he join our Qingzhou Army this time?

392
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,940
Let's wait and see.

393
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,790
Pass it down.

394
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,440
The martial arts competition is over today.

395
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,470
Mr. Yang,

396
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,030
why?

397
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,550
With the Yuzhou Army's strength,

398
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,030
we lose even if we draw.

399
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,550
Let alone losing one game.

400
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,230
Besides,

401
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,520
how do you know they don't have countermeasures?

402
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,670
Mr. Yang,

403
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,230
even if we lose,

404
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,910
we can just take Shang Yizhi back to the prison.

405
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,520
We'll compensate him some food at most.

406
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
What does it have to do with Mr. Yang?

407
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,110
Besides, our Yuzhou Army is trying hard.

408
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,790
We will win the third round.

409
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,030
Mr. Yang,

410
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,230
why are you discouraging at this critical moment?

411
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,030
Fine.

412
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,550
I was just saying.

413
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,710
Military orders are like a mountain,

414
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,150
and can't be changed easily.

415
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,950
That's right.

416
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,910
If we stop now,

417
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,190
as if our Yuzhou Army is afraid of them.

418
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,710
The third round starts.

419
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,820
Third round.

420
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,190
Offense-defense Battle.

421
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,400
According to the draw,

422
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,800
Yuzhou is the attacker and Qingzhou is the defender.

423
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,330
The hourglass is the timer.

424
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,740
Within the time limit,

425
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,640
Yuzhou wins if it took the enemy's flag.

426
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,840
If it failed to take the flag, Qingzhou wins.

427
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,990
Protect the flag.

428
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,370
Young Marquis.

429
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,710
Sprinkle the powder.

430
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,130
What is this? What...

431
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,270
The game is over.

432
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,830
Qingzhou Army won!

433
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,020
We won!

434
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,990
We won!

435
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,670
We won!

436
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,910
You guys are cheating.

437
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,110
What are you talking about?

438
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,710
Who are you calling cheater?

439
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,070
You cheated!

440
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,750
Don't you know war is full of tricks?

441
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,350
The Beimo soldiers have more evil tricks than this.

442
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,350
Are you accusing them of cheating on the battlefield?

443
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,390
You...

444
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,830
Shi Dachun.

445
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,550
Did you do it on purpose?

446
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,790
Mr. Yang,

447
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,030
Why do you say that?

448
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,510
You've always been the military inspector.

449
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,550
You are watching my every moves.

450
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,910
Soldiers fight bravely.

451
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,520
Mai.

452
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,850
I’ve arranged someone

453
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,270
to send you out tomorrow.

454
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,870
As for how to go to Beimo,

455
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,710
you have to figure it out yourself.

456
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,370
What do you mean, General Shi?

457
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,890
Where did you take Young Marquis?

458
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,190
I am not the one who took him.

459
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,790
The crown prince wanted to kill Young Marquis.

460
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,910
As for how to save Young Marquis,

461
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,270
there is nothing I can do now.

462
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,750
Mr. Shi, please wait.

463
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,790
Since Young Marquis is my friend,

464
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,070
I won’t leave him alone.

465
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,830
You are so righteous.

466
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,400
General Shi.

467
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,230
I always speak my mind.

468
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,950
As far as I know,

469
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,710
the crown prince is here for military power,

470
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,350
right?

471
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,870
You even know that?

472
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,590
Yes.

473
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,910
Because the crown prince has no military power,

474
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,750
so he is in an awkward position in the imperial court.

475
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,390
He tried to win me over and over again.

476
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,910
I didn't want to get involved in the fight between the princes.

477
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,390
So I didn't give him a clear answer.

478
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,710
Young Marquis has just left Shengdu.

479
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,230
His foundation is not yet stable in the local.

480
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,290
Young Marquis's shallow foundation

481
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,910
is the bargaining chip for us to rescue him.

482
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,770
Do you have an idea?

483
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,910
Is there any martial arts competition in Yuzhou recently?

484
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,470
Yes.

485
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,490
Young Marquis.

486
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,360
Uncle Shi.

487
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,050
It’s all on you.

488
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,930
Young Marquis is still so naughty.

489
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,210
Young Marquis.

490
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,620
You're good at using troops.

491
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,990
I admit it.

492
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,470
All the provisions I promised will be delivered.

493
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,820
Thank you, Uncle Shi.

494
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,870
General.

495
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,310
General.

496
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,790
The crown prince was abducted by the Beimo Army.

497
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,190
Please save His Majesty.

498
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,230
Young Marquis.

499
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,290
It's an emergency.

500
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,190
Let's go inside and discuss it.

501
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:58,830
Let's go.

502
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,000
What? You want me to save him?

503
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,600
Save the crown prince.

504
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,460
You lead the army.

505
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,670
You are in luck.

506
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,150
Uncle Shi,

507
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,190
I’m grateful

508
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,930
for your help.

509
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,080
But we both know

510
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,680
why crown prince came here.

511
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,650
Now you want me to save him?

512
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,920
I want to avoid him instead.

513
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,190
I didn't make it clear to the Young Marquis.

514
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,430
It's normal for you to misunderstand.

515
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,030
Fine.

516
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:34,940
[Shi]

517
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,710
I proposed to train soldiers

518
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,990
because I want a military coalition between Qingzhou and Yuzhou.

519
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,650
A military coalition?

520
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,030
Chang Yuqing led the elite cavalries of Beimo

521
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,350
to attack Yinbao and disappeared.

522
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,310
According to the military report,

523
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,710
there's no news regarding Qinshan sentry.

524
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,390
I guess it's the fall of the sentry.

525
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,350
Based on this,

526
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,130
the final target of the Beimo Army

527
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,630
should be the Jingyang Pass.

528
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,690
The people from Beimo worked together from inside

529
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,830
to breach Jingyang.

530
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,260
[Shi]

531
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,950
This is just a speculation.

532
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,950
But the Beimo Army is strong.

533
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,110
Your Qingzhou Army is weak.

534
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,630
If Qingzhou and Yuzhou can't form a military coalition,

535
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,710
we will lose Qingzhou and Yuzhou will be in danger.

536
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,230
By then, when the Beimo Army marches into Jingyang,

537
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,750
no one can stop them at the border.

538
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,060
I see.

539
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,710
You won the martial arts competition this time.

540
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,910
You can convince the people.

541
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,070
If a military coalition formed between Qingzhou and Yuzhou,

542
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,470
you'll be the commander in chief.

543
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,710
If you become the commander in chief of Qingzhou and Yuzhou,

544
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,590
the sword that tries to kill you

545
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,590
will become a shield to protect you.

546
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,710
Uncle Shi is really cunning.

547
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,390
No.

548
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,790
You are old but vigorous.

549
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,990
No, no, not old.

550
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,120
It doesn't matter if I'm old.

551
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,270
I hope you can be a good general

552
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,060
like the Old Marquis.

553
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:03,800
[Shi]

554
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,990
Don’t worry, Uncle Shi.

555
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,650
I’ll lead the military coalition to save crown prince.

556
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,280
I'm late.

557
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,490
Please forgive me.

558
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,480
[City Guard Mansion]

559
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,350
Shang Yizhi.

560
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

561
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,590
I can kill you

562
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,440
or let you go.

563
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,930
But you saved me.

564
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,470
We are even.

565
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,110
General Shi Dachun sneaked into Beimo's camp

566
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,970
and captured more than 20 of them.

567
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,350
He bravely saved the crown prince.

568
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,670
He's highly skilled in scheming and made great contributions.

569
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,930
He will be rewarded with 1,000 dan of military provisions.

570
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,230
Thank you, Your Highness.

571
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,810
Your Highness.

572
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,720
The Beimo Army is very aggressive.

573
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,830
In my opinion,

574
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,590
only a military coalition between Qingzhou and Yuzhou can protect the people.

575
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,389
Defend Shengdu to fight against foreign enemies.

576
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,949
Of course we’ll listen to General Shi.

577
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,590
I was attacked by bandits in Beimo.

578
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,900
Moreover, the enemy situation in Beimo is unpredictable.

579
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,949
I must go back to Shengdu immediately

580
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,350
to report to His Majesty.

581
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,030
Farewell, Your Highness.

582
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,080
General Shang.

583
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,070
The next time we meet,

584
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,949
It will be our first meeting.

585
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,630
Young Marquis didn't us down.

586
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,840
[To Counsellor Xu, we've received the provisions in Yuzhou]

587
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,540
Not only did he get the provisions,

588
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,590
but also became the commander in chief of Qingyu military coalition

589
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,920
Send His Grace's order.

590
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,650
Wei Peng and Liang Shao will guard Qingzhou.

591
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,200
Select a troop of elite soldiers

592
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,790
and follow me to Yuzhou.

593
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,430
Yes.

594
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:33,430
Awesome!

595
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,950
What's wrong? Can you add more?

596
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,230
Awesome!

597
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,910
More!

598
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,750
Good!

599
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:45,100
Way to go! Way to go!

600
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:51,230
Way to go! Way to go!

601
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,160
Lieutenant.

602
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,630
What's wrong?

603
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,310
Is this the strength of your Yuzhou Army?

604
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,470
Lieutenant Tang,

605
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,830
your training is very strange.

606
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,880
We've never seen or trained like this.

607
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,010
Aren't you bullying Lieutenant Wang?

608
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,670
Yes, you are bullying us.

609
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,670
Yes, bullies, bullies.

610
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:13,570
How can you be defeated by a posture when you have the strength?

611
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,950
If Nanxia Army

612
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,270
gave up like this,

613
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,840
how can we resist the Beimo Army?

614
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,750
Lieutenant Wang,

615
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,160
can you do more?

616
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,680
Again.

617
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,590
Okay.

618
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,310
Okay!

619
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,310
Awesome!

620
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,510
We just settled down Mr. Xu

621
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,440
and stationed Qingzhou soldiers.

622
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,840
Then we came here to inspect the training of Yuzhou Army.

623
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,030
Now both Qingzhou and Yuzhou Army are yours.

624
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,830
You can rest assured now, right?

625
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,700
The Qingzhou and Yuzhou Army has two forces now.

626
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,680
How to combine these two forces

627
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,440
is what I'm most worried about.

628
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,420
Well done.

629
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,080
You look like a general now.

630
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,080
I'm not kidding.

631
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,640
I'm really worried.

632
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,150
It's simple.

633
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,560
As long as you take these recruits

634
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,270
out of the city.

635
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,970
No matter it’s bandits or a ranger,

636
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,630
as long as they can fight two real battles,

637
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,800
they'll be successful.

638
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,470
You're so smart.

639
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,430
It would be better if you could stay by my side forever.

640
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,070
Enough.

641
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,090
Don't whine in broad daylight.

642
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,760
Your problem is solved,

643
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,890
I have to think about a way to get to Beimo.

644
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,980
What Beimo?

645
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,450
There's still a war.

646
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,250
What does war have to do with me?

647
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,250
I'm neither a soldier nor a general.

648
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,570
Let's go.

649
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,030
I mean after the war is over,

650
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,090
we can go to Beimo with you.

651
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,910
When can we finish this war?

652
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,030
If you beat away Beimo, then there's Xihu.

653
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,360
You want to me to stay by your side forever?

654
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,230
I mean,

655
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,350
after this is over,

656
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,010
no one can change my decision.

657
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,470
I...

658
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,400
Don’t follow me.

659
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,210
What’s wrong, Mai?

660
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,320
Why pulling a long face?

661
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,710
Did someone bully you?

662
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,030
Brother.

663
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,750
I have something to tell you.

664
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,710
I plan to go to Beimo.

665
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,280
You've made your decision?

666
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,470
I know I can't persuade you.

667
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,950
But good men are ambitious.

668
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,550
If there is something you want to do,

669
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,190
try your best to do it.

670
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,190
Stop nagging

671
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,350
like a sissy.

672
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,680
Brother,

673
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,480
I have something to tell you.

674
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,390
Xiu'er…

675
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,070
Mai.

676
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,870
Now we’re going to face enemies.

677
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,670
I don't want any relationships.

678
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,450
I'm just saying.

679
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,900
Look how scared you are.

680
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,310
Let’s go.

681
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,380
Mai.

682
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,340
Let’s have a drink before you leave.

683
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,430
Okay.

684
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,380
You've been busy all day. Go back and rest.

685
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,210
Yes.

686
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,260
Are you here to make peace?

687
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,320
I have something to tell you.

688
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,380
Let's talk inside.

689
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,380
Let's talk here.

690
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,380
Go ahead.

691
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,910
I’m leaving.

692
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,350
I plan to go to Jingyang Pass to try my luck.

693
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,030
Maybe I can get out.

694
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,350
I don’t understand.

695
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,350
Why do you have to go to Beimo?

696
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,910
A woman going there alone.

697
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,790
Is it even safe?

698
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,670
Don't you know me?

699
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,030
I cherish my life the most.

700
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,640
I never do dangerous things.

701
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,930
Otherwise, I wouldn't have survived until now.

702
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,430
What about Xu Xiu'er?

703
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,950
Are you going to leave her alone in Yuzhou?

704
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,460
Is that taking responsibility?

705
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,660
I've entrusted Xiu'er to Brother Tang.

706
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,070
But Brother Tang is careless.

707
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,030
If you want to help taking care of Xiu'er,

708
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,990
you can do that.

709
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,350
Stop!
