[Episode 17]

4
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,870
Brother.

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,150
Brother.

6
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,150
Why didn't you invite me?

7
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,800
Brother.

8
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,670
I'm suffocating in the city.

9
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,270
Nanxia people's cities are really narrow.

10
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,130
Even a horse can't run through it.

11
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,950
Brother.

12
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,190
I told you.

13
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,590
When I came out this time,

14
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,350
my father went to that girl's house to propose marriage.

15
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,270
If I don't bring back some military honors this time,

16
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,830
she will laugh at me.

17
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,170
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,270
When I come back next time,

19
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,070
I'll prepare a good gift for you.

20
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,120
Brother,

21
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,870
isn't the gift in the Wulan Mountains?

22
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,390
I don't want to trouble you any further.

23
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,710
Take me into the mountains.

24
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,130
I can get it myself.

25
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,390
Fine.

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,750
If I don't say yes this time,

27
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,430
I'll get calluses on my ears.

28
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,040
With your braggy personality,

29
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,240
it is indeed time to find someone to keep an eye on you.

30
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,070
Brother.

31
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,930
When are you getting married?

32
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,870
There's no hurry.

33
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,630
You're right.

34
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,130
There are so many girls in the capital who fancy you.

35
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,550
The third daughter of the Zhou family,

36
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,870
the old lord's granddaughter,

37
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,270
and the eldest daughter of that old man from the Ministry of War.

38
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,130
But I've never seen my brother attracted to anyone.

39
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:58,860
Brother,

40
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,470
what kind of girl do you like?

41
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,190
Not like them, anyway.

42
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,390
You must be careful this time.

43
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,270
Be alert.

44
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,150
All right, let's go.

45
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,210
Go back and pack up.

46
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,310
Yes.

47
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,640
What are you looking for, Mai?

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,350
Nothing.

49
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,070
Mai.

50
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,200
I’ll bring it to you.

51
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,400
It's late. Let's go.

52
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,870
Okay.

53
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,030
Come here.

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,150
Take the sticks.

55
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,020
Take these.

56
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,310
I'm fine, look...

57
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,550
Keep your eyes on your feet.

58
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,550
I have no problem walking.

59
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,110
Mai.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,829
Mai. Here.

61
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,670
Use this.

62
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,470
I don't need the sticks, I'm fine, really.

63
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,310
Are you really okay?

64
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,430
Yes. Go back.

65
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,030
Mu Bai.

66
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,950
Take it for him.

67
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,610
Okay, leave it with me.

68
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,270
We’ll take care of Mai.

69
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,910
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

70
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,470
Don’t worry. Go back.

71
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,270
Take care.

72
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,720
Go back.

73
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,870
Let's go.

74
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,329
You guys are really close.

75
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,670
Mai,

76
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,960
your place is ready.

77
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,090
It's next to my tent.

78
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,990
Okay.

79
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,160
Mu Bai.

80
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,590
I don't know why he asked me to come here.

81
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,150
Young Marquis asked you to be on night duty.

82
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,370
Actually, I...

83
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,470
What's wrong with being on night duty? It's good.

84
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,110
Thank you.

85
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,110
Well, thank you then.

86
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,870
I'll take these myself.

87
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,550
No, no, no.

88
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,079
-No, you can’t.
-I can do it.

89
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,110
Sleeping alone in such a big place

90
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,310
must be quiet, right?

91
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,070
I'll keep watch tonight.

92
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,190
Sleep easy.

93
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,840
What are you talking about?

94
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,990
What are you doing?

95
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,710
I asked you to come so you could get some rest.

96
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,270
It's better in here.

97
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,070
If you want to take a bath,

98
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,110
I also included a hot bath for you.

99
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,310
You asked me to be on night duty

100
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,470
so I could sleep here?

101
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,630
You even prepared a hot bath for me?

102
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,270
Yes. If you want to take a bath,

103
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,590
you can take one anytime.

104
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,270
Really?

105
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:13,910
Nevermind.

106
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,120
What if someone sees me?

107
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,760
What would we do?

108
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,430
The only person who could possibly see you in the shower

109
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,230
is me,

110
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,710
and I've already seen it.

111
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,750
It's boring.

112
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,970
So are you going to take a bath?

113
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,510
No.

114
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,510
It's late. I'm going to bed.

115
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,070
Okay.

116
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,160
What are you looking at?

117
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,110
Well...

118
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,150
I can accept it.

119
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,040
But for some things, if it's too fast,

120
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,790
I can't stand it.

121
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,630
Let's sleep.

122
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,150
General,

123
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,290
the entrance to the valley is three miles ahead.

124
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,070
Scout forsaken horses and enter the mountains.

125
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,870
See if there are any Nanxia posts within two miles.

126
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,830
Yes sir.

127
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,060
The rest of you, go into the forest and hide.

128
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,030
Stand by.

129
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,390
Yes sir.

130
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,860
You're awake.

131
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,030
Come in.

132
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,880
I'm not going in.

133
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,930
If I go in, you'll hit me again.

134
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,289
Where did you get this?

135
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,590
You lost it.

136
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,390
I found it

137
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,510
with the clothes that you threw away.

138
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,790
I didn't mean it.

139
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,830
Are you angry?

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,640
No.

141
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,590
Fine.

142
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,510
Since you're so good at weaving,

143
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,370
make another one for me next time.

144
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,980
What can I do for you? Tell me.

145
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,870
What is that?

146
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,470
What?

147
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,750
C-c-come out.

148
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,510
Come out?

149
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,750
What's wrong?

150
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,320
This...

151
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,270
What?

152
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,090
What are you doing?

153
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,750
What?

154
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,930
Weren't you trying to coax me?

155
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,470
I'll coax myself then.

156
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,150
I'll beat you up.

157
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,310
Go ahead.

158
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,970
After you beat me up, you'd still have to coax me.

159
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,910
Boring.

160
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,160
Let me take you somewhere.

161
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,750
According to the scout,

162
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,430
there is no ambush within two miles.

163
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,250
General, why don't you want to go into the mountains?

164
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,630
Deputy General Jiang, you seem anxious.

165
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,910
I'm just worried that there will be more trouble.

166
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,710
Order the scout to go two miles further.

167
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,310
Yes sir.

168
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,870
Cui Yan, Mo Yu.

169
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,670
Come with me.

170
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,040
It's so dark already. Where is the meteor?

171
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,110
Just wait.

172
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,430
According to reliable sources,

173
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,270
it will happen tonight.

174
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,730
What are you doing?

175
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,660
I-I-I'm just practicing.

176
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,760
No, no.

177
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,430
I mean I'm practicing

178
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,510
the look I'll make when I close my eye

179
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,270
when the meteor comes.

180
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,790
You have to do the same.

181
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,990
When you make a wish,

182
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,030
you have to close your eyes.

183
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,160
Otherwise, your wish won't come true.

184
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,490
Okay, close your eyes.

185
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,120
Meteor! Meteor! Meteor!

186
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,100
It's really here!

187
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,400
The meteor is really here.

188
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
It's gone so soon.

189
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,190
Have you gone dumb?

190
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,300
That was so spectacular.

192
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,070
Nothing.

193
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,210

194

Let's go.

195
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,670
Wait.

196
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,910
According to reliable sources,

197
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,790
there'll be another wave tonight.

198
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,500
One wish is enough.

199

200
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,040

Young Marquis.

203
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,730
General is back.

204
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,630
Mu Bai.

205
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,190
What did you do this time

206
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,190
to make Sir angry?

207
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,160
Luckily we came back in time.

208
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't have kept your head.

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,640
Sir.

210
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,590
Don't hold back on my account.

211
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,330
Give him the scolding that he deserves.

212
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:17,970

213
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,070
What’s the offence

214
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,560
for leaving camp late at night without permission?

215
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,070
Sir, don’t worry.

216
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,440
Mai and I are not young anymore.

217
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,470
We have our own sense of propriety.

218
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,830
But there are things

219
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,680
that we can't talk too much about.

220
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,730
We made a big discovery while we were out of town.

221
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,590
What discovery?

222
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,510
Mai found Beimo soldiers.

223
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,190
Are you sure?

224
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,520
I saw it with my own eyes.

225
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,070
They're 10 miles away from the military camp.

226
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,070
General.

227
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,070
We must adjust our defense immediately

228
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,200
and gather the generals for a meeting.

229
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,870
Mu Bai.

230
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:56,990
Yes.

Gather the generals for a meeting.

232
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,320
Also,

233
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,070
get the scouts to leave the city and increase the defense.

234
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,590
Yes sir.

235
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:06,830
Mai.

236
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,470
We're about to talk about important matters here.

237
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,910
Why are you not returning to camp to reflect

238
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,310
and still standing here?

239
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,190
Sir.

240
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,030
I can...

241
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,300
I promise I'll just listen and not interrupt.

242
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,920
Mai.

243
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,910
Don’t try anything.

244

Don't forget what you promised me.

246
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,150
Yes sir.

247
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,990
General.

248
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,790
Don’t let Mai

249
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,550
participate in military affairs.

250
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,610
Especially when it concerns Chen Qi.

251
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,120
I understand, sir.

252
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,800
But will Chen Qi really lead the army into the mountains?

253
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,990
Chen Qi lost in the battle of Yelanggou,

254
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,520
but it was due to chaos in the middle troops.

255
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,950
If I’m right,

256
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,750
it’s probably related to Mai.

257
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,790
In that battle,

258
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,510
Beimo actually didn't lose much of their main force.

259
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,950
Although we won, our army was greatly wounded.

260
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,590
If Chen Qi wants to attack the mountains directly,

261
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,550
I think

262
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,870
we are already trapped now.

263
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,950
I left something behind.

264
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,940
I'll leave after I take it.

265
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,430
I really forgot something.

266

Mai.

267
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,790
Sir said

268
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,550
no one is allowed to enter.

269
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,910
-I…
-If you really left something,

270
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,589
I'll send it to you after this is over.

The security in the camp was suddenly tightened.

275

Did the enemy attack?

276
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,589
I just got the news

277
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,569
that Beimo has sent scouts into the mountain late at night.

278
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,079
If my guess is right,

279
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,520
in the darkness,

280
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,010
they are trying their best

281

to find out where our army is.

282
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,160
How dare they make a comeback after being defeated?

283
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,710
Chen Qi's army lost to us

284
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,420
when our troops were less than 30% of his.

285
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,920
No matter what the reason is,

286
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,130
he's been disgraced.

287
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,700
So we must be careful this time.

288
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,350
They will try their best

289

to regain their dignity.

290

Who will he send?

291
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,970
Chen Qi has two generals.

292
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,090
Zhou Zhiren is experienced but cautious.

293
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,230
Chang Yuqing is good at fighting and resourceful.

294
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,390
I think the latter is more likely

295
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,670
to have led troops to the mountain without a sound.

296
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,150
Well,

297
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,590
are you all scared by the name of the killer general?

298
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,720
I don't believe

299
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,800
Chang Yuqing is smarter than others.

General.

301
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,930
It's not that I'm trying to aid the enemy.

302
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,870
In war, you should know yourself and your enemy.

303
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,590
Chang Yuqing is a military genius.

304
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,910
Behind the scenes, he is good at deploying troops.

305
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,550
On the battlefield, he can take the head of a general.

306
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,950
If we fight him head-on,

307
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,530
with the Zhenbei Army's current strength,

308
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,270
we might not be able to stop him.

Once Chen Qi sets off from the Wulan Mountains,

312

we will be attacked from both sides.

313
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,860
Lieutenant Tang is right.

314
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,830
So we must

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,230

which is easy to defend and hard to attack.

325
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,750
We can take advantage of the Wulan Mountains' terrain

326
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,360
and wait for the opportunity to make a quick move.

327

Is she not in the tent?

How would I know?

439
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,430
You didn't even report to Battalion Commander Lu.

00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,560
Go and greet him.

449
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,360
You are indeed a soldier from the Seventh Battalion.

There are more enemies than our own people.

00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,200
Everyone, speak up.

457
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,750
I'll go first.

458
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,790
We'll go down the mountain and fight them,

459
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,960
pretend to retreat

460
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,260
and lure them here.

Okay?

462
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,710
Okay.

463
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,830

You’ve been with Commander Shang for the longest time.

466
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,770
You’re a smart man too.

467
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,510
Say something.

468
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,500
Battalion Commander Lu.

469
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,440
Do you know if we're battling against

470
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,320
Chen Qi or Chang Yuqing this time?

471
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,910
It should be Chen Qi's general,

472
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,790
Chang Yuqing.

473
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,790
If it's Chang Yuqing,

474
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,390
then he's bringing cavalry.

475
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,120
We don't have any advantage in going head-to-head with him.

476
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,440
But he is a competitive person.

477
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,630
We can use that

478
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,390
to lead them to the depths of the forest.

479
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,070
Why lead them there?

480
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,150
Think about it.

481
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,750
After luring them deep into the forest,

482
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,950
their cavalry won't be able to run, right?

483
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,350
Won't we, the infantry, have an advantage?

484
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,510
Yes.

485
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,430
Sergeant, this is good.

486
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,310
This is good.

487
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,200
I'll continue.

488
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,240
Go ahead.

489
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,950
We'll split into four teams.

490
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,950
One side will attack them

491
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,830
and the other side will retreat.

492
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,750
At the end,

493
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,310
Let's gather at Shihukou Pass.

494
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
How's that sound?

495
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,230
Okay.

496
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,750
What do you think?

497
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,350
Good idea.

498
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,110
Not bad.

499
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,340
Arrows.

500
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,930
Young Marquis.

501
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:47,710
Have you found him?

502
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,550
There's no sign of him for two miles.

503
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,350
Search again.

504
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,160
Yes sir.

505
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,720
How long will you delay this for Mai?

506
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,990
All the soldiers outside

507
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,850
are waiting your order, General.

508
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,150
You guys go first.

509
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,190
I'll find her myself.

510
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,050
Young Marquis.

511
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,230
You're the main general of the army.

512
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,810
You can't see the big picture and you're not calm.

513
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,590
Have you forgotten

514
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,140
everything that I've taught you?

515
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,550
Both you and I know

516
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,520
that the Seventh Battalion will fight General Chang Yuqing

517
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,650
directly this time.

518
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,230
I...

519
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,110
So what?

520
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,470
Since they're the bait,

521
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,910
they have to be sacrificed if necessary.

522
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,790
Since Lu Gang volunteered,

523
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,450
he would have thought of that.

524
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,790
In your heart,

525
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,030
is Mai’s life

526
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,790
more precious than the lives of all the men of the Seventh Battalion?

527
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,840
What if we compare Mai

528
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,640
and the lives of all the soldiers

529
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,560
of the the Zhenbei Army?

530
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,390
People like Mai with no respect for military rules

531
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,920
and who are prone to disobedience,

532
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,750
she'll have to be punished by military law even if she comes back.

533
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,790
Otherwise, it's hard to convince the public.

534
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,480
General, don't blame me for being rude.

535
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,550
The enemy is in front of us.

536
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,150
If you abandon the whole army today,

537
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,840
don't blame the whole army for letting you down in the future.

538
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,200
General.

539
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,720
We should focus on the overall situation.

540
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,560
Strike camp!

541
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,560
General.

542
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,350
Mai really left the camp with the Seventh Battalion.

543
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,480
Make sure you bring them all back to me.

544
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,620
Yes, sir.

545
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,950
Brothers, follow me!

546
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,760
Yes sir.

547
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,230
Brother,

548
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,790
when are we going to attack the mountain?

549
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:50,840
[Chang]

550
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,990
What's the rush?

551
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,070
I'm afraid that the Nanxia soldiers would see your banner

552
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,270
and run away immediately.

553
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,600
We would've come all this way for nothing.

554
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,040
Brother, there's an ambush!

555
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,760
It's that thief.

556
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,760
Retreat!

557
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,800
[Chang]

558
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,230
Retreat!

559
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,280
Get on your horses! After them!

560
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,670
Run!

561
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,040
Mai, they’ve fallen for our trick.

562
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,240
Let’s split up.

563
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,280
See you at Shihukou Pass.

564
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,950
Okay.

565
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,990
Let's go.

566
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:35,990
Brother.

567
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,190
They've split up. Should we chase them?

568
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,350
Split up and pursue them. Go!

569
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,240
Hurry!

570
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,830
Mai.

571
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,010
Have a rest here.

572
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,660
Sure.

573
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,230
Take a rest.

574
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,940
You can have some water.

575
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,540
Hurry!

576
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,480
Drink some water, guys.

577
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,790
Be alert.

578
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,470
Mai.

579
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,990
Nice move.

580
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,360
We've finally gotten away from the Beimo people.

581
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,830
Beimo dogs.

582
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,640
You're nothing.

583
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,060
I'll lead my men to the west.

584
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,480
Yang Mo, to the east.

585
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,600
Mai, lead your men to the south.

586
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,110
Liang Er, to the north.

587
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,630
Yes sir.

588
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,170
If you see a red arrow in the air,

589
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,830
that means this team has died for the country.

590
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,830
The living must not wait any longer.

591
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,790
You can leave with Lieutenant Tang at Shihukou Pass.

592
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,429
Mai.

593
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,440
If I don't come back,

594
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,500
you'll be the Battalion Commander of the Seventh Battalion.

595
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,060
Yes sir.

596
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,429
I entrust my brothers to you.

597
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,449
Remember,

598
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,260
you must bring all the survivors

599
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,389
back in one piece.

600
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,010
No one is to be left behind.

601
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,080
We'll all be alive.

602
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,389
Go!

603
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,790
Are they all dead?

604
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:54,989
Mai.

605
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,160
Let’s stop here.

606
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,770
Let's fight them to the death.

607
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,950
To the death!

608
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,800
Fight! Fight! Fight!

609
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,460
No.

610
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,670
We have fewer people.

611
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,720
We'll definitely die if we do this.

612
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,220
I don't care.

613
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,930
I'll fight them to death!

614
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,590
Fight! Fight!

615
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,590
Fight with them!

616
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,160
Battalion Commander Lu entrusted you to me.

617
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,210
That means I can't lose any of you.

618
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,500
Do you hear me?

619
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,270
But what about Battalion Commander Lu?

620
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,210
Who will avenge Battalion Commander Lu?

621
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,280
Sergeant!

622
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,840
It's not that we're not avenging him.

623
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,090
It's not the time.

624
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:47,790
Let's go.

625
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,140
Listen to me. Go!

626
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,350
Go.

627
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,110
Go! Go!

628
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,850
Lieutenant Tang.

629
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,250
There's no trace of the Seventh Battalion.

630
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,140
Search again.

631
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,320
Yes sir.

632
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,280
Hurry!

633
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,550
Hurry up.

634
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,320
Hurry!

635
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,190
Can this bridge hold?

636
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,390
We have to go through it.

637
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,800
Brothers, don't rest.

638
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,590
We'll be safe at Shihukou Pass.

639
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,520
Get up.

640
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,190
Get up.

641
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,430
Guys, get up.

642
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,140
Get up.

643
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:07,950
Hurry!

644
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,950
The pursuers are here.

645
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,990
Run!

646
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,470
-Go! Hurry!
-Go!

647
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,870
-Go!
-Hurry!

648
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,310
-Hurry!
-Hurry up!

649
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,310
-Cover!
-Hurry!

650
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,000
The bridge deck is broken.

651
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,740
We can't let too many people cross at the same time.

652
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,230
Hurry, let's go.

653
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,200
Hurry!

654
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,520
Kill them!

655
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,430
Kill them!

656
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,190
Go! Go!

657
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,200
Hurry!

658
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,190
Deputy General Cui.

659
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,790
I'll go get reinforcements.

660
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,470
Let’s go.

661
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,190
Mai.

662
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,870
Mai! Run!

663
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,690
Leave me alone. Go after him!

664
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,910
Mai! Hurry! Mai!

665
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,070
Hurry! Hurry!

666
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,150
Mai! Hurry!

667
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,670
Run! Mai!

668
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,950
Hurry! Mai!

669
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,190
Hurry! Hurry!

670
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,190
Run! Mai! Hurry!

671
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,710
Mai! Mai!

672
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:54,310
Mai! Mai!

673
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,190
Cut down the bridge!

674
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,440
Cut down the bridge!

675
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,310
Brothers!

676
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,390
Retreat!

677
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,190
Let's go.

678
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,150
Report!

679
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,070
General.

680
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,550
The Nanxia soldiers are still fighting.

681
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,720
Deputy General Cui is seriously injured and we don't know if he's alive.

682
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,680
Where is he?

683
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,550
Just ahead.

684
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,710
Lead the way.

685
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,380
General, just ahead.

686
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,190
General Cui is right ahead.

687
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,000
Cui Yan!

688
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,320
Cui Yan!

689
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,230
Cui Yan.

690
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,190
Liu San!
