[Fighting for love]

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 3

4
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,430
Lower your voice.

5
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:54,320
Others will hear you if your voice is too loud.

6
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,670
Well.

7
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,789
I told you not to do that.

8
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,320
Why didn't you listen to me?

9
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,410
Mai.

10
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,630
I should have a big share.

11
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,710
Don't worry.

12
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,650
You'll get your share of the money.

13
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,850
That's for sure, bro.

14
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,210
Okay.

15
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,910
The left is all yours.

16
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,770
This is what I get?

17
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,340
You think it's too much?

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,390
Fine, I'll take some more.

19
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,150
Mai.

20
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,630
If I hadn't helped you,

21
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,160
you wouldn't have fooled them successfully.

22
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,520
Let me ask you.

23
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,829
Didn't we agree

24
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,010
that we would never scam poor people?

25
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,630
If I hadn't stopped you,

26
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,430
that old lady would have

27
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,510
lost her money for her tonight's supper.

28
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,070
I admit I was being too greedy.

29
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,410
Of course you were.

30
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,230
One day,

31
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,100
you'll end up in jail because of your greed.

32
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,950
You took most of the money

33
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,790
when you left.

34
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,000
You just left me a little.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,950
That was far from enough.

36
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,280
I had to make more money.

37
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,040
You're hopeless.

38
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,830
Don't do it again.

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,880
Hurry up.

40
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,110
Chief.

41
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,990
I need to go to the toilet.

42
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,470
Okay.

43
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,070
Wait.

44
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,670
Check on the guy in the yard.

45
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,230
Take it.

46
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,510
Okay.

47
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,840
Come on, let's drink.

48
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,070
Be gentle.

49
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,110
Shut up.

50
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,750
I'm busy.

51
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,710
It's so difficult to untie this.

52
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,120
Hey.

53
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,290
Are you trying to set him free?

54
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,770
Well.

55
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,870
Of course not.

56
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,829
Bro, I'm not...

57
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:47,590
Come here.

58
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,590
Come here.

59
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:48,910
Bro.

60
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,430
Hurry!

61
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,430
Bro.

62
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,590
I knew you were up to something.

63
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,320
You've misunderstood.

64
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,580
You two

65
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,600
know each other?

66
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,180
-No.
-Yes.

67
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,720
Do you know each other or not?

68
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,710
-Yes.
-No.

69
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,029
I don't care whether you know each other or not.

70
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,240
I'll take you to the magistrate tomorrow morning and he'll interrogate you two and find out about it.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,030
Officer.

72
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,870
Let me explain.

73
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,870
Silence them.

74
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,710
Yes.

75
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,210
Open your mouth.

76
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,600
Stay here.

77
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,030
Don't try to escape.

78
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,550
It's so late. Who is it?

79
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,710
Who are you?

80
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,630
We are guards of Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

81
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,290
Can we stay here for one night?

82
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,840
Sure, please come in.

83
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,470
Mai?

84
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,350
Don’t get yourself into trouble.

85
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,150
Who did it?

86
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,960
I did it.

87
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,370
What's wrong?

88
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
This is not our business.

89
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,770
Bro, it's too cold.

90
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,640
How about you set him free?

91
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,680
Do you guys

92
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,550
know him?

93
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,870
-No.
-Yes.

94
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,620
They're also giving different answers.

95
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,630
Let me be honest.

96
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,150
He's from Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

97
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,610
You're from Marquis Dingnan's Mansion but you also need to obey the law.

98
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,630
If you don't stop interfering us in our work,

99
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,890
we'll also arrest you.

100
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,790
I'm Marquis Dingnan.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,560
Don't...

102
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,550
Are you

103
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,950
going to arrest me?

104
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,360
You are Marquis Dingnan?

105
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,850
Then why are you dressed like a guard?

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,170
Officer, I think you haven't been to Shengdu for a long time.

107
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,170
Now, young people from the upper-class families in Shengdu

108
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,790
like to wear uniforms that all kinds of officials wear.

109
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,920
Today, I'm wearing a guard's uniform.

110
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,810
Mu Bai, get the officer a uniform that I'm wearing.

111
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,750
No need.

112
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,360
Do you have a tablet that shows your identity?

113
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,500
See this clearly.

114
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,380
[Marquis Dingnan]

115
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,760
I didn't know you were Marquis Dingnan. Sorry about that.

116
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,650
Don’t be sorry.

117
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,150
Just set him free.

118
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,390
How about you set him free?

119
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,430
Only he can go.

120
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,630
Yes.

121
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,310
There is clear evidence for the other man's crime.

122
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,170
So he must be placed under arrest.

123
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,620
Alright.

124
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,070
Bro.

125
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,550
What's wrong?

126
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,590
It's so cold.

127
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,230
Get him a room where he can sleep.

128
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,430
You'll be blamed if he freezes to death.

129
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,690
What's wrong with you?

130
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,690
Take it. Buy yourself a drink.

131
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,400
Fine.

132
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,880
Thank you for your help, Young Marquis.

133
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
I didn't expect

134
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,150
to see you here tonight.

135
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,150
It's my pleasure.

136
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,860
You must feel very cold.

137
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,390
No.

138
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,150
Mai.

139
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,340
Don't get us into trouble again.

140
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,270
Don't say that.

141
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,810
He was rude.

142
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,419
Young Marquis, it's so late.

143
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,990
The long journey must have made you very tired.

144
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,630
You

145
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,659
should go to bed early.

146
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,840
By the way, where are you going to sleep?

147
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,830
I'm fine.

148
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,510
I'll share a room with these two bros.

149
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,540
You three will share one room?

150
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,640
What if they...

151
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,710
I just feel it'll be too crowded.

152
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,960
Too crowded?

153
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,750
No, it won't be.

154
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,260
I mean...

155
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,830
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

156
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,290
We should have a good chat.

157
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,710
Since you have to share a room with someone,

158
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,670
how about we share a room?

159
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,170
Let's go.

160
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,350
My young marquis.

161
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,800
Mai has his own plan.

162
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,870
You don't have to worry too much about him.

163
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,230
He doesn't have a plan.

164
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,190
Young Marquis.

165
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,270
I don't want to trouble you.

166
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,710
Thank you so much.

167
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,850
Guys, let's go to bed early.

168
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,200
Go to bed early.

169
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,630
Bro, let's go.

170
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,030
Mr. Post Officer.

171
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,750
-Come when you finished your work.
-Young Marquis.

172
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,030
Please follow me into your room.

173
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,830
-Come with me.
-Let’s go.

174
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,630
It's late. Let's go to bed early.

175
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,080
Young Marquis, please.

176
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,330
Young Marquis.

177
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,230
The accommodations of the stage station are not very good.

178
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,000
Young Marquis, please make do with it tonight.

179
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,830
Thank you.

180
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,680
What are you doing?

181
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,610
We're away from home so we have to be very careful.

182
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,030
We decided to come here on a whim.

183
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,090
It will be all fine.

184
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,130
I'm afraid someone will ambush you.

185
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,430
Mu Bai.

186
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,790
No one would hide in this lamp.

187
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,880
You're right.

188
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,880
Are you done?

189
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,750
I spent the whole day riding the horse.

190
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,630
I'm so sleepy.

191
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,840
Okay, it's safe for now.

192
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,790
All right, you should leave now.

193
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,630
Go.

194
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,310
Wait, Young Marquis.

195
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,830
I have something to say.

196
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,470
What?

197
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,630
You disguised yourself because you didn't want others to recognize you.

198
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,520
But just now,

199
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,300
you let others know your identity

200
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,160
just because of an acquaintance.

201
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,030
He's not just an acquaintance.

202
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,030
That's Mai.

203
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,920
Mai saved me in the Emerald Pavilion.

204
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,850
You forgot that?

205
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,790
I don't care.

206
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,630
Now many people know where we are.

207
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,870
They will find us soon.

208
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,800
I'm not leaving.

209
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,440
Even if they know we are here,

210
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,270
they won't be here until tomorrow at the earliest.

211
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,720
Aren't you going to sleep?

212
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,120
You've been watching me for 24 hours.

213
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,750
If you don't sleep, you won't have the energy

214
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,080
to protect me tomorrow.

215
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,630
You're right.

216
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,740
What are you doing?

217
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,720
I'll sleep here.

218
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,160
Where should I sleep if you sleep here?

219
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,770
Let's sleep together.

220
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,050
Where are you going?

221
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,920
I’m going to talk to Mai.

222
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,940
I’ll be back soon.

223
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,990
Come back early.

224
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,710
My Lord.

225
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,950
I think Marquis Dingnan is not in the tent.

226
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,680
You think?

227
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,670
I'm sure Marquis Dingnan is not in the tent.

228
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,800
Are you really sure?

229
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,680
I just patrolled this place

230
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,210
and found that Mu Bai wasn't nearby.

231
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,630
He and Marquis Dingnan grew up together.

232
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,830
They always stay with each other.

233
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,360
We made a careless mistake.

234
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,280
Mr. Shi.

235
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,550
I received a tip-off from Lieutenant Liu

236
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,630
that Marquis Dingnan

237
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,290
was seen at a stage station on the official road.

238
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,840
My Lord, that stage station is a little far from here.

239
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,210
I'm afraid we won't be able to get there tonight.

240
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,590
Tell Lieutenant Liu to play it by ear

241
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,790
and make sure Marquis Dingnan doesn't leave the stage station.

242
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,350
Yes.

243
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,500
Guys, let's go there.

244
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,150
Yes.

245
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,510
Mai.

246
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,270
I didn’t expect that

247
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,240
you would know

248
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,980
Marquis Dingnan, a man of noble birth.

249
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,910
That's amazing.

250
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,070
Why didn't you stay in Shengdu

251
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,960
and make a fortune with his help?

252
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,800
I have no family

253
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,440
so I don't need a lot of money.

254
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,230
You need money to get a wife and raise your future children.

255
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,950
Cheers.

256
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,240
What are you jealous of?

257
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,300
Marquis...

258
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Marquis Dingnan.

259
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,050
Greetings, Marquis Dingnan.

260
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,430
We'll leave now.

261
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,580
Let's go.

262
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,230
Sit.

263
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,750
It's okay.

264
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,410
Let me do it.

265
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,960
Here you are.

266
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,560
Young Marquis.

267
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,220
Why aren't you in bed?

268
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,170
You're not in bed, either.

269
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,230
I had a drink to keep myself warm.

270
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,270
Oh.

271
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,350
Those guys made this wine by themselves.

272
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,310
Would you like to try it?

273
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,470
Sure, let me have a taste.

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,800
-Here.
-Okay.

275
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,680
Let's drink.

276
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,590
I didn't expect to meet you here.

277
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,720
What a coincidence!

278
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,280
Where are you going?

279
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,470
I am now the Guard General of Qingzhou.

280
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,600
I'm on my way to Qingzhou.

281
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,890
Congratulations.

282
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,520
Where are you going?

283
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,950
To Yinbao, Yinbao City.

284
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,390
So the person you're looking for is in Yinbao City?

285
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,350
Miss Chunniang gave me a token.

286
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,750
She asked me to go to Yinbao City

287
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,510
and find a man called Mr. Ghost Hand Four.

288
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,440
She said that guy had the thing I've been looking for.

289
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,830
By the way,

290
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,020
Chunniang is dead.

291
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,870
I've lost the Emerald Pavilion.

292
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,750
And my father

293
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,350
is also dead.

294
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,950
Sorry to hear that.

295
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,040
Actually, I felt quite bad

296
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,470
at the mansion those days.

297
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,630
My mother was with me all the time

298
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,390
so I hid my true feelings.

299
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,750
I felt

300
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,010
there was a rock

301
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,900
on my chest.

302
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,080
Mai, thank you

303
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,490
for drinking with me tonight so I can show my real feelings.

304
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,790
At home,

305
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,930
I didn't dare to cry.

306
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,390
Cry if you want to.

307
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,970
You'll feel better after you cry.

308
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,320
It's true.

309
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,670
I‘ll go out to get some fresh air.

310
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,660
Father!

311
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,510
Mother!

312
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,990
Run!

313
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,830
Run, Mai!

314
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,070
Mr. Post Officer.

315
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,300
You brat.

316
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,720
Are you leaving now?

317
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,870
Yes, I have to hurry.

318
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,620
Thank you for letting me stay here last night, Post Officer.

319
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,440
Wait.

320
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,140
Take some buns with you so you'll have food to eat on your way.

321
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,290
Thank you.

322
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,190
When will Mr. Shi arrive?

323
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,710
He’s on his way.

324
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,350
He ordered us to get the marquis to stay at the stage station.

325
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,270
It's dawn. Let's stop waiting.

326
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,720
Go get changed. Let's go to the stage station first.

327
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,270
Okay.

328
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,000
They want to pose as officials from the Ministry of Justice. How dare they!

329
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,810
They are heading towards the stage station.

330
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,460
Are they trying to assassinate Young Marquis?

331
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,910
Luckily I didn’t throw it away.

332
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,390
Mai.

333
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,550
Why are you back?

334
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,710
You're from the Ministry of Justice?

335
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,350
Actually, I'm a secret agent of the Ministry of Justice.

336
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,750
I'm completing a mission

337
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,350
so I didn't tell you the truth last night.

338
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,330
I'm sorry.

339
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,670
Don't be.

340
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,440
Then...

341
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,150
So why are you back?

342
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,470
Mr. Post Officer.

343
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,190
Sit down.

344
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,680
Recently, two groups of people have been bold and lawless.

345
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,430
They've been posing as officials of the Ministry of Justice

346
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,290
and scamming people everywhere.

347
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,710
I was assigned to the job

348
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,000
to investigate them in secret.

349
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,560
I can't believe it.

350
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,740
Mr. Post Officer, don't panic.

351
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,030
This is a secret.

352
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,090
I shouldn't have told you about it.

353
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,410
Thank you for your warning.

354
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,490
Many people come and go to the stage station.

355
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,110
They might come here and it's hard to notice them.

356
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,700
You have to pay attention to suspicious people.

357
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,520
Yes.

358
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,950
Losing some of your food is not serious.

359
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,870
But if the police believe you are harboring those criminals,

360
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,910
then...

361
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,640
Thank you for your warning.

362
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,070
Thank you very much.

363
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,750
He hasn't got up?

364
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,510
I just heard the sound from the room.

365
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,710
He should have got up.

366
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,730
I'll tell him about it too.

367
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,750
Okay.

368
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,050
Be careful, Mr. Post Officer.

369
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,030
Who is it?

370
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,750
It's me.

371
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,450
Why are you here?

372
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,310
A group of people are coming to the stage station.

373
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,430
I saw them

374
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,990
change into uniforms of officials of the Ministry of Justice.

375
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,520
They're quite suspicious.

376
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,840
I'm afraid they'll hurt you.

377
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,790
Officers, are you...

378
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,130
Why are you so late?

379
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,640
I didn't know you were coming.

380
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,990
Shut up and bring us food.

381
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,150
Okay.

382
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,950
Can I see

383
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,750
your official tablets and official seals?

384
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,480
How dare you!

385
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,400
You're just a post officer.

386
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,440
You have no right to ask us to show them to you.

387
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,630
You've misunderstood, officer.

388
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,590
It's my duty to check them.

389
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,710
I need to keep a record of all the visits

390
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,670
so that at the end of year, we can get the accounts right.

391
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,630
Otherwise,

392
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,250
I would lose my job.

393
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,510
Please cooperate.

394
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,960
[Ministry of Justice]

395
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,230
Okay.

396
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,070
Please wait a moment.

397
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,330
I'll get you food and drink right now.

398
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,750
I think they're Longyin Guards.

399
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,370
Longyin Guards?

400
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,870
If they're Longyin Guards,

401
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,470
there should be more of them.

402
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,150
So

403
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,550
many more of them will come.

404
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,240
It's very possible.

405
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,850
They're just the first group.

406
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,980
They want to stop us from leaving here.

407
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,760
We shouldn't wait any longer. Let's go now.

408
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,270
Yes.

409
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:12,750
Wait.

410
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,610
This is a stage station.

411
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,060
If you leave here, you'll be in the middle of nowhere

412
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,460
and have no place to hide.

413
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,830
If they are lying in ambush,

414
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,950
you'll fall into their trap and die.

415
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,210
Then what should we do?

416
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,590
Mai.

417
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,440
They want me.

418
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,390
Listen to me. You leave here now.

419
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,580
Young Marquis.

420
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,210
You saved me last night.

421
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,390
If I leave now,

422
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,210
I'll be an ungrateful person.

423
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,080
Mai.

424
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,470
Since I've come back,

425
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,310
you and I

426
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,950
are on the same boat.

427
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,270
We shouldn't confront them now.

428
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,910
We need to find a smart way to deal with them.

429
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,170
You know what to do now?

430
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,250
Almost.

431
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,350
Young Marquis.

432
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,280
Who is it?

433
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,760
Officer Mai, it's me.

434
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,290
He's on our side.

435
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,490
You're right.

436
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,590
There're some people posing as officials from the Ministry of Justice.

437
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,520
I have gained their trust.

438
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,110
I'm here to ask you how to catch them.

439
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,560
Well done.

440
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,240
But I'm solving this case secretly.

441
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,440
If I go confront them,

442
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,200
I'm afraid that I won't be able to get them arrested and that they'll know my identity.

443
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,790
I'll contact my superior immediately.

444
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,390
Don't let them leave.

445
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,400
Wait for my instructions.

446
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,200
Okay, I'll do it right away.

447
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,510
Why did he

448
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,850
call you Officer Mai just now?

449
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,510
Who is your superior?

450
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,070
[Ministry of Justice]

451
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,340
Look.

452
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,940
[Ministry of Justice]

453
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,580
You're from the Ministry of Justice?

454
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,770
Of course not.

455
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,070
Only when we make things complicated for them

456
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,930
can we find a chance to leave here.

457
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,030
That Constable Zhang we saw last night seemed to be a decent guy.

458
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,140
You've got an idea?

459
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,570
I'll find another person to do us a favor.

460
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,810
I'll go out first.

461
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,790
You can also go out and have a look.

462
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,500
What do you mean?

463
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,590
They're here to catch us.

464
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,850
What are you afraid of?

465
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,550
We're at a stage station.

466
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,150
Everyone knows Marquis Dingnan is here.

467
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,560
Since they are hiding their identities,

468
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,020
they wouldn't dare to catch you in public.

469
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,910
Young Marquis.

470
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,840
You're a famous for making a mess.

471
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,970
This time, do your best to make a mess.

472
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,510
Come on.

473
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,030
Who is it? Who is making noise?

474
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,030
It was so noisy that I didn't sleep well.

475
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,790
What are you doing?

476
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,310
We didn’t know Marquis Dingnan was here.

477
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,030
Sorry for waking you up.

478
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:56,990
It's okay.

479
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,940
Are you from the Ministry of Justice?

480
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes, I'm Liu Ben, an official from the Ministry of Justice.

481
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,070
They are my...

482
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,710
Alright.

483
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,710
No need to introduce them.

484
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,770
I won't be able to remember all of you.

485
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,710
Send a message to your superior.

486
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,950
Tell him that after being appointed as the Guard General of Qingzhou,

487
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,950
I was busy going to Qingzhou, so I didn't have time to drink with him.

488
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,810
I'll treat him to drink next time.

489
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,080
Okay, I will.

490
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,820
Have a seat.

491
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,040
Yes.

492
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,530
Officer Mai.

493
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,740
Mr. Post Officer.

494
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,530
How is everything going?

495
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,430
Did you tell it to anyone else?

496
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,510
No.

497
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,750
I've contacted my superior.

498
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,350
He will send people to help us soon.

499
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,190
Great.

500
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,190
I'm thirsty. Get me some water.

501
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,520
Okay. Wait a second.

502
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,550
Here, have some water.

503
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
Mr. Post Officer.

504
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,190
After you serve them breakfast,

505
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,680
go find Constable Zhang.

506
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,370
Tell him in private what we are going to do.

507
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,730
Then when the people sent by my superior come,

508
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,770
they won't mistake you as a criminal.

509
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,590
Thank you so much.

510
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,550
It's so nice of you.

511
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,260
You're welcome.

512
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,370
Tell Constable Zhang that there're people posing as officials

513
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,630
and that you want him to be an eyewitness.

514
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,630
Okay.

515
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,850
I should go now.

516
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,070
Don't tell him that I asked you to do that.

517
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,400
The credit is all yours.

518
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,720
Be careful.

519
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,080
Be careful.

520
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,160
I'm done. Let's go.

521
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,070
Your Grace.

522
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,050
How dare you!

523
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,680
Your Grace, there have been many bandits nearby lately.

524
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,280
You only have three guards.

525
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,990
I'm worried that those bandits will hurt you.

526
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,030
Please let me and my colleagues go with you.

527
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,490
Please let us protect you.

528
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,150
Thank you for your concern.

529
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,760
But I don't think you're strong enough to protect me.

530
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,530
You should protect yourselves first.

531
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,510
Bye.

532
00:28:58,870 --> 00:28:59,430
Your Grace.

533
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,830
Didn't you hear what His Grace said?

534
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,830
Get out of the way.

535
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,230
Your Grace, if you get hurt,

536
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,000
we'll be held accountable.

537
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,310
Your Grace, how about you stay here for a few more days?

538
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,430
You'd better start off

539
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,110
after we wipe out the bandits.

540
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,860
So,

541
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,350
you won't let me go today, right?

542
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,150
Your Grace, I'm doing this for your safety.

543
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,830
If you want to punish me for doing it,

544
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,990
it's okay.

545
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,520
I will take the punishment.

546
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,040
What's going on?

547
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,650
Who's making trouble?

548
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,700
It's him.

549
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,910
It's him.

550
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,540
The man with the beard.

551
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,990
I can recognize him no matter what happens to him.

552
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,590
It was his idea

553
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,490
to scam people.

554
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,370
He planned it. Catch him.

555
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,350
What scam?

556
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,540
We are from the Ministry of Justice.

557
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,330
He's still lying.

558
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,650
Show me your official tablet.

559
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,100
[Ministry of Justice]

560
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,840

561
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,550
Chief.

I didn't tell everyone his true identity

585

because I could tell that he was investigating
