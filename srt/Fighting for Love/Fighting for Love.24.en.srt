00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,080
[Fighting for love]

3
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 24]

4
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,520
According to the secret report,

5
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,590
another group of people in Yuzhou

6
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,670
were found to be watching Marquis Shang as well.

7
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,470
The spies have been investigating many times

8
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,870
and found that they were also from Shengdu.

9
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,110
It seems that the crown prince has some sense.

10
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,990
He knows what he should do.

11
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,190
Your Majesty,

12
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,390
those people aren't the crown prince's men,

13
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,870
but...

14
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,810
Prince Kang's.

15
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,949
My second son?

16
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,710
Yes.

17
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,470
My good son

18
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,750
is still restless.

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,230
I'm sick.

20
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,030
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,990
I caught a cold.

22
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,800
Suspend all the affairs in the palace

23
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,600
and leave the crown prince to handle the administrative affairs.

24
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,560
When Marquis Shang returns to the capital,

25
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,720
ask him to come and see me.

26
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,750
Do you understand?

27
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,430
Yes.

28
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,829
You may leave.

29
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,910
The crown prince.

30
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,670
Prince Kang.

31
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,310
My two good sons.

32
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,730
Your Highness.

33
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,630
You've been working all night.

34
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,160
Would you like some snacks?

35
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,880
Thank you, dear.

36
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,110
Father. Father.

37
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,000
[Grandson of the Emperor, Qi Yu]

38
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,350
I don't know how to play Cat's Cradle.

39
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,350
Teach me, please.

40
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,190
Let Xing play with you.

41
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,790
I happen to be busy right now.

42
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,269
Xing ignores me.

43
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,070
Father, play with me.

44
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,590
Yu.

45
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,350
What is this?

46
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,590
Cat's Cradle.

47
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,950
Cat's Cradle?

48
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,790
Excessive attention to playthings saps the will.

49
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,790
Yu has used up 20 pieces of paper to practice writing today.

50
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,430
This is just a relaxing moment before eating.

51
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,159
It's not as serious as you said.

52
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,030
Dear,

53
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,750
a loving mother often spoils her children.

54
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,750
Bear that in mind.

55
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,270
Yes.

56
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,520
I'll keep it in mind, Your Majesty.

57
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,070
Father.

58
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,550
I know I was wrong.

59
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,030
Mother only said that because she loves me.

60
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,350
Please don't be angry with her, okay?

61
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,430
Come here, Yu.

62
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,550
Yu.

63
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,880
It's not that I'm being unreasonable.

64
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,750
I've been growing up like this since I was young.

65
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,640
As members of the royal family,

66
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,280
we are different from ordinary people.

67
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,159
Besides, your royal grandfather

68
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,909
has high hopes for you.

69
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,180
If you are not upright and cautious,

70
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,409
in the future...

71
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,750
Father, I understand.

72
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,190
All right, you may leave.

73
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,750
I'll take my leave.

74
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,230
Come on. Let's go.

75
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,890
Second Cousin?

76
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,030
Cousin.

77
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,000
I've been waiting for you here for a long time.

78
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,190
Cousin,

79
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,150
I want to talk to you alone.

80
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,710
Come.

81
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,870
So many people are watching.

82
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,350
I'll just stand here.

83
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,270
Long time no see.

84
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,530
You seem to have changed completely.

85
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,310
It indeed makes a difference

86
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,540
whether you have military power or not.

87
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,190
When we were young,

88
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,710
we often played together.

89
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,950
We fought playfully.

90
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,230
Do you still remember, Cousin?

91
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,070
I do.

92
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,510
Second Cousin, you always bullied me at that time.

93
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,830
Well…

94
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,200
Why didn't I bully others?

95
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,090
It was because I just wanted to play with you.

96
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,990
I like to get straight to the point.

97
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,110
I'm here to make a deal

98
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,790
with you.

99
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,430
Well...

100
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,550
What deal can you make with me?

101
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,070
I know

102
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,200
you're the person my father has always been looking for.

103
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,390
Father has been sharpening his sword in Shengdu.

104
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,070
But don't worry.

105
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,670
I will still stand with you,

106
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,270
like when we were little.

107
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,950
As long as you can help me,

108
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,390
I'll keep you alive.

109
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,550
Let's enjoy a luxurious life together.

110
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,230
I don't quite understand

111
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,510
what you said.

112
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,830
It doesn't matter.

113
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,430
Think about it.

114
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,440
There are four or five days before you arrive at Shengdu.

115
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,350
There's enough time for you to think it over.

116
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,220
I hope you will give me a satisfactory reply

117
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,040
when we meet next time.

118
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,390
Your Highness,

119
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,050
I think you went the wrong way.

120
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,320
It's been a long time since I last left the palace. Pardon my mistake.

121
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,710
See you, Cousin.

122
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,000
He's trying to win you over.

123
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,890
Mr. Xu was indeed right.

124
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,650
Your Highness.

125
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,230
Your Highness.

126
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,990
Young Marquis sent a message back.

127
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,390
He will arrive in Shengdu

128
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,710
in three or four days.

129
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:15,880
Okay.

130
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,690
Your Highness,

131
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,590
you've been copying Buddhist scriptures for half a day.

132
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,470
Take a rest.

133
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,790
This is for General Shi.

134
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,410
I need to finish it as soon as possible.

135
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,930
Your Highness.

136
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,570
Let me make you a cup of tea.

137
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,870
Okay.

138
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,050
The situation of Shengdu is about to change.

139
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,550
Accompany me to Liuyun Temple tomorrow

140
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,250
to pray for Young Marquis.

141
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,030
Yes.

142
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,050
Your Highness.

143
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,390
Prince Kang left Shengdu in the name of hunting

144
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,230
but went to see Marquis Dingnan in secret.

145
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,030
His evil intention is obvious.

146
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,920
We have to guard against him.

147
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,210
Your Highness.

148
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,390
The Zhenbei Army

149
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,720
has expelled the Beimo Army, which outnumbered itself five times,

150
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,030
to the outside of the Pass.

151
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,590
The surrounding states are all shocked by this exploit.

152
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,110
We can't watch such an elite army

153
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,630
be bought over by Prince Kang.

154
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,390
Otherwise, Your Highness will be in danger.

155
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,760
How could I not know?

156
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,110
Why don't you give me an idea?

157
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,030
Your Highness and Marquis Dingnan are cousins.

158
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,740
It's reasonable

159
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,950
that you go to welcome him outside the city.

160
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:43,830
No.

161
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,750
As the crown prince,

162
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,670
Your Highness is being watched by countless eyes.

163
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,510
Some things can be done by Prince Kang,

164
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,770
but not Your Highness.

165
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,110
Actually, I think

166
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,240
Your Highness doesn't need to worry too much.

167
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,350
Why not?

168
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,020
Prince Kang thought he did it in secret,

169
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,070
but now Your Highness already knows.

170
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,470
His Majesty might have heard about it, too.

171
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,110
Prince Kang acted rashly.

172
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,590
The gains can't make up for his losses.

173
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,590
That makes sense.

174
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,590
You mean

175
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,550
I just need to take the quiet approach?

176
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,200
Your Highness is wise.

177
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,670
You must be calm at times like this.

178
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,510
The more actions you take, the more mistakes you'll make.

179
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,070
But if we do nothing,

180
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,510
what if Marquis Dingnan takes Prince Kang's side?

181
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,630
He won't.

182
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,630
Marquis Dingnan climbed to the position of

183
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,230
Grand Marshal of the Zhenbei Army from a good-for-nothing boy of noble birth.

184
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,510
If he was not smart,

185
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,650
he would never have done that.

186
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,950
Unless he has the ability to stand alone,

187
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,750
then as long as he wants a backer,

188
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,990
he will surely seek help from Your Royal Highness.

189
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,150
Really?

190
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,270
That's why

191
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,330
if Your Highness takes the initiative, you'll lose your advantage instead.

192
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,330
It's better that Your Highness just waits in Shengdu.

193
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,950
[Marquis Dingnan's Mansion]

194
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,200
Your Highness, look

195
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,310
who is back!

196
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,010
Your unfilial son is back.

197
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,430
Mother.

198
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,500
Get up.

199
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,670
How have you been, Mother?

200
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,390
You seem stronger.

201
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,500
Really?

202
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,060
You're still so immature.

203
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,160
Mu Bai,

204
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,530
thank you.

205
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,500
I didn't let you down

206
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,910
and brought Young Marquis back safely.

207
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,230
This must be General Mai.

208
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,580
My name's Mai Sui. Greetings, Your Highness.

209
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,400
I've heard so much about you, General Mai.

210
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,430
Now that I've met you, you're as handsome as they said.

211
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

212
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,790
Your Highness and Marshal Shang haven't seen each other for a long time.

213
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,750
I guess you must have a lot to catch on.

214
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,670
I'll leave now.

215
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,430
What?

216
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,330
Do you know where you can go?

217
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,230
Mother.

218
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,230
She's exhausted from the long journey.

219
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,090
Please allow her to go have a rest.

220
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,670
Look.

221
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,510
I forgot the etiquette because I'm too happy.

222
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,670
Actually, the guest house has been ready.

223
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,390
Guishun,

224
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,930
take General Mai…

225
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,430
No need.

226
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,390
Just let her stay at my place.

227
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,430
Okay.

228
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,630
Go.

229
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,510
Please.

230
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,940
I'll take my leave.

231
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,470
You may all leave.

232
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,070
Yes.

233
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,150
Come on.

234
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,380
Sit down.

235
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,670
You've grown up.

236
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,390
I'm proud of you.

237
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,310
But I failed to protect Uncle Shi.

238
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,790
I heard.

239
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,290
It's not your fault.

240
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,230
It's because the one in the palace hasn't given up yet.

241
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,750
So this time you're back,

242
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,190
you must be more careful.

243
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,050
This time being back in Shengdu, I have a plan.

244
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,270
I want to ally with the crown prince.

245
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,050
Ally with the crown prince?

246
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,230
Although I didn't have much contact with him,

247
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,270
it's not hard to tell

248
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,110
he is actually a kind person.

249
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,160
And what he lacks most is military power.

250
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,950
If I help him,

251
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,480
he will turn the tables and ascend the throne.

252
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,110
Only when he becomes the emperor

253
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,000
can I have enough ability to protect you, Mother.

254
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,190
But now,

255
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,110
the Zhenbei Army is your biggest bargaining chip.

256
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,230
You have to be gentle

257
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,150
to Mai and other generals.

258
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,920
Don't let them betray you.

259
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,110
Mother, don't worry.

260
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,450
I'll keep that in mind.

261
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,540
Your Majesty,

262
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,030
Marquis Dingnan entered the city at 13 o'clock

263
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,160
and went back to his mansion directly.

264
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,520
Did he come back alone?

265
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,430
He came back to Shengdu with Mai Sui,

266
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,960
General Yunhui, together.

267
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,630
That "Little God of War"?

268
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,070
Yes.

269
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,640
Your Majesty, when do you plan to summon them?

270
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,430
No hurry.

271
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,190
Let the crown prince and Prince Kang welcome them for me.

272
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,470
Ask someone to pay attention to them

273
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,390
and see which one of them acts differently.

274
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,610
Yes, Your Majesty.

275
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,750
Father is slightly ill.

276
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,270
Under His Majesty's orders, my brother and I

277
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,590
are giving Cousin and General Mai this dinner for your arrival.

278
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,030
You two don't need to stand on ceremonies.

279
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,870
Make yourselves at home.

280
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,390
Thank you, Cousin.

281
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,050
Thank you, Second Cousin.

282
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,040
His Majesty is not well.

283
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,550
I should visit him,

284
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,430
but I was afraid that I would disturb him.

285
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,470
Father just caught a cold.

286
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,170
There's nothing serious.

287
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,990
Don't worry, Cousin.

288
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,780
Come on.

289
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,790
Cousin, General Mai, I'd like to propose a toast

290
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,590
to celebrate your triumphant return

291
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,780
and your safe return to the capital.

292
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,390
You even tried to kill her;

293
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,560
now you are

294
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,630
like a close family.

295
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,750
I've opened my eyes today.

296
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,109
Second Cousin,

297
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,770
I don't understand what you said.

298
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,750
Cousin, you are really

299
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,990
a broad-minded person.

300
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,150
Since you don't mind,

301
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,070
I won't be the villain here.

302
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,990
If someone wanted my life,

303
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,310
I wouldn't be able to be as generous as you.

304
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,990
If a mere cup of wine could make peace,

305
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,870
then my life would be too cheap.

306
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,240
Second Brother.

307
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,870
Look at me.

308
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,070
I've always been straightforward.

309
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,390
Brother, I guess you

310
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,870
won't mind my impulsive words, will you?

311
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,790
The ancient virtuous king Shun promoted eight sages

312
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,510
and asked them to preach the five virtues all over the country:

313
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,370
fathers being righteous, mothers loving, older brothers sociable…

314
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,390
Is it Yu who's outside?

315
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,660
Father.

316
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,590
Second Uncle.

317
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,390
This is Uncle Yizhi.

318
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,950
That's General Mai.

319
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,200
Uncle Yizhi.

320
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,410
General Mai.

321
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,510
Your Highness.

322
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,270
Yu,

323
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,710
recite what you just said

324
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,670
to me again.

325
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,670
Yes.

326
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,750
The ancient virtuous king Shun promoted eight sages

327
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,270
and asked them to preach the five virtues all over the country:

328
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,130
fathers being righteous, mothers loving, older brothers sociable…

329
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,190
elder brothers sociable…

330
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,790
Uncle,

331
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,230
I just learned this passage of Annals of the Five Emperors,

332
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,470
but I forgot it.

333
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,800
Can you teach me, Uncle?

334
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,390
Well...

335
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,230
Yu, don't make things difficult for me.

336
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,710
I'm not even as knowledgeable as you.

337
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,590
The ancient virtuous king Shun promoted eight sages

338
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,050
and asked them to preach the five virtues all over the country:

339
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,750
fathers being righteous, mothers loving,

340
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,870
elder brothers sociable, younger ones respectful, and children dutiful.

341
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,110
Within the empire, there was peace and, beyond it, submission.

342
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,790
In this sentence, the five virtues

343
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,070
are similar to what Mencius said:

344
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,920
"There should be affection between fathers and sons,

345
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,470
affiliation between monarchs and courtiers,

346
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,150
distinction between husbands and wives,

347
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,150
order between seniors and juniors,

348
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,710
and trust among friends."

349
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,870
If we can practice what the saints said,

350
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,990
our family will be harmonious,

351
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,230
and we have strength to spare to make the world better.

352
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,390
Yu,

353
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,350
don't forget it again.

354
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,710
Yes, Father.

355
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Uncle, you should remember it, too,

356
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,470
so that your teacher won't punish you.

357
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,620
Yes.

358
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,060
Yu, you're right.

359
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,950
You must study hard, Yu.

360
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,880
Don't be as ignorant as me.

361
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,400
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

362
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,700
You may leave.

363
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,450
I'll take my leave.

364
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,040
I feel dizzy

365
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,080
before drinking.

366
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,230
I apologize to you, Brother.

367
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:01,830
Cousin,

368
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,560
I'll treat you to wine another day.

369
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,850
We have plenty of time.

370
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,350
Go back and rest early.

371
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,900
Goodbye, Second Cousin.

372
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,820
Farewell, Prince Kang.

373
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,200
Why do you choose me?

374
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,260
Because Your Royal Highness

375
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,220
is the legitimate crown prince.

376
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,470
Besides, you have a kind heart.

377
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,010
You will certainly be a virtuous emperor.

378
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,190
Good.

379
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,800
Since you have such intention,

380
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,230
I won't let you down.

381
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,680
However, we're always feeling troubled and uneasy

382
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,110
after we came back this time.

383
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,230
If we can't return to Yuzhou safely,

384
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,700
everything I promised you today

385
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,710
will go up in smoke.

386
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,400
Let me think.

387
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,030
I have an idea.

388
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,110
General Mai, are you willing to take Yu as your disciple?

389
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,950
Well...

390
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,660
Father would do Yu a favor

391
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,350
if not do me one.

392
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,620
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

393
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,420
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

394
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,670
Cousin, General Mai, you don't have to be so polite.

395
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,990
We'll take our leave.

396
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,140
Please.

397
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,990
Are you all dead?

398
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,870
What's the use of you?

399
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,240
Your Highness, you must hold back.

400
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,920
Hold back. Hold back.

401
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,240
Father bullied me.

402
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,310
The crown prince bullied me.

403
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,910
Now, even Qi Yu, a little kid,

404
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,590
can humiliate me in public.

405
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,790
How long do I have to bear with it?

406
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,000
To achieve great things,

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,600
you should bear with the things unbearable for ordinary people.

408
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,230
Who is it?

409
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,590
Me.

410
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,480
Come in.

411
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,710
Is this place okay for you?

412
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,390
Of course.

413
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,450
This place is much more comfortable than the barracks.

414
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,660
Why are you still up?

415
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,950
I came here too early.

416
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,110
By the way,

417
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,870
I didn't do anything wrong to offend Princess Shenghua

418
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,330
when I met her today, did I?

419
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,190
Not at all.

420
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,000
I just felt that you always wanted to run away.

421
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,390
I know how you felt.

422
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,790
If you are not ready yet,

423
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,350
I can wait.

424
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,270
We can proceed to the next stop

425
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,890
whenever you are ready.

426
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,230
Thank you.

427
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,630
So,

428
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,480
should you wash first,

429
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,870
or should I?

430
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,860
Get lost.

431
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,110
He and the crown prince went to talk in the inside room?

432
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,950
Yes.

433
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,590
I've already sent someone to investigate.

434
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,590
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

435
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,950
I won't miss a word.

436
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,550
Uncle Shi,

437
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,070
I'm sorry.

438
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,230
Please rise, Generals.

439
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,270
Thank you, Your Majesty.

440
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,510
I'm glad

441
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,420
that the Zhenbei Army had an enormous victory.

442
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,390
Both of you have done a great job.

443
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,230
What reward do you want?

444
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,310
Haven't Your Majesty already rewarded

445
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,520
all the people in the Zhenbei Army?

446
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,590
That's business.

447
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,610
It's for the outsiders to see.

448
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,270
Today, I want to reward you two in private.

449
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,310
I do have a request.

450
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,670
Go ahead.

451
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,130
Although General Shi surrendered,

452
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,950
he did it for the safety of the people inside the city.

453
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,750
So, after Your Majesty finds out the whole truth,

454
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,510
could we bury General Shi's body in whole?

455
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,590
Approved.

456
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,450
Thank you, Your Majesty.

457
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,270
This is

458
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,080
the famous Charming Yama in the Zhenbei Army, right?

459
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,560
I want to see you carefully.

460
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,030
You are decisive in the army.

461
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,650
I didn't expect you

462
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,270
to be so good-looking.

463
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,810
What reward do you want?

464
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,510
Your Majesty, you flatter me.

465
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,870
The victory of the Zhenbei Army

466
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,270
is all down to Your Majesty's prestige.

467
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,880
I dare not take the credit.

468
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,750
Father,

469
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,590
there's another piece of good news

470
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,110
that I haven't told you.

471
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,990
Yu admires General Mai very much.

472
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,710
He has become General Mai's disciple.

473
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,550
Really?

474
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,830
Yu has always been weak.

475
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,230
I've always wanted to

476
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,150
find him a martial arts master

477
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,390
to strengthen his body.

478
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,470
But Yu only admires General Mai.

479
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,760
I couldn't change his mind,

480
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,110
so I had to fulfill his wish.

481
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,150
It's good to strengthen his body.

482
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,830
General Mai.

483
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,470
You can discipline my grandson at will.

484
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,670
If he doesn't behave,

485
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,160
just teach him a lesson.

486
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

487
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,870
What reward do you want, General Mai?

488
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,150
Can I really ask for anything?

489
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,670
Anything.

490
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,160
I want some silver.

491
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,210
General Mai, have you made up your mind?

492
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,630
It's a rare reward from His Majesty.

493
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,090
Thank you for reminding me, Prince Kang.

494
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,890
I'm afraid Your Majesty will laugh at me.

495
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,350
I was poor when I was young.

496
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,550
I used to starve often.

497
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,270
That's why I'm short.

498
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,350
I'm so traumatized by being poor

499
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,160
that I just want more money.

500
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,740
When there is no war one day,

501
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,910
and I'm not needed,

502
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,670
I can retire with money and return to my hometown.

503
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,310
Return to your hometown?

504
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,350
Fine.

505
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,150
I'll reward you.

506
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,350
Here, reward him.

507
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,730
His Majesty rewarded General Mai with a silver bow.

508
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,030
General Mai, take it.

509
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,550
Thank you, Your Majesty!

510
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,690
Besides, I'll reward you with 2,000 taels of silver

511
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,510
and two country estates.

512
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

513
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,310
Yizhi.

514
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

515
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,840
Now the official business is over,

516
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,040
have a chat with your uncle.

517
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,340
Let's not be a monarch and a courtier.

518
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,430
I just don't understand.

519
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:25,390
How did you turn from a dandy in Shengdu

520
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,000
to someone like this?

521
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,030
Even your two cousins are no match for you.

522
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,410
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

523
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,790
Both of my cousins are the chosen ones.

524
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,670
They are the best of the best.

525
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,130
I can't compare with them.

526
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,230
Don't be modest.

527
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm just curious.

528
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,030
You are so talented,

529
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:53,230
yet you've pretended to be ignorant for over 20 years.

530
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,710
Were you guarding against someone?

531
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,510
I dare not.

532
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,710
Your Majesty should know better than me

533
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,740
what kind of a person I am.

534
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,430
If I can be half as good as my father,

535
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,960
I would thank Heaven for it.

536
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,710
I knew it.

537
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,750
Forget it.

538
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,750
I'm just asking.

539
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,150
Don't mind.

540
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,310
It's getting late. Get out of the palace.

541
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,970
Don't make your mother worry.

542
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,690
My sister is not easy to deal with.

543
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,990
Your Majesty,

544
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,150
I suddenly remembered something else

545
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,790
to ask for your permission.

546
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,990
What is it?

547
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,320
I'd like Your Majesty to allow me to go to the Ministry of War

548
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,350
to check the name list of the Zhenbei Army.

549
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,110
Why?

550
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,690
The Zhenbei Army was established on the basis of the Qingyu Military Coalition.

551
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,790
The designation has just been decided.

552
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,750
We need to register and check the number of people as soon as possible

553
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,410
so that we can arrange for the distribution of pay and provisions.

554
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:55,870
Approved.

555
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

556
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,590
Do you think that Little God of War is useful?

557
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,910
Based on what I saw today,

558
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,740
General Mai doesn't seem as powerful as the rumor described.

559
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,070
Go on.

560
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,960
Yes.

561
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,870
I think

562
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,480
General Mai is actually a greedy man.

563
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,390
He's easy to be bought over but not easy to trust.

564
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,790
He pretended to be so,

565
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,430
and you believed him?

566
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,190
I'm not smart.

567
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,450
How can I compare to Your Majesty?

568
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,750
Enough.

569
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,910
Don't act innocent in front of me.

570
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,270
Your Majesty,

571
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,280
it's time to take the medicine.

572
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,670
Take the medicine.

573
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,380
Mai.

574
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,110
Why do you want to go to the Ministry of War to check the name list?

575
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,370
Do you still remember?

576
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,710
I told you

577
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,870
Chen Qi said

578
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,510
the people he brought to kill my parents

579
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,680
weren't from Beimo.

580
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,930
They were the Xuanwu Army disguised by our unit.

581
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,910
That's why I want to go to the Ministry of War

582
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,740
to check the deployment record back then.

583
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,110
I see. I'll go with you.

584
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,110
Greetings, Marquis Dingnan.

585
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,470
What brings you here, Marquis Dingnan?

586
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,030
Where is the minister?

587
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,910
Today is the birthday of Primary Assistant Minister Zuo's younger son.

588
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,150
The minister and our colleagues all went to the banquet.

589
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,640
So, you two are the only ones

590
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,650
here in the Ministry of War today?

591
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,670
Yes.

592
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,870
We're the only ones on duty here.

593
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,710
Your Grace, do you want me to get the minister?

594
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,350
No need.

595
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,320
It's a piece of cake.

596
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,770
You two are enough.

597
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,790
What can I do for you, Your Grace?

598
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,750
I want to check

599
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,350
the name list of the officers and soldiers of the Zhenbei Army.

600
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,150
You want to enter the archives room, Your Grace?

601
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,679
That's right. Lead the way.

602
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,070
Your Grace, please wait.

603
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,170
Please show me the written order.

604
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,389
What order?

605
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,630
If you want to check the archives, Your Grace,

606
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,790
you need to have Minister Du's handwritten order.

607
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,710
I am the Marshal of the Zhenbei Army.

608
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:50,800
I want to check the list of my own soldiers.

609
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,060
Why do I need an order?

610
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,750
No one

611
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,980
is allowed to enter the archives room without the order.

612
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,630
His Majesty has approved this matter.

613
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,400
Even if His Majesty comes in person,

614
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,750
I still have to follow the rules.

615
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,110
I...

616
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,080
Forget it.

617
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,940
Let's go get the order.

618
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,550
Mai.

619
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,350
How is it?

620
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,590
I got it.

621
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,110
Let's go.

622
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,510
Go.

623
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:01,300
[Approved] [Marquis Dingnan and his subordinates will enter the Ministry of War to check the name list, and all the people in the Ministry should cooperate]

624
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,910
It only consists of a few lines.

625
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,240
How much longer are you going to read them?

626
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,530
It's indeed the minister's handwritten order.

627
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,950
Let's go, then.

628
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,540
Your Grace, wait.

629
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,880
What now?

630
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,830
The archives room is a crucial place of the Ministry of War.

631
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,690
The minister's order is only one of the conditions.

632
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,680
You still need to register it in a few more books, Your Grace.

633
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,810
So many?

634
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,710
Yes.

635
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,990
Who went into the archives room to check which archives?

636
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,110
In which year and for what purpose?

637
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,800
When are the archives taken out and when are they taken back in?

638
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,130
Those should all be registered in detail.

639
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,800
Why do I feel you're making things difficult for us on purpose?

640
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,130
I dare not. You misunderstood.

641
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,280
I'm just doing my job impartially.

642
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,410
Let me do it.

643
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,430
Please don't miss anything, General Mai.

644
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,560
Thank you, General.

645
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,630
[Invitation to Princess Shenghua]

646
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,210
I don't know what day it is.

647
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,430
As if they'd made a deal,

648
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,620
they all came to invite me to admire the beauty of flowers.

649
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,390
I don't know which mansion to go to.

650
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,120
[Invitation to Princess Shenghua]

651
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,030
It's all thanks to Young Marquis.

652
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,350
His Highness is such a magnificent figure.

653
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,110
Those families with daughters at the age of marriage

654
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,510
have to make plans early.

655
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,710
Forget it.

656
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,490
Decline them for me.

657
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,470
Just say that I'm not free recently

658
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,150
and that I'll hold a banquet to invite them another day.

659
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,790
Yes.

660
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,150
Wait.

661
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,110
I do have a good place to go.

662
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,510
Come and see if this will work.

663
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,350
Yes.

664
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,670
Lord Zhang, please.

665
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,670
General Mai, Young Marquis.

666
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,310
I'm off duty now.

667
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,800
Please come again tomorrow.

668
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,800
What did you say?

669
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,670
You just told me to take it slow.

670
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,030
Now you ask me to come back tomorrow?

671
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,310
Can you wait a little longer?

672
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,710
We'll be ready very soon.

673
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:18,990
Sorry.

674
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,240
My mother is left at home alone.

675
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,150
It can't be delayed.

676
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,270
Stop pretending to be a filial son.

677
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,830
Fine.

678
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,670
In that case,

679
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,990
we'll come another day.

680
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,550
Sure.

681
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,040
Thank you, General.

682
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,430
Mai.

683
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,530
I feel like someone is fooling us.

684
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,630
You're right.

685
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,660
Otherwise, how dare a mere civil official in the Ministry of War

686
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,150
make things difficult for Marquis Dingnan?

687
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,870
Yeah.

688
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,350
Mai, listen.

689
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,910
I didn't see this coming.

690
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:06,150
We came directly to the Ministry of War from outside the city.

691
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,830
Only a few people near His Majesty

692
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,830
know about this.

693
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,950
Could it be...

694
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,200
Prince Kang?

695
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,670
Their whole family is watching our family.

696
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,930
He's just so snaky.

697
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,630
Can you arrange some spies

698
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,830
to keep an eye on them?

699
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,470
This way, we can also know

700
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,030
when something unusual happens.

701
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,550
Yes, there is someone.

702
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,430
We must get it even.

703
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,510
Enough.

704
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,510
Come with me to the Crown Prince's Mansion tomorrow.

705
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,990
The Crown Prince's Mansion?

706
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,650
Ask the crown prince for help.

707
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,030
The crown prince?

708
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,110
Let's go.

709
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:56,330
[Quiet]

710
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,590
[Quiet]

711
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,230
I couldn't believe Shang should have turned to the crown prince.

712
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,040
Can you still put up with it?

713
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,630
Then you needn't.

714
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,990
It's time.
