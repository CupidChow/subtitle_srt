[Fighting for love]

00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,009
[Episode 7]

4
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,500
I thought

5
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,830
all these years, conflicts

6
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,000
between Beimo and Nanxia

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,880
are just some small fights.

8
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,950
And there's no war.

9
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,830
Besides, Nanxia sends

10
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,190
food and money every year.

11
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,509
We never failed to perform.

12
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:55,310
There is no reason to break the contract for Beimo.

13
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,590
Father,

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,670
I think

15
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,070
Yinbao City was attacked by bandits.

16
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,630
The general failed to guard the city and was afraid of taking on responsibility.

17
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,190
So he blamed it on Beimo.

18
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,430
Father, you are wise.

19
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,590
Yinbao City was once a military industrial city.

20
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,400
Even if it declines, it can protect itself.

21
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,660
The enemy took the city

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,170
within a few hours.

23
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,990
They are well trained.

24
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,670
How could it be done by bandits?

25
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,850
Your Majesty,

26
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,680
I heard that

27
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,540
there have been many promising men in Beimo Army.

28
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,750
Besides, it's indeed strange that the Yinbao is lost.

29
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,050
Maybe Beimo really has the ambition to go south.

30
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,950
What ambition?

31
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,110
The emperor in Beimo

32
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,510
is just trying to get something from me.

33
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,710
Fine.

34
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,280
Send the diplomatic crops to the capital

35
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,590
and ask them what they want.

36
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,530
Have a discussion with them nicely.

37
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,740
There's no need to fight.

38
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,440
Father wants to negotiate peace again.

39
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,890
Do you have any objections?

40
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,730
I...

41
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,630
Father didn't want the people to suffer in war,

42
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,030
so he had to give in.

43
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,220
Brother,

44
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,350
why don't you understand

45
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,030
father's efforts?

46
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,210
Crown Prince.

47
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,550
Don't always stay in the Eastern Palace.

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,440
Go out more often.

49
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,290
Yes, Father.

50
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,140
I’m leaving.

51
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,690
How is Shi Yuan?

52
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,110
Your Majesty,

53
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,830
I think it’s almost time.

54
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,150
Keep an eye on Marquis Dingnan's Mansion.

55
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,260
If there is any news,

56
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,850
don't hide it from Shenghua.

57
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,070
Brother,

59
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,210
you've lost your calm today.

60
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,140
Thank you for pointing out.

61
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,790
I have something else to do.

62
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,050
Please help yourself.

63
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,050
Brother.

64
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,910
Are you mad at me?

65
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,070
My concern is that with father's age,

66
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,670
he shouldn't be worried about the war.

67
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,070
I just agreed with him.

68
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,630
It's not because of brother.

69
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,520
You're a filial second son.

70
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,150
Why would I worry?

71
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,550
That's great.

72
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,110
Since you have something important to do,

73
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,310
I'll leave you alone.

74
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,510
See you.

75
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,920
Do you have time to take a walk, Your Highness?

76
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,330
Sir, there is blood here.

77
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:08,910
Go away!

78
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,650
Keep your eyes wide open.

79
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,530
Don't miss any mark.

80
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:32,909
Xiu'er

81
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,790
Go!

82
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,490
Hurry! After them!

83
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,370
Let's go.

84
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,150
Your Highness, are you unwilling to negotiate peace?

85
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,950
Father has repeatedly yielded to Beimo.

86
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:52,280
As long as the army of Beimo is outside the border,

87
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,550
the court will send out the peace crops.

88
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,690
Not only will they send food and people,

89
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,420
they even give up the land.

90
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,230
Where is the national pride of Nanxia?

91
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,920
Father thought

92
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,880
as long as we don't put the people into war,

93
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,460
It is cherishing the people.

94
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,490
Don't you know everything sent

95
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,570
are the flesh and blood of the people?

96
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,910
Everything are heavy taxes from the people.

97
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,380
It is actually harming the people even more.

98
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
It's hard for the people to survive.

99
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,950
Your Highness putting people at the first place

100
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,060
is a blessing of Nanxia.

101
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,410
What's the use?

102
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,990
Father is so stubborn.

103
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,820
I can't persuade him at all.

104
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,950
Although I'm a civil official,

105
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,520
I'm not willing to give up the land of Nanxia.

106
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,030
The kid in Beimo is a puppet emperor.

107
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,710
And the administrative officials are split apart.

108
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,310
There's nothing to worry about.

109
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,770
In that case,

110
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,920
why don't you suggest father to counter-attack

111
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,430
and fight back?

112
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,660
First,

113
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,950
the generals in the court are withering.

114
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,590
No one can take the job.

115
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,100
Second,

116
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,230
His Majesty is concerned about the internal affairs and has no time for others.

117
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,310
Father...

118
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,710
Your Highness can't interfere in this matter. It's useless to think too much.

119
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,230
But there is one more thing

120
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,200
Your Highness must pay more attention to.

121
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,920
Thank you for reminding me.

122
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,310
It's late.

123
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,030
I should go back.

124
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,070
I'll see you out.

125
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,550
Brother Mai.

126
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,520
There's blood!

127
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,950
Slowly.

128
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,850
Is that Young Marquis?

129
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,490
That’s Mai.

130
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,130
Young Marquis.

131
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,030
Mai.

132
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,890
Young Marquis.

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,990
It's really you.

134
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,870
I told you we're destined to meet.

135
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,380
What's wrong with you?

136
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,040
Why are your clothes so dirty?

137
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,490
You're not any better.

138
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,750
Which one of us is dirtier?

139
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,270
It's the same.

140
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,150
It's the same.

141
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,900
That's why we're destined to be together.

142
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,090
Young Marquis.

143
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,870
What happened to you?

144
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
Don't mention it.

145
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,110
After we parted that day,

146
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,830
Longyin Guards have been after me.

147
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,230
I've been hiding in the forest for two days.

148
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,590
I see.

149
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:51,830
Xiu'er

150
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,230
This is Marquis Dingnan I mentioned to you.

151
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,790
Your Grace, this is Xiu'er.

152
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,030
I escaped from Yinbao City with her.

153
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,500
Hello, Xiu'er.

154
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,420
Greetings, Your Grace.

155
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,550
What? Escape?

156
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,720
General Chang Yuqing of Beimo

157
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,080
attacked Yingbao City.

158
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,410
We escaped from death.

159
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,370
We planned to go to Qingzhou to ask for your help.

160
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,270
It seems that

161
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,570
you didn't enter the city either.

162
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,600
We're sailing in the same boat.

163
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,390
What should we do?

164
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,270
I have an idea.

165
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,520
Can you ask your guards

166
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,390
to make a trip?

167
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,640
To lure the Longyin Guards here.

168
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,800
No.

169
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,580
My duty is to protect Young Marquis.

170
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,580
If you weren't, I wouldn't need you.

171
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,270
I...

172
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,870
Do you want to enter the city?

173
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,360
Mu Bai.

174
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,580
Mai is reliable.

175
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,630
Listen to her. Go.

176
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,550
Alright.

177
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,390
Zhao Zhong, Li Yu,

178
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,540
take care of Young Marquis.

179
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,350
Don't worry. Be careful.

180
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,870
Okay.

181
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,590
Be careful.

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,830
What should we do now?

183
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,360
You really trust me?

184
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,200
Yes.

185
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
Then come with me.

186
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,130
They stay and take care of Xiu'er.

187
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,320
Your Grace, no.

188
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,030
You two stay here to protect Miss Xiu'er.

189
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,960
This is an order.

190
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,130
-This...
-Let’s go.

191
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,330
Brother Mai, where are you going?

192
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,350
Xiu'er.

193
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,910
Hide yourself well.

194
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,360
I'll pick you up soon.

195
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:25,830
Let's go.

196
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,730
Don't worry.

197
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,260
Young Marquis, be careful.

198
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,720
What's going on?

199
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,310
Sir,

200
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,550
this horse is not Marquis Dingnan's.

201
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,590
Sir.

202
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,080
There is no other trace.

203
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,750
It's a trap.

204
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,000
They didn't go far.

205
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,830
As long as we guard the entrance of the valley,

206
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,110
they can't escape.

207
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,150
Yes.

208
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,960
Retreat.

209
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,000
When they see the smoke,

210
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,800
someone will come to us.

211
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,590
Since we had this method,

212
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,190
why did you let Xiao Bai go?

213
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,710
You saw through me.

214
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
What do you mean?

215
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,190
Actually, I am not

216
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,120
go to Qingzhou to deliver message.

217
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,320
I want to go to Beimo.

218
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,810
Now the war makes it hard to go out.

219
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,320
Why don't I use Marquis Dingnan

220
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,910
in exchange of a passport to Beimo?

221
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,450
Mai.

222
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,080
Are you serious?

223
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,670
You really think I thought of you as a friend?

224
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,250
I treated you well, right?

225
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,000
Sergeant, look over there.

226
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,670
Take a look. Be careful.

227
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,350
Let's go.

228
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:40,960
Sir.

229
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,770
Is something wrong?

230
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,260
Should I go and take a look?

231
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,840
We're short-handed.

232
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,870
We have to prevent traps.

233
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,850
Young Marquis.

234
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,720
Run!

235
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,390
Leave four people behind.

236
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,450
The rest follow me.

237
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,960
Everyone,

238
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,190
if we can bring Marquis Dingnan back alive,

239
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,720
we can take Qingzhou

240
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,950
without a single soldier.

241
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,960
Isn't that a great merit?

242
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,550
Young Marquis.

243
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,150
Mai, what are you doing?

244
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,350
Let Young Marquis go.

245
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,420
The buyer has arrived.

246
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,750
If you don't decide,

247
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,340
I'll have to talk to them.

248
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,510
Okay.

249
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,080
Give him to me.

250
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,850
I promise I'll send you out.

251
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,870
Who dares to take away the people I want?

252
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
He's the Guard General of Qingzhou.

253
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,950
He is in charge of the military power of Qingzhou.

254
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,390
His life is more valuable than a dead body.

255
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,830
Get ready to run.

256
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,140
Marquis Dingnan, Shang Yizhi, colluded with Beimo.

257
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,550
Kill him without mercy.

258
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,150
Go!

259
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:39,840
Go.

260
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,550
Go.

261
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,570
Notify the people at the entrance! Stop them!

262
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,050
Pull yourselves together.

263
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,510
We can't let him out of the valley.

264
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,190
Yes.

265
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,580
We are fine.

266
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,970
Mai. Mai.

267
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,690
I don’t know why.

268
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,349
You are like another person

269
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,369
and treated me very rude.

270
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,220
I can feel the tension

271
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,670
and excitement.

272
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,589
No reason.

273
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,000
He did it to save you.

274
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,490
Sorry, I didn't tell you.

275
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,020
Because I was afraid that you couldn't do it well.

276
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,349
Don't tell me next time.

277
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,900
Not bad.

278
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,470
What are you talking about?

279
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,310
You're talking nonsense.

280
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,190
Let me tell you.

281
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,520
It's hard for us to get there even if we reached the entrance.

282
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm also worried about this.

283
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,530
How about this?

284
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,360
I'll pick up Xiu'er.

285
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,500
We'll meet at the entrance of the valley.

286
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Keep an eye on him.

287
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,110
Let's go.

288
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,700
Come.

289
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,000
Brother Mai.

290
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,450
Xiu'er.

291
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,080
Brother Mai.

292
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,200
Thank you for taking care of Xiu'er.

293
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,750
You're welcome. Where's His Grace.

294
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,310
Let's meet at the entrance of the valley.

295
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:09,830
Okay.

296
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:10,720
Let's go.

297
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,260
Here.

298
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,650
It’s guarded.

299
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,280
Will Mai be in danger?

300
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,420
He’s smart.

301
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,290
Don't worry.

302
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:49,970
Be careful.

303
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,320
Young Marquis.

304
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
Are you all right?

305
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,410
Yes.

306
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,960
I was so worried.

307
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,410
Where were you just now?

308
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,730
I went to make some preparations.

309
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,350
What are you doing?

310
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,050
Your face is dirty.

311
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,270
So I wipe it for you.

312
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,250
Did he find out that I'm a girl?

313
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,560
It shouldn't be.

314
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,860
Don't look at me like that.

315
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,220
It's creepy.

316
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,740
Let me tell you.

317
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,360
I know you nobles

318
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,530
have people who like guys.

319
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,260
I'm warning you, I don't have that kind of fetish.

320
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,560
I see.

321
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,880
Why are you humming?

322
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,590
If you hum,

323
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,120
it'll be harder to explain.

324
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,110
Alright, no need to explain.

325
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,740
I understand.

326
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,000
Take off your clothes.

327
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,370
Take off your clothes.

328
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,870
People are watching.

329
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,430
Hurry up.

330
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,790
This...

331
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,270
Turn around.

332
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,030
Hurry up.

333
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,360
-Take it off.
-Hurry up.

334
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,950
It's urgent.

335
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,660
Don't look.

336
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,240
Give it to me.

337
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,190
It's your turn. I'm in a hurry too.

338
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,550
I'm pretending to be you

339
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,140
and distract them with Mu Bai.

340
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,350
Take Xiu'er and run out.

341
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,230
Understand?

342
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,270
Let go!

343
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,230
No, this...

344
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,360
No, I don't agree.

345
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,490
It's too dangerous.

346
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,350
Let me go.

347
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,150
It's useless.

348
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,790
Only I know my schemes.

349
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,430
This...

350
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,790
I'll go.

351
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,270
Xiu'er.

352
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,130
After I leave, follow Zhao Zhong.

353
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:35,910
Go.

354
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,290
Don't you want me anymore?

355
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,670
This...

356
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,590
Xiu'er.

357
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,170
Don't think too much.

358
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,640
I promise. I'll be back soon.

359
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,340
It's just temporary.

360
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,600
Let's go.

361
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,120
Go.

362
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,190
It's them! Go after them!

363
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,240
This way.

364
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,640
Jump with me.

365
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,470
Stop!

366
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,120
Come here.

367
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,040
Come on. Jump.

368
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,520
Come on!

369
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:44,910
-Let’s go.
-Brother.

370
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,470
Go!

371
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,630
Go!

372
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,630
Go!

373
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,470
-Get him!
-No.

374
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,030
Brother, it's fake.

375
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:55,950
We are fooled.

376
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,670
Go!

377
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,940
Is this your trap?

378
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,030
Are you impressed? No need to say anything.

379
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,290
Just keep that in mind.

380
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,470
Thank you.

381
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,670

This painting is worth 20 years of Xu Jing's life.

574
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
Mr. Xu,

575
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,520
please get up.

576
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,600
Mother has told me everything.

577
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,870
For the sake of our family,

578
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,090
you've remained incognito in Qingzhou for over 20 years.

579
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,190
It is a great merit.

580
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,320
You are my master.

581
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,150
Young Marquis, you don't have to do this.

582
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,389
I'm indebted to Princess Shenghua.

583
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,909
I will do my best.

584
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,010
May I ask...

585
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:24,690
This man

586
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,580
is a friend I know in Shengdu.

587
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,330
Without him,

588
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,560
I will not be able to arrive safely.

589
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,489
Greetings, Mr.Xu.

590
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,469
You must be in great danger.

591
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,810
Thanks to Mai.

592
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,210
It's my pleasure.

593
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:47,780
Mr. Xu.

594
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,850
Before my mother left,

595
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,300
she gave me a list.

596
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,800
A list of trustworthy people who

597
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,000
were my father's former subordinates.

598
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,380
I wonder if General Liang Shao and Wei Peng

599
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,620
are in the camp now?

600
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,870
Although I'm not in the army,

601
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,590
I have a tacit understanding with all generals.

602
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,700
The generals treat Wei Peng and Liang Shao as leaders.

603
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,220
General Wei Peng fought well.

604
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,710
He became a general step by step.

605
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,630
His Grace praised him a lot.

606
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,920
Why don't you ask him the way of leading army.

607
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,910
There's another person, General Liang Shao.

608
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,070
He used to be His Grace's guard.

609
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,350
Later, he injured his leg.

610
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,630
His Grace entrusted him

611
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,590
to General Wei Peng.

612
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,350
He's experienced and loyal.

613
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,650
We can trust him.

614
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:42,830
I'll send someone

615
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,030
to inform the two generals.

616
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,220
Tomorrow morning, Young Marquis will take the office first.

617
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,180
Don't worry.

618
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,170
Thank you, Mr.Xu.

619
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,790
You're really something.

620
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,120
Why not take a carriage?

621
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,890
What do you know?

622
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,530
It's the first day the new officer takes office.

623
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,790
I have to let them see me.

624
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,630
What to show them if I sit in the carriage.

625
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,560
To watch horses.

626
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,310
You didn't rest well?

627
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,870
It's you taking the office.

628
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,230
You can go alone.

629
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,560
Why did you wake me up early in the morning?

630
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,350
I slept much less than you.

631
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,330
Waking up to pick an armor?

632
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,870
I can't tell.

633
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,840
You're a man.

634
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,520
You've been choosing all morning.

635
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,830
There's no difference in this armor.

636
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,550
People who don't know

637
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,390
would think you're getting married today.

638
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,850
The most important thing for men is details.

639
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,040
It's called paying attention.

640
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,130
I guess you're the only one who cares.

641
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,550
You know what?

642
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,610
According to my observation,

643
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,010
the people on the streets

644
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,830
are probably my father's old subordinates.

645
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,690
They are protecting me in secret.

646
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,330
How can I be the only one who cares about it?

647
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,610
There are many people.

648
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,450
I am in a high position.

649
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,670
Those soldiers

650
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,270
will feel like they are walking on thin ice.

651
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,790
You'll get used to it.

652
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,870
Young Marquis.

653
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,350
Be careful.

654
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,480
What?

655
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,140
This is Qingzhou.

656
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,460
My father has protected Qingzhou for so many years.

657
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,940
Everyone has to show me some respect.

658
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,940
[City Guard Mansion]

659
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,870
City Guard Mansion

660
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,150
Why is the gate open?

661
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,150
Brothers, let's go.

662
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:51,080
[City Guard Mansion]

663
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,150
Yes.

664
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,510
Come here.

665
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,610
Coming.

666
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,430
Come on, cheers.

667
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,830
Come on. We must drink.

668
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,750
Come on.

669
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,330
Cheers.

670
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,340
Good wine.

671
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,590
Don't mention it.

672
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,350
Here comes the General.

673
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,210
Where is your manner?

674
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:23,720
Ge...

675
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,390
No.

676
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,770
This is the thin ice you are talking about?

677
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,780
It's so thick.

678
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,670
City Guard Mansion is an important place.

679
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,330
How can we let anyone break in?

680
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,030
Which camp is on duty today?

681
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,360
This is ridiculous.

682
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,090
Young Master,

683
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,590
you should leave.

684
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,910
Leave now.

685
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,590
Let's go.

686
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,870
You don't know who I am?

687
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,920
No.

688
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,490
My name is Shang Yizhi.

689
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,270
I'm the new Guard General of Qingzhou.

690
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,450
We did receive

691
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,200
that the new guard general will be on duty.

692
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,470
But since General Shang is a military general,

693
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:32,650
those who practice martial arts should look rough.

694
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,070
It doesn't make sense that you're a delicate little boy.

695
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:36,830
Right?

696
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,430
Listen to your word.

697
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,550
I am doubting myself.

698
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,310
Really?

699
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,830
Then I can only find someone sensible

700
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,920
to talk.

701
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,460
Where is Deputy General Wei Peng?

702
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,110
General Wei was transferred yesterday.

703
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,590
He has departed overnight,

704
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,320
and no longer work in Qingzhou.

705
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,690
What about Liang Shao?

706
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,400
He took the position with General Wei.

707
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,850
Not only the two generals,

708
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,860
but also their subordinates and other generals

709
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,980
went to the new office together.

710
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,070
This table

711
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,550
was supposed to be a farewell banquet for all generals.

712
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,110
But the generals left in a hurry.

713
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,910
So we stayed and ate it ourselves.

714
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,540
[Marquis Dingnan]

715
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,880
Open your eyes and look carefully.

716
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,760
This is the token of Marquis Dingnan's.

717
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,850
[Marquis Dingnan]

718
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,100
So, it really is the General.

719
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,870
Pardon my rudeness.

720
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,230
It's been so many days.

721
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,550
I wonder what you look like.

722
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,190
Forget it.

723
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,120
I understand.

724
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,040
I forgive you.

725
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,990
But why are these two

726
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,010
got drunk as soon as they see me?

727
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,470
Get up.

728
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,430
His Excellency has arrived.

729
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,220
We can't let others say

730
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,270
our Qingzhou Army doesn't know the rules.

731
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,420
Get up.

732
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,110
Your Excellency.

733
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,880
I'm really sorry.

734
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,910
They just took the medicine.

735
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,350
Now the medicine is kicking in and they are sleeping well.

736
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,710
You are generous.

737
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,120
Please don't mind.
