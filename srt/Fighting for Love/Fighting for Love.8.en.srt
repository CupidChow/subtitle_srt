[Fighting for love]

00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,009
Episode 8

4
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,880
General Shang,

5
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,750
You know what?

6
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:45,920
Lieutenant Zhao

7
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,430
calculated the number of provisions and weapons last night,

8
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,960
and didn't sleep all night.

9
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,310
Lieutenant Sun

10
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,190
was even so worried about the change of defence troops

11
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,750
that his hair turned white.

12
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,070
I see.

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,590
I feel ashamed.

14
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,830
To be honest,

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,480
my ancestors

16
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,150
had a long-lost secret therapy.

17
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,510
It's called Bloodletting Therapy.

18
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,350
I'm sure after we use a course of this treatment on these two lieutenants,

19
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,830
they will be as energetic as you.

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,030
Bai.

21
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,870
Fetch my knife for me

22
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,310
so that I can use the Bloodletting Therapy

23
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,770
on these two lieutenants.

24
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,960
Young Marquis.

25
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,200
Didn't you just say that

26
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,350
you wanted to go to the downtown area to buy something?

27
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,750
Let's go.

28
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,550
Fine.

29
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,110
We are a family from now on.

30
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,829
Yes.

31
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,630
When there's a chance, I'll use the Bloodletting Therapy.

32
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,490
General Shang,

33
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,190
I'll hold a welcome party for you another day.

34
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,990
Okay.

35
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,040
Bye, General.

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,770
We'll use the Bloodletting Therapy another day.

37
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,120
Come out, soldiers.

38
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,570
All of you should leave first.

39
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,190
Yes.

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,579
Why haven't you two got up yet?

41
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,800
What was wrong with you two?

42
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,590
We agreed to release the signal by throwing the cups at the same time.

43
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,950
Why did you two pretend to be drunk as soon as he came?

44
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,790
We almost succeeded in killing him.

45
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,550
No.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,670
Qian.

47
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,570
His Majesty always changes his mind.

48
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,310
Let's delay this plan for some more time.

49
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:46,880
Right.

50
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,480
Bullshit!

51
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,750
If Young Marquis doesn't cause trouble,

52
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,680
and we keep an eye on him carefully,

53
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,030
I don't think the superiors in Shengdu will say anything.

54
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,600
Anyway, what they've asked us to do

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
is not something honorable.

56
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,150
Why don't we wait for some more time?

57
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,880
Let's take action after we make a plan carefully.

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,310
We're finally back safely.

59
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,269
There were so many soldiers lurking inside the room just now.

60
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,350
I tried my best to warn you by winking at you,

61
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,990
but you still kept talking.

62
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,670
I'm afraid there will be a rebellion in Qingzhou.

63
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,530
Young Marquis.

64
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,300
It's not that they want to rebel,

65
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,280
but in their minds, you are the one who rebels.

66
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,870
They think they're trying to quell the rebellion.

67
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,430
Mai.

68
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,300
Don't talk nonsense.

69
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,990
Forget it.

70
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,360
It doesn't matter who rebels.

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,110
At this point, we should seize the time to escape at once.

72
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,270
It's not a bad idea.

73
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,870
What do you think?

74
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,050
I'll listen to you.

75
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,810
Let's escape then.

76
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,470
Let's escape at one.

77
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,330
Young Marquis.

78
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,130
Young Marquis.

79
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,390
The city has been sealed.

80
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,190
Why did they seal the city in broad daylight?

81
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,790
I went to the city gate first,

82
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,470
but I heard the city gate official Wang Yang announce to seal the city.

83
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,950
He said that after Young Marquis took office,

84
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,350
there would be a change of defence troops inside the city,

85
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,950
and it was necessary to seal the city for seven days.

86
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,710
See?

87
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,710
These bastards are determined

88
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,230
to keep me here.

89
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,030
Don't worry.

90
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,560
They can’t confine us here.

91
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,610
Let’s go discuss with Mr. Xu about the strategy.

92
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,470
Okay.

93
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,170
The people we sent out haven't come back yet.

94
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,920
It means that these two generals are probably in danger.

95
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,870
Yes.

96
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,680
You didn't see what happened just now.

97
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,550
These three men

98
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,350
were so bold.

99
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,950
Luckily, Mai took me out in time.

100
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,310
Otherwise, I would have

101
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,080
been killed by them.

102
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,470
Mai is so smart.

103
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,490
I just used some petty tricks.

104
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,750
I'm thinking if Zhao, Qian and Sun

105
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,150
really wanted to kill you,

106
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,630
I'm afraid you wouldn't have been able to

107
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,090
walk out of the City Guard Mansion so easily.

108
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,510
As you said, among the three men,

109
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,990
two of them pretended to be drunk,

110
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,790
and one of them talked to you.

111
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,070
That means they have different opinions.

112
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,430
Maybe this is a chance.

113
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,030
Sir,

114
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,440
how should we seize this opportunity?

115
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,050
Do what you're best at.

116
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,110
Just be a playboy.

117
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,590
Come and take a look.

118
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,550
Come and take a look.

119
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,110
This one.

120
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,350
This one, this one, this one,

121
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,240
this one, this one and this one.

122
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
I want all of them.

123
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,680
It looks so nice.

124
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:49,630
Thank you.

125
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,270
This one, this one and this one.

126
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,950
I want all of them.

127
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,030
Thank you.

128
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,640
What are you carrying?

129
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,470
Steward Liu,

130
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,630
here are a pair of Eight-treasure Silver Lights

131
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,710
purchased by the general,

132
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,950
a pair of Celadon Conch Pearl Vases,

133
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,710
some calligraphy works and paintings,

134
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,510
and some silk cloth and fabrics.

135
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,230
They were all purchased by the general?

136
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,790
Yes.

137
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,790
The general also asked you to decide where to put them.

138
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,560
Well, hurry up.

139
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Carry them into the house. Hurry up.

140
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,640
There are so many items.

141
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,720
Mai.

142
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,400
Is it quite inappropriate for us

143
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,799
to spend money like this?

144
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,929
He is Marquis Dingnan,

145
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,030
who is a famous playboy in Shengdu.

146
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,150
Didn't you see it?

147
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,070
This morning,

148
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,830
he bought many good things

149
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,990
for his own home.

150
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,020
You want to save money for him?

151
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,940
You can

152
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,310
buy whatever you want.

153
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,170
Did you hear me?

154
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,190
We bought women's stuff.

155
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,990
You don't need it, Mai.

156
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,950
He's willing to spend money.

157
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,670
You can buy whatever you want.

158
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,670
Mai is right.

159
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,790
You are his sister,

160
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,470
so I also regard you as my sister.

161
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,990
Just ask me to buy anything you want to get in the future.

162
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,990
Did you hear that?

163
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,510
I don't want to be Mai's sister.

164
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,410
Young Marquis.

165
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,070
You spent a lot of money,

166
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,300
but you didn't frown at all.

167
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,030
You're really rich and generous.

168
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,590
As the host, I'm just trying to show hospitality.

169
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,670
But it's a pity.

170
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,190
It's a pity?

171
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,600
Though Yough Marquis is generous,

172
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,790
the scene isn't big enough.

173
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,800
What do you mean?

174
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,660
[Yunshuijian Wine Shop]

175
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,350
Take care.

176
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,550
Sir!

177
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,990
What would you like, gentlemen?

178
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,120
Let me recommend some products to you.

179
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,430
I've decided to

180
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,390
buy all the wine in your shop.

181
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,320
You'll buy all the wine?

182
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,200
Are you sure?

183
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,070
Okay. I’ll arrange it for you at once.

184
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,150
Where is your mansion?

185
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,070
We can deliver the wine to your mansion.

186
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,710
No need.

187
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,390
Open all these wine jars

188
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,830
and put them outside.

189
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,830
We want to treat all the people in the city to some wine.

190
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,790
Look. There is a lot of wine here.

191
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,140
It's Marquis Dingnan's treat today.

192
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,630
Drink as much as you want!

193
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,030
Great! Great! Great!

194
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,310
Thank you, Marquis Dingnan.

195
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,640
-Thank you, Marquis Dingnan. -Thank you, Marquis Dingnan.

196
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,800
What a big scene it is today.

197
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,880
It's not big enough.

198
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,480
Sir,

199
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,670
do you have any

200
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,330
precious one-thousand-year-old wine here?

201
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,470
There's no one-thousand-year-old wine here.

202
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,300
But there are a few jars of one-hundred-year-old wine.

203
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,830
Those are the treasures of our shop.

204
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,830
I'll buy them all.

205
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,900
Okay.

206
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,960
Serve the wine.

207
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,030
Guys, look. There's still some wine.

208
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,510
There's still some wine.

209
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,440
What wine is this?

210
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
This is good wine.

211
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,070
It smells so good.

212
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,190
Come on. Look, guys.

213
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:36,750
There's still some wine.

214
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,150
There's still some wine?

215
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,710
It smells so good.

216
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,310
It smells so good.

217
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,070
Good wine!

218
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,960
Good wine! Good wine! Good!

219
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,750
Sir.

220
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,710
This jar of wine

221
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,790
will be the treasure of your shop from now on.

222
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,390
Okay.

223
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,330
Young Marquis.

224
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,050
Give this wine a name.

225
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,870
This wine is a combination of various kinds of good wine,

226
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,950
and it's rare in the world.

227
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,440
Why don't we call it

228
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,980
Immortal Drunk?

229
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,790
What do you think?

230
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,350
Good.

231
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,150
Immortal Drunk is a good name.

232
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,510
Buddies,

233
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,810
go back and tell your family and friends that

234
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,680
Marquis Dingnan bought the best wine in the world

235
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,610
with 10,000 taels of silver today.

236
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,310
It's called Immortal Drunk!

237
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,950
Good! Good!

238
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,590
Cheers!

239
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,190
Good! Good! Good Wine!

240
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,350
[Yunshuijian]

241
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,870
Bottoms up.

242
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,070
Good! Good wine! The wine is good!

243
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,910
Let's drink.

244
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,720
Let's drink.

245
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,190
Cheers!

246
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,070
Sir,

247
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,630
do you think I spent money lavishly enough like a playboy?

248
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,670
Young Marquis.

249
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,760
An ordinary person's lifelong expenses

250
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,960
are not as large as your expenses today.

251
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,190
When I came up with this plan,

252
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,720
I never thought that

253
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,570
you could carry out this plan so thoroughly

254
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,190
and so perfectly.

255
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,790
You are a genius.

256
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,690
You're the one who is brilliant.

257
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,030
You know what?

258
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,980
My mother has no desire.

259
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,150
Basically, the burden of spending money in our family

260
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,510
is borne by me.

261
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,190
Okay.

262
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,730
Young Marquis.

263
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,180
Since you bought the Immortal Drunk

264
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,070
in such an eye-catching way,

265
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,470
why don't we go on using this trick to deal with them?

266
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,630
On the first day, General Shang

267
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,990
bought a pair of Eight-treasure Silver Lights,

268
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,790
a pair of Celadon Conch Pearl Vases,

269
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,630
and some pieces of jewellery.

270
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,110
He also bought over a dozen bolts of cloth.

271
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,640
On the second day, he went to the rouge shop

272
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,950
and bought ten boxes of Yurong Powder.

273
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,710
The price was 80 taels per box.

274
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,630
Alright. That's enough.

275
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,890
Stop talking about it.

276
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,980
This Young Marquis spent money so lavishly.

277
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,430
I remember that the weapons in our barracks

278
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,830
are all old models which were bought more than ten years ago.

279
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,080
The money spent by Young Marquis in one day

280
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,530
is enough to buy a batch of new weapons for us.

281
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,330
I really want to rob him.

282
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,270
By the way,

283
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,400
Qi,

284
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,020
besides shopping around the market

285
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,990
and eating in a restaurant every day,

286
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,850
did they ask about anything else?

287
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,150
Yes.

288
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,080
What did they ask about?

289
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,830
Did they ask about the movements of Deputy General Wei and the others?

290
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,750
They asked where they could buy the best antiques,

291
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,230
where they could find the prettiest ladies,

292
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,800
and which restaurant offered the most delicious food.

293
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,440
Bah!

294
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,750
What a playboy.

295
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,230
My annual salary

296
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,070
is not enough for me to eat at a restaurant every day.

297
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,940
Report!

298
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,350
My Lord.

299
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,580
[Invitation Letter]

300
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,740
General Shang from the Garrison General's Mansion sent an invitation letter here.

301
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,150
He wanted to invite the three lieutenants to a banquet.

302
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,950
He said he had bought some good wine at a high price a few days ago,

303
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,080
so he wanted to invite the three generals to taste it together.

304
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,840
See?

305
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,880
After he bought some good stuff, he wanted to show it off.

306
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,140
He really has nothing hidden in his mind.

307
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,650
Are we going or not?

308
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,770
I'm afraid there might be a trap in the banquet.

309
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,160
By the way,

310
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,620
the servants of the City Guard Mansion said that

311
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,310
General Shang spent no less than

312
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,570
10,000 taels of silver on this wine.

313
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,590
The merchants in the city are so eager to earn money from him.

314
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,230
They always hope that General Shang will go to their shops to buy their products.

315
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,390
They even gave General Shang a nickname, and the nickname is...

316
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,520
What nickname is it?

317
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,680
God of Wealth.

318
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,920
Let's all attend the banquet.

319
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,270
I'm just not afraid of him.

320
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,470
Let's all attend the banquet.

321
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,000
Let's all go to the banquet.

322
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:02,990
Mu Bai.

323
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,270
I'm so nervous that my palms are sweating.

324
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,400
Why are you nervous?

325
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,710
You rehearsed this scene in the room many times last night, didn't you?

326
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,910
How dare you say that?

327
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,470
You played three roles by yourself.

328
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,470
Can it be the same?

329
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,230
We can't make it public.

330
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,600
We have to be careful.

331
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,150
Fine.

332
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,670
As long as the three of them enter Qingfeng Pavilion,

333
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,070
they won't be able to get out safe and sound.

334
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,390
They're here.

335
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,170
I’ll sit over there first.

336
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,430
-General Shang. -General Shang.

337
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,290
General Shang, I'm sorry.

338
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,540
We're late.

339
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,690
I apologize to you on behalf of Qian.

340
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,080
Qian caught a cold last night.

341
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,320
He couldn't get up this morning.

342
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,640
In order not to spoil your mood,

343
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,990
we didn't inform you in advance.

344
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,070
Please forgive us.

345
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,240
Alright. His health is important.

346
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,440
Please.

347
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,270
Generals, please come in.

348
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,190
Okay. Please. Please.

349
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:12,510
Please.

350
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,440
Please. Please.

351
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,230
General Shang came from afar.

352
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,970
We should have held

353
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,329
a welcome party for you.

354
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,710
However,

355
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,590
both of us don't have much money.

356
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,880
We can only use this opportunity to welcome you.

357
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,030
A toast to you, General Shang.

358
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,470
-To General Shang.
-To General Shang.

359
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:35,990
Cheers.

360
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,400
Both the people and the wine are good in Qingzhou.

361
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,750
I'm very happy.

362
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,230
But I hope that you two

363
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,470
can take up more responsibility for military affairs in the future.

364
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,520
General Shang, don't say that.

365
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,390
After the change of defence troops is finished,

366
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,920
all the military affairs in Qingzhou will be handed over to you.

367
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,560
But that's not my ambition.

368
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,390
I hate managing trivial matters in the army the most.

369
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,710
Right.

370
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,910
General Shang, you were born with a noble status.

371
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,620
How can you manage these vulgar things?

372
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,180
Right?

373
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,600
Come on. Please.

374
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,250
However, I just think that

375
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,550
you two have worked hard with great merits.

376
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,160
You racked your brains to deal with the problems in the barracks.

377
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,710
Thereore, in order to reward you,

378
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,310
I've specially invited the Lanxiang Troupe

379
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,240
to dance here and bring us some fun.

380
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,310
Greetings, General Shang.

381
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,680
Today’s main guests

382
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,850
are the two officials in my barracks.

383
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,350
Greetings, My Lords.

384
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,830
Refill my cup with some wine at once.

385
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,830
Since ancient times, good wine and beautiful ladies have been a good match for heroes.

386
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,950
A toast to you two.

387
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,950
Cheers.

388
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,870
Let's have another cup of wine.

389
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,430
Cheers.

390
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,310
Lieutenant Qian didn't come.

391
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,430
But Young Marquis is inside now.

392
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,950
We have no choice but to take action.

393
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,510
At this point, we can't wait anymore.

394
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,430
We'll set out immediately.

395
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,070
Yes.

396
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,600
Mai.

397
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,280
Where are we going?

398
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,480
We'll pick up Young Marquis

399
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,160
and then go hunting.

400
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,840

401
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,750
♫My friend would like to pick it up♫

402
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:06,230
♫We looked for friends while wearing armor, and all the soldiers got along well with each other♫

403
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,870
Bravo!

404
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,020
Cheers.

405
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,200
Come on. You should drink, too.

406
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,470
We thought that

407
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,070
all the young aristocrats from Shengdu

408
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,310
were just some wilful and bad-tempered men.

409
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,070
I didn’t expect that General Shang

410
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,530
would be such an unrestrained and frank man.

411
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,230
Not really.

412
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,400
But having fun

413
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,030
is my top priority.

414
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,390
Buddies,

415
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,190
if there's any fun activity,

416
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,390
remember to inform me first.

417
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,270
Okay.

418
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,790
I've prepared some small gifts for you.

419
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,530
Refill the cups.

420
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:11,060
Is this the legendary Immortal Drunk?

421
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,950
Exactly.

422
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,410
Come on.

423
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,760
Please.

424
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,470
Wait.

425
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,130
General Shang.

426
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,640
We can't drink this wine.

427
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,550
You don't believe me, do you?

428
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,320
Well...

429
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,710
You two can drink as much as you want.

430
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,990
I have to go to the toilet.

431
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,230
After I come back, let's continue to dance.

432
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,050
Help yourselves, please.

433
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,310
Qi.

434
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,030
Escort the general to the toilet.

435
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,590
Yes.

436
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,150
Buddy.

437
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,070
When you're here,

438
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,130
I'm not able to pee.

439
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,440
General.

440
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,780
General! General!

441
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,800
Why has Young Marquis used the toilet

442
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,790
for so long?

443
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,270
Right.

444
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,600
He hasn't come back yet after such a long time.

445
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,470
You...

446
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,480
Go look for Qi.

447
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,440
Knockout incense. Knockout incense.

448
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,230
General.

449
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,430
General, have you finished?

[Qingfeng Pavilion]

451
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,270
Come here.

452
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,590
General! General!

453
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,390
General!

454
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,510
General!

455
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,630
Did both of them pass out?

456
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,550
I drank a lot of wine.

457
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,470
I came out after I saw that the knockout incense was ignited.

458
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,150
The knockout incense skills which Chunniang taught me

459
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,480
are finally useful now.

460
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,440
However, Qian didn't come. What should we do?

461
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,590
I thought if we killed all the three of them at this time,

462
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,830
Qingzhou would be yours.

463
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,470
But I think they started to get vigilant a long time ago.

464
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,580
We have no choice but to take this opportunity to escape.

465
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,510
Let's get out of the city first before we talk.

466
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,070
Okay.

467
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,700
[Qingfeng Pavilion]

468
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,310
Oh no.

469
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:07,760
General.

470
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,550
General.

471
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,830
Qi.

472
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,140
My Lord, how are you?

473
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,100
Qi, help me up to go after Shang Yizhi now.

474
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:17,950
Hurry up.

475
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,790
General Shang, please stop.

476
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,870
Wang Yang,

477
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,590
open the city gate for me.

478
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,830
I'm sorry, but I can't do as you said.

479
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,770
You're so bold!

480
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,200
How dare you stop me?

481
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,090
General Shang is leaving in such a hurry.

482
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,190
Where are you going?

483
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,550
Lieutenant Qian.

484
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,240
Just now, the other two lieutenants

485
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,510
didn't have enough fun while eating at the banquet.

486
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,070
They said they wanted to eat wild rabbits.

487
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,590
I'm going out of the city

488
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,610
to hunt two wild rabbits for them.

489
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,750
No need.

490
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,980
We have many wild rabbits.

491
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,210
Come on. Ask General Shang to go back to his mansion.

492
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,640
Oh no.

493
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,590
I should have mentioned a rare species.

[Garrison General's Mansion]

495
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,570
Guard the place carefully.

496
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,230
Don't let even a fly come out.

497
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,000
Yes!

498
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,990
Shang is even from a noble family,

499
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,230
but he used such dirty tricks.

500
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,480
I still have a headache now.

501
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,820
Alright. It's good that your head is still there.

502
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,870
If Qian had not

503
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,480
caught up with Shang Yizhi in time,

504
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,880
I might have lost my head.

505
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,310
Qian,

506
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,830
I owe you a favor this time.

507
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,390
Just tell me what you want me to do.

508
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,350
We can't let Shang Yizhi stay alive anymore.

509
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,010
No problem.

510
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,520
I'll take two people to kill and bury him.

511
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,820
You don't need to interfere.

512
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,620
Wait.

513
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,790
If it was that simple,

514
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,640
would I have let him stay alive till today?

515
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,590
We can neither kill him nor let him stay alive.

516
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,420
What on earth do you want?

517
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,870
Shang Yizhi must die.

518
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,150
But he shouldn't be killed by us.

519
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,020
So you mean...

520
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,000
Sir.

521
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,470
How is it?

522
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,900
I've checked all these several gates.

523
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,500
All the gates are heavily guarded.

in the east room alone by them.

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,580
Everything is ready.

530
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,170
Okay.

531
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,890
Steward Liu used to be the old marquis's body guard.

532
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,940
He's trustworthy.

533
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,950
He has been staying in the General's Mansion all the time,

534
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,310
and has guarded an escape route for us successfully.

535

There's a secret passage in the Garrison General's Mansion.

536
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,250
The exit is on the back street outside the mansion.

537
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,450
It's a secluded place and few people go there.

538
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,360
I'll go save Young Marquis.

539
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,290
Let's leave here after we save him.

542
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,320
and took Young Marquis away directly.

548
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,070
Let me tell you.

If you want money or a higher official position,

550
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,240
I can give them to you.

551
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,170
As long as you let me go, it'll be fine.

552
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,000
Come on. Take him there.

553
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,890
Where is this place?

554
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,720
No.

555
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,150
Go.

556
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,880
Go inside.

00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,530
Work hard.

558
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,630
Be careful when you inquire about his news.

559
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,510
Don't expose your whereabouts.

560
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,990
Don't worry, sir.

561
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,990
Come on, Sun.

562
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,390
Let's celebrate our success in solving this problem.

563
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:03,910
Cheers.

564
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,960
It's all thanks to Qian this time.

565
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,830
If it weren't for him,

566
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,510
both of us

567
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,790
would have been affected by Marquis Shang's knockout incense till now.

568
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,510
Right.

569
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,590
But Qian didn't do it in vain.

570
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,710
Not only did he deal with Shang Yizhi,

571
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,270
but he also made that marquis earn money for him.

572
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,080
For a delicate young aristocrat from Shengdu like him,

573
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,540
how much money can he earn?

574
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,150
In Qian's place,

575
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,030
I'm afraid he can't survive for two or three days.

576
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:29,990
You...

577
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,800
Sun,

578
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,710
later, please do this hard job of

579
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,590
killing those two generals in jail.

580
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,110
Why do you want me to do it?

581
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,830
I'm not the one who wants you to do it.

582
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,110
I also have a mission, don't I?

583
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,390
What mission do you have?

584
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,670
Look. I have to keep an eye on those people

585
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,080
in the Garrison General's Mansion, don't I?

586
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,790
If they sneak out

587
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,990
and save Shang Yizhi,

588
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,870
we'll be in big trouble.

589
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,310
Can you stop walking around?

590
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,420
It's annoying to watch you walking around.

591
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:05,830
I...

592
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,550
I can't wait any longer.

593
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,150
Sir,

594
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,880
let me go out and look for him.

595
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,310
How is it?

596
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,970
Young Marquis is missing.

597
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,430
I'm afraid he's in danger.

598
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,510
Besides,

599
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,490
General Wei and General Liang will be killed by them.

600
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,490
What should we do?

601
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,200
Young Marquis is the only son of the Eldest Princess.

602
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,460
I don't think those three lieutenants dare to kill him directly.

603
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,650
However, General Wei and General Liang are in danger now.

604
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,030
We can't just stand by and do nothing.

605
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,510
Otherwise, we'll have no military power.

606
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,370
Even after we save Young Marquis,

607
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,970
we won't be able to change our situation of being weaker than our enemy.

608
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,270
What you said makes sense.

609
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,050
But we need more men

610
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,620
to rescue the two generals.

611
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,370
How about this?

612
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,330
You can take Bai and the others

613
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,710
to rescue the generals first.

614
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,150
I'll go find out about Young Marquis' whereabouts.

615
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,810
After our tasks are finished,

616
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,430
let's meet at your calligraphy works and paintings store.

617
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,670
Young Marquis' safety is entrusted to you.

618
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,430
Madam, have you seen Lieutenant Qian?

619
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,070
No.

620
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,150
We're looking for him everywhere.

621
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:19,630
I don't know.

622
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,890
Do you know where he is?

623
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,570
No, I don't.

624
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,310
Thank you.

625
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,160
Bro,

626
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,570
have you seen Lieutenant Qian on the way?

627
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,350
I don't know.

628
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,510
The city has been sealed, hasn't it?

629
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,080
Have you seen where the troops go?

630
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,750
No, I haven't.

631
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,680
Okay. Thank you.

632
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,670
Madam,

633
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,120
which is the shortest way to Yunshuijian?

634
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,910
Go straight along this road.

635
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,790
Then go through that area and go towards that direction.

636
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,470
Then turn right and you'll arrive.

637
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,470
Thank you, Madam.

638
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,360
[Yunshuijian Wine Shop]

639
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,460
You're here.

640
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,270
How many jars of Immortal Drunk do you want today?

641
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,480
I don't want the Immortal Drunk today.

642
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,010
I want to ask you something.

643
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,670
Go ahead.

644
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,470
Here's the thing.

645
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,680
A friend of mine

646
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,190
accidentally offended Lieutenant Qian.

647
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,630
I want to see Lieutenant Qian

648
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,530
and apologize to him.

649
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,400
Do you know how I can see him?

650
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,710
Sir,

651
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,620
it's not that I don't want to tell you.

652
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,070
But Lieutenant Qian is known for

653
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,430
his hot temper.

654
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,840
He's very stubborn.

655
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,950
Besides, he has a great fortune.

656
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,600
The common way of using money to save someone

657
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,190
doesn't work with him.

658
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,510
As a lieutenant,

659
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,960
how did he make a great fortune?

660
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,150
I don't know.

661
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,750
Sir,

662
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,430
please help me.

663
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,570
If you really want to save your friend,

664
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,950
you have to personally go to

665
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,710
the barracks which are under Lieutenant Qian’s control.

666
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,230
He spends over

667
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,000
half of his time there every day.

668
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,730
If you beg him sincerely, there might be a chance.

669
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,630
Okay.

670
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,400
Those bank notes I gave you just now are for buying a jar of Immortal Drunk.

671
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,310
Okay.

672
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,679
There's liquorice.

673
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,620
There's also cinnamon.

674
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,230
This is good stuff.

675
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,380
It can help to clear away the heart-fire, improve eyesight, detoxify the body and relieve internal heat.

676
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,110
It has the smell of a young girl.

677
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,210
It smells good.

678
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,190
Alright. Don't talk nonsense.

679
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,630
I'm still a virgin.

680
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,340
You're not as good as me. Let me tell you.

681
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,190
Brat.

682
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,870
How did you offend Qian,

683
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,530
which made you confined here?

684
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,370
I’m a businessman.

685
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,550
I treated Lieutenant Qian to a big drink.

686
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,630
He personally said that

687
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,870
he would drink all the wine in the cup while I could drink a little.

688
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:01,750
I really drank a little.

689
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,150
Then he confined me here.

690
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,800
Bro,

691
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,190
you just drank too little.

692
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,470
Have you guys also offended Lieutenant Qian?

693
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,310
No.

694
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,190
Do you know who managed the soldiers in Qingzhou previously?

695
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,030
The late Marquis Dingnan, Shang Wei.

696
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,830
That's right.

697
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:17,690
Wait.

698
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,450
You called him late Marquis Dingnan.

699
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,430
Yes, Marquis Dingnan is dead.

700
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,790
What? Shang Wei is dead?

701
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,330
Shang Wei is dead.

702
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,790
How come Shang Wei is dead?

703
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,790
Bro,

704
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,470
don't be too sad.

705
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,720
I believe that Marquis Dingnan

706
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,200
will bless us in Heaven.

707
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,230
How can I not be sad?

708
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,790
Shang Wei is dead.

709
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,410
How can I take revenge personally?

710
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,570
It's been ten years.

711
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,320
I've been confined here for ten years.

712
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,830
Now my only purpose for staying alive

713
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,200
is to ask him face to face

714
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,600
what our faults are.

715
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,550
We just

716
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,350
don't want to work for that fatuous and self-indulgent emperor.

717
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,790
So we have to be confined here for the rest of our lives?

718
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,870
I just want to personally see

719
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,400
how he becomes speechless.

720
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,390
Then...

721
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:23,830
I'll kill him.

722
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,740
But it's okay.

723
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,870
I've heard that he has a son named Shang Yizhi.

724
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,460
When I get out one day,

725
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,630
I will teach him a lesson.

726
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,920
Do you know what Shang Yizhi looks like?

727
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,630
Shang... Shang Yizhi?

728
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,370
I saw him once.

729
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,810
He's nearly as tall as him.

730
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,830
His skin is even darker than this man's.

731
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,160
What about his face?

732
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,270
His face...

733
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,470
He has beards. His face is full of beards.

734
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,910
His eyebrows and beards are all connected.

735
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,570
He looks more fierce than you.

736
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,430
His ears, eyes, lips, nose and tongue

737
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,090
are basically the same as his.

738
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,600
They are the same as his?

739
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,150
His face is full of beards?

740
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,110
Is there any difference between him and an ape?

741
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,190
That's right.

742
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,050
Bro,

743
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,990
just stay here.

744
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,790
If I get out of here one day,

745
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,630
you have to help me recognize Shang Yizhi

746
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,710
so that I can cut off his head.

747
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,750
Bro, don't worry.

748
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,430
I'll be the first to recognize him after I get out of here.

749
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,230
I'd like to thank you in advance.

750
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,670
Please release my grandson Mingge.

751
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,070
Madam.

752
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,400
Madam, please stand up.

753
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,590
Lord Qian is not here now.

754
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,230
It's useless for you to beg me.

755
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,390
It's useless for you

756
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,680
to scream and cry here.

757
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,790
Just stand up, Madam.

758
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,670
What are you doing?

759
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,600
Hello, Officer.

760
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,370
I'm here to deliver wine to Lord Lieutenant.

761
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,870
Lord Lieutenant is not here.

762
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,350
Do you know when Lord Lieutenant will come back?

763
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,960
Lord Lieutenant has entered the city.

764
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,620
His return date is uncertain.

765
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,520
Thank you, Officer.

766
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,160
Just go back.

767
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,350
Lieutenant Qian!

768
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,310
-What's going on?
-Lieutenant Qian!

769
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,030
Why did she still come here?

770
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,430
Lieutenant Qian!

771
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,270
Drive her away for me!

772
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,470
-Lieutenant Qian!
-Madam.

773
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,470
Lieutenant Qian!

774
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,710
-Lieutenant Qian, please release my grandson!
-Just leave here.

775
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,710
Lieutenant Qian!

776
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,640
Just leave here!

777
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,020
Lieutenant Qian! Lieutenant Qian!

778
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,270
-Please release my grandson.
-Are you alright?

779
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:46,780
Stand up.

780
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,950
Lieutenant Qian.

781
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,280
Stand up. Just stand up.

782
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,910
Come on, guys!

783
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,440
Work harder.

784
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,750
Come on.

785
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,750
How come there is a boy here?

786
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,410
Don't ask about these things.

787
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,110
Come on. Have some water.

788
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,230
A ladle of water for each person.

789
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,630
Don't drink extra water.

790
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,470
We're so tired. A ladle of water for each person isn't enough.

791
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,950
That's the quota for each person.

792
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:29,190
If someone drinks more water, people who come after him might have no water to drink.

793
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:32,920
Drink the water quickly. Get back to work after you drink the water.

794
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,570
Drink it now. Otherwise, there will be no water.

795
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,250
What about you?

796
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,960
Put it down.

797
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,150
No, I can't drink it.

798
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,030
I'm giving it to you. Just drink it.

799
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,630
We have a ladle of water respectively. It doesn't affect others.

800
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:26,950
Thank you, sir.

801
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,080
Why are you here?

802
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,030
My grandma and I depended on each other for living.

803
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,310
One day, Qian kicked and hit my grandma.

804
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,800
I was so angry that

805
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,950
I pounced on Qian and bit him.

806
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,510
Then he confined me here.

807
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,290
He didn't even spare this kid.

808
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,710
These three lieutenants of Zhao, Qian and Sun

809
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,150
are bad guys.

810
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,140
All they know is to bully the people

811
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,470
and exploit the people.

812
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,630
We all hope that

813
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,390
someone can help us.

814
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,520
Madam,

815
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,200
I think your cart is too small.

816
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,690
It doesn't look like a tool used for delivering meals to the barracks.

817
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,510
Is it for delivering meals to a place outside the city?

818
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,870
Is your grandson locked up?

819
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,150
Madam.

820
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,030
My friend is locked up, too.

821
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,190
Can you tell me where that place is?

822
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,350
Young man.

823
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,520
You can't go there.

824
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,560
There are many soldiers guarding that place.

825
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,470
Usually,

826
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,750
except for me, no one can

827
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,190
go inside or out of there.

828
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,950
It's useless even if you know where it is.

829
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,710
Madam.

830
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,710
Now I'm the only one who can help your grandson.

831
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,270
My friend

832
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,510
is Shang Yizhi, the son of the late Marquis Dingnan, Shang Wei.

833
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,830
He was framed by Lieutenant Qian.

834
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,290
He is probably locked up with your grandson.

835
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,570
He's the son of the old Marquis Shang?

836
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,150
Mr. Xu.

837
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,030
Mr. Xu!
