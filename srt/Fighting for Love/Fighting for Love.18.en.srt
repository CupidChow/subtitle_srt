00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,680
Young Master!

00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,950
-Don't move, Young Master.
-Let me down.

7
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,259
I want to find my brother.

8
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,060
Young Master.

9
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,030
Doctor!

10
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,700
Doctor!

11
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,830
Hurry!

12
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,300
General,

13
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,710
he has fallen into the mountain stream.

14
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,800
Are you sure he's dead?

15
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,390
The mountain is so high.

16
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,860
I don't think he'll survive that fall.

17
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,550
Nonsense.

18
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,830
That is Chang Yuqing.

19
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,230
Go look for him again.

20
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,070
I need to see him, alive or dead.

21
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,190
Yes.

22
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,940
It must be your scheme.

23
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,740
Deputy General Cui has lost so much blood

24
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,790
that he starts to talk nonsense.

25
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,560
Listen up.

26
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,430
While General Chang is away,

27
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,950
I'll take his position temporarily.

28
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,630
Yes.

29
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,750
Watch the step.

30
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,790
Come on.

31
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,520
Come here.

32
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,980
I don't trust Jiang.

33
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,790
Keep an eye on him.

34
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,800
Send more people to look for Brother Chang.

35
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,790
If you can't find him,

36
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,140
don't come back.

37
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,310
Yes.

38
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,270
Go!

39
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,060
Take care.

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,430
Bro!

41
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,240
I haven't found him.

42
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,550
I didn't see his body.

43
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,390
Check over there.

44
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,710
Lieutenant Tang, we can't wait any longer.

45
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,390
The scouts of the Beimo Army are getting closer and closer.

46
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,590
If we wait any longer,

47
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,190
we might get stuck too.

48
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,110
No.

49
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,900
We can't give up on our fellow fighters.

50
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,780
Yes.

51
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,990
Relax.

52
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,350
I didn't see anything.

53
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,909
I'll kill you!

54
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,230
You're pretty agile.

55
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,790
Why did you save me?

56
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,960
Because I want you to send me out of the mountains.

57
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,270
The Beimo soldiers are all over this place.

58
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,470
Why would I?

59
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,330
I can choose to save you,

60
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,730
or I can also kill you.

61
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,460
Send me out of the mountains tomorrow morning.

62
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,350
I'll let you go now.

63
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,140
Deal.

64
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,020
How can I trust you?

65
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,780
I'm a man of my word.

66
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
I will never go back on a promise.

67
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,510
Okay.

68
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,480
What's your name?

69
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,790
As we are here now,

70
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,990
I'm not a general, and you're not a soldier.

71
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,870
Let's be friends.

72
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,730
What's your name?

73
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,990
I'm Maisui.

74
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,140
You can call me Mai.

75
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,600
Mai.

76
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,430
That's a nice name.

77
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,870
Hang in there.

78
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,270
We're here.

79
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,040
Where is Battalion Commander Lu?

80
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,330
He died in battle.

81
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,380
Everyone else is dead.

82
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,030
We are all the people left in the Seventh Battalion.

83
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,670
Mai.

84
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,000
Where's Mai?

85
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860
Lieutenant Tang.

86
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,760
Mai fell off the cliff

87
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,110
in order to cover us.

88
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,110
What?

89
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,590
Brother Tang.

90
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,150
Will Mai die?

91
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,990
No way.

92
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,669
Mai is tough.

93
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,830
He won't die.

94
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,850
I'll go look for him.

95
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,809
I'll go with you.

96
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,870
The Seventh Battalion has suffered too great a loss.

97
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,950
Go back to Pingjia'ao first.

98
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,790
You guys, escort our bros from the Seventh Battalion back to the camp.

99

Dong, Liu.

100
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,150
You two go prepare some Beimo military uniforms.

Yes.

102
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,070
Yes.

103
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,540
Don't worry.

104
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,190
We'll go look for him now.

105
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,990
Brother Tang.

106
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,030
If Mai is alive,

107
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,210
he'll leave marks of the Seventh Battalion.

108
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,470
I know the mark.

109
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,930
Let me go with you, too.

110
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,190
Okay, you come with me.

[Pingjia'ao]

112
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,150
General, it's getting late.

113
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,270
You should rest.

114
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,910
It's so cold.

115
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,070
Will she catch a cold?

116
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,110
Mai is tough.

117
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,550
He'll be fine.

118
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,920
Thank you.

119
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,730
Careful. It's hot.

120
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,790
Why did you disguise yourself as a man

121
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,190
to join the army?

122
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,120
Don't tell me you just want to fight the enemies.

123
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,180
I won't believe it.

124
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,400
You're actually right.

125
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,510
That is my intention.

126
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,780
You saved my life.

127
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,760
If you are willing to tell me the truth,

128
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,880
I might be able to help you.

129
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,350
How?

130
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,230
My personal enemy is from Beimo.

131
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,750
So what?

132
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,040
Who is he?

133
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,210
What does he do?

134
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,160
I guess I can tell you.

135
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,670
Chen Qi.

136
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:11,770
Chen Qi?

137
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,150
You have a grudge against Chen Qi?

138
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,030
What grudge?

139
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,230
Did you really believe it?

140
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,060
In that case,

141
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,310
come back to Beimo with me.

142
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,620
I'll avenge you.

143
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,990
How?

144
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,170
You are a general of Beimo.

145
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,700
He is the Marshal of Beimo.

146
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,890
Do you think I'm a fool?

147
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,390
I can't explain this

148
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,470
in a short time.

149
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,400
But I'm a man of my word.

150
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
I appreciate your kindness.

151
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,110
But I'm the only one who can take this revenge.

152
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,470
You can repay me for other things later.

153
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,190
Mai!

154
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,950
Mai! Mai!

155
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,200
Mai!

156
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,030
Brother Tang.

157
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,390
Do you think Mai is still alive?

158
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,510
What are you talking about?

159
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,760
Mai must be alive.

160
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,790
Let's check over there.

161
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,390
Okay.

162
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,190
Dong, Liu.

163
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,230
Let's go over there.

164
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,750
Okay. Hurry.

165
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,920
Look over there.

166
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,110
They are here for me.

167
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Leave after I get out of this forest.

168
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,970
After leaving this forest,

169
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,710
there's a small village at the foot of the mountain.

170
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,070
You can hide over there.

171
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,440
You guys go there.

172
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,260
You go over there.

173
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,350
Hurry.

174
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:00,950
Thank you.

175
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,630
Is there anyone over there?

176
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,470
No.

177
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,430
I hope we won't meet on the battlefield in the future.

178
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,030
Take care.

179
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,350
Are you here for me?

180
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,790
General Chang.

181
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,520
General Chang! General Chang!

182
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,710
General Chang.

183
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,710
Young Master sent us to look for you.

184
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,980
Thank you. Let's go.

185
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Yes.

186
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,430
Someone stayed here not long ago.

187
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,490
Search carefully.

188
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,630
Look!

189
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,670
This is the mark Mai has left.

190
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,920
Let's continue searching.

191
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,510
Congratulations on your safe return, General Chang.

192
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,910
Are you disappointed, Deputy General Jiang?

193
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,910
It's a blessing for the whole army to have you back safely.

194
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,350
Why would I be disappointed?

195
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,990
I can't bear your words.

196
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,150
On the night I was away,

197
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,920
Deputy General Jiang, you held the banner

198
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,550
and strictly enforced the orders and prohibitions.

199
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,380
Well done.

200
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,180
Since you're back,

201
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,970
I will return the banner.

202
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,750
I'll follow your orders, General.

203
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,290
How's Cui Yan's injury?

204
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,430
The military doctor has checked on him.

205
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,470
He won't die.

206
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,730
I'll go and see him.

207
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,110
Yes.

208
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,030
Zhu is back.

209
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,150
Ma'am.

210
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,720
Son!

211
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,980
Son, you're back!

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,570
I miss you, Son.

213
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,980
You came back alone?

214
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,640
What about your father?

215
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,430
Madam, you got the wrong person.

216
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,390
I'm not your son.

217
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,270
Zhu.

218
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,030
What's wrong with you?

219
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,760
You don't even know your mother after fighting outside for a while?

220
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,910
Mother.

221
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,620
I'm back.

222
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,990
Do we have clean clothes at home?

223
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,850
Get me changed.

224
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,350
Yes. Yes.

225
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,110
Let's go.

226
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,680
Come on.

227
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,390
Brother Tang, look.

228
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,860
It should be that way.

229
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:41,870
Go.

230
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,670
Go! Hurry!

231
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,470
Let's go.

232
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,040
Hurry! Get changed.

233
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,690
Mother!

234
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,760
These are women's clothes.

235
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,290
Women should wear women's clothes.

236
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,640
See what you're wearing.

237
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,340
Take it off, and I'll wash it for you.

238
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,430
Don't bother.

239
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,300
Mother, I'm hungry.

240
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,750
Make me a bowl of noodles.

241
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,359
I'll cook for you.

242
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,839
Okay, Mother. Go.

243
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,589
Get changed.

244
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,589
-Okay.
-Put it on.

245
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,560
If Mai had been here,

246
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,270
she'd definitely have left a mark.

247
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,329
Search carefully.

248
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,230
Okay.

249
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,550
Let's go.

250
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,400
Let's split up.

251
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,150
Dong, Liu.

252
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,950
Go over there.

253
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,190
Erdan, go over there.

254
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,680
Okay.

255
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,650
Go.

256
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,230
Brother.

257
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,670
Sit down.

258
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,590
Go.

259
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,980
Brother, I'm glad you're back.

260
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,050
I knew you'd be safe.

261
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,610
I'm so embarrassed by you.

262
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,510
We've already blocked

263
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,840
those Nanxia soldiers,

264
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,670
but who knew

265
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,930
there was such a sinister and cunning man.

266
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,940
I fell into his trap by accident.

267
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,510
I'll avenge you.

268
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,030
By the way,

269
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,550
where did you go?

270
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,120
I was ambushed and fell off the cliff.

271
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,710
I stayed in the mountains for a night,

272
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,020
so I didn't come back in time.

273
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,230
You were ambushed?

274
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,110
Have you also run into Nanxia soldiers?

275
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,160
No, someone bribed Liu San

276
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,890
and tried to murder me.

277
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,150
Chen Qi.

278
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,230
It must be him.

279
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,830
I'll...

280
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,230
Cui Yan.

281
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,010
How many times have I told you?

282
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,670
Can you use your brain?

283
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,710
Do you have evidence?

284
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,330
If you don't have any evidence, then you'll be offending your superior.

285
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,950
He can kill you anytime.

286
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,040
What should we do? Just let it go?

287
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,000
Of course not.

288
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,830
I'll get it even.

289
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,730
Take a good rest.

290
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,670
You'll be helpful sooner or later.

291
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,310
Okay.

292
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,030
Sorry to bother you.

293
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,830
Brother Tang.

294
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,480
Mai.

295
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,440
Come in.

296
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,780
Beimo dog!

297
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,390
I'll kill you!

298
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,000
Mother!

299
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,630
Mother! Mother!

300
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,150
Put it down, Mother.

301
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,010
Mother, this is your son-in-law.

302
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,370
Nonsense!

303
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,090
He is your father.

304
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,990
Father?

305
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,150
Father! You're back.

306
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,070
Good timing. My mother is cooking.

307
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,030
Honey,

308
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:17,990
you're back.

309
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,170
You must be hungry. I'll cook for you.

310
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,310
Have a good chat with your father.

311
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,180
-I'll cook.
-Mother.

312
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,240
Go back to your cooking.

313
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,640
I'll chat with my father.

314
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,000
Father.

315
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,800
Let's talk over there.

316
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,470
Marshal,

317
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,270
they've found Chang Yuqing.

318
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,940
How is it?

319
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,310
He came back alive.

320
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,470
Tell Jiang Chengyi to conceal himself.

321
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,020
Don't leave any trace.

322
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,940
I understand.

323
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,870
Mai.

324
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,690
After you fell off the cliff,

325
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,220
how did you spend the night?

326
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,760
I was lucky, so I didn't die.

327
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,190
I found a cave to spend the night.

328
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,050
Big Brother,

329
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,690
have you found Wang Qi and the others?

330
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,620
I received the soldiers of the Seventh Battalion at the Shihukou Pass.

331
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,130
There aren't many left.

332
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:32,860
Mai.

333
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,860
I want to confess something to you.

334
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,070
What is it?

335
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,280
In fact, I guessed you were a girl.

336
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,360
You were badly injured after the Battle of Yelanggou,

337
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,650
but you refused to let the military doctor take off your clothes to treat you.

338
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,310
I thought it was strange then.

339
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,550
Later, I thought about it.

340
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,970
You didn't want to go into the water with us.

341
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,610
You even said you have a peculiarity

342
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,950
that you have to go to the toilet alone.

343
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,480
The more I thought about it, the weirder I found it was.

344
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,190
Until today,

345
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,920
I become certain,

346
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,780
seeing you dress like this.

347
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,510
Thank you for keeping the secret for me.

348
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,930
I have my reasons for pretending to be a man.

349
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,470
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

350
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,500
I understand.

351
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,990
But as long as you call me Big Brother once,

352
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,850
I'll be your Big Brother forever.

353
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,580
By the way,

354
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,990
does General Shang know about this, too?

355
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,560
Yes.

356
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,590
Big Brother,

357
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,490
only you,

358
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,150
Mr. Xu, and General Shang know about it.

359
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,140
Mai.

360
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,360
Then let's…

361
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,420
Otherwise, we'll be in danger.

362
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,740
What do you want?

363
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,760
Hurry up.

364
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,400
Here.

365
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,150
Mai.

366
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:17,830
Erdan.

367
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,480
Mai.

368
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,030
What happened to your face?

369
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,910
What happened here?

370
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,960
What about there?

371
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,870
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

372
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,940
That's good.

373
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,670
Alright, stop hugging.

374
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,680
Go back

375
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,390
and change your clothes.

376
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,920
Let's go.

377
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,790
Go!

378
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,500
[Pingjia'ao]

379
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,230
Mr. Xu,

380
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,600
I have a question.

381
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,030
That is Chang Yuqing.

382
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,630
This is the Seventh Battalion.

383
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,750
The Seventh Battalion is in charge of luring Chang Yuqing's vanguard

384
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,590
to Shihukou Pass.

385
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,850
Then, Tang Shaoyi will come to their aid.

386
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,660
Then what happens next?

387
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,240
Pingjia'ao is located in a low-lying place

388
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,310
It is surrounded by the mountains in three directions.

389
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,640
There is only one pass to go in and out of it.

390
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,950
It's a perfect place to set up an ambush.

391
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,350
It's easy to defend and hard to attack.

392
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,550
Once Chang Yuqing brings his troops in,

393
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,190
we will ambush him

394
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,050
and stop him from meeting the main force.

395
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,990
I guarantee this valiant general of Beimo

396
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,010
can only come but never leave.

397
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,420
You're brilliant.

398
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,520
When their vanguard arrives here,

399
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,750
we will open the city gate

400
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,760
We can't open the city gate.

401
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,470
and send…

402
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,990
How can we bring Mai back

403
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,670
without opening the city gate?

404
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,320
If we open the gate, Chang Yu Qing will understand immediately

405
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,980
that this is a trap to lure him.

406
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,310
Won't that make them abandoned troops?

407
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,920
To get rid of Chang Yuqing,

408
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,670
we have no choice.

409
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,590
I disagree.

410
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,040
In your opinion,

411
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,110
what should we do?

412
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,180
In my view,

413
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,030
now that Chang Yuqing's vanguard

414
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,310
is already here,

415
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,080
we can totally open the city gate

416
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,040
and send all our troops

417
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,500
to fight against Chang Yuqing's main force.

418
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,910
Then I'll send a squad

419
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,270
to save Mai and the lot.

420
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,000
General, have you forgotten

421
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:07,090
us, the Zhenbei Army, and the Beimo Army

422
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,350
have a great disparity in terms of strength.

423
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,110
If you send the troops out,

424
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,830
not only will our main force be exposed,

425
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,430
but we may also be wiped out.

426
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,670
Let's say you really fight Chang Yuqing head-on.

427
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,190
How confident are you

428
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,550
to defeat

429
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,310
this Beimo general who's been fighting on the battlefield since he was in his teens?

430
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,430
How sure are you that you can get away safely?

431
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,790
I don't care about that,

432
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,210
I have to save Mai and the others.

433
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,840
No one should be left behind.

434
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,150
Okay.

435
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,290
Even if we have God's help

436
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,390
and don't get wiped out,

437
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,470
by then,

438
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,280
everything we've done from Qingzhou

439
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,910
will be lost altogether.

440
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,710
His Majesty will have excuses

441
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,000
to make you go back to Shengdu.

442
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,630
It will be so easy

443
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,070
to deprive you of your military power.

444
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,070
It only takes a whim of him.

445
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,960
But I can't risk the lives of officers and soldiers

446
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,830
for my own survival.

447
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,430
You can act regardless of your own life,

448
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,570
but you have to think for Princess Shenghua.

449
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,000
If anything happens to you,

450
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,830
will Her Highness still live on?

451
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,870
It was my idea.

452
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,170
It has nothing to do with you.

453
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,280
If the plan is reviled by people in the future

454
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:40,100
I, Xu Jing, will take the blame.

455
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,620
Sergeant,

456
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,600
are we abandoned?

457
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,330
What are you talking about?

458
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,030
This is a military order.

459
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,270
If Battalion Commander Lu were still alive...

460
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,010
Enough!

461
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,750
If Battalion Commander Lu were here,

462
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,810
he wouldn't want to hear you say that.

463
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,190
Guys.

464
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,840
Come on! Hurry!

465
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,670
Go.

466
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,550
General.

467
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,870
We have found traces of the Zhenbei Army in the Wulan Mountains.

468
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,540
Good.

469
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,480
I was wondering why such a sizeable army

470
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,070
left no trace at all.

471
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,550
General.

472
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,680
This is from Yuzhou.

473
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,190
Go to scout again.

474
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,080
Make sure to locate the middle troops of the Zhenbei Army.

475
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,720
Yes.

476
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,150
You may all leave.

477
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,150
Yes.

478
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,390
General.

479
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,070
This is a secret letter from Marshal Chen.

480
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,130
Please have a look.

481
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,150
What did the Marshal say?

482
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,470
[The main force is going south]
[Return to Yuzhou immediately to join us] [Chen Qi]

483
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,600
What are you going to do, General?

484
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,930
Tell him

485
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,310
that they hurt Cui Yan

486
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,430
and that I'll return when I avenge that.

487
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,550
Here, be careful.

488
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,350
Erdan.

489
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,590
Give me a hand.

490
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,990
Come on.

491
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,380
Come on.

492
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:01,670
No need…

493
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,680
to treat me like a girl.

494
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,590
Let's go.

495
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,110
Guys, let me tell you.

496
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,910
Look.

497
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,270
We're now in Pingjia'ao

498
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,480
and near Shihukou Pass.

499
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,230
This is the defense line of the Beimo army.

500
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,610
We're now pretending that we're moving from Shihukou Pass

501
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,670
to Pingjia'ao.

502
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,700
Then tell me,

503
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,150
should we make some noise

504
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,470
along this line?

505
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,110
Sergeant! Sergeant!

506
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,030
Mai.

507
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,440
Mai! Mai is back!

508
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,050
Mai! Mai is back!

509
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,670
-Is everyone okay?
-It's really Mai.

510
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,000
-You're finally back.
-Is everyone okay?

511
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,430
I'm glad you're okay.

512
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,110
Are you okay?

513
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,710
I'm fine.

514
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,040
I didn't expect

515
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,190
you are still alive.

516
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,570
Why are you still here?

517
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,110
Didn't you go back to the camp?

518
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,630
Yes.

519
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,950
Where are my cavalries?

520
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,810
Didn't I ask them to send you back?

521
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,430
Mai.

522
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,680
Don't mention it.

523
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,510
I brought our men back to Pingjia'ao.

524
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,230
After a night of rest,

525
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,380
they ordered us out again.

526
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,710
Yes, don't worry.

527
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,310
Your men of the cavalry battalion have been back.

528
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,350
They told us

529
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,310
the Seventh Battalion just fought with Chang Yuqing.

530
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,150
So if we go to lure him,

531
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,950
Chang Yuqing won't get suspicious.

532
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,350
He will come out for sure.

533
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,390
That's why I brought my men out

534
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,310
to hide here.

535
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,520
What did you say?

536
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,800
They want you to come out to lure Chang Yuqing?

537
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,150
That wretch!

538
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,020
After the Battle of Shihukou Pass,

539
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,860
there are not many men left in the Seventh Battalion.

540
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,190
Will he be happy

541
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,390
when all the men of the Seventh Battalion are dead?

542
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,590
Get up. I'll take you back to the camp.

543
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:45,850
Mai.

544
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,670
This is a military order.

545
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,120
Lu Gang put me in charge of the Seventh Battalion before he died.

546
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,780
My words are military orders!

547
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:54,950
Get up!

548
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,360
Back to the camp!

549
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,590
Hurry!

550
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,480
Look! They are of the Seventh Battalion!

551
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,510
They seem to be injured.

552
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,590
Open the gate!

553
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Whose idea was it?

554
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:17,630
Mine.

555
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,150
It seems that after learning from Mr. Xu for so long,

556
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,700
you've learned nothing.

557
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,130
How much money can the lives of

558
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,890
the officers and soldiers of the Seventh Battalion make for you?

559
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,450
Is it enough for you?

560
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,040
If not,

561
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,770
which battalion will you send out again?

562
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,710
The Ninth Battalion or the Tenth?

563
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,640
Mai.

564
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,880
If you want to hit me,

565
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,910
hit me.

566
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,110
I won't fight back.

567
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,910
Hit you?

568
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,710
Are these brothers' lives only worth a few punches?

569
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,200
Now, not even one out of ten men of the Seventh Battalion survived.

570
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,860
The survivors don't have much life left in them.

571
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,990
Every one of them is a brave warrior.

572
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,950
Let me tell you.

573
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,670
What they want now is your respect

574
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,330
instead of getting their lives cast away again!

575
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,870
That's not what I meant.

576
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,330
A general should love a soldier like his son.

577
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,040
If you do this,

578
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,150
you'll only disappoint them deeply.

579
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,070
How can these officers and soldiers

580
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,630
follow you in the future?

581
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,830
A softhearted general is not suitable to command an army.

582
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,120
Mai.

583
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,190
There are laws and rules in the army.

584
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,620
How can you treat General like that?

585
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,200
You left the camp without permission.

586
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,140
Do you acknowledge your guilt?

587
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,470
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

588
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,830
I will get my punishment later.

589
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,310
I know you're angry with General,

590
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,790
but I forced him to make this decision.

591
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Let me ask you.

592
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,440
If you were a shepherd boy,

593
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,330
when you ran into a pack of wolves,

594
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,190
either you could sacrifice a small part of the sheep

595
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,650
to attract the wolves away

596
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,310
and get more sheep out of danger,

597
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,470
or you had to watch the wolves kill all the sheep.

598
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,920
Which would you choose?

599
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,390
Couldn't there be no sacrifice at all?

600
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,790
You can't have it both ways.

601
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,590
Mai.

602
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,710
You're familiar with books on the art of war.

603
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,550
You should understand it.

604
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,560
I understand what you said.

605
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,390
If I were you,

606
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,540
when those sheep couldn't be saved,

607
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,830
I'd lead the rest of the sheep

608
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,910
to fight against the wolves with dignity.

609
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,780
Mr. Xu.

610
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,800
I think Mai is right.

611
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,020
Should we

612
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,989
have a fair fight with Chang Yuqing?

613
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,270
Slowly.

614
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,980
Have some water.

615
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,400
Sergeant, there's the powder of pseudo-ginseng in it.

616
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,130
Drink it while it's still warm.

617
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,120
Thank you.

618
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:34,150
Mai.

619
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,110
Drink slowly.

620
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,350
Don't call me Sergeant anymore.

621
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,909
I stopped being your Sergeant long ago.

622
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:43,590
You were my Sergeant on the first day I joined the army.

623
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,590
And you will be for the rest of my life.

624
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,150
Here.

625
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,380
Mai.

626
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:49,920
To be honest,

627
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:53,110
all of us, me included,

628
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:55,230
should thank you.

629
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,390
Without you risking your life

630
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,390
to save us,

631
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,830
we would all be killed.

632
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,160
I promised Battalion Commander Lu

633
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,450
that I'd bring our brothers back.

634
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,790
I can't break my promise.

635
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,150
Aren't we brothers forever?

636
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,630
You said it yourself.

637
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,590
When you first joined the army,

638
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,400
I tried every means to bully you

639
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,780
to get rid of you.

640
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,470
I didn't know you were such a good friend.

641
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,450
Speaking of which,

642
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,150
I have to make it clear.

643
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,390
Was it because of you the first time I got beaten

644
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,950
after I joined the army?

645
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,600
No,

646
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,670
but I was beaten, too.

647
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,030
And when my butt was caned,

648
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,230
I didn't even scream.

649
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:42,710
Erdan.

650
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,380
Is it true that I didn't scream that day?

651
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,970
Yes, it's true. You didn't.

652
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:47,650
See?

653
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,270
Sergeant,

654
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,110
I just want to ask you.

655
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,390
Will the wounded soldiers

656
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,250
be transferred to other battalions?

657
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,450
Are we going to separate?

658
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,530
So what if we're separated?

659
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,750
I'll still be your Sergeant even if we're not together.

660
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,670
What? Are you going to deny it?

661
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,440
Brothers,

662
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,690
let's substitute medicine for wine.

663
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,870
This is

664
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,410
to Battalion Commander Lu

665
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,410
and to our brothers who stayed in the Wulan Mountains forever.

666
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,300
Although the Seventh Battalion is gone,

667
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,930
the brothers,

668
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,000
brotherhood, and spirit of the Seventh Battalion

669
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,630
will always be there.

670
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,080
Always be there!

671
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,470
Always!

672
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,790
Cui Yan.

673
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,100
Can you do it?

674
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,350
Don't worry, brother.

675
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,410
I'll kill those Nanxia soldiers myself!

676
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,050
Let's go!

677
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,310
Sergeant,

678
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,830
it is too damp in this village.

679
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,850
The quilt is moldy.

680
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,310
It makes me itchy all over.

681
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,150
Just take it out to air it.

682
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,470
Sergeant.

683
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,620
Sergeant, look.

684
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,740
There are fish, eggs,

685
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,380
and shrimps!

686
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,470
There's so much delicious food.

687
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,470
It smells so good.

688
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,470
So much delicious food.

689
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,590
Let's eat.

690
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,630
Let's eat.

691
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,270
Bro,

692
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,040
who arranged this?

693
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,630
This is our General's order.

694
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,690
Only the Seventh Battalion has this.

695
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,950
Sergeant,

696
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:02,950
eat this.

697
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,470
Here.

698
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,190
Let's eat.

699
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,790
Sergeant.

700
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,750
Try this.

701
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,900
Delicious.

702
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,630
Yum.

703
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:12,670
Sergeant.

704
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,500
Why aren't you eating?

705
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,270
Alright.

706
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,150
Give me one.

707
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,470
Here you are.

708
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,870
All you know is eat!

709
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,270
This may be

710
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,590
the last meal

711
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,740
we have together.

712
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,590
Sergeant,

713
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,230
are we going to separate?

714
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,230
General.

715
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,220
Careful.

716
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:48,870
What?

717
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,590
Do you not like the food I prepared?

718
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,310
General,

719
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,350
I lost my appetite at the thought

720
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,240
that we'd go our separate ways.

721
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,600
Our Seventh Battalion of Infantry

722
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,650
was willing to be the bait to cover the middle troops

723
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,090
and attacked the Beimo general Chang Yuqing head-on.

724
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,620
You made significant contributions but suffered a great loss.

725
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,530
I, Shang Yizhi, will never forget

726
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,860
this soldierly good fellowship.

727
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,720
You, too. Please remember it.

728
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,340
Now there are only 18 people left

729
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,180
in the Seventh Battalion.

730
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,430
But it represents the soul of our army,

731
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,250
which can't be dispersed.

732
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,330
So, I decided

733
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,080
to make an exception

734
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,300
and keep the Seventh Battalion of Infantry.

735
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,640
Top up the men according to its original establishment.

736
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,310
Thank you, General.

737
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,440
Thank you, General.

738
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,080
Sergeant,

739
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,360
we don't have to separate.

740
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,030
You jinx.

741
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,750
Being with you,

742
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,150
I'll never get promoted.

743
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,320
Then who'll be our new commander?

744
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,430
Mai.

745
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,750
Yes.

746
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,130
I'll appoint you the battalion commander

747
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,150
of the Seventh Battalion of Infantry of the Zhenbei Army.
