[Episode 34]

4
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,740
What's the progress

5
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,030
of the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi?

6
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,560
Your Majesty,

7
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,870
Minister Bao caught a cold last night,

8
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,270
so he asked me to take a leave for him.

9
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,110
Then you tell me.

10
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,910
Your Majesty,

11
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,510
the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi are a serious problem.

12
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,440
I'm just a lowly official.

13
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,030
I don't know the details about it,

14
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,490
so I dare not talk about it.

15
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,170
Ministry of Rites.

16
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,530
Yes, Your Majesty.

17
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,390
Have you decided on the date and time of the sacrifice ceremony in the Imperial Ancestral Temple?

18
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,190
Your Majesty,

19
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,670
I've asked the Imperial Astronomical Bureau many times about this.

20
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,829
The Bureau said

21
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,030
the auspicious day was predicted by Director Chen Min himself.

22
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,590
But Director Chen

23
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,390
has had chickenpox these days.

24
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,230
He's resting at home

25
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,579
and not seeing anyone.

26
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,870
That's why I've been delayed

27
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,030
and haven't been informed of the auspicious date yet.

28
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,590
Now that it is not a good day today,

29
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,350
and many of you are ill,

30
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,310
why don't you all go back and rest?

31
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,740
Let's

32
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,570
discuss it another day.

33
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,329
Please take care of yourself, Your Majesty.

34
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,840
You...

35
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,110
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

36
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,670
Where is the person I asked you to pick up?

37
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,510
Your Majesty,

38
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,760
when I arrived,

39
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,670
Prince Qi Yu was already taken away by the Imperial Honored Consort.

40
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,710
Li Yu.

41
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,020
You used to look smart.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,230
Why is it so hard

43
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,760
to entrust anything to you?

44
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,120
You can't even pick up someone.

45
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,320
Listen.

46
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,710
If you make a mistake again,

47
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,110
you can let another person take your place.

48
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,550
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,829
I deserve death!

50
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,470
Get lost!

51
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,550
Farewell, Your Majesty.

52
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,390
Master Mai.

53
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,860
Are you leaving me again?

54
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,230
Recently, both the palace and my place

55
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,110
are not safe.

56
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,030
You and Xing stay here for now.

57
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,130
I will come to visit you often, okay?

58
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,110
You must visit me often.

59
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,990
I promise you.

60
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,410
But you also have to promise me

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,899
not to go out without permission.

62
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,990
If you want me to know anything,

63
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,590
just tell the people outside.

64
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,190
I've sent a lot of people to protect you.

65
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,230
Master Mai, I promise you.

66
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,600
Protect His Highness, the Royal Descendant.

67
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,790
Except for Wang Qi,

68
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,470
no one is allowed to take him out.

69
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,390
Don't worry, Marshal Mai.

70
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,770
I'm going to leave.

71
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,120
Let's go.

72
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,010
Everybody will have it.

73
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,680
Line up. Don't push.

74
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,210
Next.

75
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,580
Everyone will have it, so don't push.

76
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,220
Next.

77
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,490
Come on, next.

78
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,110
Don't push.

79
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,510
Don't worry. There's enough for everyone.

80
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,990
Line up.

81
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,100
Don't rush. One by one.

82
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,270
Mai.

83
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,010
Is this where you used to live in Shengdu?

84
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:32,860
Yes.

85
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,800
I was so poor back then.

86
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,330
It seems that not all the people in the capital live a good life.

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,510
But fortunately, everyone here took good care of me.

88
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,440
Mai.

89
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,110
There are so many people here.

90
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,570
Should I call you Imperial Honored Consort?

91
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,909
I'll always be your Mai.

92
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,060
This is Brother Tang.

93
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,860
Brother Tang.

94
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,050
Don't go out running about again.

95
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,630
I'll send you to school.

96
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,260
You'll be successful when you've learned things.

97
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,460
I don't want to study.

98
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,630
No?

99
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,850
What do you want to do then?

100
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,350
I want to be your soldier.

101
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,350
Be my soldier?

102
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,960
I want to be like you and Brother Tang,

103
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,070
be a general.

104
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,310
Take me in.

105
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,670
Listen.

106
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,610
It's not easy to be my soldier.

107
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,000
Am I right?

108
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,070
Yes.

109
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,180
How can I follow you?

110
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,230
You really want to follow me?

111
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,370
Then promise me

112
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,240
that you'll study hard for a couple of years.

113
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,170
Then I'll send you to join the army.

114
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,350
I'll get back to work now.

115
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,870
Okay.

116
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,510
Sir,

117
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,560
the ministers are getting more and more outrageous.

118
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,560
But I haven't figured out how to punish them.

119
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,970
But I must do something.

120
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,120
The court will be in chaos.

121
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,210
Of course you should punish them.

122
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,510
However,

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,830
the court is full of Prime Minister Lin's trusted subordinates.

124
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,910
If you're going to punish them, you need to be cautious.

125
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,050
It's better to be safe than sorry.

126
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,270
My lord,

127
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,230
bad news.

128
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,990
Someone from the palace is here.

129
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,920
They are already at the inner gate.

130
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,800
Tidy up! Hurry!

131
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,110
My lord.

132
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,830
My lord, wake up.

133
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,430
His Majesty sent an imperial physician to treat you.

134
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,909
Who's here?

135
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,350
His Majesty sent Attendant Zhang and the imperial physician

136
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,190
to treat you.

137
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,840
His Majesty is worried about your health,

138
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,030
so he sent me to accompany the imperial physician to check your pulse.

139
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,950
Lord Bao,

140
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,750
please.

141
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,360
Attendant Zhang, please

142
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,590
ask His Majesty to pardon me on my behalf.

143
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,390
This is His Majesty's kindness.

144
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,150
Lord Bao,

145
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,390
just take it.

146
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,080
Prime Minister,

147
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,990
the subordinates of the three ministers

148
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,520
are still waiting outside.

149
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,559
Just wait some more.

150
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,430
Let's see what the situation is like in tomorrow morning's court.

151
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,830
Let them go back.

152
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,390
Yes.

153
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,400
You're all

154
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,790
the pillars of my court.

155
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,830
You're like my arms and legs.

156
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,670
Now, you have not fully recovered.

157
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,750
I'm really worried.

158
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,430
Doctor Du.

159
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,230
Yes.

160
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,670
How was the treatment yesterday?

161
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,830
Your Majesty,

162
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,870
those ministers are just low-spirited.

163
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,570
There's nothing serious.

164
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,110
That's good.

165
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,310
Go get two joss sticks

166
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,160
and send a message to my ministers.

167
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,480
They are the pillars of my court.

168
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,770
If they are not strong enough,

169
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,510
how can they help keep

170
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,710
the peace and prosperity of Nanxia?

171
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,710
If they still don't show up

172
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,710
when the two joss sticks burn out,

173
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,910
then they should

174
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,720
be removed from office.

175
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,820
I'm tired of sitting here.

176
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,240
If you are really tired,

177
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,820
you can lean on each other.

178
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,150
If it still doesn't work,

179
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,930
you can also sit on the ground.

180
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,110
Still not tired?

181
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,350
Fine.

182
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,190
Here.

183
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,310
Stop!

184
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,510
You cannot trespass the forbidden area of the palace.

185
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,430
How dare you!

186
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,890
We are officials of the imperial court.

187
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,920
We're going to the court.

188
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,400
How dare you stop us!

189
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,510
Step aside!

190
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,300
Move! Move!

191
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,040
Move!

192
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,470
The joss sticks are gone,

193
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,880
but the three of them haven't shown up yet.

194
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,620
It seems that they are really ill.

195
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,840
I thought

196
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,390
they pretended to be sick to avoid coming to the court.

197
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,350
In that case,

198
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,110
announce the decree.

199
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,870
Bao Hui, Minister of Works,

200
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,190
Chen Min, Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

201
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,640
and Jiang Rong from the Bureau of General Accounts, Ministry of Revenue,

202
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,150
pretended to be sick to avoid coming to the court,

203
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,590
neglected their duty,

204
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,910
and disregarded the public office.

205
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,840
The three of them are to be removed from office

206
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,070
and will never be allowed to take up an official position again,

207
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,650
as a warning to others.

208
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,830
If there are similar cases,

209
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,030
they will be severely punished.

210
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,470
Greetings, Your Majesty.

211
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,700
How are you?

212
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,320
Your Majesty,

213
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,310
I caught a cold last night

214
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,740
and had a severe headache.

215
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,670
My body kept trembling.

216
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,350
That's why I couldn't get up this morning, Your Majesty.

217
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,330
Your Majesty,

218
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,350
I suddenly caught chickenpox last night.

219
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,280
I felt weak.

220
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,250
That's why I didn't get up, Your Majesty.

221
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,070
Your Majesty.

222
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,440
I ate cold and rotten food yesterday.

223
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,880
I had loose bowels

224
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,350
for a whole night.

225
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,810
It didn't get any better, even this morning.

226
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,870
Since you haven't recovered

227
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,230
and need to sleep,

228
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,690
go back to sleep then.

229
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,060
Thank you, Your Majesty.

230
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,670
Guards!

231
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,280
Yes.

232
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,160
Take them away

233
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,450
and behead them.

234
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,070
Yes!

235
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,670
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

236
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,170
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

237
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,590
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

238
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,990
Your Majesty, spare my life!

239
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,790
Your Majesty!

240
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,470
Your Majesty, spare my life!

241
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,470
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

242
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,510
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

243
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,630
Your Majesty!

244
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:54,990
Your Majesty,

245
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,030
it seems unfair.

246
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,990
You gave everyone a length of two joss sticks.

247
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,750
But the two joss sticks burned together.

248
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,680
It's equivalent to one joss stick.

249
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,630
Guards!

250
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,690
We missed one.

251
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,150
Your Majesty is wise!

252
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,610
Your Majesty is wise!

253
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,630
Your Majesty! Your Majesty is wise!

254
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,680
Prime Minister.

255
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,990
What's the result?

256
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,870
All three were executed.

257
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,520
Prime Minister, you have been planning for many years before you made the Ministries of Revenue, Rites,

258
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,170
Works, and Personnel all work for you.

259
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,020
Now, His Majesty

260
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,810
took away the position of Minister of Works.

261
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,440
Prime Minister,

262
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,030
it's obviously targeting you.

263
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,510
Bao Hui is more pedantic than smart.

264
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,710
He is unqualified for important tasks.

265
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,710
Besides, the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi implicated lots of people.

266
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,440
It's time for me to get out of it.

267
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,190
Thirdly,

268
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,240
if I don't give up this position,

269
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,230
I can't prove

270
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,110
that His Majesty is determined to get rid of me.

271
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,950
Take some money to comfort the families of those three.

272
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,490
Yes.

273
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,510
I'll make arrangements now.

274
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,150
Prime Minister,

275
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,280
His Majesty is here.

276
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,660
Prime Minister, you're recuperating.

277
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,550
Would you like to get prepared?

278
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,230
No need.

279
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,220
Open the front door to welcome His Majesty.

280
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:33,300
[Lin's Mansion]

281
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,790
I didn't know Your Majesty was coming

282
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,070
and thus failed to meet Your Majesty at a distance.

283
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,870
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

284
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,750
Please rise, Father-in-Law.

285
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

286
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,390
I heard that you had been sick a few days ago.

287
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,510
Her Majesty and I were very worried.

288
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,480
It's just that she's pregnant and can't leave the palace,

289
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,870
while I'm too busy.

290
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,310
That's why I only come here today.

291
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,630
Father-in-Law, you won't blame me, will you?

292
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,270
Your Majesty is making me so embarrassed.

293
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,310
Let's not be a monarch and a courtier today,

294
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,440
but just a family.

295
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,910
Seeing you today…

296
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,430
You still look the same.

297
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,590
Have you recovered?

298
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,550
I've been recuperating for days with Your Majesty's grace.

299
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,470
I also have Lian Po's concerns—

300
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,270
Although I'm old,

301
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,230
I still want to serve the court.

302
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,360
I dare not forget it.

303
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,000
That's good.

304
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,870
That's good.

305
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,710
Neither Nanxia nor I

306
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,750
can live without the help of you.

307
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,270
I'm relieved

308
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,110
to hear your words.

309
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,030
It's my honor to have Your Majesty here.

310
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,350
Please come in and have a talk, Your Majesty.

311
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
Father-in-Law, please.

312
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,330
Please, Your Majesty.

313
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,160
I'll hold you, Father-in-Law.

314
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,510
Okay.

315
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,540
Be careful, Your Majesty.

316
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,760
Your Majesty, I'm here to feel your pulse.

317
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,710
I'll pass.

318
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,390
Follow this prescription.

319
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,830
No decoction.

320
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,690
Make it into honeyed boluses.

321
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,750
Jinchu,

322
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,589
guard the door.

323
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

324
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,099
[God of Fu Soup]

325
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,349
Your Majesty,

326
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,670
this prescription is used to hasten parturition.

327
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,950
Your Majesty, you really can't use it!

328
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,760
Just follow the prescription.

329
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,230
I have my own use.

330
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,260
I understand.

331
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,750
I will send it to you in person later.

332
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,910
What you should say

333
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,440
and what you shouldn't…

334
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,190
I don't think you need me to teach you that, right?

335
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,390
I know.

336
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,600
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

337
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,520
What's the matter, Father?

338
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,120
You've been leading the Zhenbei Army for a while.

339
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,590
Have you done it?

340
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,790
What do you mean, Father?

341
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,350
You just need to tell me

342
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,990
how many soldiers are willing to listen to you

343
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,710
in the Zhenbei Army?

344
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,630
Please tell me first

345
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,030
why you asked it.

346
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,360
You've changed.

347
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,960
You never asked much before.

348
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,550
Did I break your heart

349
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,110
because I used you in Qi Yu's matter?

350
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,900
I pretended to be dead and left home when I was five.

351
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,850
You used me as a secret killer.

352
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,880
Now, you're saying you broke my heart by using me.

353
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,740
I don't know where that came from.

354
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,630
You do have a grudge.

355
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,920
Fine.

356
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,470
I can tell you.

357
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,520
You were born in the same year as His Majesty.

358
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,950
You were also born in the 37th year of Yongxi.

359
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,230
Do you know that?

360
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,490
Isn't it the 38th year of Yongxi?

361
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,630
You are my only son.

362
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,190
If I had another choice, how could I bear to be separated from you?

363
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,710
I did use you to do some things,

364
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,110
but I'm also trying to save your life.

365
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,480
In that case,

366
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,150
do you still hate me?

367
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,670
My parents gave birth to me and raised me.

368
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,280
I've never hated you.

369
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,810
My son is a person who is grateful

370
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,370
and cares about the overall situation.

371
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,910
Then you must know

372
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,470
what I'm going to say next.

373
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,030
I want you to establish your prestige in the army as soon as possible

374
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,910
and win over the Zhenbei Army.

375
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,620
What do you want to do, Father?

376
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,710
Just do as I say.

377
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,190
When the time comes,

378
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,830
you'll know.

379
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,350
Please.

380
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,920
Please.

381
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,760
General Zhao.

382
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,950
General Lyu.

383
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,110
Greetings, Prime Minister Lin.

384
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,190
Prime Minister, I wonder why you asked us

385
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,550
here today.

386
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,180
I'll get straight to the point.

387
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,200
As far as I know,

388
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,470
General Zhao, General Lyu, you both

389
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,070
worked for the crown prince before,

390
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,710
like Marquis Zhongyong, didn't you?

391
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,510
Yes.

392
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,880
We were the former crown prince's guards.

393
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,640
After that, we joined the army on the strength of the crown prince's recommendation.

394
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,910
If that's the case,

395
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,590
there's something I have to say.

396
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,270
May I ask what it is, Prime Minister?

397
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,790
It's claimed that Marquis Zhongyong died of an illness,

398
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,830
but he was actually poisoned to death.

399
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,460
Your Highness!

400
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,680
Your Highness!

401
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,110
Your Highness!

402
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,570
Your Highness!

403
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,960
Poisoned?

404
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,670
Yes.

405
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,430
Who dared to murder a high-ranking official?

406
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,630
Marquis Zhongyong was just a scapegoat.

407
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,870
It was only an accident.

408
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,910
The person they really wanted to murder

409
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,310
was Qi Yu.

410
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,830
Well...

411
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,630
Please think about it.

412
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,620
If the former royal grandson grew up safely,

413
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,340
who would worry the most?

414
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,350
Could it be...

415
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,840
His Majesty？

416
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,070
Marquis Zhongyong died of loyalty.

417
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,840
Now, in the Huainan Army,

418
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,320
you are the only ones who can be relied on.

419
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,150
I wonder if you two are willing to protect your old master

420
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,680
and help him rule the world.

421
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,140
Generals.

422
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,410
Is Father going to rebel?

423
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,610
I know

424
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,860
you grew up with His Majesty.

425
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,230
You are like brothers.

426
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,510
But you have to understand this.

427
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,470
As an essential official of three emperors,

428
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,990
although His Majesty relies on me,

429
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,650
he's also on guard against me.

430
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,910
If I fall,

431
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,950
he will destroy our whole family.

432
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,830
At that time,

433
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,230
would he still treat you as his brother?

434
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,040
Mu Bai.

435
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,130
Greetings, Your Majesty.

436
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,450
You are not my subordinate today.

437
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,350
We are brothers.

438
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,310
You may leave.

439
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,390
Yes.

440
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,450
Have a seat.

441
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,030
Yes.

442
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,760
Is everything okay at home?

443
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,680
When did you know?

444
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,470
We grew up together,

445
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,590
and you're so stupid.

446
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,030
It shouldn't be difficult for me to know these.

447
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,550
Okay.

448
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,870
I'll tell you everything today.

449
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,760
Actually, my real name is Lin Minshen.

450
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,930
I'm the son of Prime Minister Lin.

451
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,180
My father suspected you were Qi Huan,

452
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,910
so he planted me by your side

453
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,100
in case…

454
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,100
in case of emergency.

455
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,250
The spy reported today

456
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,090
that Mu Bai met Prime Minister Lin secretly.

457
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,920
To be honest, I didn't know why you went there.

458
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,150
But I bet with them

459
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,260
that you won't harm me.

460
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,250
Thank you, Your Majesty.

461
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,110
Thank you, Mu Bai.

462
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,260
Minshen.

463
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,560
You're finally here.

464
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,590
I know you will never abandon the Lin family.

465
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,040
I'm not here to help you.

466
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,230
I'm here to persuade you to stop now.

467
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,230
Fool.

468
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,230
Look how he treated me today.

469
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,510
He reprimanded my important subordinates at will.

470
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,770
Don't you understand?

471
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,310
At this point,

472
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,890
I can't back down anymore.

473
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,440
It's not that you can't.

474
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,790
It's you're pressing so hard

475
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,830
that His Majesty had to make a countermove against you.

476
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,290
Do you want your father to be bullied at will?

477
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,750
Ridiculous.

478
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,590
I've served three emperors. How can I be restrained by a boy?

479
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,190
Then you can usurp the throne?

480
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,150
Lin Minshen!

481
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,590
Do you remember that you are my son?

482
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,870
Heaven, Earth,

483
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,440
the emperor, the parents, and the master.

484
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,070
You...

485
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,990
You have to put your status as an official before that of a son.

486
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,450
You taught me this yourself when I was young.

487
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,070
You taught me to be loyal to the emperor

488
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,110
and love our country.

489
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,870
But what are you doing now?

490
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,800
Even if you don't care about me,

491
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,040
you should at least care about your sister Zerou.

492
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,270
She has been in the palace for so long.

493
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,910
Has she ever had a happy day?

494
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,790
Mai is a scheming woman.

495
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,710
She takes all of His Majesty’s heart.

496
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,970
Don't you want to do something for Zerou?

497
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,910
His Majesty does owe Zerou.

498
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,650
But since he ascended the throne,

499
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,610
he has been diligent and never slacked off.

500
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,240
For the people,

501
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,680
he is a good emperor.

502
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,710
If you continue to act arbitrarily

503
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,790
and stir up chaos in the court,

504
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,920
it will only be the people of Nanxia who suffer in the end.

505
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,990
How did I raise

506
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,290
a short-sighted son like you?

507
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,310
Those who achieve great things must sacrifice something.

508
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,630
Once prosperous times come,

509
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,510
the people will enjoy eternal blessings.

510
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,860
Stop lying to yourself.

511
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,750
You just did it for your own benefit.

512
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,870
-You...
-Shut up!

513
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,670
Regarding tomorrow,

514
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,510
whether you help me or not,

515
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,910
just don't forget

516
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,640
your surname is Lin.

517
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,430
Father!

518
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,090
Your Majesty, are you still not feeling well today?

519
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,910
Maybe it's because I didn't sleep well last night.

520
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,510
Jinchu,

521
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,470
get me a bowl of medicine for miscarriage prevention.

522
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,330
At the sacrifice ceremony today,

523
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,190
I can't afford to be indecorous.

524
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,350
Yes.

525
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:03,610
[Lin's Mansion]

526
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,830
Send someone to protect Madam.

527
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,810
You'll be in charge of the safety of the mansion.

528
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,030
Don't worry, Prime Minister.

529
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,960
I've arranged everything.

530
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,630
Whether I win or lose depends on today.

531
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,040
It's time to enter the palace.

532
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,870
Your Majesty.

533
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,390
The imperial physician sent the honeyed boluses this morning.

534
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,350
The medicine for miscarriage prevention is also ready.

535
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,150
Jinchu,

536
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,860
go and get some candied fruits for me.

537
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,590
Yes.

538
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,510
Generals,

539
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,730
Prime Minister has ordered you

540
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,690
to stand by.

541
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,720
You are pregnant.

542
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,850
There's no need for courtesy.

543
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,590
This sacrifice ceremony

544
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,870
is the first time Your Majesty worshiped the Imperial Ancestral Temple after you ascended the throne.

545
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,800
How can I make a fool of myself in front of the officials by misbehaving?

546
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,830
Thank you, Honey.

547
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,950
This is my duty.

548
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,110
Let's go.

549
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,040
Your Majesty, please abdicate.

550
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,030
Prime Minister Lin, are you trying to rebel?

551
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,630
No.

552
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,050
I'm just trying to set things right

553
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,310
so that the people will give their allegiance to the right person.

554
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,510
Protect His Majesty!

555
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,040
Where is General Li?

556
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,270
I am here.

557
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,350
I, Li Yu, am willing to serve

558
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,880
the legitimate emperor.

559
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,170
Please rise, General.

560
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,360
Arrest them.

561
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,670
Li Yu,

562
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,870
you've been with me for more than ten years.

563
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,800
Ten years.

564
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,750
But in the past ten years,

565
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,990
have Your Majesty ever favored me?

566
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:50,230
Commander Li, you've risked your life for him these years.

567
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,600
But what did you get in the end?

568
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,670
Are you really satisfied

569
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,330
to be the mere commander of the imperial guards?

570
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,610
Prime Minister Lin, stop talking.

571
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,590
I will do it.

572
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,510
Is that why you betray me?

573
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,310
How can Your Majesty understand

574
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:28,450
the feeling that when the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold?

575
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,460
Your Majesty, please abdicate.

576
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,550
Your Majesty, please abdicate!

577
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,310
Enough!

578
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,750
Father.

579
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,470
Stop now.

580
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,390
Unfilial son!

581
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,770
Father.

582
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,390
Stop it.

583
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,820
Even if you succeeded,

584
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,570
would the new emperor watch his maternal relative become powerful?

585
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,820
Turn around.

586
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,070
You...

587
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,969
Your Majesty, please abdicate.

588
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,989
The Zhenbei Army came to save the emperor.

589
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,350
We'll only punish the leader.

590
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,510
If the soldiers hand over their weapons,

591
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,900
they will be forgiven.

592
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,389
The Zhenbei Army came to save the emperor.

593
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,909
We'll only punish the leader.

594
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:26,900
If the soldiers hand over their weapons,

595
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,159
they will be forgiven.

596
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,929
I'm late.

597
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,110
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

598
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,860
It's not too late.

599
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,850
You're just in time.

600
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,620
Please rise.

601
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,350
Thank you, Your Majesty.

602
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,909
It’s not my credit.

603
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,750
It's all thanks to Mai's timely discovery.

604
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,230
I saw Li Yu on the street.

605
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,409
He was drunk

606
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,270
and was dragged into a carriage.

607
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,750
I thought something was fishy, so I followed him.

608
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,680
I found the carriage left the city.

609
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,950
Who did he go and meet?

610
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,110
At Shili Pavilion outside the city.

611
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,190
He went to see Prime Minister Lin.

612
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,160
Prime Minister Lin?

613
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,720
Brother Tang,

614
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,450
go back to the camp quickly

615
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,870
and deploy your men.

616
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,510
Be ready to protect His Majesty at any time.

617
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,990
Okay.

618
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,160
Mai.

619
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,670
Do you want to go to the palace

620
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,400
and report this to His Majesty?

621
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,460
It's not appropriate for me to participate in military affairs now.

622
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,350
I'll trust everything to you, Big Brother.

623
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,950
You must protect His Majesty

624
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,410
at all costs.

625
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,060
Thanks to Mai.

626
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,390
Your Majesty.

627
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,350
I have a request.

628
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,350
Go ahead.

629
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,750
I hope you can restore Mai to her former position.

630
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,350
I'll announce it now.

631
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,900
I hereby reinstate Mai as the Marshal of the Zhenbei Army.

632
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,020
Thank you, Your Majesty.

633
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,150
Your Majesty!

634
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,470
Zerou.

635
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,270
Your Majesty.

636
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,310
Call the imperial physician.

637
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,750
Your Majesty.

638
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,070
The royal offspring is gone.

639
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,590
How is Her Majesty?

640
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,950
Her Majesty is safe.

641
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,510
It won't harm her ability to have children in the future.

642
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,150
But it damaged her health, anyway.

643
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,860
Her vitality is greatly damaged.

644
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,430
She needs to rest in bed for three months.

645
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,710
Her Majesty is awake.

646
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,480
You may leave now.

647
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,310
Yes.

648
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,670
Yes.

649
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,830
Your Majesty.

650
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,270
Why did you do that?

651
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,770
Your Majesty is like Heaven to me.

652
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,910
I won't allow anyone to hurt you,

653
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,800
including myself.

654
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,150
Since I'm your Heaven,

655
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,290
why didn't you tell me about this?

656
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,340
I dare not.

657
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,670
Why not?

658
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,870
If I had told you the truth,

659
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,710
would you believe my sincerity,

660
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,820
or would you think I had other intentions?

661
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,030
I dare not gamble.

662
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,640
Take good care of yourself.

663
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,190
Your Majesty.

664
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,040
Your Majesty, can you spare my father's life?

665
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,790
You've come.

666
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,930
Prime Minister Lin, why did you ask

667
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,910
to see me?

668
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,350
Have Rou and Minshen been implicated?

669
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,350
Both of them are fine.

670
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,400
He's just showing it to others.

671
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,230
He's no longer

672
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,290
that foppish marquis who relied on others all the time.

673
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,590
He has become a real emperor.

674
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,790
Being with a king is like being with a tiger.

675
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:07,750
This saying has never been false.

676
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,190
You can only understand

677
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,250
the taste of power after you taste it.

678
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,870
Han Maisui.

679
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,060
If you were in my position,

680
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,270
what would you do?

681
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,120
Prime Minister Lin, you're wrong.

682
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,670
It's not that power tempts people to do evil,

683
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,950
but because you have evil in your heart in the first place.

684
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,550
That's why you were tempted.

685
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,750
In my heart,

686
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:41,410
I have never had any improper thoughts.

687
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,190
You may not have other thoughts,

688
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,870
but in the eyes of others, it may not be so.

689
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,740
When a person is about to die, his words are kinder.

690
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,670
Let me remind you.

691
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,790
If you don't believe me today,

692
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,150
then, when you are in prison one day, like me,

693
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,210
it'll be too late for you to regret it.

694
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,320
Do you know

695
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,500
His Majesty and Beimo are secretly in collusion?
