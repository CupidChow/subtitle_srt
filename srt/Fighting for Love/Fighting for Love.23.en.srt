00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,130
I saw it. She is a woman.

5
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,770
All you know is drinking.

6
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,450
It's all my fault.

7
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,329
I leaked General Mai's identity.

8
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,610
And I killed He Chao.

9
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,270
I'm truly unforgivable.

10
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,550
Zhao Zhong,

11
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,430
don't worry.

12
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,210
Young Marquis will find a way.

13
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,710
Sir, how do you want to punish Zhao Zhong?

14
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,430
Our country has its law,

15
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,180
and the military has its rules.

16
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,210
I'm afraid Zhao Zhong will have to pay with his life.

17
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,910
I... I disagree.

18
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,190
Yes.

19
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,070
Our country has its laws and the military has its rules.

20
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,670
I understand what you said.

21
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,110
But we humans also have emotional bonds.

22
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,130
Zhao Zhong is our brother.

23
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,210
He has been loyal all these years.

24
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,840
He did kill He Chao.

25
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,000
But we can't just kill him

26
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,950
just because one of our men died.

27
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,560
If we don't kill Zhao Zhong,

28
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm afraid we can't make others convinced.

29
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,470
You have a point.

30
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,370
How about this? Let's make a compromise.

31
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,829
As long as we keep him alive,

32
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,829
you can punish him however you want.

33
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,390
Let me think about it.

34
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,870
I know

35
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,420
you and Marshal Shang came from Shengdu together.

36
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,420
You have shared weal and woe.

37
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,950
You are like brothers.

38
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,500
What has happened has happened, don't blame yourself too much.

39
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,290
How can I not blame myself?

40
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,470
Young Marquis has always been good to us.

41
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,000
I've always kept it in my heart.

42
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,510
I made a big mistake because of drinking too much wine.

43
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,250
I feel guilty towards Young Marquis.

44
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,970
I feel guilty towards him.

45
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,630
Guard Zhao, have you heard of the story of the cuckoo?

46
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,350
Please enlighten me.

47
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,020
Once upon a time,

48
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,990
there was a poor family.

49
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,190
The family consisted of an old mother

50
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,350
and two sons.

51
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,470
The eldest son was called Du Da.

52
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,150
He was about 30 years old.

53
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,010
The youngest son was called Du Er.

54
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,590
He was 19 years old.

55
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,550
Both of them made a living by selling illegal salt

56
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,350
to support their old mother.

57
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,190
Du Da had much strength.

58
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,730
He could carry 150 kg each time with a carrying pole.

59
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,440
Du Er had less strength.

60
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,920
He could only carry over 50 kg each time with a carrying pole.

61
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,310
The money he made was only enough for supporting himself.

62
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,670
One day,

63
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,990
Du Da accidentally dropped the salt carrying pole

64
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,590
and killed someone.

65
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,150
He was arrested by the government and was on death row.

66
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,430
Du Er went to visit him.

67
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,750
The two of them cried so hard.

68
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,990
Du Da told his brother

69
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,550
to take good care of their mother.

70
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,030
But Du Er said

71
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,190
he should replace him to die.

72
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,870
If he died, he would be the only one who would die.

73
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,190
If Du Da died, the three of them would die.

74
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,400
He didn't have much strength and couldn't earn much.

75
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,450
He couldn't support their mother.

76
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,910
In the end, they could only starve to death.

77
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,150
Later, Du Er really replaced his big brother to die.

78
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,230
Their mother was able to live a peaceful life.

79
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,110
And Du Er's soul turned into a cuckoo

80
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,710
and cried day and night.

81
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,830
Who did this?

82
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,350

Let me ask you.

112
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,360
Which soldier doesn't have a wife, a child, parents,

113
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,990

115

116
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,549
Why?

117
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,070
Not just because you are kind

118
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,350
and loyal.

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,050

132
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,520

150
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,430
and take his head back to Shengdu to report.

151
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,560
The responsible department shall carry out the execution. Respect this.

152

Your Majesty.

153
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,110
Shi Dachun defected to the enemy

154
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,310
to protect the people in the city.

155
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,430
You gave an order to behead him.

156
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,550
I still think it's inappropriate.

157
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,550
According to the law,

shall be executed along with their nine clans.

But he did it for the people.

161
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,910
That's why I have spared his nine clans.

162
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,710
If I don't punish traitors severely,

163
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,070
everyone in the military could learn from them.

164
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,210
Then what's the use of the law?

165
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,190
The people of Yuzhou just had a rough time.

166
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,980
They still don't trust the court very much.

167
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,510
A single stone cast into water could create countless ripples.

168
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,640
If the people become resentful...

169
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,670
He is just a guard general of a city.

170
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,990
Why would his death make the people resentful?

171
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,870
Stop talking about this.

172
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,430
He must be killed.

173
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,630
Your Majesty,

174
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,510
although this can weaken the strength of the Zhenbei Army,

175
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,760
it can't undermine its foundation.

176
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,270
Your Majesty,

177
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,580
I really don't understand why you are doing this.

178
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,990
I don't think

179
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,640
the special envoy sent to Yuzhou

180
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,870
was killed by the Beimo people.

181
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,550
You think Marquis Dingnan did it?

182
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,030
Either he kills him,

183
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,830
or he bears the name of a rebel.

184
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,950
It depends on his choice.

185
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,950
Alright, stop talking.

00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,350
Thank you, Your Majesty.

188
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,230
Nice tea.

189
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,030
General Shi is devoted to the people of Yuzhou.

190
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,830
How could His Majesty treat a loyal official like this?

191
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,160
Don't worry, Uncle Shi.

192
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,230
We can definitely

193
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,150
come up with a perfect idea.

194
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,350
It's not that simple.

195
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,350
What His Majesty wants is not General Shi's life,

196
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,040
but the Zhenbei Army's loyalty.

197
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,370
The Zhenbei Army was transformed from the Qingyu Military Coalition.

198
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,830
Half of the soldiers were General Shi's men.

199
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,270
Now His Majesty has ordered Young Marquis

200
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,790
to supervise the execution of General Shi.

201
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,320
I think it will affect the prestige of Young Marquis in the army.

202
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,770
If Chen Qi attacks us again by that time,

203
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,350
we may not be able

204
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,110
to resist the Beimo Army's attack.

205
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,510
Then His Majesty can punish Young Marquis.

206
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,560
This move allows him to kill two birds with one stone.

207
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,230
Uncle Shi,

208
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,190
give me a few more days.

209
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,590
I will come up with a solution.

210
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,390
I'm tired.

211
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,710
I want to rest for a few days.

212
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,830
Don't come to me if there's nothing important.

213
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,230
General.

214
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,530
What do you plan to do

215
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,910
about General Shi's matter?

216
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,550
I plan to burn my bridges.

217
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
You insist on disobeying the order.

218
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,350
Actually, the soldiers know

219
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,910
without Uncle Shi,

220
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,030
the Qingyu Military Coalition wouldn't have come this far.

221
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,430
And we wouldn't have had 100,000 soldiers.

222
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,790
If anything happens to me or Uncle Shi,

223
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,390
the soldiers of the Qingyu Military Coalition

224
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,830
won't just sit and watch.

225
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,870
So this time,

226
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,110
I plan to take them with me.

227
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,510
You plan to use the 100,000 soldiers as the bargaining chip

228
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,910
to threaten His Majesty?

229
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,110
Although I will go to the palace alone to negotiate with His Majesty,

230
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,510
our 100,000 soldiers

231
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,210
will wait outside the city.

232
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,510
This indeed can be a threat to His Majesty.

233
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,420
That's right.

234
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,110
Don't you think there is a kind of balance

235
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,710
between us and His Majesty now?

236
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,670
If there is a balance, there will be restrictions.

237
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,670
Only with restrictions can we have a bargaining chip.

238
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,930
The core of this time's negotiation

239
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,230
is Uncle Shi's life.

240
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,550
No.

241
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,710
There must be a way.

242
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,750
Honey,

243
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,030
is there really no way to turn the tide?

244
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,120
We can't disobey His Majesty's order.

245
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,470
No.

246
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,470
There must be a way.

247
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,830
There must be a way.

248
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,510
Young Marquis.

249
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,390
I'm going to beg Young Marquis.

250
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,150
Honey. Honey.

251
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,520
I'm going to be frank with you.

252
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,520
Young Marquis

253
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,880
is trying to solve the problem.

254
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,440
So don't go to cause him trouble now.

255
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,740
You are not lying to me, right?

256
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,160
This is about disobeying His Majesty's order.

257
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,710
Young Marquis is taking a great risk

258
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,630
since he has agreed to help.

259
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,960
If the information is leaked, not just us,

260
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,430
everyone in Marquis Dingnan's Mansion will be implicated.

261
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,550
So I didn't tell you.

262
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,920
Really?

263
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,910
Have I ever lied to you in my life?

264
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,050
Just pretend that you don't know.

265
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,069
Don't tell anyone else.

266
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,550
I'm not stupid.

267
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,430
Why would I tell others?

268
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,069
All right, stop talking about this.

269
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,390
I'm hungry.

270
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,790
I want to eat golden patties made by you.

271
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,330
Wait a minute. I'm going to make some.

272
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:05,770
[I, Shi...]

273
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,190
I remember the Huainan Army was under your father's command.

274
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,120
Are you familiar with any general?

275
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,000
You want to take a drastic measure to deal with the situation?

276
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,110
The Zhenbei Army

277
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,430
should kill enemies.

278
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,120
When facing our comrades,

279
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,030
we should try to negotiate.

280
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,350
It's best not to fight.

281
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,550
I'll try.

282
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,150
Marshal Shang, I want to talk to you alone.

283
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,410
Marshal Shang, do you want to start a rebellion?

284
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,070
Since the emperor is fatuous and conscienceless,

285
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,750
we might as well replace him, right?

286
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,480
But it's not the right time now.

287
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,060
How can we succeed if we act in a hurry?

288
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,550
Besides,

289
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,910
you can't ignore

290
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,520
Princess Shenghua's safety, right?

291
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,050
It's just a temporary idea.

292
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,180
I didn't want to fight for it.

293
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,310
Now I have no choice.

294
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,080
This is not a wise decision.

295
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,270
You can't do this.

296
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,470
Mr. Xu, stop talking.

297
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,190
I've decided.

298
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,050
I just want to make this

299
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,030
as a souvenir for you.

300
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,310
Honey,

301
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,690
you have decided to give up your life long ago.

302
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,630
You lied to me

303
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,650
about asking Young Marquis for help.

304
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,590
Honey,

305
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,640
we can't disobey His Majesty's order.

306
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,670
You're so cruel.

307
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,630
Honey,

308
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,950
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,600
[Beimo]

310
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,830
Okay, let's do this.

311
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,590
Okay.

312
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,070
Let's go!

313
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,270
Okay.

314
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,270
Report.

315
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,130
Marshal Shang,

316
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,280
General Shi is here.

317
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,830
Uncle Shi.

318
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,010
Marshal Shang, are you going to fight your way back to Shengdu?

319
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,510
I said I would protect you.

320
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,750
Come with me.

321
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,590
No matter what it is, we'll talk about it after I come back.

322
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,600
Come with me.

323
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,310
Uncle Shi.

324
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,580
Young Marquis, you are here.

325
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,550
Come and sit.

326
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,970
Let's drink. Come on.

327
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,190
Good wine.

328
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,380
Why haven't you drunk?

329
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,110
If you want to persuade me to give up the plan,

330
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,880
there's no need to say it.

331
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,870
Back then,

332
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,710
your father saved my life on the battlefield.

333
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,110
Since then, I had followed him wholeheartedly.

334
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,190
Marquis

335
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,790
was loyal and nostalgic.

336
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,440
He was always the first one to come forward no matter what happened.

337
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,950
We all admired him,

338
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,430
except in one aspect.

339
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,110
Do you know how we thought of him

340
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,710
in private?

341
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,950
No.

342
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,430
We all said

343
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,770
he was afraid of his wife.

344
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,910
So are you.

345
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,860
Uncle Shi, you are afraid of your wife too.

346
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,350
I…

347
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,570
People can't speak ill of others behind their backs.

348
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,430
Otherwise, they may easily embarrass themselves.

349
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,190
Marquis died.

350
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,510
I didn't say goodbye to him for the last time.

351
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,790
It's not that I didn't want to. It's that I couldn't.

352
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,470
Because I have to help him

353
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,670
finish his unfinished journey

354
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,990
and unfinished things.

355
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,600
Before Marquis went to Shengdu,

356
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,350
he made a detour to Yuzhou.

357
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,470
We met privately. Right here.

358
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,000
Right where we are sitting.

359
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,470
Marquis

360
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,610
wanted me to repay his kindness with my life.

361
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,390
He said for other people, a son should pay his father's debts.

362
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,980
But for him, he wanted his son to inherit what I owed him.

363
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,440
He asked me to protect you with my life.

364
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,330
I promised him.

365
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,670
So, Uncle Shi,

366
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,530
when I first came to Yuzhou to borrow food,

367
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,060
you pretended to refuse me.

368
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,790
No, I meant it.

369
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,270
I only have one life.

370
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,790
I can save you once,

371
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,390
but I can't save you forever.

372
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,170
I wanted to see if you had the ability to protect yourself,

373
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,870
if you could get out of trouble on your own,

374
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,530
and if you deserved me entrusting my life to you.

375
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,510
I have to say

376
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,430
you have.

377
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,630
So,

378
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,350
I want to help you do one last thing.

379
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,620
[Letter of Apology]

380
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,990
What is this?

381
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,470
Your Aunt Shi doesn't have many relatives.

382
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,800
After I die,

383
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,390
you should help me take care of her.

384
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,800
Uncle Shi,

385
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,670
don't joke with me.

386
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,950
I'm not joking.

387
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,070
Listen.

388
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,800
Keep this well.

389
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,910
Why don't you understand?

390
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:58,190
From the moment the imperial edict was delivered to Yuzhou,

391
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,920
the result has been decided.

392
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,230
Do you know why His Majesty

393
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,360
asked you to supervise the execution?

394
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,270
Why?

395
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,510
Because you are actually the one

396
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,350
he wants to kill.

397
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,390
I'm guilty of treason.

398
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,520
If you don't kill me,

399
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,990
everyone in the Zhenbei Army would become my accomplice.

400
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,870
You would become the marshal of the rebellious army.

401
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,790
Do you know the result of bearing this name?

402
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,910
Marquis Zhongyong's army has been waiting at the southern bank of Wanjiang River.

403
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,110
That means His Majesty is waiting for you to make a choice.

404
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,630
Uncle Shi, I understand what you said.

405
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,960
But the situation is slightly different now.

406
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,750
Mai and I have made full preparations

407
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,910
for this battle.

408
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,870
We can definitely defeat the Huainan Army.

409
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,670
Alright, stop talking.

410
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,390
You really...

411
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,150
Don't let Aunt Shi see this.

412
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:40,830
Otherwise,

413
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,310
it'll be too late even if you don't want to die.

414
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,370
How come you still don't understand?

415
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,380
Uncle Shi, what's wrong with you?

416
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,230
Don't worry about me. Listen to me.

417
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,110
From the moment you take the initiative to send an army,

418
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,390
you'll become a real rebel.

419
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,170
The people who greet you with smiling faces now

420
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,960
will treat you as a beast by that time.

421
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,910
You should know that you can't win alone.

422
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,730
You are not strong enough yet.

423
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,990
It's reckless to start a rebellion now.

424
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,550
Do you really want everyone in the Zhenbei Army

425
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,950
to die because of your recklessness?

426
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,150
What on earth did you eat?

427
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,920
And this isn't the real crisis.

428
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,110
When you take my head

429
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,110
to Shengdu to report,

430
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,800
that will be the real beginning.

431
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,630
You have to do this.

432
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,990
Because the Zhenbei Army is your most trusted army.

433
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,310
Only by getting more political support

434
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,510
can you take back what belongs to you.

435
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,430
I don't want it.

436
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,490
-I don't want anything.
-You have to.

437
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,830
Uncle Shi.

438
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,430
Listen to me.

439
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,150
This is the last thing I can do for you.

440
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,870
If you don't want to let me down,

441
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,270
be a good emperor in the future.

442
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,230
Remember,

443
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,630
as an emperor,

444
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,880
you must be determined.

445
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,070
Uncle Shi.

446
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,080
Uncle Shi.

447
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:07,630
Uncle Shi.

448
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,110
Uncle Shi.

449
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,340
Young Marquis.

450
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,610
Young Marquis.

451
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,580
Time to eat.

452
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,210
Young Marquis.

453
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,810
Young Marquis.

454
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,920
Have some food, Young Marquis.

455
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,440
He hasn't eaten anything for two days.

456
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,430
Leave it to me.

457
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,380
You haven't eaten anything for two days.

458
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,280
Come and have some.

459
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,950
Look at yourself now. Don't you feel guilty towards Uncle Shi?

460
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,250
I feel guilty towards him.

461
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,590
Uncle Shi chose to do that

462
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,640
to better protect you.

463
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,190
He counted on you

464
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,250
to achieve what he couldn't achieve.

465
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,810
You are so dispirited.

466
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,760
You indeed are guilty towards him.

467
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,290
I couldn't protect Uncle Shi now.

468
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,210
That means I can't protect you in the future.

469
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,290
It's not you protecting me or me protecting you.

470
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,550
We protect each other.

471
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,400
We still have a long way to go.

472
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,350
We can't fall here.

473
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,770
Mr. Xu is still waiting for us.

474
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,270
Get up and have some.

475
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:32,480
His Majesty summoned Marshal Shang back to Shengdu because he has ulterior motives.

476
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,290
We have to take precautions.

477
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,110
Marshal Shang is in charge of the Zhenbei Army.

478
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,840
His Majesty has some scruples.

479
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,150
He won't use the same methods as before.

480
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,230
But Marshal Shang doesn't have a trustworthy man in the court.

481
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,910
It seems quite dangerous.

482
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,870
I'm afraid our precautions may not be effective.

483
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,550
General Mai is right.

484
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,430
That's why

485
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,110
I have a suggestion.

486
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,870
Sir, please go ahead.

487
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,110
Choose one between the crown prince and Prince Kang.

488
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,400
Do you mean we should form an alliance with a prince?

489
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,670
His Majesty only has two sons:

490
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,290
the crown prince and Prince Kang.

491
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,470
The crown prince is sentimental but mediocre.

492
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,870
If he wants to succeed the throne successfully,

493
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,230
I'm afraid he'll have to work harder.

494
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,390
Prince Kang is ambitious.

495
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,990
He hasn't got along with the crown prince for long.

496
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,470
Both of them need military power urgently.

497
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:41,550
Marshal Shang, why don't you take the chance to choose one to form an alliance?

498
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,360
In this way, you can ask for his protection

499
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,210
to solve the current problem.

500
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,170
Also, you can take advantage of his power to take root in the court.

501
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,950
You can gain many benefits.

502
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,490
Sir, you're resourceful.

503
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,010
This is a great idea.

504
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,310
I wonder which one you prefer

505
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,750
in your heart.

506
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,790
Marshal Shang, what do you think?

507
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,530
I prefer the crown prince.

508
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,469
The crown prince once wanted to kill you.

509
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:21,230
Why do you still want to choose him?

510
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,830
He did want to kill me.

511
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,630
Because in his eyes,

512
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,250
whether I want to compete for the throne or not,

513
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,909
I'm an obstacle on his way to succeed the throne.

514
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,980
But when the Beimo Army came,

515
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,710
he decided to let me go in the end.

516
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,670
It means the crown prince is righteous

517
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,929
and prioritizes the bigger picture.

518
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,000
He's not like the current emperor,

519
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,300
who is fatuous.

520
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,989
So I think if he ascends the throne,

521
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,909
he will be a wise emperor.

522
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,389
You made a good choice.

523
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,470
The one who will ascend the throne in the future

524
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,350
will definitely be the current crown prince.

525
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,470
Why are you so sure?

526
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,070
Actually, the successor His Majesty wants the most

527
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,790
is not the crown prince,

528
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,430
but the crown prince's eldest son, Qi Yu.

529
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,350
The crown prince was able to outshine Prince Kang

530
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,150
because of his son.

531
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,550
Qi Yu is still in his childhood,

532
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,910
but he's very smart.

533
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,910
He is favored by His Majesty.

534
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,790
Before His Majesty dies, he will clear all obstacles

535
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:30,510
for the crown prince to make sure he can ascend the throne.

536
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,560
Since you've decided to choose the crown prince,

537
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,670
Marshal Shang, who do you want to take with you?

538
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,790
The situation in Shengdu is unknown.

539
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,310
It's not proper to take too many people.

540
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,550
Mai, Bai, and I

541
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,480
will go first.

542
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,840
Guards can just follow us closely.

543
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,790
As for the army,

544
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,420
I plan to let Tang Shaoyi lead the army temporarily

545
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,470
and let you be in charge of the affairs.

546
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,630
Sir, what do you think?

547
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,790
After you leave for Shengdu,

548
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,390
Marshal Shang, General Mai, you must be very careful.

549
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,630
Keep in touch with Yuzhou anytime.

550
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,470
I'm going to make arrangements now.

551
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,720
Since you've decided to leave,

552
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,950
you should go visit Mrs. Shi, right?

553
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,210
I really don't know

554
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,600
how to face Aunt Shi.

555
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,320
Let's go now.

556
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,660
Mrs. Shi, look.

557
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,760
The flowers over there are blooming so well.

558
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,010
Let's go there.

559
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,510
Mrs. Shi,

560
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,040
Young Marquis is here to visit you.

561
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,150
Aunt Shi.

562
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,570
You don't have to do this.

563
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,070
Mrs. Shi,

564
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,150
we're going to leave with Mr. Shi.

565
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,790
Aunt Shi,

566
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,000
you'll be my family from now on.

567
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,150
Uncle Shi died because of me.

568
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,030
No matter what happens,

569
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,670
I'll protect you for the rest of my life.

570
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,720
Are you leaving today?

571
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,510
Tomorrow.

572
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,030
Take good care of... him.

573
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,110
Xiu'er,

574
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,850
take good care of Mrs. Shi.

575
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,470
Have they arrived?

576
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,550
Your Majesty, they will arrive soon.

577
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,640
Tell them to continue to keep an eye on them.

578
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,270
If anything happens,

579
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,590
report to me immediately.

580
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

581
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,020
Your Majesty,

582
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,950
there is one more thing.

583
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,190
Stop.

584
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,300
Leave.

585
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,070
Go ahead.

586
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,640
According to the secret report,

587
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,760
there is another group of people in Yuzhou

588
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,990
keeping an eye on Marquis Shang.
