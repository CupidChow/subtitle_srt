[Wisdom eyes]

5
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,440
Quietly immersed in the sounds of buddha.

6
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,750
It can calm you down.

7
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,150
I feel guilty.

8
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,829
Then come here often.

9
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,350
An ancient temple deep in the mountains.

10
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,470
It has its own Zen.

11
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,270
Greetings, Your Highness.

12
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,890
Prime Minister Lin, are you here to pray?

13
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,630
This is my daughter, Zerou.

14
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,740
[Lin Zerou]

15
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,750
Greetings, Princess Shenghua.

16
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,870
Brother Yizhi.

17
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,320
Greetings, Brother Yizhi.

18
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,990
It's inconvenient to talk here.

19
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,870
Let's go to the meditation room to take a rest.

20
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,030
Yizhi,

21
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,070
take her around.

22
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,510
Prime Minister Lin,

23
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,320
young people should be familiar with each other by themselves.

24
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,870
Prime Minister Lin, please.

25
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,200
Please, Your Highness.

26
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,270
It's my honor

27
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,490
to have Your Highness make the tea for me.

28
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,150
Without Prime Minister Lin's help,

29
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,430
even our family can't save Yizhi.

30
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,710
Making a cup of tea

31
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,850
can't repay Prime Minister Lin's kindness.

32
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,480
What is the reason for the invitation?

33
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,680
Prime Minister Lin clearly knows the situation in the imperial court.

34
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,710
The crown prince is grounded, and Prince Kang is getting powerful.

35
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,430
Now everyone thinks

36
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,950
the successor must be Prince Kang.

37
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,310
I wonder

38
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,230
if Prime Minister Lin has the same attitude.

39
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,760
His Majesty is unpredictable.

40
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,190
It's not my duty to guess His Majesty's intention.

41
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,590
Prime Minister Lin has served two emperors.

42
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,670
You are still powerful with a season.

43
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,520
Fortunately, Prince Kang is like his father.

44
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,910
Prime Minister Lin and Prince Kang must be getting along very well.

45
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,800
I've always been loyal to His Majesty.

46
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,110
Although we're not close,

47
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,440
but there is nothing negative between us.

48
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,700
Of course, we are fine.

49
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,030
Poor Prime Minister Lin for your loyalty.

50
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,910
I wonder if Prince Kang is happy about it.

51
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,750
Your Highness has always been on guard against Prince Kang.

52
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,590
His Majesty has ordered

53
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,880
to lift the restraining order of the crown prince.

54
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,950
As his aunt,

55
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,550
I certainly hope they

56
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,270
can get along with each other.

57
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,470
Unfortunately, the crown prince

58
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,440
can never get into my brother's heart.

59
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,720
Prime Minister Lin,

60
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,670
do you still want to support crown prince?

61
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,190
Since Prime Minister Lin wants more choices,

62
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,990
why don't you take Yizhi into consideration

63
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,270
and see if you will like him.

64
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,390
I'm too blind to tell.

65
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,150
But my daughter is smart.

66
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,830
She can make a decision for me.

67
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,430
Fine.

68
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,950
Let the two kids take a good look.

69
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,590
Take a look.

70
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,750
Prime Minister Lin, please.

71
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,080
Please, Your Highness.

72
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,590
Is something troubling you?

73
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,750
Miss Lin also likes Philosophy of Changes?

74
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,030
I get this for you.

75
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,180
For me?

76
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,450
I heard that fighting on the battlefield is dangerous.

77
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,909
So I want to pray for your safety.

78
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,230
Can you show me?

79
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,350
If this is for me,

80
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,710
why can't you show it to me?

81
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,580
[The goddess of the moon wishes for a reunion, so good things come together and last forever]

82
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,580
[The half moon shines brightly in a clear blue sky, the good luck is coming down to you]

83
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,030
I am ungracious.

84
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,630
Please forgive me, Mr. Yang.

85
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,190
It doesn't matter. Let's go.

86
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,750
Crown princess,

87
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,670
His Royal Highness sent someone to get his son.

88
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,490
Okay.

89
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,310
Greetings, crown princess.

90
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,750
As you were.

91
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,090
Where is His Highness now?

92
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,950
Why is he taking Yu there?

93
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,470
His Highness is going to Hehuan Hall to pay respects.

94
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,600
He's waiting ahead.

95
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,120
He sent me to pick his son.

96
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,990
Please wait for a moment.

97
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,590
Yu.

98
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,190
Greet your grandfather for me.

99
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,150
Yes, I will.

100
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,690
Go.

101
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,409
I'll wait for you to come back for dinner.

102
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,110
Take good care of him.

103
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,310
I understand.

104
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,600
Let's go, Young Master.

105
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,030
Here.

106
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,070
Here, have some.

107
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,370
Just a bowl of rice?

108
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,650
You are not eating?

109
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,610
I've had it with my mother.

110
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,790
Did you find anything today?

111
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,390
Eat up.

112
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,360
By the way,

113
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,390
did you have fun at the temple today?

114
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,760
Not as pretty as you.

115
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,310
What?

116
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,920
I mean the monk

117
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,230
is not as good looking as you.

118
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,880
Why? You don't believe me?

119
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,870
If you don't believe me,

120
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,530
I can take you there next time.

121
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,470
I don't have time.

122
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,470
I really don't understand

123
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,000
why there are so many morgues in Shengdu City.

124
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,960
I have to continue looking for them tomorrow.

125
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,430
I'll go with you.

126
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,880
Why did Your Highness come back alone?

127
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,750
Where is Yu?

128
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,790
Yu?

129
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,180
I didn't see Yu today.

130
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,460
But Officer Yang, who followed you,

131
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,350
picked Yu up in the name of you.

132
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,230
I didn't send anyone to pick Yu up today.

133
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,470
Don't worry, Your Highness.

134
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,070
His Highness Qi Yu is fine.

135
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,310
Mr, Guo, do you know where Yu is?

136
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,670
His Highness Qi Yu,

137
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,870
is now in a safe place.

138
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,510
As long as Your Royal Highness brings the crown prince's seal

139
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,150
to Prince Kang's Mansion before midnight,

140
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,670
His Highness Qi Yu will return safely.

141
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,350
Is it that you and Yang Xuan took Yu away?

142
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,430
He is not afraid of

143
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,790
alarming Father?

144
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,670
It depends on whether Your Highness dare to gamble.

145
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,510
How dare you!

146
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,520
You traitor!

147
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,630
Guards!

148
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,630
Yes.

149
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,430
Take him down.

150
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,350
Yes.

151
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,890
Your Highness, you...

152
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,080
Don't worry.

153
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,910
I will bring Yu

154
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,030
back to you.

155
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,470
Are you going to Prince Kang's Mansion?

156
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,510
I need to meet someone first.

157
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,990
The Crown Prince's Mansion is going to impose a curfew.

158
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,630
No information should be leaked.

159
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,270
Yes.

160
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,990
Your Highness.

161
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,640
Are you ready?

162
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,030
Your Highness,

163
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,230
everything is ready.

164
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,500
Whether we succeed or not,

165
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,350
it depends on tonight.

166
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,030
Please.

167
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,040
I came to visit you at night and disturbed your sleep.

168
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,330
It doesn't matter.

169
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,650
Please have a seat.

170
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,040
You are looking for Yizhi, right?

171
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,430
Go get Yizhi.

172
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:46,990
Yes.

173
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,750
Have a seat.

174
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,630
You don't have to bow.

175
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,790
I'm in trouble.

176
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,640
Yu was kidnapped.

177
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,270
What?

178
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,230
Do you know who did it?

179
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,310
Someone bribed my men

180
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,030
to lure Yu out of the palace.

181
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,030
And the person behind this is Yuzong.

182
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,350
My brother didn't allow me to tell father.

183
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,030
He only asked me to bring the official seal to his mansion.

184
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,530
Otherwise, Yu will be killed.

185
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,670
I think Yu has been

186
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,270
hidden in a secretive place.

187
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,030
So now,

188
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,670
I can only ask for help from my cousin and General Mai

189
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,750
to save Yu.

190
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,030
Your Royal Highness, please don't.

191
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,910
You two

192
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,590
are the only people I can trust now.

193
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,000
Please rise, Your Highness.

194
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,610
Your Highness.

195
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,470
I'm half of Yu's master.

196
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,990
I won't stand by.

197
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,590
Good.

198
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,360
I'll entrust Yu to Cousin

199
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,750
and General Mai.

200
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,660
Your Royal Highness.

201
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,030
Time is limited.

202
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,480
Let them make arrangements first.

203
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,430
I'll wait for your good news.

204
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,630
How many people can be useful in the mansion?

205
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,890
Mu Bai, and the guards.

206
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,800
There are only a dozen even we added Si.

207
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,310
I don't care.

208
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,830
I'll bring them, you stay.

209
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,950
You brining the people?

210
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,010
That's dangerous.

211
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,870
No way.

212
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,630
Listen to me. There is no discussion.

213
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,790
Stop arguing. You guys go together.

214
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,190
Be careful.

215
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:08,840
[Wu, Si, Chen, Mao, Yin, Chou, Zi, Hai]

216
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,170
[Zi, Hai, Xu]

217
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,510
Brother,

218
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,100
did you bring the official seal?

219
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,210
Where is Qi Yu now?

220
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,280
Hand over the official seal.

221
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,230
Then you can see Qi Yu.

222
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,030
What?

223
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,340
You don't trust me?

224
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,830
You're right.

225
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,630
In your heart,

226
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,630
I've always be a cunning and despicable man.

227
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,410
If you think of me that way,

228
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,590
I accept it.

229
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,450
But I never thought that

230
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,950
a well-dressed

231
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,720
and benevolent crown prince

232
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,190
is actually a reckless man who

233
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,190
will do anything to win His Majesty's heart.

234
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,190
I don't know what you're talking about.

235
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,040
Come on.

236
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,010
You pretended your wife is pregnant.

237
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,350
Trying to fake having a son.

238
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,880
Ten years ago,

239
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,880
you and I were nip and tuck.

240
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,320
Just because the crown princess gave birth to Yu,

241
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,310
you became the crown prince.

242
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,180
I thought God abandoned me.

243
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,650
[I am going to fake the pregnancy to get the title of the crown prince and wait for the baby to come out]

244
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,650
[Then, I'll pretend the baby is died and replaced him with a real one to keep my father's heart]

245
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,310
Getting a son first.

246
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,170
[Grandson of the Emperor, Qi Yu, is not from a royal bloodline. He is adopted by the crown prince to fulfill his own selfish desire]

247
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,170
[Prince Qi wants to use a fake prince to be favored, and then he will get a real son]

248
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,230
But I didn't expect that this child is the fake one.

249
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,670
I thought that once you become the crown prince,

250
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,760
you would let Yu die.

251
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,030
But I never thought that you two would not have any children anymore.

252
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,630
Yu is also loved by Father.

253
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,230
This is a dilemma.

254
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,470
These letters are fabricated.

255
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,570
That's why I asked you to bring the official seal

256
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,310
to make it real.

257
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,630
Besides,

258
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,880
these letters are fake.

259
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,280
But this matter

260
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,510
is true.

261
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,000
But who knows?

262
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,520
[Zi, Hai, Xu]

263
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
What did you find?

264
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,310
I guarded the palace outside as usual today.

265
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,350
I found Yang Xuan.

266
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,760
Come over there.

267
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,270
You scared me.

268
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,750
What's wrong?

269
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
You found something?

270
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,230
Follow him?

271
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,340
Yes.

272
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,830
And then?

273
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,180
Mai.

274
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,250
Young Marquis.

275
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,330
Your Grace,

276
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,490
we found something.

277
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,680
Go on.

278
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,790
We found them

279
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,070
based on the marks on those four carriages.

280
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,150
They stopped at Nanlou Shop, Fuxing Shop,

281
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,600
Anding Shop and Mayi Shop respectively.

282
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,400
Let's search these four places.

283
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,790
Let's split up.

284
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,910
Be careful.

285
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,950
Okay.

286
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,800
Brother.

287
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,030
Please.

288
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,410
It's getting late.

289
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,430
What?

290
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,720
Are you still waiting for news?

291
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,990
Time flies.

292
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,750
If you don't obey,

293
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,790
Yu will never come back.

294
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,110
Why are you laughing?

295
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,380
I'm laughing at your stupidity.

296
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,110
If you are at the end of the rope and

297
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,310
want to speak freely,

298
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,870
just do it.

299
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,670
But whether Yu can wait,

300
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,960
I can't guarantee.

301
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,720
Qi Min,

302
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,670
if I don't sign these papers today,

303
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,040
Qi Yu will die.

304
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,950
Although I will lose His Majesty's favoritism,

305
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,810
you can't get away with it either.

306
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,070
But if I sign these papers

307
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,650
and you submit them to our father,

308
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,190
Qi Yu will also die.

309
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,470
Yu will die anyway.

310
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,950
He is not even my son.

311
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,790
What would you do if it were you?

312
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,670
Qi Min,

313
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,150
didn’t you say I'm reckless and

314
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,950
intend to get my way by any means?

315
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,470
How did you know that I would be soft-hearted?

316
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,590
Yuzong,

317
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,970
the one who can't be soft-hearted

318
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,430
is you.

319
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,950
You must

320
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,910
kill Qi Yu.

321
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,070
It's still early.

322
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,930
There is no need to rush.

323
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,390
Search!

324
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,150
Yes.

325
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,600
Why are you here so late?

326
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,190
Sir.

327
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,310
Something happened in the Crown Prince's Mansion.

328
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,120
Yu was kidnapped.

329
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,110
His Highness went to Prince Kang's Mansion to save him.

330
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,670
This...

331
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,570
Your son had a fever at three.

332
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,480
You didn't change your clothes and stay up all night.

333
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,790
You only slept for a few hours in three days.

334
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,470
Your son had rashes at four.

335
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,470
The doctor didn't allow the crown prince to come near him.

336
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,120
You prayed to the buddha.

337
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,310
for his recovery.

338
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,070
Your son was playing

339
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,530
and broke his leg at the age of six.

340
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,430
The crown prince who never held his son,

341
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,680
became his cane and held him every day.

342
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,910
You and your son

343
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,720
may not be father and son biologically,

344
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,710
but are in fact, father and son.

345
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,550
The crown prince is benevolent.

346
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,480
People have been praised about it.

347
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,710
I think it's not fake.

348
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,470
What if

349
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,590
everything is just what I want you to see?

350
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,950
Kidnapping the grandson of the emperor is a desperate move.

351
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,070
We dare to bet.

352
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,640
If Your Highness is willing to bet,

353
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,470
let's wait until midnight.

354
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,670
Brother.

355
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,470
Yu really treats you as his father.

356
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,430
When he was kidnapped,

357
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,230
he kept hoping you to save him.

358
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,230
Brother.

359
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,110
Brother.

360
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,350
Stop hesitating.

361
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,830
Sign it.

362
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,800
[Chou, Zi, Hai]

363
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,870
Y-Young Master, don't be afraid.

364
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,620
Don't be afraid.

365
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,150
Your Highness.

366
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,430
Mai is late.

367
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,710
Master Mai.

368
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,670
Prince Kang.

369
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,550
Yu was rescued.

370
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,110
And the people in the palace are here.

371
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,390
Even if you win,

372
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,350
I will spread the news to the world tomorrow.

373
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,590
Can you still be the crown prince?

374
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,230
Qi Min,

375
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,950
you can never get the position you want.

376
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,990
Even if I die,

377
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,140
I won't betray my father.

378
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,710
Qi Jing.

379
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,890
Why are you doing this?

380
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,430
Because only when I die,

381
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,670
Yu can live.

382
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,460
His identity

383
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,590
can be real.

384
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,670
Because only a real father

385
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,630
would die to protect his own son.

386
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,070
You were ready to die.

387
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,790
It's not too late.

388
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,160
Just in time.

389
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,670
His Royal Highness is dead.

390
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,910
Your Majesty!

391
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,910
Your Majesty.

392
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,910
How is it?

393
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,300
The crown prince...

394
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,110
His Royal Highness just died in

395
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,270
Prince Kang's Mansion.

396
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,600
Crown princess.

397
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,710
It's karma.

398
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:33,950
Karma.

399
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,870
It's karma.

400
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:41,840
It's karma!

401
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,590
It's because of me.

402
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,830
Your Majesty!

403
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,190
Get the imperial physician!

404
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,910
Your Majesty! Summon the imperial physician!

405
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,290
Call the imperial physician!

406
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,080
Mr. Deng.

407
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:16,790
Your Highness.

408
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,920
Is Father all right?

409
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,210
Your Highness, ministers,

410
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,230
Your Majesty is fine.

411
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,030
He has issued a verbal instruction

412
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,510
to tell everyone to go home.

413
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,750
No need to wait here.

414
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,070
I'll go in and check on him.

415
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,930
Your Highness.

416
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,500
His Majesty woke up several times at night

417
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,750
and just fell asleep.

418
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,540
I feel sorry for him.

419
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,950
Please go back first, Your Highness.

420
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,550
I will report your filial piety to His Majesty.

421
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,350
I...

422
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,810
What happened tonight...

423
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,190
Don't you have to think of an explanation?

424
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,870
Be alert.

425
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,000
Don't let anything go wrong.

426
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,870
Yes.

427
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,020
I want Yu.

428
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,070
Get lost!

429
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,350
Get lost!

430
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,030
Your Majesty.

431
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,430
Your Majesty, don't be anxious.

432
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,310
It's just a temporary irritation that caused the loss of energy.

433
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,270
You'll recover after some rest, Your Majesty.

434
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,210
I've sent Shi Yuan to pick him up with the Longyin Guards.

435
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,150
Your Majesty.

436
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,950
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

437
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,650
I will arrange the imperial guards to guard the palace.

438
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,870
No one except the people who serve you

439
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,310
is allowed to come near the bedroom.

440
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,600
What is going on now?

441
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,960
Doctor Du should know that

442
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,840
the condition of the emperor concerns the fate of the country.

443
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,510
Please tell me honestly.

444
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,110
How can I accept Prime Minister Lin's courtesy?

445
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,070
After all, His Majesty is old.

446
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,340
He can't bear great joy or great sorrow.

447
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,350
This faint is a sign of a stroke.

448
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,750
Even if he wakes up,

449
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,280
I'm afraid he won't be the same as before.

450
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,880
He has to be taken good care of in order to recover.

451
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,230
I understand.

452
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,910
Please take care of His Majesty.

453
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,430
I will do my best.

454
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,590
Except us,

455
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,750
no one should know His Majesty's condition.

456
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,630
Don't worry, Prime Minister Lin.

457
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,350
I know what's important.

458
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,230
You've done a great job.

459
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,070
Serve His Majesty well,

460
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,000
and you will enjoy your late years in peace.

461
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,310
Thank you, Prime Minister Lin.

462
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,950
Come with me.

463
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:46,750
Yes.

464
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,510
Your Majesty.

465
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,790
Your Majesty.

466
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,550
Yu.

467
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,280
Do you want to summon your grandson to the palace?

468
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,110
Summon Yu.

469
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,090
Your Majesty, don't worry.

470
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,470
I know what to do.

471
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,150
Prince Kang.

472
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,070
You haven't left the palace?

473
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,760
I'm worried about my father.

474
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,690
I dare not leave.

475
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,890
Prime Minister Lin,

476
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,790
how is Father?

477
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,920
Please rest assured, Prince Kang.

478
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,910
His Majesty is awake.

479
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,150
No, no, no.

480
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,150
Prince Kang, why are you doing this?

481
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,110
No.

482
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,910
Please get up.

483
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,750
Father is seriously ill.

484
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,220
The crown prince died unfortunately.

485
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,880
Everyone at must be unstable.

486
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,750
Therefore, I'm willing to take you as my master

487
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,160
and learn politics.

488
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,690
I wonder if Prime Minister Lin will accept me as your disciple.

489
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,990
You're exaggerating, Prince Kang.

490
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,910
With my ability,

491
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,110
how can I afford to be your master?

492
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,750
Prime Minister Lin is the founding member of two dynasties.

493
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,160
You are the foundation of Nanxia.

494
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,310
Why not?

495
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,590
Your Highness, you've overrated me.

496
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,720
I can recommend the Imperial College for you.

497
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,590
I don't deserve this.

498
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,630
I really can't take the responsibility.

499
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,820
Fine.

500
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,680
In that case, I won't force you anymore.

501
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,760
Thank you, Your Highness. I'll take my leave.

502
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,469
Please go back early.

503
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,469
Don't worry too much.

504
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,030
I’m leaving.

505
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,719
Thank you, Marshal Shang and General Mai.

506
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Yu is still young.

507
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,940
He shouldn’t have suffered so much.

508
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,670
Mr. Shi,

509
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,110
please send him to the emperor safely.

510
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,530
Don't worry.

511
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,230
Goodbye.

512
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,270
His Majesty is seriously ill.

513
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,590
At the time of the storm,

514
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,910
the imperial court

515
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,350
needs someone who is  mature and experienced like Prime Minister Lin

516
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,610
to take charge of the overall situation.

517
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,390
I'm walking on thin ice.

518
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,030
Fortunately, Prince Kang still holds the will to help the country.

519
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,490
He wants me to be his master

520
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,950
and share the burden.

521
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,640
Did you accept it?

522
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,150
I'm still thinking about it.

523
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:55,590
Yes.

524
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,450
How can an emperor's master comparable to his father-in-law?

525
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,310
How sure are you?

526
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,750
The Zhenbei Army is popular now.

527
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,480
It is the strongest army of Nanxia.

528
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,230
Prime Minister Lin is the most powerful person in the imperial court.

529
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,550
If the two combine,

530
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,070
Nanxia can be settled.

531
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,410
I've long heard that Prime Minister Lin's daughter, Zerou, is a lady.

532
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,810
She can be the mother of this country.

533
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,270
Young Marquis Shang is an outstanding person.

534
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,670
They are a perfect match.

535
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,800
But it's not enough.

536
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,290
What do you mean, Prime Minister Lin?

537
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,750
The Ministry of Revenue.

538
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:46,750
After the new emperor ascends the throne,

539
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,010
I'll be the one assign the position of Ministry of Revenue.

540
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,150
Deal.

541
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,670
Prime Minister Lin, please.

542
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,190
It's my honour that

543
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,910
our families can be linked up through marriage.

544
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,510
Please.

545
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,670
Old bastard!

546
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,070
That old bastard!

547
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,150
Old bastard!

548
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,660
He has gone too far!

549
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,190
When...

550
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,960
When I ascend the throne,

551
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,790
I must kick him out of Shengdu.

552
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,000
Calm down, Your Highness.

553
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,950
It's not that Prime Minister Lin is not willing to,

554
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,270
but he dares not to.

555
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,310
I know.

556
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,670
But Father is awake now.

557
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,710
What can I do to solve this?

558
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,070
I'll just wait in the mansion to die.

559
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,260
The only way now

560
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,950
is to spread the news about the identity of the emperor's grandson.

561
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,990
So that we have a chance of survival.

562
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,550
Without evidence,

563
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,150
how can we pin it on Qi Yu?

564
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,630
Isn't there the crown princess?

565
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,710
When His Majesty can manage the state affairs,

566
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,070
he won't let this go.

567
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,800
Think about it.

568
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,670
She is a woman.

569
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,910
How can she hide it from His Majesty?

570
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,230
Thank you, Master Pang.

571
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,120
Congratulations, Your Highness.

572
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,720
Congratulations, Your Highness.

573
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,800
What's there to congratulate?

574
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:34,910
It's such a big event.

575
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,790
Everyone knows it.

576
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,550
Why are you treating me as a stranger?

577
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,150
Father is seriously ill.

578
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,990
My brother is dead.

579
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,670
Why are you here to report good news?

580
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,810
Shen Tingyuan.

581
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,110
Don't think that I dare not kill you.

582
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,950
Spare my life, Your Highness.

583
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,510
It's just hearsay.

584
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,700
How would a little hostage prince know about the affairs of the court?

585
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,470
I should be punished.

586
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,440
All right.

587
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,270
Tell me, what do you want from me?

588
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,230
I'm here for rewards.

589
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,630
What happened last night...

590
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,630
His Majesty was seriously ill and the crown prince passed away.

591
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:17,360
I think Prince Kang will act for the emperor to supervise the state.

592
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,900
I thought I was close to His Highness.

593
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,790
So I came to ask for rewards.

594
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,430
What do you want?

595
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,910
Wine, beauty, and a house.

596
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,310
I'll accept

597
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,350
whatever you give me.

598
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,790
Good for you.

599
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,470
That's all?

600
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,270
If Your Highness can

601
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,430
send me home...

602
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,550
What home?

603
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,560
I want to be close to you.

604
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,760
I don't want you to leave.

605
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,820
I want to keep you for a few more years.

606
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,630
Here.

607
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,310
I'll prepare good wines and pretty girls for you

608
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,310
right now.

609
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,210
The great future of Nanxia

610
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,190
is better than you eating sands in Beimo.

611
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,910
I miss my hometown so much.

612
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,560
I haven't supervised the state yet.

613
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,520
This is not the right time.

614
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:18,950
Got it.

615
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,800
I understand.

616
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,160
Your Highness, I will do anything for you.

617
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,260
Your Highness is busy.

618
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,990
I'll leave you alone.

619
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,880
I'll visit you another day.

620
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,800
He wants to go back to Beimo?

621
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,150
Not a chance.

622
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,090
Your Highness.

623
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:50,990
He is a good pawn that

624
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,350
can't be given up easily.

625
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,790
I know.
