00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,550
Who is it?

197
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,830
Please inform Mr. Four.

198
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,690
A guest is here.

199
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,950
Mr. Four is not feeling well today.

200
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,280
He won't see any guests.

201
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,780
Please.

202
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,710
Please give this to Mr. Four.

203
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,280
Mr. Four will see me.

204
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,310
So troublesome.

205
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,150
Wait for me.

206
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,670
Freshly fried peanuts.

207
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,350
Your water.

208
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,750
Crispy melon seeds.

209
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,950
Crispy melon seeds.

210
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,630
Have you seen him?

211
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,470
No.

212
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,430
Have you seen this person?

213
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:28,990
Wait.

214
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,590
Have you seen this person?

215
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,140
No.

216
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,310
Have you seen him?

217
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,630
No.

218
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,430
Have you seen this person?

219
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,910
No.

220
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,440
You...

221
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,030
come with me.

222
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:49,990
Thank you.

223
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,470
Mr. Four.

224
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,600
He’s here.

225
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,550
You may leave.

226
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,310
Yes.

227
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,030
Greetings, Mr. Four.

228
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,070
Where did you get this ring?

229
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,070
Miss Chunniang gave it to me.

230
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,290
What's your relationship with Chunniang?

231
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,150
To be honest,

232
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,950
I met Miss Chunniang by chance.

233
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,310
I helped her out by chance.

234
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,230
You have nothing to hide.

235
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,990
Don't be modest.

236
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,830
She gave this to you.

237
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,470
You must have put your life on her hand before.

238
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,160
Tell me, what's the matter?

239
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,980
I'm looking for someone.

240
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,320
Miss Chunniang said

241
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,410
only Mr. Four knows his whereabouts.

242
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,560
Who are you looking for?

243
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,000
Chen Qi, the adopted son of Duke Shengguo.

244
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,800
Why are you looking for him?

245
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,790
Something personal.

246
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,910
Please be honest with me

247
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,610
for Miss Chunniang's sake.

248
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,950
He went to Beimo.

249
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,990
Did Chunniang tell you

250
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,830
what business I do?

251
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,130
She only told me your nickname is Ghost Hand.

252
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,070
I'm specialized in forging passports.

253
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,110
They look like real ones.

254
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,990
So you made Chen Qi's passport?

255
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,790
Why did he go to Beimo?

256
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,550
I don't know.

257
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,230
In our business,

258
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,670
we have rules.

259
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,670
I only do my job.

260
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,130
I don't ask questions.

261
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,550
If I want to go too,

262
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,850
can you make one for me?

263
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,480
Sure.

264
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,880
How much do you need?

265
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,510
Chunniang's friend doesn't need to bargain.

266
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,310
Come and get it after three days.

267
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,240
Thank you.

268
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,350
Chunniang...

269
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,880
Something happened in the Emerald Pavilion.

270
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,710
None of them escaped.

271
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,080
Miss Chunniang asked me to send you a message.

272
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,440
She said it's a long journey

273
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,610
and had no time to meet you.

274
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,710
I feel guilty.

275
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,720
Goodbye.

276
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,070
I've arranged my men to search for the spy.

277
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,730
I haven't heard anything yet.

278
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,590
Remember.

279
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,400
Don't let your guard down on the spy from Beimo.

280
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,890
Come here. Look at this.

281
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,150
[Dibao]

282
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,080
[I inherited the throne to raise and educate all people. I try to cease fire...]

283
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,080
[To provide a stable life, how would I start a war? I order all cities to send gold and silk to Beimo]

284
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,870
The Imperial court decided to make peace.

285
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,630
How much land will they give this time?

286
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,160
And how much taxes will they charge this time?

287
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,830
You may be angry,

288
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,600
but why are you venting your anger on dibao?

289
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,780
Brother,

290
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,510
don't be angry.

291
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,130
The north is the border of Jingyang,

292
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,760
and then we have Qinghai and Henan provinces.

293
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,550
No matter how the war is fighting,

294
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,190
it will never come to us.

295
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,270
Let's do our job.

296
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,050
Report!

297
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,640
Report!

298
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,750
Just now, some people

299
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,950
found a trace of suspected spy of Beimo.

300
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,510
Leave.

301
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,070
Yes.

302
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,790
Brother.

303
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,390
I'll take my men to search

304
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,910
and enforce martial law.

305
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,150
By the way,

306
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,670
I think we should

307
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,530
defeat the enemy of Nanxia at once

308
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,720
in exchange for real stability.

309
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,230
You're still young.

310
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,550
It's that fat sheep.

311
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,390
Qiang.

312
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,790
He's Mr. Four's friend.

313
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,390
Should we let him go?

314
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,020
Mr. Four is nothing when it comes to money.

315
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,580
Let's go.

316
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,030
Are you looking for Li Erniu?

317
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,270
Yes.

318
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,110
Madam,

319
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,230
when will Li Erniu come home?

320
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,790
He won't come back.

321
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,360
Where did he go?

322
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,170
He was imprisoned by the officer.

323
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,910
What crime did he commit?

324
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,190
I don't know.

325
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,700
I heard it from others.

326
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,910
Thank you, Madam.

327
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,610
Are you looking for Li Erniu?

328
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,950
When will Li Erniu go home?

329
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,810
He was imprisoned by the officer.

330
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,990
Young man,

331
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,770
where are you going in a hurry?

332
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,020
You two.

333
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,670
What can I do for you?

334
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,390
We know each other.

335
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,270
Lend me some money.

336
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,470
If you were sensible,

337
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,589
we won't do any evil things.

338
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,550
Don't worry.

339
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,470
How about this?

340
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,470
I will

341
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,170
give you half first

342
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,040
and keep the other half.

343
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,030
If you let me out safely,

344
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,190
I'll give you the other half.

345
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,710
Okay.

346
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,170
Take the money.

347
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,310
Let's see him off.

348
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,800
Young man, I think you're quite dedicated.

349
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,510
Why don't you work with me from now on?

350
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,350
What do you think?

351
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,710
I just passed by Yinbao City.

352
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,830
I’ll leave in a few days.

353
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,590
But can you introduce

354
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,110
some good restaurants nearby.

355
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,990
No problem.

356
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,230
My brother knows too much about food.

357
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,190
Isn't this the thief?

358
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,310
I'm sure you'll be able to eat something good.

359
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,240
Yes, you can eat whatever you want.

360
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,160
Let's go.

361
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,830
How dare you stand in my way?

362
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,230
I'll sell you to a brothel.

363
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,830
Go away.

364
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,830
Don’t you think it’s a small world?

365
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,380
No, not at all.

366
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,350
You go this way. I'll go this way.

367
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,670
No one will meet each other.

368
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,470
Cut the crap.

369
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,830
How dare you steal my stuff.

370
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,550
You are the first one to steal from the Chang's.

371
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,550
Do you want to die?

372
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,320
It's the Young Master Chang.

373
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,380
You're a noble man.

374
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,240
Don't bother yourself with me.

375
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,150
Besides,

376
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,630
you've come in.

377
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,190
I guess

378
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,110
you also stole someone else's pass.

379
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,830
Am I right?

380
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,080
I know

381
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,310
it's my fault for stealing from you.

382
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,350
How about this?

383
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,830
Let me go.

384
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,290
I won't tell on you.

385
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,830
You know what I want to do?

386
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't know what you want to do.

387
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,350
But I know

388
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,310
your business

389
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,830
is more important than mine.

390
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,790
Don’t blame me for not reminding you.

391
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,590
There are many patrol nearby.

392
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,320
Brother.

393
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,790
Brother! Brother!

394
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,110
Help!

395
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,070
Help!

396
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,070
Who are you?

397
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,910
I'll come back to you.

398
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,670
Help!

399
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,430
Let's take a look.

400
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,510
Boss.

401
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,530
It looks like something from Beimo.

402
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,590
Arrest this Beimo spy!

403
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,230
No.

404
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,830
Get up.

405
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,900
Sir.

406
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,510
I'm not a spy.

407
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,190
That jade ring

408
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,370
was left by the man who hit me just now.

409
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,250
You're good at making up stories.

410
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,610
Such a precious ring.

411
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,460
You are neither a spy nor a thief.

412
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,280
Take him away!

413
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,750
Go!

414
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,680
-Sir.
-Let’s go.

415
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,760
-Let’s go.
-Sir!

416
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,710
Sir!

417
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,330
We have a newcomer.

418
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,310
Come to us.

419
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,030
Pretty boy.

420
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,080
Come to our room.

421
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,670
Come on.

422
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,310
Come on!

423
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,670
What did you do? Lock him up at ours.

424
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,330
Stand here.

425
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,110
The bed is ready.

426
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,740
Quiet! Stay still!

427
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,750
Get back!

428
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:12,990
Sit down.

429
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,430
Sit tight.

430
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,960
Bring him in.

431
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,750
Get in.

432
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,320
Behave yourselves!

433
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,950
Brother.

434
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,490
Are you a carpenter?

435
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:20,880
Yes.

436
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,470
What's wrong?

437
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,280
Nothing.

438
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,140
I am curious of what you are looking at.

439
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,080
An amateur.

440
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,590
You won't understand it.

441
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,880
I thought you were reading something good.

442
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,850
Isn't this whip arrow?

443
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,070
You know it?

444
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,230
Do you dare to show it to me?

445
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,130
This kind of whip arrow...

446
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,230
Although it reduced the use of raw materials,

447
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,420
[The shaft is one third of the arrow’s length, and there's no feathers at the back]

448
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,400
because of this groove,

449
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,510
there's no way to add the tail feather.

450
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,710
When the arrow is shot, it can't get the help from the wind.

451
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,430
Then the shooting range will be shorten.

452
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,230
It can only be used as a reserve on the battlefield.

453
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,360
[The shaft is one third of the arrow’s length, and there's no feathers at the back]

454
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,070
You know a lot.

455
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,060
You're right.

456
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,420
The whip arrow used to be like this.

457
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,970
I can modify it,

458
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,520
so that its shooting range won't shrink.

459
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,490
It can also be shot continuously.

460
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,430
Look.

461
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,510
Here.

462
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,280
And here.

463
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,400
[Whip Arrow Style]

464
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,160
[Whip Arrow Style]

465
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,720
It's really a great change.

466
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,990
Brother.

467
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,650
You're a great craftsman.

468
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,310
I'm flattered.

469
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,290
It's just an ancestral skill.

470
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,510
Brother.

471
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,210
This is a treasure.

472
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,510
If we can send it to the army for promotion,

473
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,440
they will surely become stronger.

474
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,230
And we can make a lot of money.

475
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,370
Brother,

476
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,350
Li of the Armament Departmen and I

477
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,350
are close.

478
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,430
This

479
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,570
won't be given to the army.

480
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,460
Why are you turning back on greenback?

481
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,430
Get in.

482
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,270
Hurry up!

483
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,160
Brother.

484
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,200
Come on, you're back.

485
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Have a seat.

486
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,900
Pour some water.

487
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,310
A young one came today.

488
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,870
How did you get in?

489
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,860
Pretty boy.

490
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,180
Brother is calling you. Come here.

491
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Coming, brother.

492
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,350
Brother.

493
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,150
To answer you,

494
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,590
I came from another city.

495
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,150
I ran into this robber as soon as I came in.

496
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,190
I was mistook as a spy.

497
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,150
So I am here.

498
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,990
A spy?

499
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,190
I hate spies the most.

500
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,150
I am a native of Nanxia.

501
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,430
I am definitely not a spy.

502
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,070
Brother.

503
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,640
It was all a misunderstanding.

504
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,430
Raise your head.

505
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,750
Why do you look like this?

506
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,560
You look like a girl.

507
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,880
Stand up.

508
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,070
Turn around.

509
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,550
How dare you!

510
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,990
Yeah.

511
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:10,990
Brother!

512
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,950
Beat him!

513
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,110
Beat him! Beat him!

514
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,230
Beat him! Beat him!

515
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,670
Beat him! Beat him!

516
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,950
Stop! Stop!

517
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,190
What happened?

518
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,470
Nothing.

519
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,270
I fell asleep

520
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,390
and fell down.

521
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,530
Are you really okay?

522
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,210
I'm fine.

523
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,850
It's just a misunderstanding.

524
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,050
We were just kidding.

525
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,130
That's enough.

526
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,520
Don't go too far.

527
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,360
Yes. Yes.

528
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,310
Warden Xu is right.

529
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:05,550
You...

530
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,930
Do you want me to change a room for you?

531
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,920
Don't bother.

532
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,260
He takes good care of me.

533
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,870
Not bad, young man.

534
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,020
You're good and loyal.

535
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,840
You are a bigger man.

536
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,270
Don't take it to heart.

537
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,750
We don't know each other without fighting.

538
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,150
Where are you from?

539
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,040
Shengdu.

540
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,050
Shengdu!

541
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,060
At the foot of the emperor.

542
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,230
I heard that it's full of gold.

543
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,270
Is it true?

544
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,600
The emperor's Noble Consort

545
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,070
is said to be a goddess.

546
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,670
Have you ever seen her?

547
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,350
Enough.

548
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,070
Young man,

549
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,190
don’t laugh.

550
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,670
The men in Yinbao City

551
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,510
have never been that far.

552
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,630
Young man,

553
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,730
Tell me.

554
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,000
Come on. Come on.

555
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,750
Have a seat.

556
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,280
Sit down.

557
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,540
You really want to hear it?

558
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,470
Yes.

559
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,000
Fine.

560
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,470
Shengdu City

561
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,180
is really bustling.

562
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,270
Most of the people I met outside

563
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:26,890
are rich and noble.

564
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,470
People like us

565
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,750
have to avoid them.

566
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,350
We've never seen

567
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,260
the empress in the palace.

568
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,640
But the girls in the city

569
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,590
are pretty.

570
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,610
Brother.

571
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,380
Look at this.

572
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,510
We just collected from a spy.

573
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,370
This should be an item from Beimo.

574
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,710
Yes.

575
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,110
This is not used by ordinary Beimo people.

576
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,990
It's an object used by

577
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,430
the Chang family of Beimo.

578
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,710
The Chang family?

579
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,870
If it's the Chang family,

580
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,960
he should be taking an important position in Beimo.

581
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,830
Why is he here alone?

582
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,270
I heard that in this generation of the Chang's,

583
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,550
there is an outstanding young man.

584
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,070
His name is Chang Yuqing.

585
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,590
He is highly skilled and arrogant.

586
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,790
Others won't.

587
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,190
But this person is very likely to do this.

588
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,790
The only thing in our city that the Beimo people want

589
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,200
is the military supplies in the treasury.

590
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,330
I'll take someone to the treasury now.

591
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,550
No, to the prison.

592
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,390
Hurry up and bring more people.

593
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:53,920
Okay.

594
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,670
Who is Li Erniu?

595
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,270
Come out!

596
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,950
Who is Li Erniu?

597
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,070
Who is Li Erniu?

598
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,950
Who is Li Erniu?

599
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,190
Who is Li Erniu?

600
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,280
Brother.

601
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,360
Someone broke into the prison!

602
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,110
Wake up!

603
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,870
The jailbreaker is here.

604
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,590
Who is Li Erniu?

605
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:55,990
I'm Li Erniu.

606
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,490
I'm Li Erniu.

607
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,510
This...

608
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,390
Are you Li Erniu?

609
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,020
Yes, I'm Li Erniu.

610
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,990
Do you live in Xinghua Shop?

611
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,290
Xinghua Shop?

612
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,750
Yes, I live there.

613
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,300
Come on. Take me away.

614
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,890
Show me the drawing of the whip arrow.

615
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,420
The drawing of the whip arrow?

616
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,460
What drawing?

617
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,490
Who is Li Erniu?

618
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,590
Who is Li Erniu?

619
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,960
If you don't tell the truth, I'll kill you.

620
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:58,800
Brother.

621
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,730
Do you live in Xinghua Shop?

622
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
[Eastern Market Xinghua Shop]

623
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,420
Boss.

624
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,910
It looks like Beimo's item.

625
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,580
Take out the drawing of the whip arrow.

626
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,220
[The shaft is one third of the arrow’s length, and there's no feathers at the back]

627
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,490
The man surnamed Chang from Beimo

628
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,200
wants to steal this whip arrow drawing.

629
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,350
Tell me.

630
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,840
Tell me the truth or I'll kill him.

631
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,110
Stop!

632
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,270
I'm Li Erniu.

633
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,410
Don't move.

634
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,200
We meet again.

635
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,270
I'm here to kill him.

636
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,590
You saved me trouble.

637
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,160
Really?

638
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,050
Yes.

639
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,380
Do it.

640
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,630
Stop!

641
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,230
Young Master Chang framed me.

642
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,420
I was mistaken as a spy

643
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,550
and was imprisoned.

644
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,830
I am still holding a grudge.

645
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,510
What do you want?

646
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,260
If you don't apologize to me today,

647
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,990
no one can take him away.

648
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,550
Okay.

649
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,600
I apologize.

650
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,160
You're not sincere.

651
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,700
Kneel down!

652
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,390
You asked for it.

653
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,010
Search carefully.

654
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,260
Don't let anyone go.

655
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,670
Arrest them!

656
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,150
Hide your stupid book.

657
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,400
I'll get you out of here.

658
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,230
Help me!

659
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,070
Go!

660
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,380
Stop chasing.

661
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,070
Arrest this spy.

662
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,790
Yes.

663
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,830
Tell me.

664
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,350
What's your purpose of coming here?

665
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,150
Sir.

666
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,170
There is no us,

667
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,700
I was really framed.

668
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,630
I don't know him.

669
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,750
Listen,

670
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,980
you'd better tell me the truth.

671
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,320
I know. I know.

672
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,670
Sir, let me tell you.

673
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,390
That man just now.

674
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,110
The man who ran away in white.

675
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,970
He's from Beimo. His surname is Chang.

676
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,510
He's here for Li Erniu.

677
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,110
Wait.

678
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,710
His surname is Chang?

679
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,790
He's skilled in martial arts.

680
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,990
Is he the Chang Yuqing from Beimo Army?

681
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,190
Sir, let me tell you.

682
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,550
Li Erniu, I just heard...

683
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,350
-I just heard from Chang.
-Oh no.

684
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,360
If he is really Chang Yuqing,

685
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,560
he failed to attack us just now,

686
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,160
I'm afraid he will attack the city soon.

687
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,680
Pass my order.

688
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,520
We will attack the city tomorrow morning.

689
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,240
General.

690
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
We've been in Yinbao for a long time.

691
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,780
We must travel day and night.

692
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,590
Otherwise, we won't be able to reach Qinshan.

693
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,020
If we failed Marshal's order,

694
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,930
It is a serious crime.

695
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,330
I've investigated it.

696
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,120
There are less than 3,000 people who can guard the city.

697
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,180
Weapons are short.

698
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,740
They don't even have heavy bows and crossbows.

699
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,150
To attack a small city like this,

700
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,510
a few hours is enough.

701
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,960
It won't take long.

702
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,620
Anything else, Lieutenant Jiang?

703
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,810
No, order received.

704
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,750
I, Chang Yuqing, must get the person I want.
