1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,465
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:27,104
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:29,169
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:32,554
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:36,186
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:37,485
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:41,967
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:46,468
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:51,016
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:56,159
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:01,297
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:05,777
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,273
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:13,549
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,710
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,895
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:19,909
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,589
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,031
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,172
 If I may comment, 

25
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:30,560
 I've fought those four Foundation
Establishment Blood Guards before. 

26
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,390
 They are strong. 

27
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,470
 Especially their Demonic Transformation. 

28
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,521
 It allows them to ascend
to the next tier by brute force. 

29
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:41,760
 Of course, it is not without weaknesses. 

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,280
 One, the transformation
requires one to enter a Blood Cocoon. 

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,000
 That takes time. 

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,350
 Two, upon transformation, 

33
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,920
 one will be overtaken by the thirst
for blood and lose all rationality. 

34
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,840
 We can exploit those two weaknesses. 

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
 Do not forget that. 

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,440
 We'll try to waste their time. 

37
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,120
 My fellow sisters, please stick to our plan. 

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,560
 If things go awry, quit fighting 

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,220
 and regroup with us immediately. 

40
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,660
 

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,485
Stay alert.

42
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,150
Master is training in solitude.

43
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,870
We have released Beguiling Mist in the palace.

44
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,700
So don't fall into a deep slumber

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,930
like those mortals did.

46
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,400
Those three scoundrels.

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
Who do they think they are?

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,690
How dare they put me on watch duty?

49
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,250
The enemies will fall for our traps, they said.

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,740
It's just an excuse to shirk.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,900
Once Master comes out, I'll report them to him.

52
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,150
What is this new gadget?

53
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,520
It's quite useful.

54
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,120
I assembled it myself.

55
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,580
It's more than enough to fight weaker cultivators.

56
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,760
I knew it. An ambush.

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,870
Kill the messengers first.

58
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,370
Don't alert others.

59
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,030
How annoying.

60
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,020
- Alert others.
- Yes!

61
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,040
 We have made ourselves known. 

62
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,920
 There's no use hiding. 

63
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,190
Chen Rong, Chen Mu,

64
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,070
please deal with those rookie cultivators.

65
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,160
My Seniors in arms, let's give chase
and kill this demon.

66
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,530
Sure.

67
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,850
A long fight is risky. Make it quick.

68
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,800
You three idiots!

69
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,090
Come out already!

70
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,120
Qing Wen, Tie Luo, you ingrates!

71
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,410
I won't spare you even when I'm dead!

72
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,440
How fun.

73
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,750
That beast is mine.

74
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,620
Don't get in my way.

75
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,740
I'm talking to you.

76
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,330
Go transform now.

77
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,930
I'll deal with them.

78
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,880
He's too strong. I can't defeat him.

79
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,200
Let's swap.

80
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,500
Come.

81
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,980
Today, I shall avenge my lost arm.

82
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,720
I can handle this.

83
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,440
Stop him from transforming.

84
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,810
All right.

85
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,930
Meng, watch out!

86
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,750
Bladestorm?

87
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,330
As expected of you, Jing.

88
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,570
Let me aid you.

89
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,030
Regenerate if you want.

90
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,810
I'll just chop it off again.

91
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,790
 Good. 

92
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,550
 Rage on. 

93
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,670
 The transformation brings out
]your animalistic instincts. 

94
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,687
 If he loses his humanity, he'll be dead soon. 

95
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,467
 Where are the two other Blood Guards? 

96
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,500
Watch out!

97
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,360
Senior Song. Take care of the meathead.

98
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,510
Sure.

99
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,810
Chen Rong.

100
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,080
This is bad.

101
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,550
It is a very potent corpse venom.

102
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,930
Here.

103
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,120
I can't believe we met again.

104
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,650
How have you been, Han?

105
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,146
I see you used the Ascension Token
to enroll in Yellow Maple Valley.

106
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:31,146
And you have reached mid-Foundation Establishment.

107
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,860
You lured rogue cultivators
to join you at Tainan Bazaar.

108
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,890
Thanks to you, Wu Jiu Zhi has turned to this.

109
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,360
Fate keeps me alive so that I can kill you.

110
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,550
Enough.

111
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,150
For what you did to Wan Xiao Shan,

112
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,450
we'll settle the score today.

113
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,530
Go support Senior Liu.

114
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,570
Take care.

115
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,510
Like I said, you are mine.

116
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,290
You're different from others.

117
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,650
You fight like a martial artist.

118
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,720
You are smart.

119
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,440
I hail from the Song Clan of Hanzhou.

120
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,870
We are a martial arts clan.

121
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,380
Perhaps you were also a martial artist?

122
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,790
Cultivators like you
claim to stay away from the mortal affairs.

123
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,030
Yet the endless war in our world

124
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,550
is all orchestrated by the cultivation sects.

125
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,960
You claim to maintain peace.

126
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,150
But in the end, the mortals pay with their lives.

127
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,030
You're neither a human nor a demon.

128
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,360
You don't have the right to speak
such insolent words on behalf of all mortals.

129
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,260
Scums from the Seven Sects, die!

130
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,320
The art of spear
is about blocking, lifting, stabbing,

131
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,020
parrying, striking, sweeping,

132
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,750
and thrusting.

133
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,160
The same goes for the art of sword.

134
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,720
The longer the weapon, the stronger it is.

135
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,830
Your reckless fighting technique
does no justice to your monstrous strength.

136
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,400
What a waste.

137
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,050
You talk so much.

138
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,530
We did it.

139
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,130
Careful!

140
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,700
Chen Mu!

141
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,960
Chen Mu.

142
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,720
Chen Mu.

143
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,330
I'm sorry.

144
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,250
You must taste good too.

145
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,660
Chen Mu.

146
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,960
Chen Mu.

147
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,440
Chen Mu.

148
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,810
Chen Mu.

149
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,720
One less useless ally for you.

150
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,590
Han, make it quick.

151
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,180
I need your support.

152
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,850
This is Ping Gu's belonging.

153
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,420
Drop dead.

154
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,500
I will crush you with my bare hands!

155
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,750
 Using his blood essence
to activate his life-bound treasure? 

156
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,980
 Senior Liu is going all out. 

157
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,960
You are quite durable.

158
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,240
Tell me. What is your name?

159
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,640
If I'm in a good mood,
I'll erect a tombstone for you.

160
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,830
I am Tie Luo, General of Lanzhou Cavalry.

161
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,570
I'll also be the man who takes your life.

162
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,700
Stop hiding any tricks.

163
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,440
Our foe is strong.

164
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,880
The ice demon is dead.

165
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,583
Transform now and fight them with me!

166
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,700
 ♫ Chasing wind ♫ 

167
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,980
 ♫ I set out afar ♫ 

168
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,020
 ♫ The road ahead lost ♫ 

169
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,620
 ♫ My voice unheard ♫ 

170
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,540
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

171
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,620
 ♫ Laying low ♫ 

172
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,960
 ♫ I plan every move... ♫ 

173
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,980
What a hassle.

174
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,420
 ♫ And lingering ties ♫ 

175
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,850
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

176
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,426
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

177
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:03,020
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

178
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:08,340
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

179
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:13,500
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

180
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:18,826
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life... ♫ 

181
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:20,374
Thank you, my fellow juniors.

182
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:21,954
You may back down.

183
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:27,260
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

184
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,060
 ♫ Kind at heart ♫ 

185
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,780
 ♫ Ruthless when I must be ♫ 

186
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,060
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

187
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,220
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

188
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,420
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

189
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,100
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined... ♫ 

190
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,790
You evil beings.

191
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,340
Be cleansed!

192
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,380
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

193
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:58,460
 ♫ Drunken steps, high song
over ocean and mountaintop ♫ 

194
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,620
 ♫ The celestial gourd bears dew,
the Golden Core takes shape ♫ 

195
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,365
 ♫ Deep in the night, the crane
soars through autumn's clear sky ♫ 

196
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:10,070
 ♫ Across endless western winds
cuts a lone sword, cold and true ♫ 

197
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,790
 ♫ A lone sword, cold and true ♫ 

198
00:25:14,617 --> 00:25:17,480
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life... ♫ 

199
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,400
No, wait. I'm almost done.

200
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,700
I'm almost done!

201
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,780
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

202
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,460
 ♫ Kind at heart ♫ 

203
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,220
 ♫ Ruthless when I must be ♫ 

204
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,420
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

205
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,740
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

206
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,820
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

207
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,580
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

208
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:43,454
 ♫ Forged by trial ♫ 

209
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,695
 ♫ I rise through three realms ♫ 

210
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:49,855
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

211
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,530
They lost?

212
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,735
Good.

213
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:10,365
I don't have to intervene then.

214
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,310
Villain.

215
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,180
You cannot leave.

216
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,880
What joy is there in life?

217
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,070
What suffering is there in death?

218
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,460
You cannot leave...

219
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,312
 It defeated a mid-Foundation Establishment
demon in one blow. 

220
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,713
 As expected of a life-bound treasure. 

221
00:26:45,713 --> 00:26:48,794
 However, it also burned
the mystic pouch to a crisp. 

222
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:50,334
 What a waste. 

223
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,680
Han.

224
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,700
I consider this match a draw.

225
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,780
Well done, Jing!

226
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,660
We've killed them all.

227
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,750
You would sacrifice
your life-bound treasure to kill demons.

228
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,130
How admirable.

229
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,550
You flatter me, Han.

230
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,700
Don't tell Wei Niang about today.

231
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,980
I don't want her to worry.

232
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,370
Chen Mu.

233
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,510
I didn't mean to kill you.

234
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,810
How am I supposed to face others now?

235
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,370
What am I supposed to do now?

236
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,160
Their leader still lives.

237
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,763
No one knows if the worst will come.

238
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:04,663
We can't leave him here.

239
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,270
Chen Mu.

240
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,740
Forgive me.

241
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,330
Forgive me. Chen Mu.

242
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,270
Senior Liu.

243
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,590
Senior Song.

244
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,110
Senior Han.

245
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:49,880
I'll tell Qiao Qian about Chen Mu myself.

246
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,000
Don't tell her for now.

247
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,700
I don't want her to be distraught.

248
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,200
Of course.

249
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,940
My condolences.

250
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,850
Chen Mu, let's go home.

251
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,810
Let's go inside.

252
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,610
 Something is amiss. 

253
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,050
This might be their hideout.

254
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,020
Over here.

255
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,571
Murong Qing.

256
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,916
- Zheng Tian Nan.
- Zhou Yan.

257
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,200
Chu Shan Ming.

258
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,270
Zhang Wei.

259
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,920
- Feng Wan Er.
- An Ke Qiao.

260
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Zhang Shui Sheng.

261
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,960
Murong Chu.

262
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,800
These should be the
names of the victims.

263
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,880
Meng Yuan.

264
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,490
Murong Zhu.

265
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,210
Shen Qian Xun.

266
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,900
A blood pool?

267
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,860
Jing.

268
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,430
Jing.

269
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,810
Are you all right?

270
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,810
Did you have a flashback?

271
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,560
We can kill all dark cultivators
and demonic sects.

272
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,920
There will always be new ones.

273
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,900
They can't be purged.

274
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,920
You are too critical of yourself.

275
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,990
It's all in the past.

276
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:07,420
We're no longer the trembling kids in the dungeon.

277
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,160
We gained spirit roots

278
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,140
and became Foundation Establishment cultivators.

279
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,470
It's been so many years.

280
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,750
You are still my senior.

281
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,250
I'm still not as capable as you.

282
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,080
Your potential is far superior to mine.

283
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,030
But you've been suppressing yourself.

284
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,750
You ascend every time after I do

285
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,670
so that I don't feel inferior.

286
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,900
Right?

287
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,050
Just because you don't say it out
doesn't mean I wouldn't know.

288
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:47,000
Come on. That's not true.

289
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,510
When it comes to cultivation,

290
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,500
there's no waiting for anyone else.

291
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,660
Also, I'm not as thoughtful as you imagine.

292
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,200
No need to comfort me.

293
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,920
The experiment
those dark cultivators put me through

294
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,500
has damaged my constitution.

295
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,780
I might never reach the Core Formation Stage ever.

296
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,550
Wei Niang and you have great potential.

297
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,180
Don't squander your talent away.

298
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,485
You always make things up.

299
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:26,955
This is not fun.

300
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,030
I'll check on Han.

301
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,180
Thank you so much for what you've done, Song Meng.

302
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,510
 What is going on? 

303
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,890
 There is no exit. 

304
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,400
- Jing!
- Wei Niang.

305
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,740
- Wei Niang?
- Qiao Qian.

306
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:54,640
How did you find this place?

307
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,200
We chanced upon a contraption.

308
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,727
Then, we ran into the emperor

309
00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:00,795
and took the secret passage here.

310
00:35:00,795 --> 00:35:03,710
The Black Fiend Cult sure has done many things.

311
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,420
 
It digs deep.

312
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:10,000
Greetings, fellow cultivators.

313
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,590
Thank you for rescuing me.

314
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,070
You're welcome.

315
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,780
It is our duty to kill dark cultivators.

316
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,160
There is a soporific array here.

317
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,720
All mortals will fall asleep.

318
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,835
How do you stay awake?

319
00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:26,615
And did you run into any pursuers?

320
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:31,920
Master, I have no idea at all.

321
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,720
I stumbled upon these two cultivators

322
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,270
and they woke me up.

323
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,350
They even gave me a pill.

324
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:45,479
Master, all my consorts and ministers...

325
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:49,739
Are they all dead?

326
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,880
Han, I did give him a sobering pill.

327
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,810
And we truly did not run into pursuers here.

328
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,110
Han, the enemies still roam about.

329
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,320
Let's find more clues now.

330
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,670
Any delay will bring more variables.

331
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,400
Come with us.

332
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,290
We can protect you.

333
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,320
Thank you.

334
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,829
Wei Niang, please look after him with Qiao Qian.

335
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:22,280
Don't worry about it, Jing.

336
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,660
Let's go.

337
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,930
Seniors.

338
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,260
There might be traps.

339
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,850
What is this place?

340
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,110
What is this place?

341
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,220
I've never been here either.

342
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,970
Apologies for the lack of reception,
my esteemed guests.

343
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,010
But since you're here, there's no need to leave.

344
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,440
 Late Foundation Stage. 

345
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,178
 He is the leader of Black Field Cult. 

346
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:09,998
Evil cultist.

347
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,100
Chen Rong!

348
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,670
 Why did he attack the weakest Chen Rong first? 

349
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,955
Time to return them to their rightful owner.

350
00:39:46,955 --> 00:39:49,156
 Are they the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills? 

351
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:50,856
 How come there are only four? 

352
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,100
You shall not leave!

353
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,810
Come.

354
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,260
Where did he go?

355
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,896
 He is a Late Foundation Stage cultivator. 

356
00:40:36,896 --> 00:40:39,597
 Why did he attack ruthlessly 

357
00:40:39,597 --> 00:40:42,670
 as if he doesn't care about his life? 

358
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:47,005
 Unless there's something wrong
with the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills? 

359
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,882
 Thank you. 

360
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:59,883
 You brought me the Blood
Condensing Five-Element Pills. 

361
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:03,663
 Everything is now in order. 

362
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,760
 One, two, three, four. 

363
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,800
 Who is the last Blood
Condensing Five-Element Pill? 

364
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,360
 Tie Luo is metal. 

365
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,920
 Qing Wen is wood. 

366
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,960
 The ice demon is water. 

367
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,280
 Wu Jiu Zhi is earth. 

368
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,670
 He must be fire then. 

369
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,920
 Oh, no. 

370
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,960
 He is not the leader of the Black Fiend Cult, 

371
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,230
 but the last Blood Guard. 

372
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:29,220
 Where is the real leader then? 

373
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,880
Jing! Jing!

374
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,180
Wei Niang.

375
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,590
- Do not move.
- Wei Niang.

376
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,930
Or he will die.

377
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,150
Jing.

378
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,920
I'm sorry.

379
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,400
You have to show your face today.

380
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,285
Don't worry, my dear brother.

381
00:42:10,285 --> 00:42:12,815
What's yours is mine.

382
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,738
Villains, quit pretending.

383
00:42:18,738 --> 00:42:20,049
You sicken me!

384
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:22,341
Jing, stop speaking.

385
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:24,092
Use your power to heal yourself now.

386
00:42:24,092 --> 00:42:26,122
You're right.

387
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,800
He's about to die.

388
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,060
Surrender yourself.

389
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,290
Wei Niang.

390
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,700
Jing!

391
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:14,629
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

392
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:20,540
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

393
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,980
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

394
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,505
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

395
00:43:26,505 --> 00:43:29,866
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

396
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:34,592
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

397
00:43:34,592 --> 00:43:41,146
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

398
00:43:41,146 --> 00:43:47,027
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

399
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:50,604
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

400
00:43:50,604 --> 00:43:53,059
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

401
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:56,180
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

402
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,536
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

403
00:44:00,536 --> 00:44:03,657
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

404
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:06,268
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

405
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,180
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

406
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,260
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

407
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,540
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

408
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,692
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

409
00:44:19,692 --> 00:44:22,933
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

410
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:27,151
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

411
00:44:27,151 --> 00:44:30,558
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

412
00:44:30,558 --> 00:44:32,660
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

413
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,780
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

414
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:40,137
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

415
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:43,885
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

416
00:44:43,885 --> 00:44:50,020
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

417
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:57,140
 ♫ In a fleeting moment we call eternity ♫ 

418
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:04,640
 ♫ In a fleeting moment called eternity ♫
