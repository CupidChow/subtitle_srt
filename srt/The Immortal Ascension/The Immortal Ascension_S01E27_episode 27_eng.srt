1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,480
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,120
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,545
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:36,160
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,920
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,991
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:46,520
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,992
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:56,167
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,273
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:05,487
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,272
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:13,984
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,920
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,160
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,120
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,034
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,960
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,690
Elder Han.

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,860
To Li Hua Yuan of Yellow Maple Valley.

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,100
Halt.

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,160
- Elder Han.
- Where are you going?

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,600
I received a missive addressed to Mentor Li

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,960
from a cultivator in Yellow Maple Valley.

30
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm on my way to deliver it.

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,920
Imbecile! You're abandoning your post.

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,520
If the demonic sects invade now,

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,280
they'll have an open door.

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,240
Can no one else do it?

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,750
Elder Han, everyone else
is preparing for the battle.

36
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,250
No one is available.

37
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,890
Ridiculous.

38
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,670
Forget it.

39
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,000
I need to see Hua Yuan
to discuss something anyway.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,350
Give me the missive. I'll pass it to him.

41
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,840
I... Elder Han,

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,640
this is addressed
to Mentor Li of Yellow Maple Valley.

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,790
I fear this is not right.

44
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,040
Are disciples of the Clear Void Sect
as impertinent as you are?

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,430
Should I escalate this to Fu Yun Zi?

46
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,840
Please don't.

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,070
Forgive me.

48
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,260
I appreciate your help, Elder Han.

49
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,560
Everyone has a job to complete.

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,120
If there is a lack of manpower,

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,280
I can ask Spirit Beast Mountain

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
to handle the internal communication.

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,350
Don't worry about it.

54
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,090
- Go now.
- Yes.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,970
He sure is cautious.

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,571
Congratulations, Grandmaster.

57
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:45,000
Spirit Beast Mountain sent news

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,606
about when the Seven Sects are going to attack.

59
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:51,506
They plan to siege us when we least expect it.

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,280
We have let them live for long enough.

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,690
Now is the time to see who is the victor.

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,460
Wise choice, Grandmaster.

63
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,840
Master, I'm done packing.

64
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,740
We should go now.

65
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,930
Sure.

66
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,740
Xiao Cui Er!

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,544
Han Li, you're back.

68
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:25,150
Don't be rude.

69
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,840
He's Mentor Han now.

70
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,810
It was a force of habit.

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,020
Mentor Han.

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,690
You're taller now.

73
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,620
Here. Take this.

74
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,560
This is a pill
to strengthen your base in the Qi Refining Stage.

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,900
Consider it a gift for you.

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,080
Thank you, Mentor Han.

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,620
I Won't let you down.

78
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,710
All you do is talk to the girl.

79
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,690
You never come to visit me.

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,740
Mentor Ma.

81
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,930
Who is that?

82
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,910
You, Mentor Ma.

83
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,030
Who is Mentor Ma?

84
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,560
Senior Ma.

85
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Mentor Ma.

86
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,620
I'll do as you say. All right?

87
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,340
It's been a while.

88
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,570
You brat.

89
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,080
I see you still know your way here,

90
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,800
and still remember me.

91
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,240
Stop teasing me.

92
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,630
When I first came here, you took me in

93
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,960
and gave me pills.

94
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,370
I'm forever grateful for that.

95
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,370
Good. Come.

96
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,250
All right.

97
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,720
Go inside and pack everything.

98
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,600
I need to speak with him.

99
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,730
Yes.

100
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,270
You brat.

101
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,430
Don't hit on my disciple now.

102
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,410
It seems like you quite like the disciple
I found you.

103
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,430
She's decent.

104
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,680
Talented but easily distracted.

105
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,970
It's fine. I can take my time to teach her.

106
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:31,410
Senior Ma, will you be gone for a long time?

107
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,680
We need to leave for a while.

108
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,070
There's something wrong with our sect.

109
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,950
I plan to go into hiding.

110
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,460
How so?

111
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:52,000
In the past two months, many people
from Baiji Hall came

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,240
and bought all kinds of aged herbs .

113
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,360
It's not just the hundred-year spirit herb.

114
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,720
Even the decade-old ones are gone.

115
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,600
What is happening?

116
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,580
Is the front line in a dire situation?

117
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,680
I just returned from the Imperial Capital.

118
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,850
I'm not up to date regarding the front line.

119
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,190
I tended this garden for many years.

120
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,950
Every plant here contains our hard work.

121
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,800
I'd rather leave than watch them
squeeze this land dry.

122
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,390
Out of sight, out of mind.

123
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,510
You are smart.

124
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,600
This war seems pointless.

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,600
It's always about land or resource disputes.

126
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,870
It's been going on for so long.

127
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,480
Yet those cultivators in the Nascent Soul Stage
do not care.

128
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,950
And cultivators like us pay with our lives.

129
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,720
Listen to me.

130
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,510
If it becomes too much for you,
find an exit strategy.

131
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,970
Your life is always more important.

132
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,870
Thank you for the advice, Senior Ma.

133
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,720
I appreciate it.

134
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm old.

135
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,480
I nag a lot.

136
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Han, you are a lucky man.

137
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,040
Perhaps you don't need my advice.

138
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,870
But I do not know when we'll meet again
after this departure.

139
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,800
I didn't let them have certain herbs.

140
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,390
We put in a lot of effort to grow these herbs.

141
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,610
You know what? If you have use for them, use them.

142
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,390
Han.

143
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,290
Take care.

144
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,070
Remember.

145
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,160
Don't die before me.

146
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,380
I won't die so soon.

147
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,950
Master.

148
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,460
Come.

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,130
 Who knows if I'll see Mentor Ma again? 

150
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,819
 Has the situation at the front line
grown this dire? 

151
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:09,080
 If the Seven Sects are defeated, 

152
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,080
 will there still be a peaceful place
for people to cultivate? 

153
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:39,080
 ♫ That day I first saw you ♫ 

154
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,000
 ♫ We held close, hearts full of joy ♫ 

155
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,075
 ♫ We made a promise to reunite ♫ 

156
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:52,184
 ♫ And walked into the unknown... ♫ 

157
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:54,220
He always has an issue.

158
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,900
Hua Yuan, I've been having a bad feeling.

159
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,800
Something bad is about to happen.

160
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,200
Don't worry, Hong Fu.

161
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,181
The Seven Sects are going all out.

162
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:07,252
I estimate a 50% chance of winning, at least.

163
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:08,393
You know what?

164
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:09,854
Why don't you observe from the side?

165
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:13,237
My disciples and I will attack them first.

166
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,258
- Let's go.
- Yes.

167
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:21,605
 ♫ To be one standing tall and proud ♫ 

168
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:25,760
 ♫ Never become a hollow shell ♫ 

169
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,960
 ♫ The ones before once told me ♫ 

170
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,120
 ♫ There's still hardship ahead ♫ 

171
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,610
 ♫ Even as cold winds blow... ♫ 

172
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,680
Master.

173
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,340
Song Meng, Wei Niang.

174
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,450
You are the only ones left.

175
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,920
 ♫ Time slipped by before we knew ♫ 

176
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,360
 ♫ Yet we burn that spark of light... ♫ 

177
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,884
My fellow disciples of Yellow Maple Valley!

178
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:00,125
Yes, Master!

179
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,646
Yes, Master!

180
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:02,705
Yes, Master!

181
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:06,760
 ♫ While the mayfly dies in the whirlpool ♫ 

182
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,920
 ♫ Fate raises a toast with song ♫ 

183
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,490
 ♫ Playing the fleeting game of life... ♫ 

184
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,270
Lead the war with me.

185
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,275
Yes, Master!

186
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:19,321
Yes, Master!

187
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:22,511
 ♫ Who can guess the ending... ♫ 

188
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:23,560
Charge!

189
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,600
 ♫ But my heart has never rested ♫ 

190
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,680
 ♫ Ever chasing, still searching on ♫ 

191
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,600
 ♫ Through all the joy and sorrow ♫ 

192
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,549
 ♫ How do I choose the way? ♫ 

193
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,280
 It's time to get ready for the war. 

194
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,175
 If I leave, who knows when
I can come back again? 

195
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:54,420
 Alas, I can't bring this cavern
and the spirit spring with me. 

196
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:58,520
These are all the herbs required
for the Core Formation Stage.

197
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,280
I planted them painstakingly.

198
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,060
None can go to waste.

199
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,092
81 tolls of the Dragonfell Bell?

200
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:09,632
Our sect has fallen.

201
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:14,270
Did something happen at the front line?

202
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,610
81 tolls of Dragonfell Bell.

203
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,420
I suppose you know what this means.

204
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,540
That's right.

205
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,090
Several hours ago,

206
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,920
Spirit Beast Mountain and Skyfort Castle
turned against us.

207
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,880
The alliance collapsed.

208
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,720
More than half of the Foundation
Establishment cultivators are gone.

209
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,805
- What in the world?
- Yellow Maple Valley...

210
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:45,330
- What do we do?
- We've been... Defeated.

211
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,660
The demonic sects continue to advance.

212
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,400
They will break through
the last line of defense soon.

213
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,560
The last line of defense?

214
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,670
Spirit Beast Mountain and Skyfort Castle...

215
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,450
- How could this be?
- Turned against us?

216
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,400
- They defected?
- They are scoundrels!

217
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,800
 What happened to Master and the rest? 

218
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,850
We're done for!

219
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,060
- We're done for!
- Silence!

220
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,190
We're done for!

221
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,800
-  Those despicable scums. 
- We're done for!

222
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,150
-  But I did warn them. 
- Silence!

223
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,280
 But he never believed me. 

224
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,850
Silence.

225
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,940
- We're done for.
- Silence!

226
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,330
Listen to me.

227
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,010
While our existence is indeed in a crisis,

228
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,880
it is not the moment to give up hope.

229
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,850
Although the Core Formation
Stage elders are not here,

230
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,630
we can beseech Grand Elder to intervene.

231
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,800
Please help us turn the tide, Grandmaster!

232
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,450
Please help us turn the tide, Grand Elder!

233
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,850
Please help us turn the tide, Grand Elder!

234
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,920
Please help us turn the tide, Grand Elder!

235
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,880
Please help us turn the tide, Grand Elder!

236
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,130
Please help us turn the tide, Grand Elder!

237
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,520
 This is futile. 

238
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,400
 If those Nascent Soul elders
were willing to intervene, 

239
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,080
 the war would have ended already. 

240
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,562
 Why intervene now then? 

241
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:09,683
 In this time of need,
relying on yourself is better 

242
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:12,200
 than relying on others. 

243
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,400
Please help us turn the tide, Grand Elder!

244
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,160
Please help us turn the tide, Grand Elder!

245
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,580
Please help us turn the tide, Grand Elder!

246
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,110
 What is going on? 

247
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,050
Did you ever study some kind of soul technique?

248
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,030
Grandmaster, I did study
one particular soul technique.

249
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,280
 

250
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,126
Interesting.

251
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:49,730
Your foundation is solid.

252
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,490
You have the right mindset too.

253
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,880
Unfortunately, your spirit root is too weak.

254
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,010
 So this is the power
of a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator? 

255
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,850
 If I hadn't studied Great Deployment Art
to reinforce my soul, 

256
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,230
 I wouldn't even have been able to reply to him. 

257
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,460
I hate to see people on their knees.

258
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,630
Everyone, get up now.

259
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:25,210
Please help us turn the tide, Grand Elder!

260
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,790
Didn't I say that I hated to see people
on their knees?

261
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,060
Get up now!

262
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:40,270
Did you think that I'll say yes if you kneel?

263
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,300
As cultivators,

264
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,870
how could you forget about
the importance of easement?

265
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:59,090
As you can already see,
our sect is probably no more.

266
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,520
So disperse now.

267
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,870
Don't bother me and my cultivation.

268
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,210
Grandmaster, forgive our incompetence.

269
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,730
We deserve to be punished.

270
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,330
But our sect has centuries of legacy.

271
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,970
It can't go down now.

272
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,165
Please have mercy and kill those demonic sects.

273
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,395
Save us from the impending doom!

274
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,292
- Sect Master!
- Sect Master!

275
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,700
You idiot.

276
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,680
What makes you think that

277
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,010
I'll risk my life for useless beings
like all of you here?

278
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,970
All I want is peace.

279
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,840
All of you are weak,

280
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,360
yet you want me
to fight those powerful monsters for you.

281
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,400
I can do that.

282
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,130
But I... I'm not strong enough.

283
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,008
A battle between Nascent Soul
Stage cultivators will be a grueling one.

284
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,600
People will die.

285
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,900
Die!

286
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:01,661
Grandmaster.

287
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:04,250
Grandmaster!

288
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,150
You want me

289
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,540
to die for you?

290
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,961
Why? Because you performed a kowtow

291
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:17,621
and called me a grand elder?

292
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,400
How absurd!

293
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,390
Absurd!

294
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,800
- We're all alone.
- Grandmaster left us.

295
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,490
- What do we do?
- He left us.

296
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,850
What do we do?

297
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,980
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

298
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,160
It's over for our sect.

299
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,150
- What do we do?
- Grandmaster.

300
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,561
 Those Nascent Soul Stage cultivators 

301
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:44,512
 stay out of the war and
leave weak disciples to die. 

302
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:46,034
 How dare they? 

303
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,604
What do we do?

304
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,010
Sect Master.

305
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,450
- Sect Master.
- Grandmaster does not care about us.

306
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,835
What do we do?

307
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:56,135
Everyone.

308
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,900
Do not panic.

309
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,790
We still have the Mountain Barrier.

310
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,360
If we work together, we can defend this place.

311
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,250
I swear to live and die with this place.

312
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,520
He's right.

313
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,840
We have the Mountain Barrier.

314
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,410
We fear nothing. We live or die with this sect!

315
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:22,080
 At this juncture, speeches that
raise morale serve no purpose. 

316
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,040
 I must find a way to deal
with the upcoming invasion. 

317
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,960
 Look at those fools. 

318
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,010
 If you hear this message and want to live, 

319
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,210
 come to Qianji Hall after 15 minutes. 

320
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,300
 Do not be late. 

321
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:45,800
 Am I chosen? 

322
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,710
 Is there another plan? 

323
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,250
Wei Niang.

324
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,300
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

325
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,101
Oh, the infamous Hong Fen and Skull.

326
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:17,881
You are knowledgeable.

327
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,280
Elder Han, you betrayed the Seven Sects

328
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,560
and turned on us.

329
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,650
You have killed many people.

330
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,170
My gullible juniors,

331
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,080
since your master and I are good friends,

332
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,040
I'll give you a second chance.

333
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,230
Join us now.

334
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,532
Elder Han, while I may be weak,

335
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:48,900
I am not a traitor.

336
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,040
I am Song Meng of Qingbo Cavern,
Yellow Maple Valley,

337
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,080
the fourth disciple of Li Hua Yuan.

338
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,950
Take my life if you can.

339
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:08,560
Song Meng. Song Meng.

340
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,170
Song Meng.

341
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,450
Song Meng.

342
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,900
Song Meng.

343
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,140
Song Meng.

344
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,040
Wei Niang.

345
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,210
Why are you still here?

346
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,800
Jing is gone.

347
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,920
If you're gone too,

348
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,190
there's no reason for me to live in this world.

349
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:31,520
Darling, I love to see this kind of story.

350
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,250
Those Seven Sects are weak.

351
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,080
But seeing these star-crossed lovers

352
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,800
navigating through the turmoil of war

353
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,890
can be so addictive.

354
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,840
I'm glad you like it.

355
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,760
But our priority targets still roam.

356
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,840
We cannot dally.

357
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,750
Let's end them now.

358
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,320
I am Zhong Wei Niang

359
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,800
of Qingbo Cavern, Yellow Maple Valley,

360
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,320
the seventh disciple of Li Hua Yuan.

361
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,710
Take my life if you can.

362
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,880
Insolence.

363
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,010
I shall grant you your wish and take your life.

364
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,300
Don't bully them now.

365
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,820
I made it in time.

366
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,840
Zhong, Song. Your job is done.

367
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,250
Go back and rest up.

368
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,120
Oh. Tell your master that he owes me one.

369
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,430
Farewell.

370
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,040
Han and the perverted couple there,

371
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,730
the three of you ganged up on those two disciples.

372
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,540
Have you no shame?

373
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,085
Fu Yun Zi.

374
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:10,286
Your legs are trembling.

375
00:23:10,286 --> 00:23:12,807
You look like you're dying.

376
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:16,088
One small mistake
and you might lose your life here.

377
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:20,410
Why don't you join me to do great things together?

378
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,800
In your dreams.

379
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,320
Darling.

380
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,840
I don't like that old guy.

381
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,120
He ruined my show.

382
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,723
Kill him for me.

383
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:32,800
Kill him.

384
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,800
Fu Yun Zi, you made my wife angry.

385
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,430
You'll have to pay the price today.

386
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,012
My friends, let's see

387
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:54,670
if you have the ability to kill me or not.

388
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,860
Go away!

389
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,750
You have quick reflexes.

390
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,860
Master.

391
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,360
It's been a while. Did you ascend again?

392
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,730
Thanks to your teachings.

393
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,210
Master, are you all right?

394
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm fine.

395
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,840
Were you hoping for something to happen to me?

396
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,880
Of course, not.

397
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,280
I know... - Mentor Li.
- You are strong.

398
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,450
You will surely be safe.

399
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,710
Mentor Li.

400
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,490
Master.

401
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,600
Mentor Li.

402
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,730
Regarding the battle with the Black Fiend Cult,

403
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,320
I'm sorry.

404
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,210
Senior Wu and Senior Liu died because of me.

405
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,020
Please punish me.

406
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,750
- Mentor Li.
- It's fine.

407
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,450
Song Meng and Wei Niang
already told me everything.

408
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,320
Who would have thought that the cultists

409
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,900
had infiltrated the royalty this deeply?

410
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,640
And now that the demonic sects are invading,

411
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,320
we are indeed having trouble at two fronts.

412
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,120
Fortunately, you returned here safely.

413
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,510
I am glad.

414
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,532
Oh, I heard Senior Song
and Senior Zhong went to the front line.

415
00:25:42,532 --> 00:25:43,650
Yes, they did.

416
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,300
Where are they now?

417
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,320
We split up.

418
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,560
I thought they would return.

419
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,670
But I guess things
aren't doing that well for them.

420
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,790
Mentor Li.

421
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,690
Mentor Li.

422
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,360
Han Li, listen carefully.

423
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,272
The meeting later is crucial.

424
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:19,490
I begged for a while to reserve a spot for you.

425
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,580
Don't squander it.

426
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,250
What do we do?

427
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,140
What do we do?

428
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,180
It's over.

429
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,490
They are all
at least Mid Foundation Establishment.

430
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,540
It seems like all of the capable
fighters are gathered here.

431
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,060
Grandmaster.

432
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,950
Grandmaster.

433
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,750
Grandmaster Ling Hu.

434
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:16,927
Grandmaster.

435
00:27:25,085 --> 00:27:27,280
Good.

436
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,560
You're all here.

437
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:35,600
Then, I have no need to beat around the bush.

438
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,120
As you all already know,
the front line has crumbled.

439
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,730
The demonic sects are heading toward us.

440
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:53,030
They say to kill all who resist.

441
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,710
I fear all hope is lost.

442
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,790
Grandmaster, don't frighten the younglings.

443
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:14,320
My fellow disciples,
you play key roles in our sect.

444
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,360
The legacy of Yellow Maple Valley
falls on your shoulders.

445
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,000
The act Grandmaster put up earlier before the hall

446
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,170
was to make those cowards
escape as soon as possible.

447
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,340
That way, our evacuation plan
will proceed smoothly.

448
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,170
I see. Forgive us.

449
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,800
Where do we go from here?

450
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,710
Please instruct us.

451
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,820
I'll answer that on behalf of him.

452
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,560
Grand Elder had previously contacted our allies

453
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,360
in the Nine Kingdoms Alliance.

454
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,490
They promised to provide refuge.

455
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:55,860
And now, Mentor Li and I will evacuate
all of you in batches.

456
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:58,320
Oh, the Nine Kingdoms Alliance. Wonderful.

457
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,280
It's one of the strongest factions in Tiannan.

458
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,040
We are all saved!

459
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,210
There's nothing such as a free favor.

460
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,280
We seek refuge.

461
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,060
We have to do their bidding.

462
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,430
- We're saved.
- The Nine Kingdoms Alliance.

463
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,490
Soul-Burning Spell.

464
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,750
I believe you know what it does.

465
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:49,600
I also added a telepathic spell.

466
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,275
You may use your energy to communicate

467
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:58,165
within a radius of 100 li.

468
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,319
So long as the light still shines,

469
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,935
I will know where you are!

470
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,800
Do note that this journey as refugees

471
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,540
will not be as peaceful as the life you have here.

472
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,060
All of you, be cautious.

473
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,560
Thank you for your help, Grandmaster.

474
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,970
We will help each other

475
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,750
and not bring shame to our sect.

476
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,250
You bootlickers.

477
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,470
You are refugees now.
Quit worrying about shame and reputation.

478
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,600
Now, why are you standing there?

479
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,230
Waiting for food?

480
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,692
Get ready now.

481
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:52,970
We regroup at the great hall later.

482
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,670
Yes!

483
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,761
Don't tell anyone.

484
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:00,541
Yes.

485
00:31:02,878 --> 00:31:05,990
- Hurry up.
- Yes.

486
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,600
Master.

487
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,100
Go.

488
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,455
 I don't want to leave, 

489
00:31:24,455 --> 00:31:26,650
 but I can't stay here and face my fate either. 

490
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,030
 I should just get ready for all eventualities. 

491
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:58,419
 This isn't the place, it seems. 

492
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:01,280
 I need another place. 

493
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,300
 Truth be told, I quite like the maple trees here. 

494
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,450
Young Master,

495
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,510
we have now arrived at Yellow Maple Valley.

496
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,990
What is wrong with him this time?

497
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,890
I feel bad for the Seven Sects.

498
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,930
The Moonshadow Sect has shut its door to everyone.

499
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,600
The Clear Void Sect is almost annihilated.

500
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,410
Only three other sects
are still putting up resistance.

501
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,380
Success is not far from you, Young Master.

502
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,250
I know what's bothering you, Young Master.

503
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,320
It's a person.

504
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,620
Li Fei Yu.

505
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,890
It's not Li Fei Yu.

506
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,730
It's Han Li.

507
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,300
What?

508
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,970
 

509
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,360
Han Li?

510
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,010
List of Yellow Maple Valley Disciples.

511
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,520
This is a treasure. Where did you get it from?

512
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,140
Someone gave it to me.

513
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,190
His name is Han Li?

514
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,900
So I've been fooled by him all this time.

515
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,440
Tell them to invade Yellow Maple Valley.

516
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,780
Whoever captures Han Li alive

517
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,670
will be rewarded.

518
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,520
Invade Yellow Maple Valley.

519
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,620
Capture Han Li alive.

520
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,885
I don't want to leave either.

521
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:09,055
But now is not the moment to be sentimental.

522
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,280
 The demonic sects will arrive soon. 

523
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,860
 Please group up now. 

524
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:21,745
It's a great cavern.

525
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,365
I can't let others have it.

526
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:47,479
Who knows

527
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,380
when I'll return to this place again?

528
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,290
It will be a dangerous journey.

529
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,290
I can't bring you with me.

530
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,070
Let's bid farewell here.

531
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,460
All right. Don't do this.

532
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:19,839
If fate permits, we'll meet
in Yellow Maple Valley.

533
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,150
Greetings, Mentor Hong Fu.

534
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,720
He is my attendant.

535
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,890
He is strong too.

536
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,500
He won't be a dead weight.

537
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,040
Have you packed everything?

538
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,490
After we leave,

539
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,900
we won't come back for the foreseeable future.

540
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,330
I appreciate your concern, Mentor Hong Fu.

541
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,900
I've packed everything.

542
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,850
Where's Master?

543
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,550
He won't come with us?

544
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,930
Your master and Sect Master will evacuate

545
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,450
another batch of disciples
alongside Sect Master Zhong later.

546
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,190
Otherwise, a bigger party might draw attention.

547
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,940
Mentor Hong Fu.

548
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,270
Listen up.

549
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,640
It will be a dangerous trip.

550
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,770
We have to cut across
the demonic sects' territory.

551
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,760
If we come across enemies,
do not fight for too long.

552
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,761
Once you flee, locate us
with the Soul-Burning Spell

553
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:19,441
and regroup at the marked place.

554
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,011
Yes!

555
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,710
Let's go.

556
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,150
Han Li.

557
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,670
Mentor Hong Fu.

558
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,290
You must be disappointed in us.

559
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,080
Your master and I are here,

560
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,710
yet we can't save ourselves from the defeat.

561
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,120
Mentor Hong Fu,

562
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,290
in fact, I came across Spirit Beast Mountain's
plan to betray us in advance.

563
00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:00,790
I informed Sect Master Zhong
and even sent a missive to warn Master.

564
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,020
Oh?

565
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:10,670
Yet your master and I never received the missive
in our operation together.

566
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,980
No wonder.

567
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,630
Alas, there's no point in
dwelling in the past anymore.

568
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,925
You let go easily and are level-headed.

569
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:26,520
You stand out from the rest,

570
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,720
and I see why
your master paid you extra attention.

571
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:35,560
Even Grandmaster Ling Hu asked me to specifically
bring you with us.

572
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,110
I think he likes you.

573
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,600
You flatter me.

574
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,410
I can't believe I have earned his favor.

575
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,080
Xuan Er isn't as fortunate as you.

576
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,710
And now, I regret what I did very much.

577
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,640
Mentor Hong Fu,

578
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,330
the frontline has perhaps
fallen to the demonic sects.

579
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,230
If they are there, what is our plan?

580
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,490
This is called the Mist of Camouflage.

581
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,380
It'll help us.

582
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,150
Wait.

583
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,010
- Mentor Li.
- At ease.

584
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,010
Have you seen Mentor Hong Fu?

585
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,490
She...

586
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,770
Did you not receive the message
from Grandmaster Ling Hu?

587
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:59,330
He asked Mentor Hong Fu
to evacuate some disciples first.

588
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,590
We Will follow suit soon.

589
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,900
What's wrong?

590
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,040
Did he give that order?

591
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,370
Yes.

592
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,980
What's the matter?

593
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,560
I need to verify one thing.

594
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,420
Leave without me.

595
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,411
 What a coincidence. 

596
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:51,191
 I passed by here again. 

597
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,440
Careful.

598
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,490
Something feels wrong about this place.

599
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,945
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

600
00:45:35,945 --> 00:45:41,873
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

601
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:45,430
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

602
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,880
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

603
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,241
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

604
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:56,026
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

605
00:45:56,026 --> 00:46:02,306
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

606
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:08,400
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

607
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,960
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

608
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,360
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

609
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,600
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

610
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,920
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

611
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,151
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

612
00:46:25,151 --> 00:46:27,652
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

613
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:30,638
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

614
00:46:30,638 --> 00:46:34,720
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

615
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,160
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

616
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,120
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

617
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,361
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

618
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:48,520
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

619
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,880
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

620
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,440
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫

00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,160
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

622
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,508
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

623
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:05,304
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

624
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:11,400
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:25,733
 ♫ In a fleeting moment called eternity ♫
