1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,520
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,140
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,160
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,545
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:36,200
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,960
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,967
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:46,520
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,000
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,245
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:01,281
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:05,568
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,273
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:13,680
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,720
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,960
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,128
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,044
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:30,040
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,060
 

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:45,079
Don't kill me!

25
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,320
Don't kill me!

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,180
Senior, save me!

27
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:50,000
 This is quite a predicament. 

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,810
Senior!

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,540
Help won't come.

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,558
Another one with a death wish?

31
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,768
So, how do you two want to die?

32
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,490
I'll give you a hand!

33
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,910
What kind of artifact is that?

34
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,750
Want a duel with artifacts?

35
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,060
I've never lost one!

36
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,580
Die now!

37
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:32,410
 Who's attacking? Where are they? 

38
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,740
 Let me grab the loot first. 

39
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,860
It's Feng Yue! That lunatic from Skyfort Castle!

40
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,090
Since you know who I am,
why aren't you running yet?

41
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,870
Kid, I gave you a chance.

42
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,000
Why didn't you run?

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,120
Turning my back on the enemy means death.

44
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,250
If I ran, I'd be just like her.

45
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,090
Well, you're a fun one for once.

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,780
Then let me have some fun with you!

47
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,580
You really brought out
that crappy Primordial Pearl?

48
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,840
 You think that's all I've got? 

49
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,880
 Try this one. 

50
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,340
 See how it feels! 

51
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,510
 Not even ashes will remain. 

52
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,970
 Shame about that yellow umbrella though. 

53
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,260
 What's this? 

54
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,490
 Forget it. I'll take it for now
and study it later. 

55
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,800
 The boots are still intact! 

56
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,500
 They must be something valuable. 

57
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,460
 Better not stick around! 

58
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,070
Looks like Violet Monkey Blossoms!

59
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,410
They really are!

60
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,210
There's another one over there!

61
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,800
Hey, seniors, look!

62
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,650
Violet Monkey Blossoms, right here!

63
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,630
Saying hi to us?

64
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,500
Like we're old pals.

65
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,450
 This remote spot really was the right call. 

66
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,360
 The spirit herbs here may be young, 

67
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,220
 but no one's competing for them. 

68
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,030
 See? 

69
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,020
 It's aged enough now! 

70
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,132
 When I get back, I'll hand in a few 

71
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:06,910
 and keep the rest for myself. 

72
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,260
 Still, two days have flown by already. 

73
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,260
 Time to find those three herbs. 

74
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,410
 Violet Monkey Blossoms! 

75
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,500
Han Li?

76
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,450
Senior Chen?

77
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,740
You're hurt?

78
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,080
Why do you have the Qingjiao Banner?

79
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,960
That belongs to Lu Ming Yuan!

80
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,270
 Oh no. She saw it. 

81
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,630
It's a misunderstanding, Senior.

82
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,960
My artifact just looks a lot
like the Qingjiao Banner.

83
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,600
A misunderstanding?

84
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,390
No way.

85
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,000
You saved me that day, right?

86
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,600
But you took my Foundation Pill,

87
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,780
so now you don't dare admit it, right?

88
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,440
You're poisoned now.

89
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,600
You may start seeing weird visions.

90
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,080
I have an antidote.

91
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,670
Take it quickly.

92
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,860
Or else, you may not make it
out of the Trial Ground.

93
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,200
Once you're cured, if you still have questions,

94
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,100
I promise I'll answer them all.

95
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,980
This pill really does work.

96
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,840
So are you going to tell me now?

97
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,530
Even if you don't, I already know.

98
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,980
I... know too...

99
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,670
 I'm sorry. 

100
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,390
 This Oblivion Pill will help you
get some real rest. 

101
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,380
 I'll find you a safe spot. 

102
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,720
 
That's a huge piece of Jade Marrow Mushroom.

103
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,670
No way it won't draw much attention!

104
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,270
Keep your voice down.

105
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,220
Don't let anyone hear us.

106
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,750
 These two are really going all in, 

107
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,450
 even using Jade Marrow Mushroom as bait. 

108
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,440
I'm tired. I'll rest for a bit.

109
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Keep watch, will you?

110
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,740
Don't worry.

111
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,080
Senior!

112
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,780
- What is wrong?
- The... The Mushroom!

113
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,200
Where's my Mushroom?

114
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,320
It's gone in a blink!

115
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,900
Who took it?

116
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,650
After them!

117
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,330
Li!

118
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,450
Who's there? Who's hiding over there?

119
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,440
I saw him jump in there!

120
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,650
Yu!

121
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,030
Qi!

122
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,270
Where is he?

123
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,240
I saw him run this way!

124
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,980
How'd he just vanish?

125
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Weird. Where could he have gone?

126
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,270
There's a path that way.
Come on, let's check it out.

127
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,450
Yeah.

128
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,150
This high-grade stealth artifact is amazing.

129
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,510
Miss Han, thank you.

130
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,220
What are you doing here?

131
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,630
It's my fault. I was useless.

132
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,320
Right after I entered the Trial Ground,

133
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,140
my mystic pouch and map got stolen.

134
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,900
I didn't know what to do, so I just found a place
to hide for now.

135
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,270
This pill should help restore your strength.

136
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,328
Here, take it.

137
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:02,108
Thank you, Li.

138
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,910
Honestly, when I first got here,

139
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,150
I was scared out of my mind.

140
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,480
But if I can't find Solarflame Blossom,

141
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,530
my brother's illness...

142
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,440
I really don't know what else to do.

143
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,550
Aren't those two your sect mates?

144
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,860
No, I don't know them.

145
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,860
You don't?

146
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,030
Didn't you all come in together?

147
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,900
I never saw them
when I was at Spirit Beast Mountain.

148
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,510
Li, don't worry about me.

149
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,120
With this stealth artifact,

150
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,630
I can definitely make it to the fifth day.

151
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,480
Go find what you came here for.

152
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,260
There's not much time.

153
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,530
You're looking for Solarflame Blossom?

154
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,960
Yeah.

155
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,960
That is the whole reason I came here.

156
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,650
I'll take you.

157
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,440
That's great!

158
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,870
Thanks, Li!

159
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,220
Don't mention it. It's on my way anyway.

160
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,150
Where can we find Solarflame Blossom?

161
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,150
It's not marked on my map at all.

162
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,910
But they say most spirit herbs in the Trial Ground

163
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,080
can be found near the central ring of mountains.

164
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,620
It shouldn't be a problem.

165
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,650
Something's off with that sound. Cover your ears!

166
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,380
Run!

167
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,650
Jump!

168
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,440
Li, that flying python looks strange.

169
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,110
It doesn't seem like a spirit beast here.

170
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,045
You're right. That whistle earlier
must've come from its master.

171
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:56,955
He's hiding somewhere.

172
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,348
As far as I know, in all of Spirit Beast Mountain,

173
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,480
only one senior raises that kind of beast.

174
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,440
His name's Zhong Wu.

175
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,510
Zhong Wu?

176
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,070
If he finds out we killed his flying python,

177
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,240
he won't let us off easy.

178
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,358
Maybe... We should
just go around instead?

179
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,530
We're short on time.

180
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,440
You two have got some guts.

181
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,350
You killed my spirit python

182
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,850
and still dared to show up here?

183
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,790
Senior Zhong, please let us pass.

184
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,200
We won't take a single herb from here.

185
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,110
It's all yours!

186
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,160
Spare me the sweet talk.

187
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,640
If you've got guts, come here.

188
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,660
Let's have a little duel.

189
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,220
Wait a second!

190
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,370
Are those shoes Cloud-Riding Boots?

191
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,310
Yeah.

192
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,560
Aren't those Feng Yue's?

193
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,590
Did he lose his mind and give them to you?

194
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,530
What's he wearing now then?

195
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,400
You know him, so you should know

196
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,090
he'll never give them away.

197
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,700
So you're saying you killed that lunatic Feng Yue

198
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,830
and stole his boots?

199
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,370
What do you think?

200
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,110
That belt on you looks nice too.

201
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,510
Hey, hold on! I'm not done talking yet!

202
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,110
Step back! Back off!

203
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,020
I said I'm not done!

204
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,440
I actually think my junior has a point.

205
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,200
It's fate we crossed paths.

206
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,810
Who knows? Maybe later, we'll need each other.

207
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,400
So what are you offering?

208
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
A map.

209
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,750
Each sect's map of the Bloody Trial Ground
is unique.

210
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,000
I happen to have a version
from Spirit Beast Mountain.

211
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,680
You can consider trading me Yellow Maple Valley's.

212
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,510
Not a bad deal, right?

213
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,530
Spirit Beast Mountain's map?

214
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,590
Miss Han already has one.

215
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,090
We don't need to see yours.

216
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,020
You do?

217
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,850
I forgot about that.

218
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,530
Then how about one from the Saber-Shearing Sect?

219
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,550
How do I know it's real?

220
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,720
No deal.

221
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,350
How can I scam you?

222
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,720
Tell you what, I'll throw in Skyfort Castle's too.

223
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,790
Two for one.

224
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,960
There's no way I can make so many different ones.

225
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,460
Am I right?

226
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,810
Deal?

227
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,200
Okay then. I'll count to three,
and we exchange at the same time.

228
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,090
Three, two, one!

229
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,110
We agreed to do it together!

230
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,890
What kind of deal is this?

231
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,920
He got away again!

232
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,110
Yu, where do you think he could've gone?

233
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,240
Who knows.

234
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,370
That kid sure runs fast.

235
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,160
Oh, it's you.

236
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,880
You scared us!

237
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,260
So, where's my Blood Spirit Flower?

238
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,310
We did what you asked.

239
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,850
Now what else do you want?

240
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,866
Besides the flower,

241
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:23,270
we're also supposed to take out
elite disciples from the Seven Sects.

242
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,370
Did you forget about that?

243
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,640
The two of us have already killed plenty of them.

244
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,530
What about you?

245
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,790
On the surface,

246
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,350
I'm still part of Spirit Beast Mountain.

247
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,000
It's hard for me to make a move directly.

248
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,850
That's why I need you two!

249
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,830
Just now, I ran into a guy and a girl.

250
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,640
The girl's from Spirit Beast Mountain.

251
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,200
The guy's from Yellow Maple Valley.

252
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,460
I saw them both
gathering quite a few spirit herbs.

253
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,180
Now tell me,

254
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,130
you two got any ideas?

255
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,400
Need me to spell it out?

256
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,850
Why don't you go take them out,

257
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,980
grab their herbs,

258
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,090
then we each get a cut.

259
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,050
You get it now?

260
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,420
What does he look like?

261
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,310
Tall and skinny, pretty plain-looking.

262
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,610
Plain-looking?

263
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,160
Where are they now?

264
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,200
That girl was looking for medicine
for her brother.

265
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,110
So they're probably headed to the Solarflame Cave

266
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,200
to hunt for spirit herbs.

267
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,960
Ambush them before they get there.

268
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,720
Their cultivation is weak, weaker than you think!

269
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,740
That's all from me.

270
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,270
Everyone, disciples are dying unusually fast.

271
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,700
Did none of you notice?

272
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,000
Now that the Trial Ground
opens once every 60 years,

273
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,310
they'll fight tooth and nail for herbs.

274
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,880
The bloodshed this time will be worse than ever.

275
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,110
Elder Han,

276
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,880
didn't we all go through this back in the day?

277
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,240
Relax, everyone!

278
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,660
They'll be fine!

279
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,933
 

280
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:45,880
It's so dark.

281
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,920
I can't see a thing.

282
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,110
In a place like this,

283
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,200
if we don't follow the stars and markings,

284
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,397
we're bound to get lost.

285
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:55,177
What do we do now?

286
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,178
It's the Solunar Purification Pearl!

287
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:07,590
Three days have passed.

288
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,400
That Pearl was made specifically

289
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,920
to cut through the Trial Ground's mists.

290
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,810
With it, we won't lose our way!

291
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,270
Found it!

292
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,890
That way!

293
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,830
Solarflame Blossoms!

294
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,780
A whole field of them!

295
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,740
Run!

296
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,020
Nowhere left to run, huh?

297
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,160
You want Solarflame Blossoms?

298
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,110
I won't let you have them!

299
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,610
No!

300
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,960
Solarflame Blossoms... Solarflame Blossoms...

301
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,850
Not a single flower left...

302
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
 They fought way too viciously. 

303
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,790
 And their techniques
aren't from the Seven Sects at all. 

304
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,045
 They're not from Spirit Beast Mountain. 

305
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:29,955
 Then who are they? 

306
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,980
Stop crying.

307
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,810
There's still one left.

308
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,270
Thank you!

309
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,270
 Li, I saved this flatbread for you. 

310
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,850
 Take it! 

311
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,640
It's dangerous here.

312
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,940
Let's go.

313
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,790
Li, how can I ever thank you?

314
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,940
Once we're out of here,
make me a few flatbreads!

315
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,590
Flatbreads?

316
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,380
 

317
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,090
We're almost there. Let's move.

318
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,889
 I've gathered the Violet Monkey Blossom
and Jade Marrow Mushroom. 

319
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,700
 Just need the Celestial Essence Fruit now. 

320
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,880
 According to the map,
it should be right around here. 

321
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,960
 But I don't see it anywhere. 

322
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,310
 Maybe someone else have picked it? 

323
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,790
 Time's running out. 

324
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,220
 Let me check this place for any unripe sprouts. 

325
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,940
 Even spirit sense can't get through it! 

326
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,300
I'll take a gamble.

327
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,720
This should be the stone temple
mentioned in the records.

328
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,530
This place actually blocks spirit sense.

329
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,510
Everyone, stay alert.

330
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,330
We'll give it our all, Grandmaster!

331
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,030
Yu, Qing, you two stay behind

332
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,720
and keep searching for the Blood Spirit Flower.

333
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,750
This concerns Yan Ru Yan's life

334
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,720
and our relationship with the Yan Clan Stronghold.

335
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,160
We must not take it lightly.

336
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,000
Yes, Grandmaster!

337
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,370
All others, stick close to me!

338
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,200
 It's so strange. 

339
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,830
 I can't even scan this place with spirit sense. 

340
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,480
 There's only one path all the way through. 

341
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,220
 If I'm surrounded here,
I'll have no way to escape. 

342
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,550
 No, I can't take that risk. 

343
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,660
 I'll search elsewhere. 

344
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,020
 No! Someone's here! 

345
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,180
 It's a dead end! 

346
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,370
 What is this? 

347
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,720
Grandmaster, they say the Blackscale Python here

348
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,070
is a Tier One demon beast.

349
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,400
Is this place even safe?

350
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,550
Stay calm.

351
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,000
Stick to the plan.

352
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,830
Leave everything to me.

353
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,590
 Grandmaster? 

354
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,980
 A Core Formation cultivator's here? 

355
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,700
It's her.

356
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,780
It really is here!

357
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,400
All of you, listen up!

358
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,200
From this moment on, lock down the area.

359
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,350
Guard all sides.

360
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,510
Form the array!

361
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,500
Yes, Grandmaster!

362
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,550
 There really is a Celestial Essence Fruit! 

363
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,500
 I have to find a way to get it. 

364
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,720
 Is that the Blackscale Python? 

365
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,050
 It doesn't quite match the illustrations. 

366
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,350
What a fierce fight!

367
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,090
Tough luck running into me!

368
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't care which sect you're from.

369
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,790
If you miss the teleport window tomorrow,

370
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,850
you're stuck here for another 60 years!

371
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,720
This beast's scales are tough as nails.

372
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,480
Regular spells do nothing to it.

373
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,980
At my command!

374
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,110
Activate the array!

375
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,570
Yes, Grandmaster!

376
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,420
 Impressive indeed! 

377
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,790
It doesn't seem that hard to handle.

378
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,240
Grandmaster, what kind of demon beast is that?

379
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,590
No, it's not a Blackscale Python.

380
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,890
It can shed its skin
and evolve into a Blackflood Drake!

381
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,030
It's now Tier Two.

382
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,840
A Tier Two demon beast?

383
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,960
 That's about the Mid Foundation
Establishment Stage! 

384
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,030
 Should I abandon the Celestial Essence Fruit? 

385
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,740
No need to panic.

386
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,970
Form up!

387
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,660
Retreat! You're no match for it!

388
00:36:57,887 --> 00:36:59,000
Grandmaster!

389
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,860
The path is blocked!

390
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,960
 We're sealed in! 

391
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,060
 There's no way out now! 

392
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,580
You wretched beast!

393
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,150
Only one left?

394
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,890
Can she take it alone?

395
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,710
If you don't come out now,
you're not getting out at all!

396
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,440
 Step outside and I'll die. 

397
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,490
Stay hidden and you'll still die!

398
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,100
What are you waiting for?

399
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,810
Run!

400
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,070
You're pretty slick,

401
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,370
hiding all this time and not making a move?

402
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,360
I was afraid you'd kill me for my treasure.

403
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,920
You're so young, but already this scheming?

404
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,230
Not afraid you'll end up friendless?

405
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,920
If I weren't this scheming,

406
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,840
I'd be dead ten times over by now.

407
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,620
There wouldn't be a later.

408
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,396
I'm low on spiritual power.

409
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:05,280
This won't hold it much longer.

410
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,810
If you've got something, use it now!

411
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,000
I do have one more talisman treasure.

412
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,260
Then what are you waiting for? Hurry!

413
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,880
Senior! I need time to activate it!

414
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,692
- You'll have to hold it off!
- I'll do my best.

415
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,540
But you'll have to draw it away first!

416
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,880
You ready yet?

417
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,920
Do I look ready to you?

418
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,670
Why don't you take over?

419
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,810
Now you know how it feels to be left hanging?

420
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,960
Move it!

421
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,760
This is the Golden Brick Talisman,

422
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,320
my shop's finest treasure!

423
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,920
It's a bit slow to activate,
but it's far from ordinary.

424
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,960
Senior! Bear with me!

425
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,840
This is all I've got left!

426
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,490
Faster!

427
00:42:00,115 --> 00:42:01,190
You monster!

428
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,890
Get down!

429
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,590
It's insanely strong!

430
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,760
I can't hold on much longer!
Hurry!

431
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm going as fast as I can!

432
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,180
Faster!

433
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,890
Faster!

434
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,850
Go!

435
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:22,552
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

436
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:28,442
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

437
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:31,560

00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,960
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

443
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,457
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

444
00:43:58,457 --> 00:44:00,880
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

445

 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

453
