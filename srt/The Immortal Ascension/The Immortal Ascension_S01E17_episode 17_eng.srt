1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,505
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:27,115
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,160
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,545
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:36,160
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,920
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,960
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,480
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,000
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,034
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:01,273
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:05,565
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:10,272
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:13,640
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,780
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,100
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,120
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,042
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,976
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,320
Something's wrong!

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,350
Han!

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,670
Miss Mo!

27
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,600
- What happened?
- We need to get out of the city.

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,380
Someone's after us.

29
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,870
I know an old waterway that leads outside.

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,490
I'll take you there.

31
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,490
It's this way.

32
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,320
Han...

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,450
Why did it suddenly get so dark?

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,380
Han.

35
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,470
This path was something
a patient once told me about.

36
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,420
It leads right out of the city.

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,340
Why's it a dead end?

38
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,580
Step back! Don't get hurt!

39
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,200
I'm Dong Xuan Er. What's your name?

40
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,480
Mo Ca Huan. I'm a friend of Han Li's.

41
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,710
A friend? When did you two become friends?

42
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,840
A long time ago.

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,360
No wonder he never mentioned you.

44
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,191
We haven't seen each other in years.

45
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,921
You just ran into him?
I wish I had someone to watch fireworks with too.

46
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:38,102
Move on! They're catching up!

47
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,060
There's light up ahead!

48
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,331
Sirs, you must've heard by now

49
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:07,682
the fall of Jiang and Cheqi Kingdoms.

50
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:10,310
The demonic sects have been quiet for years.

51
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,080
But this time, they're really here.

52
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,750
I heard those royal families
were secretly learning cultivation,

53
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,080
trying to become cultivators.

54
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,960
They broke the rule
barring royals from cultivation.

55
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,690
The demonic sects acted,
and maybe they had a reason.

56
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,080
What's the point of fighting over scraps?

57
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,280
Righteous or demonic,

58
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,430
why should our Seven Sects
get dragged into this mess?

59
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,310
If we provoke the demonic sects,

60
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,120
they may come after us next.

61
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,470
Exactly.

62
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,400
Everyone, since we were
all invited here by Hong Fu,

63
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,800
let's hear what she has to say.

64
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,240
I heard a Nascent Soul cultivator
is involved in this fight.

65
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,080
Yes, someone from the Joyful Union Sect,

66
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,360
Grandmaster Yun Lu.

67
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,250
Grandmaster Yun Lu?

68
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,120
You old geezers, what's that look for?

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,680
Talk business if you must,

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,530
but keep your eyes off my senior!

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,910
All of you, I didn't call this meeting.

72
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,370
Nangong Wan from Moonshadow Sect did.

73
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,120
What? Yan Clan Stronghold sided with the enemy?

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,190
I saw it with my own eyes!

75
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,190
Inside Yan Clan Stronghold,
they activated two grand arrays.

76
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,440
Not just to block detection,

77
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,960
they were meant to trap every Seven Sect disciple

78
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,840
attending the wedding inside the city.

79
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,560
On the surface, it was a wedding feast.

80
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,800
But in truth, Yan Clan worked
with the demon sects to set us up.

81
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,630
This... this can't be true.

82
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,680
I didn't dare delay.

83
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,690
As soon as I realized it, I rushed back to report.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,120
I should've seen it coming.

85
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,200
Yan Clan Stronghold is right on the border,

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,880
next to the Jiang Kingdom.

87
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,200
Yan Ru Yan's wedding, and what happened to Qing...

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,740
With so many red flags, how did I miss them?

89
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,620
You've been more than cautious, Grandmaster.

90
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,100
If you hadn't warned me
to keep an eye on the demonic sects,

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,560
I wouldn't have gone
to investigate Yan Clan Stronghold.

92
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,640
The Seven Sects are still in the dark.

93
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,740
Come. We're going to Yellow Maple Valley.

94
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,760
Yellow Maple Valley?

95
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,590
They're holding a meeting there now.

96
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,200
I want you to tell them everything you know,

97
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,120
start to finish, every last detail.

98
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,250
Let's move.

99
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,710
Han! My powers are back!

100
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,680
We must be outside the array now.

101
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,860
Move on!

102
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,166
He's on us!

103
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,216
You two, leave!

104
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,366
We're surrounded by open land.

105
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:16,616
We won't outrun him.

106
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:17,656
Miss Mo, you leave first!

107
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:19,296
Han and I will hold him off!

108
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:21,566
- Then you two...
- Go! Now!

109
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,810
- Hurry!
- Stay safe!

110
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,790
Junior,

111
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,960
we meet again!

112
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,370
You fiend! Why do you keep coming after me?

113
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,590
Boy from Yellow Maple Valley,

114
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,540
I underestimated you before.

115
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,120
State your identity!

116
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,960
I don't kill nobodies!

117
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,440
Li Fei Yu, disciple of Yellow Maple Valley.

118
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,980
Nothing worth bragging about.

119
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,660
Li Fei Yu?

120
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,910
You keep ruining my plans!

121
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,390
Looks like you're a standout

122
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,910
from that shabby sect after all?

123
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,640
With how clueless you are,

124
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,830
you dare speak like a real master?

125
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,520
Let me set you straight.

126
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,470
In Yellow Maple Valley,
core cultivators are common,

127
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,320
and Foundation cultivators are everywhere.

128
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm just a nobody myself.

129
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,910
But taking you down?

130
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,860
A piece of cake!

131
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:19,846
Nice.

132
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,320
This blood mist can regenerate!

133
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,680
Run!

134
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,730
Die!

135
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,900
Fly up!

136
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,340
No one's getting away!

137
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,180
Head back!

138
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,290
We need to escape before the array seals off!

139
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,610
Still trying to run?

140
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,830
The flying talismans burn out fast!

141
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,350
I can't hold on much longer!

142
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,990
I've got one talisman left.

143
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,160
I'll send you out!

144
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,710
What about you?

145
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,220
I'll figure something out!

146
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,550
 At least she's safe. 

147
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,940
 If my elders ask, I'll have an answer. 

148
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,310
 Don't die! 

149
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,250
 You have to come back alive! 

150
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,630
All right then, I'll keep you company for a bit.

151
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,730
So tell me, how do you want to die?

152
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,710
Running into you today,

153
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,030
looks like I've lost this round.

154
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,560
What happened in the Bloody Trial Ground
was your doing too, right?

155
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,710
Recruiting spies from the Seven Sects,

156
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,450
and stealing from Yan Clan Stronghold,

157
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,030
you've got quite the operation going.

158
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,200
What's your next move?

159
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,370
At least let me die knowing the plan.

160
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,520
Cut the crap.

161
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,160
You think I don't see through you?

162
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,670
You're just buying time for those two women
to get away.

163
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,071
You think I'm an idiot?

164
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:31,581
Wow, you're real clever.

165
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,010
Kid.

166
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,980
Time to die!

167
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,430
Seriously?

168
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,850
You need this much firepower for one guy?

169
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Luckily, he's huge, but clumsy.

170
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,660
I can still take him.

171
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,880
My Cyan Mirror... Oh no!

172
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,170
It can't hold on!

173
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,100
You came loaded with artifacts!

174
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,880
Azure Drake Banner!

175
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,100
Go!

176
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,790
Cyan Sword Technique!

177
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,760
His cultivation's above mine.

178
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,100
I can't go head-to-head!

179
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,920
What is this?

180
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,540
So flashy and useless.

181
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,100
Get over here!

182
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,880
Blood Spirit Spell, Form Ten...

183
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,940
Blood Burst!

184
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,100
Too bad!

185
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,570
Got you at last!

186
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,700
Now die!

187
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,740
No, this smoke is toxic...

188
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,040
That Azure Smoke is made
from Blackflood Drake venom.

189
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,350
I earned it back in the Bloody Trial Ground!

190
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,060
You really have no shame!

191
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,000
With someone like you, any method is fair game.

192
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,760
You're... you're even more demonic than I am!

193
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,990
Well played, Li Fei Yu...

194
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,450
I won't forget this!

195
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,160
I finally drove him off.

196
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,420
Any longer, I'd be in trouble too.

197
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,190
This is a Core elder discussion.

198
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,080
You brought a Foundation disciple here?

199
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,650
Is that really appropriate?

200
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,280
This is Xuan Yue, my disciple.

201
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,080
He's been handling our contact
with Yan Clan Stronghold.

202
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,520
Now we know they're a serious problem.

203
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,090
Now tell everyone what you know.

204
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,920
Sirs, I saw it myself.

205
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,960
Yan Clan Stronghold teamed up
with the demonic sects to set a trap.

206
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,430
All the Seven Sect disciples at the wedding

207
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,770
were sealed and killed inside the city.

208
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,790
What?

209
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,330
All of them died?

210
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,260
What are you saying?

211
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,890
That can't be true!

212
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,310
The demonic sects never
planned to spare Yue Kingdom.

213
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,920
They struck Yan Clan Stronghold today,

214
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,180
but tomorrow it can be all Seven Sects!

215
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,620
Xuan Er...

216
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,090
Yan!

217
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,310
Yan!

218
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,510
Yan, you're awake!

219
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,960
Father?

220
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,030
Father!

221
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,700
You're finally awake!

222
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,710
I... How do you feel?

223
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,510
Wasn't I supposed to be at Moonshadow Sect?

224
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,420
Do you feel unwell?

225
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,680
Why am I dressed like this?

226
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,710
Don't panic.

227
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,220
Listen to me.

228
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,490
So much has happened

229
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,160
while you were unconscious.

230
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,550
All I can tell you is,
you're now married to Wang Chan,

231
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,680
heir to Ghost Spirit Sect.

232
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,750
Our clan

233
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,250
has officially joined the Ghost Spirit Sect.

234
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
Father, what are you talking about?

235
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,230
The Ghost Spirit Sect is demonic!

236
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,990
Are you really defying the Seven Sects of Yue?

237
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,840
The Seven Sects?

238
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,750
Yan,

239
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,840
don't blame me.

240
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
When you were gravely ill,

241
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,770
did anyone from the Seven Sects care about you?

242
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,550
I didn't want to betray them.

243
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,980
They forced my hand!

244
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,180
To save you,

245
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,250
this was the only way.

246
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,460
I can feel within me
their wrongly spilled spirits.

247
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,050
So...

248
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,530
they died because of me?

249
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,940
If they hadn't died,

250
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,680
you couldn't have lived.

251
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,550
Father...

252
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,400
How could you do this?

253
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,310
We've stood against the demonic sects
for 300 years!

254
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,200
Now, just because of me,

255
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,570
you've joined forces with them?

256
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,750
If I had known, I'd rather you never saved me!

257
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,030
I'm going back to Moonshadow Sect!

258
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,530
Yan! Stop, Yan!

259
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,920
Yan! Are you okay?

260
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,310
Yan, are you alright?

261
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,490
Yan!

262
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,980
Yan, you can't go back now!

263
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,550
Your husband, Wang Chan,
used the Blood Spirit Spell

264
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,470
and the blood of Seven Sect cultivators

265
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,030
to bring you back to life.

266
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,990
You think you can go back?

267
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,070
Moonshadow Sect

268
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,940
and all the Seven Sects

269
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,710
see us as enemies now!

270
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,330
You can't go back anymore!

271
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,600
I'm old.

272
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,900
My cultivation in this lifetime

273
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,740
has likely hit its limit.

274
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,980
But you're different.

275
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
You have a heavenly spirit root.

276
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,310
On the path of cultivation,

277
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,900
you have limitless potential!

278
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,680
I've always believed you'll become our clan's

279
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,090
first Nascent Soul cultivator.

280
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,380
With you protecting us,

281
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,900
no one will dare bully us again!

282
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,620
Yan, I had to save you,

283
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,290
not just because you're my daughter,

284
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,105
but also because...

285
00:22:27,105 --> 00:22:32,250
you... you're the future of our clan!

286
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,940
That burden

287
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,220
is now yours to carry.

288
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,070
Thanks for your sharing.

289
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,400
Don't mention it.

290
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,030
I talked too much.

291
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,490
That must've tired you out.

292
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,160
Just how far has the demonic sects' plan come?

293
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,840
Nangong, please tell us everything you know.

294
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,680
To be honest, we noticed it too.

295
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,230
You were holding back earlier.

296
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,620
Normally, we shouldn't press you, but...

297
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,030
this concerns the survival of the Seven Sects.

298
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,850
We have to ask further.

299
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,440
Some time ago, I fought a demonic cultivator

300
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,510
who'd infiltrated Yue Kingdom.

301
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,420
He said they've already won over
some Core cultivators in Yue.

302
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,510
Even Core cultivators have betrayed us.

303
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,310
No wonder they kept stalling, turning a blind eye.

304
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,220
So they've become traitors.

305
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,640
Can we trust what that man said?

306
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,880
At this point,

307
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,550
nothing can be trusted completely anymore.

308
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,120
I'm only telling you this
so the Seven Sects understand

309
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,600
we can't just focus on what's in front of us.

310
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,180
We need to watch our back.

311
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,790
Thanks for your warning.

312
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,750
Yellow Maple Valley will take it to heart.

313
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,200
Right now, Yan Clan Stronghold has defected,

314
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,920
leaving Yue Kingdom wide open to invasion.

315
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,010
Do you have a strategy?

316
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,230
The demonic sects are closing in fast.

317
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,400
Even Nascent Soul cultivators
have joined the battle.

318
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,550
Our best option is for each sect to send
their own Nascent Soul elders

319
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,640
to handle the conflict at their level.

320
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,230
That way, we can keep mortals out of it.

321
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,840
Of course.

322
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,960
You've thought it through.

323
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,360
In addition, battles between Core cultivators

324
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,880
will be key to deciding the outcome.

325
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,400
We need Core cultivators
stationed on every front line

326
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,960
to fend off the demon assault.

327
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,550
Agreed.

328
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,200
Now that Yan Clan Stronghold has fallen,

329
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Yellow Maple Valley and Moonshadow Sect

330
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,840
must be the first line of defense.

331
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,550
Junior Li and I will each lead a unit into battle.

332
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,880
Your resolve is admirable.

333
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,510
I'm deeply impressed.

334
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:33,120
Third, it's time to send in
elite Foundation disciples.

335
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,640
We need to form scout teams.

336
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,230
They'll rescue survivors near Yan Clan Stronghold

337
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,510
and gather intel on the enemy.

338
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,880
If anything comes up,
they'll report it immediately.

339
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,680
Moonshadow Sect will have
Xuan Yue lead the squad.

340
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,990
This mission is part of our build-up
to a full counterattack.

341
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,680
I take the mission.

342
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,380
Xuan Yue,

343
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:54,200
are you sure

344
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,660
not a single Seven Sect disciple made it out?

345
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,990
Reporting:

346
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,640
I couldn't confirm on the spot,

347
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,640
but I fear most didn't survive...

348
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,680
Don't worry, Senior.

349
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,510
That little disciple of mine
is always careful to a fault.

350
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,840
Before he left, he promised again and again

351
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,510
he'd look after Xuan Er.

352
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,810
If anyone survived, it must be the two of them.

353
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,770
But Han Li's only a Foundation cultivator...

354
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,960
Han Li?

355
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,888
He went to Yan Clan Stronghold?

356
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,988
He can't have died just like that.

357
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,850
Miss Mo!

358
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,740
Han!

359
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,330
Hurry, get on!

360
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,460
Han, are you badly hurt?

361
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,510
I'm fine.

362
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,180
I already took a healing pill.

363
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,880
What about that man chasing us?

364
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,750
Did you kill him?

365
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,310
No.

366
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,140
But he didn't walk away happy.

367
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,460
Then what?

368
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,220
What's your next move?

369
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,990
There's a village up ahead.

370
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,530
You can lie low there for a while.

371
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,880
Then head to the Imperial Capital.

372
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,570
It's safer than Yan Clan Stronghold.

373
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,620
 Last time we met was ten years ago... 

374
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,420
 Who knows when the next time will be? 

375
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:18,360
 You cultivators live so long,
but I'm just a mortal. 

376
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,460
 How many decades do I really have? 

377
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,490
 Can I even wait that long? 

378
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,850
Han, are you fine?

379
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,050
It's all right.

380
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,220
Miss Mo, this is as far as I can take you.

381
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,905
If I'm right,

382
00:29:56,905 --> 00:30:00,570
a major war is coming to the cultivation world.

383
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,990
I've got some pills here.

384
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,490
You can keep them for yourself
or sell them for money.

385
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,790
Go settle down in the capital,

386
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,850
and try to live a peaceful life.

387
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,380
I don't need them.

388
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,050
Miss Mo,

389
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,570
we part ways today.

390
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,250
Who knows when we'll meet again?

391
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,090
Take care of yourself.

392
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,940
Han...

393
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,940
If I have a spirit root,

394
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,850
I'll be able to stay by your side, right?

395
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,460
You're always like this.

396
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,090
Whenever the question gets hard,

397
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,770
you just go quiet...

398
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:34,493
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

399
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:40,839
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

400
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:44,360
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on... ♫ 

401
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,416
Miss Mo...

402
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,720
 ♫ Old scenes rise again... ♫ 

403
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,752
Take care.

404
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:55,100
 ♫ Too hard to forget, easier just to miss ♫ 

405
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,500
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke... ♫ 

406
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,860
Han...

407
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,250
Take care of yourself.

408
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,440
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

409
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:21,120
 ♫ Eyes once looked far, now lost in the shift ♫ 

410
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:27,920
 ♫ Autumn winds stir, smoke curls once more ♫ 

411
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,960
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky,
returning to my eyes ♫ 

412
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:41,200
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop,
time lost its name ♫ 

413
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,960
 ♫ Was it yesterday or tomorrow? ♫ 

414
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,440
 ♫ The world has changed, beyond recall ♫ 

415
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,520
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

416
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,640
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

417
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,221
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

418
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:11,600
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

419
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,892
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

420
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:18,280
 ♫ we call eternity ♫ 

421
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:24,252
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

422
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,400
 ♫ called eternity ♫ 

423
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,130
 He's not really dead, is he? 

424
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,230
Grandmaster.

425
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,600
What is it?

426
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,160
You sent me to find royal bloodlines

427
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
from Cheqi and Jiang Kingdoms.

428
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,460
I only returned with two children.

429
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,030
Keep them in our sect.

430
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,360
If they have spirit roots, train them.

431
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,900
If not,

432
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,990
find them good homes.

433
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,840
Understood.

434
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,310
Grandmaster, I discovered something strange

435
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,880
while I was undercover in both kingdoms.

436
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,600
The demonic sects were gathering

437
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,790
entire populations together
to test for spirit roots.

438
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:31,230
Anyone who had one was taken away on the spot,

439
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,330
even children weren't spared.

440
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,960
They're downright monstrous.

441
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,090
Aren't they afraid of incurring heaven's wrath?

442
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,348
Ma'am, why would they do something like that?

443
00:34:47,348 --> 00:34:49,550
They're forcing people to cultivate fast.

444
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,600
Then using forbidden techniques

445
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,510
to rush them into higher stages.

446
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,400
Finally send them to the front lines.

447
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,920
As for those people, even if they survive,

448
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,960
their foundation's ruined.

449
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,700
They won't live long anyway.

450
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,420
Who goes there?

451
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,640
Congrats, Young Master!

452
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,680
Hail the Young Master!

453
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,840
Young Master, you're peerless!

454
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,230
With just a bit of trickery,

455
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,440
you took Yan Clan Stronghold effortlessly.

456
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,600
With the Seven Sects, you'll crush them
just as easily!

457
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,900
Get lost!

458
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,540
Oh, Young Master, you're seriously hurt.

459
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,510
The Bloody Trial Ground...

460
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,700
Blackflood Drake's poison...

461
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,740
Zhong Wu,

462
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,150
you know a lot about the Seven Great Sects.

463
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,320
You went to the Bloody Trial Ground too.

464
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,670
Did you come across someone

465
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,540
named Li Fei Yu from Yellow Maple Valley?

466
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,190
Young Master, I was too busy

467
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,550
stirring up trouble at the time.

468
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,550
Who could remember names?

469
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,110
Here's an idea. Once we take Yellow Maple Valley,

470
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,400
I'll round them all up,

471
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,020
and deliver him straight to you.

472
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,770
Problem solved.

473
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,410
Then put out the order.

474
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,880
Find out where he went.

475
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,400
He's hurt worse than I am.

476
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,280
He can't have gone far.

477
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,840
Of course!

478
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,760
There's no way he got far!

479
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,220
Wait.

480
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,220
How's Yan Ru Yan doing?

481
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,240
She's awake.

482
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,960
But she probably realized her home is gone,
and she got married in her sleep.

483
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,670
That's a lot to take in.

484
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,770
She won't speak to anyone now.

485
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,760
The game's already set.

486
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,620
She has no say in it.

487
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,540
Let me rest a bit, will you?

488
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,330
I'm off now!

489
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,660
What a fine mood you're in, dear.

490
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,920
Let's properly introduce ourselves.

491
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,320
My name is Wang Chan,

492
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,840
Young Master of Ghost Spirit Sect,

493
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,890
and your new husband.

494
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,660
You vile scum.

495
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,476
You'd better kill me now,

496
00:38:20,476 --> 00:38:23,110
or I swear one day I will kill you!

497
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,190
If you really want revenge,

498
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,400
then dual cultivate with me.

499
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,110
Once your powers grow

500
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,510
and you reach Nascent Soul, come and try.

501
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,100
Shameless!

502
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,060
I just wonder

503
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,250
will you really kill your dear husband?

504
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,700
Well, broad daylight and all,
congrats on your big day!

505
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,110
Aunt, I should be congratulating you.

506
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,920
You just took Cheqi Kingdom,

507
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,920
and made Grandmaster Yun Lu grin ear to ear.

508
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,470
Sweet talker, aren't you?

509
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,840
You handled the Yan Clan Stronghold business well.

510
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,190
I've already put in a good word

511
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,960
with my brother for you.

512
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,150
He was so pleased.

513
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,250
He couldn't stop smiling.

514
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,920
Thanks, Aunt.

515
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,832
That said,

516
00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:15,200
in Yan Clan Stronghold,

517
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,400
you lost to some no-name
from Yellow Maple Valley.

518
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,890
If my brother knows it, he won't be thrilled.

519
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,110
Understood.

520
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,360
I'll take it to heart,

521
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,180
and be more careful next time.

522
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,060
Truly your father's son, sharp and sensible!

523
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,510
Oh, you're badly injured.

524
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,470
You should stay out of the fight
with the Seven Sects.

525
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,550
What? Why?

526
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,240
I'm almost healed!

527
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,400
Why the rush?

528
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,920
Yan Clan Stronghold just surrendered.

529
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,190
And as their new live-in son-in-law,

530
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,630
shouldn't you be home doting on your bride?

531
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,220
Leave the fighting to others.

532
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,620
Even my brother, I mean, your father, agrees.

533
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,920
Things are tense on the battlefield.

534
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,550
We can't spare anyone for the front lines.

535
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,880
We've already drafted
a huge number of mortals from Jiang and Cheqi.

536
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,250
Mortals?

537
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,220
They're all mortals with spirit roots.

538
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,190
Anyway, get back to your sweet little bride

539
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,740
and keep her company!

540
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,590
Forgive my aunt, dear.

541
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,280
This is the real face of the Ghost Spirit Sect.

542
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,930
You'll have to get used to it.

543
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,760
She's your actual aunt?

544
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,970
Yes.

545
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,540
But she's also probably...

546
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,540
the one who most wants me dead.

547
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,660
Your family is really something else.

548
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,450
Well, going forward, they'll be your family too.

549
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,330
Don't worry.

550
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,770
In the future, I'll need you desperately.

551
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,400
But I may betray you anytime,

552
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,850
and use you for my own ends.

553
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,500
Of course,

554
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,440
you're free to betray me too,

555
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,600
and use me however you like.

556
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,940
Dear.

557
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,960
As for the Yan Clan Stronghold situation,

558
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,630
I assume everyone's already heard.

559
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,360
The demonic sects are running wild.

560
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,990
We can't let our guard down.

561
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,110
On orders from the Seven Sects' elders,

562
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:04,110
we from Yellow Maple Valley
must also send disciples

563
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,990
to join the joint scout teams.

564
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:10,890
You're heading to Yan Clan Stronghold
to investigate the situation.

565
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,470
Who's willing to go?

566
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,240
I volunteer, Wu Xuan!

567
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,840
Chen Qiao Qian volunteers!

568
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,920
You?

569
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,720
This mission is dangerous.

570
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,670
You've just reached
Foundation Establishment Stage.

571
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,160
- I'm afraid...
- Senior.

572
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,880
I gained little from the Bloody Trial Ground.

573
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,400
I made no contributions to our sect,

574
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,672
yet was granted a Foundation Pill.

575
00:42:32,672 --> 00:42:34,240
Though I succeeded in my breakthrough,

576
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,880
if I keep coasting like this,

577
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,770
I may develop inner demons.

578
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,920
Now that the demonic sects have invaded,

579
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,960
and I share ties with Junior Xuan Er and Han Li,

580
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,840
I just can't sit by and do nothing.

581
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,280
Please allow me to go.

582
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,400
Since you're willing, you and Junior Wu Xuan
may go together.

583
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,880
Thank you, Master.

584
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,660
Let Moonshadow Sect's Xuan Yue lead the team.

585
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,290
Xuan Yue accepts the order.

586
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,190
All scouts, come with me!

587
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,810
- Yes!
- Yes!

588
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,410
All disciples, hear this!

589
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,360
The demonic sects have
officially declared war on us.

590
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,760
On orders from the elders,

591
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,562
all Foundation and Qi Refining disciples
of Yellow Maple Valley

592
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:30,720
must now choose a battlefront
and prepare to fight.

593
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,946
In this war, we cannot retreat!

594
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:33,990
We must not surrender!

595
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,110
Any who defy orders will be severely punished!

596
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,540
- Yes!
- Yes!

597
00:43:53,560 --> 00:44:00,080
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

598
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:05,997
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫

00:44:05,997 --> 00:44:09,438

 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

605
00:44:32,509 --> 00:44:36,015
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

606

 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

607
