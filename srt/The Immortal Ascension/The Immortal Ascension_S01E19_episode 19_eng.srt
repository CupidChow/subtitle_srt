1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,520
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,140
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,160
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,480
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,210
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,080
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,006
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:46,480
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,960
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,229
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,274
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:05,754
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,272
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:13,620
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,717
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:17,959
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,190
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,870
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,932
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,440
See that?

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,920
They are inside the cave.

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,760
I don't care if you have to dig.
Just bring him to me!

27
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,080
Young Master, the cave system is convoluted.

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,720
The tunnels are windy.

29
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,960
The bends are sharp.

30
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,450
Straight to the point!

31
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,080
It will be difficult to find them.

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,610
It will be easy! How can I say it's difficult
when I haven't tried?

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,612
But Young Master, you see,

34
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:10,600
those vermin are no threat.

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,380
- Just leave them be.
- Vermin?

36
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,170
Zhong Wu,

37
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,850
you finally said something right for once.

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,070
Vermin.

39
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:33,070
We should treat them like vermin.

40
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,340
Right?

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,960
My friends,

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,670
I suppose this is all the demonic sects could do.

43
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,910
They can't do anything

44
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,600
if we hide in this mountain.

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,110
That's right. Unless they can move the mountain.

46
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,970
Or better yet, blow the mountain up!

47
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,190
Earthquake Talisman?

48
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,600
Young Master, you can't do that.

49
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,160
If you use the Earthquake Talisman,

50
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,270
this quarry will be all gone.

51
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,660
Your aunt will be angry.

52
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,020
She will be angry?

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,520
More reason for me to blow it up, then.

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,310
But, what about our people in there?

55
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,250
Die!

56
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,440
Quick! Run and get inside the cave!

57
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,640
- Go!
- Hurry!

58
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,160
- Quick!
- Quick!

59
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,380
Hurry up!

60
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,200
Are those people out of their minds?

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,360
They used an Earthquake Talisman
on their own quarry.

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,430
Now that the quarry is destroyed,

63
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,960
no one will know we were ever here.

64
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,200
We just have to survive
until the earthquake is over.

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,110
You're right.

66
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,700
Once we get out, I'll buy you a drink.

67
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,450
Lv, come.

68
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,210
Let's go.

69
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,550
Who's there?

70
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,360
Show yourself now.

71
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,675
 Oh, no. 

72
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:41,575
 I ran into them again. 

73
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,920
It's me, Han Li.

74
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,140
Is this Senior Lv and Xuan?

75
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,870
Yes.

76
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,860
Han. Come join us.

77
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,610
 I have no choice but to meet them. 

78
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,370
Seniors, I'm so glad you're safe.

79
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,230
I knew you could make it, Han.

80
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,470
What did I tell you?

81
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,960
Han would surely make it out alive.

82
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,230
Han, did you find any other cultivators?

83
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,390
Not at all.

84
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,200
The ground is shaking.

85
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,030
I'm fortunate enough to have escaped.

86
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,320
Luckily, Yellow Maple Valley
has a Soul-Burning Spell.

87
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,590
We can locate and help each other
in times of need.

88
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,230
My senior, Chen, is also very powerful.

89
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,470
She has many high-grade artifacts,

90
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,560
and I'm looking for her.

91
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,780
See you.

92
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,830
Hold on.

93
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,150
I've heard of your Soul-Burning Spell,

94
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,830
but I've never witnessed it.

95
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,320
We are reunited here by fate.

96
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,590
Why don't you join us?

97
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,390
We can look after each other.

98
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,910
He's right.

99
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,000
Perhaps we should

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,560
find a way out together.

101
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,470
And then, we can find your senior.

102
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,910
Staying together makes it safer.

103
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,390
What do you think?

104
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,570
Sure.

105
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,130
Seniors, you have my gratitude.

106
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,050
Han. Come.

107
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,680
 Once we leave this place, 

108
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,720
 they will kill me to silence me. 

109
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,940
 I need to find a way to get rid of them first. 

110
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,810
It's not him.

111
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,900
There's one over there.

112
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,490
Young Master, I...

113
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,612
I was just telling him to look harder,

114
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:14,120
to think harder about where he could be.

115
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,030
He's an idiot.

116
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,100
You there. Come here.

117
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,230
Did you see someone from Yellow Maple Valley?

118
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,470
- He's this tall.
- Wait. He's dead.

119
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,910
He should be this long on the ground.

120
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,240
He's just a plain guy.

121
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,030
Did you run into someone like him?

122
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,370
No?

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,370
Bugger off.

124
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,590
Young Master, this robe
belongs to the Clear Void Sect,

125
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,710
not Yellow Maple Valley.

126
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,612
- I know.
- I couldn't find our target.

127
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:45,090
But I came across a gem vault inside.

128
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,390
Young Master.

129
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,980
Young Master, I can make you proud.

130
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,520
Young Master, I know what you're looking for.

131
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,350
You're looking for a dead man by the name of Li.

132
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,710
Did I get it right?

133
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,860
No.

134
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,200
He's not here.

135
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,590
How did you know?

136
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,420
Someone like him

137
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,030
will never die next to a fool.

138
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,350
You know him very well.

139
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,560
But this is not important.

140
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,710
I have great news.

141
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,560
- You see, over there...
- You found the place...

142
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,350
Where the Yan Clan hid their gems.

143
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,560
How did you know?

144
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,350
Knowing my father-in-law,

145
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,000
it would be odd
if he didn't have a hidden gem trove.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,760
How wise of you, Young Master.

147
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,790
It will still do nicely.

148
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,000
Take everything.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,320
Leave nothing behind.

150
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,230
They will be my wife's dowry.

151
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,050
That's what he gets
for putting me on clean up duty.

152
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,470
So he knew it wasn't here.

153
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,320
Yet he blew this place up.

154
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,250
He is heartless.

155
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,220
What's the matter, Han?

156
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,750
Nothing. I'm just a bit paranoid.

157
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,110
Worry not, Han.

158
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,590
With our protection, you're safe.

159
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,700
Come.

160
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,060
We should check it out.

161
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,010
Let's go together.

162
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,590
You there. Scout it out.

163
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,890
Yes.

164
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,560
Luo?

165
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,530
It's Luo from Moonshadow Sect!

166
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,820
 This is a dangerous place. 

167
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,320
A prowling enemy.

168
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,940
Light up this area.

169
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,990
 They are both stronger than I. 

170
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,700
 I must proceed with care. 

171
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,180
 What kind of beast is that? 

172
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,980
 

173
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,580
A level four demon beast, White Jade Spider.

174
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,610
What in the world?

175
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,900
 

176
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,940
 That beast is huge yet agile. 

177
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,230
It is fast.

178
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,010
We can't run away from it.

179
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,700
Let's fight it together.

180
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,460
 

181
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,280
Use whatever trick you have now.

182
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,770
Stop hiding your strength!

183
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,740
 

184
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,060
 

185
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,410
 It can't be this easy. 

186
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,010
 It mutated? 

187
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,915
A Blood Jade Spider?

188
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:49,295
This is bad.

189
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,900
 

190
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,380
 

191
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,315
Not bad, Han.

192
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:30,375
 They were trying to kill me as well. 

193
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:35,040
Xuan, keep that beast trapped.

194
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,580
I'll use my talisman to kill it.

195
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,860
 He hides many things,
including precious talismans. 

196
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,500
 

197
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,740
 So they aren't exactly loyal to each other either. 

198
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,130
 They are both hiding something. 

199
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,490
Die!

200
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,530
 Here it comes. 

201
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,180
 I should flee first. 

202
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,940
One down.

203
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,270
Xuan Yue.

204
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,180
You...

205
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,980
I'll drag you down with me!

206
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,960
Han.

207
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,310
Come out now.

208
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,940
I know where you are.

209
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,103
You didn't intend to keep the spider trapped.

210
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,550
He ambushed us.

211
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,050
You feigned death.

212
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,980
You can't blame me for pulling

213
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,220
one tiny trick.

214
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,420
Did both of you rob the gem vault here?

215
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,270
I knew you were not as simple as you looked.

216
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,840
Unlike that fool who thought he was a genius.

217
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,250
All he could think of was the gems.

218
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,600
He wanted to kill both of us

219
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,760
so that he could have the gems to himself.

220
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,551
But how could those dirty gems

221
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,850
ever compare to the real treasure here?

222
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,010
Han,

223
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,360
aren't you curious

224
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,160
about the edge of the ocean?

225
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,850
Don't you want to know what lies

226
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,490
beyond the Tiannan Continent?

227
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,740
Someone asked me the same question in the past.

228
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,680
What happened after that?

229
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,250
Did he venture out of the continent?

230
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,490
He died.

231
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,700
And I thought we were the same people.

232
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,050
Enjoy your moment with the beast.

233
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,980
Don't worry. For this brief journey,
I'll bury your body.

234
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,620
 Oh, no. 

235
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,960
 Where did he go? 

236
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,660
 I need to find him. 

237
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,740
 Found him. 

238
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,860
 

239
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,290
This is the Cyan Mirror from my sect.

240
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,180
How did you get it?

241
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,220
 

242
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,330
It's futile, Han.

243
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,820
 

244
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,290
Using the puppet to attract the spider.

245
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,090
What a ruse.

246
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,460
My eight-legged friend, let's talk.

247
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,180
You have a bad temper.

248
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,660
 

249
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,570
Go. Keep it in place.

250
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,310
 

251
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,960
 It's losing color. 

252
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,090
 It won't last for long. 

253
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,220
 

254
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,400
 Not bad. This is good. 

255
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,740
 And I'll take the gems they stole as well. 

256
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,620
 These are spider eggs. 

257
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,360
 Don't worry. 

258
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,380
 I'll take good care of them. 

259
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,140
 Is this the teleport array
that Xuan Yue mentioned? 

260
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,290
Don't you want to know what lies

261
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,290
beyond the Tiannan Continent?

262
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,810
 The world outside? 

263
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:29,330
 Could this array allow one to teleport far away? 

264
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,980
Unfortunately, one side is broken.

265
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,960
What are these?

266
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,220
Pills?

267
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,940
Greater Teleport Command Seal?

268
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,920
With this,

269
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,570
I can perhaps repair the array.

270
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,160
 All this greed, scheming, and ambition. 

271
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,960
 In the end, it's all just a pipe dream 

272
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,570
 that turns to dust. 

273
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,509
 This teleport array is a surprising find
on this trip. 

274
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:24,310
 I don't know if it will help me or not
in the future. 

275
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,600
 But I have a feeling 

276
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,990
 that it will serve an important purpose. 

277
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,250
 For the moment, no one can know about it. 

278
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,600
 I'll mark this place. 

279
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,570
 Once I find someone who can fix it,
I'll come back. 

280
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,160
You're a lizard, not a dog.

281
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,980
Act like one.

282
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,290
Han, is that you?

283
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,420
Senior Chen.

284
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,070
This is a strengthening pill.

285
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,770
Swallow it now.

286
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,710
I should have listened to you.

287
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,530
They would have still been alive.

288
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,850
You're still alive.

289
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,460
I'm glad.

290
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,355
 She's my senior. 

291
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:18,575
 I can't just leave her here. 

292
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,990
Senior Chen, you're awake.

293
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,810
Put me down.

294
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,550
Are there any survivors?

295
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,290
I didn't see anyone.

296
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,360
Xuan Yue and Lv Tian Meng never appear.

297
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,710
They must have snuck into the gem vault

298
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,600
and looted that place before running away.

299
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,400
Even if they are alive,

300
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,320
they most probably won't show their faces.

301
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,840
 Her reasoning saves me an explanation. 

302
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,660
 No one knows they are both dead. 

303
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,320
Han.

304
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,580
Rinse yourself.

305
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,700
 Is she thinking about what happened in the past? 

306
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,660
Han,

307
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:10,360
I know you don't like me
because of Lu Ming Yuan.

308
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,800
But I am the eldest daughter of my family.

309
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,880
I don't have a say in certain matters.

310
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,100
I met a bad person and...

311
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,540
Anyway, let's forget it.

312
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:26,030
 Good. 

313
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,250
 She didn't recall everything. 

314
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,470
 It happened a long time ago. 

315
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,470
 Besides, Lu Ming Yuan started it first. 

316
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,590
 However, killing one of my own 

317
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,840
 is not exactly a good thing to do. 

318
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,400
You've always impressed me.

319
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,470
As a rogue cultivator with a fake spirit root,

320
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,410
you have mastered many techniques.

321
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,290
You must have trained very hard.

322
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,320
Senior Chen, why are you talking about this?

323
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,150
I envy you.

324
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:02,500
I envy your freedom and your defiant spirit.

325
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,450
I know that coming from me,

326
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,452
this may make you think

327
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:11,760
I'm taking my prestigious background for granted,

328
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,770
or that I'm diminishing your effort.

329
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,290
But...

330
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,140
What am I rambling about?

331
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,020
I hope you don't find me weird.

332
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,070
Lu Ming Yuan bullied me many times.

333
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,850
You intervened many times as well.

334
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:38,370
I know you're not like him.

335
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,670
What a relief.

336
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,810
I thought you didn't like me.

337
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,330
Why would I?

338
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,070
So why do you want to be a cultivator?

339
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,850
Is it because of your family too?

340
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,190
You can say that.

341
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,850
But it's not the only reason.

342
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,330
So what's your reason then?

343
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,660
If I have to pick a reason...

344
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,800
It's probably because of some bread.

345
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,410
Bread?

346
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,890
Flatbread?

347
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,810
Do you like flatbread?

348
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,190
This is my first time

349
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,850
hearing that someone
becomes a cultivator for flatbread.

350
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,970
You're intriguing.

351
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,290
Are you injured?

352
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,260
Come.

353
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,760
My brothers are quite naughty.

354
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,140
When they get hurt, I'll patch them up.

355
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,330
Do you have a sister?

356
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,630
I have a younger sister.

357
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,500
She loves flatbread more than I do.

358
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,770
Does it still hurt?

359
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,810
I appreciate your help.

360
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,740
Let's go.

361
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,480
I don't see traces of demonic sects here.

362
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,260
We should be safe.

363
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,835
Just a bit more and we will enter

364
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:24,245
the area guarded by the Seven Sects
before nightfall.

365
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,800
We don't usually hang out, but when we meet,

366
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,960
I see the determination in your eyes

367
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,630
as if nothing can sway you.

368
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:48,410
You must have an unwavering will.

369
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,970
I want that too.

370
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,320
But I don't even have the option.

371
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,280
I thought I could gladly accept
whatever my family arranged for me.

372
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,970
But after Lu Ming Yuan,

373
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,100
I became afraid.

374
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,990
I'm afraid of not having a choice

375
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,850
and being ordered around.

376
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,360
Was that why you came to the front line?

377
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,360
I don't know if this is the right decision,

378
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,770
but I want to try.

379
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:36,100
Right decision or not, it's not important.

380
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,540
What is important then?

381
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,770
Being

382
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,920
yourself

383
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,450
is very important.

384
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,854
Being myself?

385
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:52,990
No one gets to tell you
what a right or wrong decision is.

386
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,060
Only you can do that.

387
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,700
I'm hungry.

388
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,590
Han, do you want some?

389
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,970
Is it edible?

390
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,700
It's delicious.

391
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,150
Han, you've always been a lucky person.

392
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,840
I owe this escape to your warning.

393
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Anyway, how did you escape from the quarry?

394
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,240
I remember you have some puppet beasts.

395
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,850
Why is she asking so many questions
despite knowing all that?

396
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,880
Perhaps we can travel together

397
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,590
and serve at the front line.

398
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,190
 No way. 

399
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,670
Sure.

400
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,330
If you wish.

401
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,030
Also, your injury hasn't healed completely.

402
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,670
You should take some pills and rest up.

403
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,220
Sure.

404
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,280
- That's too much.
- No worries.

405
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,290
I have a lot of them.

406
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,800
 They are extra potent Oblivion Pills. 

407
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,970
 Forgive me, Senior Chen. 

408
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,510
 Please forget everything
that happened in the quarry. 

409
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,930
 I can't let anyone know
about the teleport array and the gem vault. 

410
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,440
 All right. 

411
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,500
 She should be safe now. 

412
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,880
 I've spent a lot of power
after those grueling battles. 

413
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,440
 I need to find a place to recuperate 

414
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,990
 and reinforce my training
before I head into the war. 

415
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:58,030
 Returning to Yellow Maple Valley right now
isn't a great idea. 

416
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,770
 Golden Drum Plains it is. 

417
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,398
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

418
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:31,340
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

419
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,780
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

420
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,280
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

421
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,641
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

422
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:45,426
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

423
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:52,220
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

424
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:57,760
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

425
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,326
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

426
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:03,760
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

427
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,000
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

428
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,440
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

429
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,561
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

430
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:17,080
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

431
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,960
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

432
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,060
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

433
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,340
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

434
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,400
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

435
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,840
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

436
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,761
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

437
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:41,320
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

438
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,460
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

439
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,580
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

440
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:50,920
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

441
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,715
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

442
00:46:54,715 --> 00:47:00,820
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

443
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,252
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

444
00:47:04,252 --> 00:47:07,640
 ♫ we call eternity ♫ 

445
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:13,652
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

446
00:47:13,652 --> 00:47:17,360
 ♫ called eternity ♫
