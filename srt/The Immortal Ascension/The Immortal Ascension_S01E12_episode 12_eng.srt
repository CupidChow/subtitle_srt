1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,505
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:27,164
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:29,185
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:32,570
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,152
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:38,000
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,998
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:46,534
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:51,007
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:56,214
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,250
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,730
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,295
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:14,000
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,780
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,080
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,200
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,479
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:29,960
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,060
 

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,921
 Wang Yu was speaking the truth. 

25
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,011
 She's not as ordinary as I thought. 

26
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,040
Show yourself.

27
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,820
That sickening beast is dead.

28
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,570
I'll tame you and make you our sect gatekeeper.

29
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,760
Since I've captured its primordial spirit,

30
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,900
you may have its body.

31
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,350
This Tier Two Demon Beast
is literally a treasure trove.

32
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,430
Its hide is already impenetrable.

33
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,640
I just don't know

34
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,980
if you can break through its carapace.

35
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,430
You're just a young cultivator
at the Qi Refining Stage.

36
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,150
But you have quite a lot of artifacts, huh?

37
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,130
Will you kill me and steal them from me?

38
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,640
To you, they might be treasures.

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,820
But to me, those are just junk.

40
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,510
You're too reckless.

41
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,920
The horns and claws of Blackflood Drake

42
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,920
are excellent materials
that can be used to make top-quality artifacts.

43
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
You'll let them go to waste
if you hack it as such.

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,570
Stand back. Step aside.

45
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,910
When harvesting a Demon Beast,

46
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,860
you have to extract its inner core first.

47
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,630
 It's been too long since I've done this. 

48
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,590
 I'm not as sharp as I used to be. 

49
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,860
 But I can't afford to embarrass myself here. 

50
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,060
What is that?

51
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,960
The core of a drake should be hard and tough.

52
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,620
But this is...

53
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,300
 Consider yourself lucky. 

54
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,510
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

55
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,950
Disciples, evacuate immediately.

56
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,650
It's finally ending.

57
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,720
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

58
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,700
Disciples, evacuate immediately.

59
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,520
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

60
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,350
Disciples, evacuate immediately.

61
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,500
 What's happening to me? 

62
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,260
 They're closing the portal to Trial Ground. 

63
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,720
 Why have I slept for this long? 

64
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

65
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,240
Disciples, evacuate immediately.

66
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,780
 This won't do. I have to leave immediately. 

67
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,700
Wake up.

68
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,000
How long are you going to stay asleep?

69
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,730
It'll be too late if we don't leave now.

70
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,430
I... Have I slept for a long time?

71
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,160
That's not the point here.

72
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,310
The point is that they're closing the portal.

73
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,390
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

74
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,160
- Disciples, evacuate immediately.
- Is this already the fifth day?

75
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,780
Are they closing the portal now?

76
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,510
 What should I do with this guy? 

77
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,480
 Should I silence him right now 

78
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,650
 so that he won't spout nonsense outside? 

79
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,270
Aren't you going to leave?

80
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,600
That was the Blackflood Drake's lust sack.

81
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,240
I didn't expect it to be a male drake,
which was quite rare.

82
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,080
Contact by any female will cause it to release

83
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,100
an aphrodisiacal poison mist.

84
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,440
You should know well the kind of person I am.

85
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,440
What happened between us
was merely a misunderstanding.

86
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,870
Just treat it as a dream.

87
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,380
I understand.

88
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,720
If you dare to tell anyone what happened today...

89
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,570
Nobody else will know.

90
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,550
I'll take the chest with me.

91
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,960
I suppose you have no objections.

92
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,650
Not at all.

93
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,260
What about the spirit herbs?

94
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,260
I'll take the Blood Spirit Flower.

95
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,170
You can have the rest of it.

96
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,500
 The Celestial Essence Fruit, it's finally mine. 

97
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,360
You'd better stop now.

98
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,100
We're running out of time.

99
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,897
This path is blocked off.

100
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,507
Do you have any solutions?

101
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,050
I do.

102
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,790
But thanks to you, my power is entirely depleted.

103
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,790
Therefore, you have to open a path.

104
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,630
Your power is entirely depleted?

105
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,960
How is that possible?

106
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,570
How dare you ask me that?

107
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,140
It doesn't look that way to me.

108
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,480
Hurry! If we don't make it out,

109
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,500
we'll be trapped here for 60 years!

110
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,440
- Hurry!
- Run for your life!

111
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,510
The portal to Trial Ground will be closed soon.

112
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,410
Disciples, evacuate immediately.

113
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,080
Grandmaster!

114
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,380
Slow down! Don't panic!

115
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,100
Grandmaster!

116
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,480
Hurry! Hurry!

117
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,960
Where are the rest of you?

118
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,220
Hurry!

119
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,510
My Golden Brick Talisman
actually broke just after two uses.

120
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,670
Which is more important?
The talisman or your life?

121
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,000
Both are equally as important.

122
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,620
What a moneygrubber.

123
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,351
I'm Han Li.

124
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,356
What's your name?

125
00:15:36,356 --> 00:15:38,387
You'll be trapped here for the next 60 years

126
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:41,217
if you don't make it out by nightfall.

127
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,750
May I know your name?

128
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,790
I'm Han Li.

129
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,330
"Li", as in erecting a tombstone.

130
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,790
I was just asking.

131
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,740
It's fine if you don't want to answer me.

132
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:59,790
I'm Nangong Wan.

133
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,840
I'm Han Li.

134
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,270
I don't care what your name is.

135
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,910
We'll be complete strangers
once we leave this place.

136
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,150
Nangong Wan, if, one day, you're in any danger,

137
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,720
I'll surely come to your aid.

138
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,320
You should tend to yourself first.

139
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,020
Do not find me again.

140
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,080
Time is almost up!

141
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,790
The portal will be closed soon!

142
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,510
I don't think anyone else is coming out.

143
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,120
It's not nightfall yet.

144
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,200
Let's wait a little longer.

145
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,550
I'm sure anyone who's still alive

146
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,440
has exited the portal long ago.

147
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,900
Fellow peers, I and the Moonshadow Sect
shall make a move first.

148
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,900
Han Li?

149
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,290
That was a tough trip.

150
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
Is this how you lead your team?

151
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,150
Are these all of the members you have left?

152
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,650
Let's go!

153
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,150
 Seems like this trial was perilous indeed. 

154
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,410
 So many disciples have ended up as casualties. 

155
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,670
 Nangong Wan. 

156
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,570
 Has she already left? 

157
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,580
Did you get anything out of it?

158
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,360
 I shouldn't show them too much. 

159
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,260
 If not, they'll suspect me. 

160
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,650
Is that the Celestial Essence Fruit?

161
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,980
Old gambling addict,

162
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,290
you should accept your loss.

163
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,460
Take these!

164
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,370
Let's return now.

165
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:27,480
Let's go.

166
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,370
How did you manage to obtain these spirit herbs?

167
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,440
Grandmaster, I followed your advice

168
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,640
upon entering the portal.

169
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,880
I avoided conflicts

170
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,270
and focused on finding spirit herbs.

171
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,020
In the end, by a stroke of luck,

172
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,440
I encountered several peers

173
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,640
from other sects who fought fierce battles.

174
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,570
I picked up the spirit herbs they left behind.

175
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,050
So, you picked them up on the way, huh?

176
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,740
You're quite lucky.

177
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,810
Come here.

178
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,160
From today onward, you shall serve me

179
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,020
as one of my disciples.

180
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,960
Thank you, Grandmaster.

181
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,030
Why are you still calling me that?

182
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,420
- You should address me as Master.
- Yes, Master.

183
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,160
Greetings, Master.

184
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,850
I'm Han Li.

185
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,170
Your name is Han Li, huh?

186
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,260
Get up here.

187
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:12,130
Han Li, come to my side.

188
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,720
 So many people had died during this trial. 

189
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,840
 On the path of cultivation, 

190
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,080
 one wrong move leads to utter ruin. 

191
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,270
 He didn't get ahead of himself. 

192
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,640
 And, he's grieving over the loss of his peers. 

193
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,780
 He seems like a good-natured boy. 

194
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,934
This is the path of cultivation.

195
00:21:54,934 --> 00:21:57,344
There are many different sights along the way.

196
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,520
Since you managed to survive,

197
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,870
you should be more open-minded.

198
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,060
That is what it means to have clarity of thought.

199
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:12,100
You can have this Qingyuan Sword Manual
as our meeting gift.

200
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,720
But you can only practice it
during the Qi Refining Stage.

201
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,630
Do not practice it excessively.

202
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,830
I'll select another art for you

203
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,370
once you reach the Foundation Establishment Stage
in the future.

204
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,020
Thank you, Master.

205
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,800
Master.

206
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,780
I have something to report to you.

207
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,930
You may speak.

208
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,870
When I was at Bloody Trial Ground,

209
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,340
I encountered several sect members
of Spirit Beast Mountain.

210
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,870
They were behaving sneakily.

211
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,540
It didn't feel like
they were official sect members.

212
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,110
Tell me the details.

213
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,390
Most of the techniques they used

214
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,190
were related to the arts of toxic
and demonic cultivation.

215
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,630
They were ruthless.

216
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,630
They didn't try to steal spirit herbs.
They merely killed.

217
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,780
They didn't even spare their fellow sect members.

218
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,030
 Could they be the troublemakers? 

219
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,560
Han Li.

220
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,910
You reported your findings to me.

221
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,765
That deserves praise.

222
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,696
However, this is a huge deal.

223
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:23,234
Do not let anyone know about this.

224
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:25,044
Yes, Master.

225
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,280
 Could the major casualties 

226
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,300
 be related to this incident? 

227
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,820
You've been behaving strangely
upon returning from Bloody Trial Ground.

228
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,110
It's either you're in a daze

229
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,520
or you vent your frustrations on the chest.

230
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,370
That's not true.

231
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,660
You're still denying it?

232
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
I spent so much effort just to procure this chest.

233
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,870
But now, I can't unlock it.

234
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,690
How could I not be frustrated?

235
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,481
I told you not to suppress your powers
before heading inside.

236
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:14,364
You didn't heed my advice.

237
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:16,824
Now, things have taken an unexpected turn.

238
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,559
Has the Blood Spirit Flower
been delivered to Yan Clan Stronghold?

239
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:26,749
Did you forget?

240
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:29,189
The first thing you did upon exiting Trial Ground

241
00:25:29,189 --> 00:25:31,729
was instructing Qing
to head to Yan Clan Stronghold.

242
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:36,008
Judging by the time, she should arrive soon.

243
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,709
Wan.

244
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,779
Be honest with me.

245
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,669
What exactly happened at Trial Ground?

246
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:51,469
It feels like you've changed.

247
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:53,859
Why have you lost all of your powers?

248
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:57,079
Even the Maiden Cycle Technique
doesn't have such an effect on its practitioner.

249
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:01,669
It's the fault of the Blackflood Drake.

250
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:03,749
And, someone even cut off my escape route

251
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:06,029
when I engaged it in combat.

252
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:08,529
If not, I would've never ended up
in such a pathetic state.

253
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,354
If so, how did you manage to escape by yourself?

254
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:13,854
Han.

255
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:19,779
I suspect that some evil forces managed
to sneak in during the trip to Trial Ground.

256
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:23,379
If not, there wouldn't be that many casualties.

257
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:26,599
Are you referring to the demonic sects?

258
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:32,779
And, they entered Trial Ground
right under our noses.

259
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:35,099
I'm afraid they've infiltrated
the Seven Sects long ago.

260
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:39,209
Maybe Moonshadow Sect was jeopardized as well.

261
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,580
Members of the demonic sects aren't that rare.

262
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:51,909
Just let them be.

263
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,709
Nothing major will go wrong for now

264
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:56,779
as long as we're holding the fort in our sect.

265
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:58,559
But those disciples...

266
00:27:00,989 --> 00:27:03,859
Look at the state you're in.

267
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,669
Even if the demonic sects were to invade us now,

268
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:07,969
do you think you can deal with them?

269
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:10,509
Right now, your priority

270
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:12,809
is to restore your powers as soon as possible.

271
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:16,669
Although it's a shame
that many of our sect members

272
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,269
failed to make it out alive,

273
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,859
the world is unpredictable after all.

274
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:22,269
We can only pin our hopes on those who survived.

275
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:25,099
May they progress more smoothly

276
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:27,359
on the path of cultivation.

277
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:34,469
- I am Zhong Wu.
- I am Zhong Shu.

278
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:36,379
We're here to congratulate you, Young Master.

279
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:37,509
Speak.

280
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:40,229
Young Master, I think I've somewhat
accomplished the task

281
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:42,859
that you've assigned to me.

282
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:44,749
The cultivators of the Seven Sects..
No, I mean...

283
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:46,339
The fools of the Seven Sects.

284
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:47,469
Around 70% of them were killed.

285
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:49,469
They were Qi Refining Stage experts.

286
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:51,379
Their foundation has definitely been damaged.

287
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,619
So, for the remaining 30%,

288
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:55,429
do you expect me to deal with them for you?

289
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:57,269
Young Master, please be appeased.

290
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:58,749
The final battle is nearing. Forget about 30%.

291
00:27:58,749 --> 00:28:00,469
I'll deal with them for you
even if there are 3,000% of them left...

292
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:02,819
- Shut up.
- I...

293
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:04,619
Young Master, please be appeased.

294
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,809
Have you accomplished the task I assigned you?

295
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,619
He means the herb.

296
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:11,079
I have.

297
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:15,709
You passed.

298
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:17,859
Seems like you're not entirely useless.

299
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:20,009
At least you're somewhat useful.

300
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:23,189
Young Master, thank you for the praise!

301
00:28:23,189 --> 00:28:24,709
Hurry and return to Spirit Beast Mountain.

302
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,949
Go and instigate the fools of Seven Sects.

303
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:28,779
Persuade them to join Ghost Spirit Sect.

304
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,339
It's best if they're
at the Foundation Establishment Stage.

305
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:32,139
- Roger that!
- Stop shouting!

306
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:33,909
You have to be discreet.

307
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:35,809
Just wait and see.

308
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,229
What a talent.

309
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:48,389
Young Master, you have excellent taste!

310
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:13,669
The two sect members
who returned from Bloody Trial Ground

311
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,669
had been kneeling there for one night.

312
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:17,829
You should see them.

313
00:29:18,949 --> 00:29:20,579
How dare they come back

314
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:22,559
without the Blood Spirit Flower?

315
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,539
Elder Liu.

316
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:38,159
Is there still no news from the Seven Sects?

317
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:44,909
The trip to Bloody Trial Ground
ended a few days ago.

318
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,779
Logically speaking, the Blood Spirit Flower

319
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:49,529
should've arrived at its destination by now.

320
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:09,469
Are you the contact of Yan Clan Stronghold?

321
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:11,749
I'm here to see Lord of the Yan Clan Stronghold

322
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:13,639
under the order
of the Moonshadow Sect's sect leader.

323
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:28,449
Young Master, this is the Blood Spirit Flower.

324
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,319
Elders, I appreciate the effort.

325
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,800
I suppose they managed to harvest it as well.

326
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,860
Who's daring enough
to cause trouble in our territory?

327
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:48,919
The Blood Spirit Flower?

328
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:15,599
Elder Liu, don't be scared.

329
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:19,489
I just wish to be your friend.

330
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,009
My Lord.

331
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:36,289
My Lord, do you still remember
the guy from Ghost Spirit Sect?

332
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:39,029
He has found us again.

333
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:42,159
This time, he said he's able to save Young Lady.

334
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:45,319
Are you willing to see him?

335
00:31:56,779 --> 00:31:58,399
Please.

336
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:24,709
You dare to come here alone even though

337
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,619
you're merely at the Mid Foundation Stage.

338
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:28,769
You're pretty bold, aren't you?

339
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:33,989
To express my sincerity,
I've prepared a humble gift.

340
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:35,859
It's meant for Young Lady.

341
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,909
Forget about the gift.

342
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:42,209
Right now, what she requires the most is a herb.

343
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:45,429
I have the Blood Spirit Flower as well.

344
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:46,859
But it can't cure the root of the problem.

345
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:49,099
And, one's foundation
will be damaged upon consumption.

346
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:53,989
I'm afraid she'll never be able to pass
the Core Formation Stage for the rest of her life.

347
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:57,269
Lord Yan, can you bear for that to happen?

348
00:32:57,269 --> 00:32:58,759
What do you mean?

349
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,709
Don't tell me you have other solutions.

350
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,619
Naturally.

351
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:04,976
The Ghost Spirit Sect practices a unique art.

352
00:33:04,976 --> 00:33:07,229
It's much more effective
than the Blood Spirit Flower.

353
00:33:07,229 --> 00:33:09,749
Not only can it
help your daughter to regain consciousness,

354
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:12,879
but it can also cure her
of her chronic ailment permanently.

355
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:19,139
Young boy, no matter how flustered I am,

356
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:21,399
I won't resort to such dubious methods.

357
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,859
Young Lady's condition won't get any worse.

358
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:28,619
Lord Yan, you should let me give it a go.

359
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,909
If it doesn't work,
you can use the Blood Spirit Flower

360
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,559
to treat her by then.

361
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,539
Speak.

362
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,159
What conditions do you have?

363
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,260
I want the Yan Clan Stronghold

364
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,639
to be my ally.

365
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:56,779
 I finally returned alive from Bloody Trial Ground. 

366
00:33:58,109 --> 00:33:59,809
Han.

367
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,379
What are you doing here?

368
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,379
I'm here to check on you.

369
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:13,209
I heard that many people
had died at Bloody Trial Ground.

370
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:16,749
Indeed.

371
00:34:16,749 --> 00:34:20,299
Aren't we practicing cultivation
to attain immortality?

372
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:23,299
What's the point of us losing our lives

373
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:25,669
just to obtain the Foundation Pill?

374
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:29,049
There are many magnificent sights in the world.

375
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:34,839
Go and check them out on my behalf.

376
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,106
I suppose this is the path of cultivation.

377
00:34:40,106 --> 00:34:41,816
On this path,

378
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:44,969
one will witness all kinds of sights.

379
00:34:47,509 --> 00:34:50,599
When you put it that way, I think it makes sense.

380
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:55,819
However, you actually came back in one piece.

381
00:34:55,819 --> 00:34:57,319
That's great.

382
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:01,729
I was merely lucky.

383
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,737
Master Mo, I think I understand
a little of what you said before.

384
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,040
 ♫ Time and time again, it never changes ♫ 

385
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:26,029
He addressed us as Mentors before this.

386
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:27,669
Now, he's Master's disciple.

387
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:29,509
Now, he'll address us as seniors.

388
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:30,779
Our ranks have been lowered.

389
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:32,189
I would rather let him address me as Senior.

390
00:35:32,189 --> 00:35:34,989
Mentor sounds old.

391
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:37,139
I think someone arrived before us.

392
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:39,559
They're sitting quite intimately as well.

393
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,800
 ♫ I'm a speck of dust in the sky ♫ 

394
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,259
Don't tell me you're jealous.

395
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:50,219
That's right. I'm jealous.

396
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:53,259
You're not related to Xuan Er by any means.

397
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:54,769
Who said so?

398
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:58,485
 ♫ Unafraid of the winding journey ♫ 

399
00:35:58,485 --> 00:36:02,045
 ♫ We promised to enter the dream together ♫ 

400
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:09,489
 ♫ I fight only for you for the rest of my life ♫ 

401
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:12,314
 Han Li. 

402
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:15,400
 I heard that Master has taken you as his disciple. 

403
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,260
 If so, I guess we're seniors and juniors now. 

404
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,769
 Han, let's get into a fight one day. 

405
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:29,349
 Han, I heard that your trip
to Blood Trial Ground was a harrowing one. 

406
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:31,289
 You should rest and recuperate. 

407
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:33,619
 Do your best to cultivate. 

408
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:35,634
 Don't embarrass our master. 

409
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:38,640
 ♫ Searching and searching ♫ 

410
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,400
 ♫ For your whereabouts ♫ 

411
00:36:44,129 --> 00:36:47,809
 ♫ Fate can besiege me ♫ 

412
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:52,320
 ♫ With a thousand obstacles ♫ 

413
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,681
 ♫ Courage turn ♫ 

414
00:36:55,681 --> 00:37:00,240
 ♫ Into a thousand sails ♫ 

415
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,120
 ♫ The fate is sealed when we lock eyes ♫ 

416
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,800
 ♫ Never turning back on this wayward journey ♫ 

417
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,049
 ♫ Looking back at shared memories ♫ 

418
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:10,394
 ♫ The long night ends ♫ 

419
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:15,514
 ♫ As I fly to the shore where you belong ♫ 

420
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,249
 My name is Han Li! 

421
00:37:30,909 --> 00:37:32,259
 This is so annoying. 

422
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:35,209
 If this keeps up, it'll take ages
before I can form a new core. 

423
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,731
 I'm Han Li. 

424
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:51,301
 What's your name? 

425
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:56,319
 May I know your name? 

426
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:00,619
 I'm Han Li. 

427
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:02,169
 "Li", as in erecting a tombstone. 

428
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:04,949
 This is so annoying. 

429
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,509
 Once I'm done with my retreat, 

430
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:08,219
 the first thing I'll do is to kill you. 

431
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,249
 I'll erect a tombstone for you after that. 

432
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,309
If having one Foundation Pill isn't secure enough,

433
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:41,309
I'll create 10 of them.

434
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:42,879
Maybe even 20 of them.

435
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:08,909
 I must reach Tier 13 as soon as possible 

436
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:11,169
 while waiting for the spirit herbs to ripen. 

437
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:40,469
I haven't even landed yet.

438
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:42,139
Why is there already a banquet?

439
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:46,539
I suppose your aunt prepared
the welcoming banquet for you.

440
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:47,989
As if.

441
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:50,509
She doesn't care about me that much.

442
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:52,439
Indeed.

443
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:04,469
 

444
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,029
Chan, you're here.

445
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,059
You really know how to show up at the right time.

446
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:09,139
Great timing.

447
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:10,739
The banquet just started.

448
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:12,059
Who are we holding this celebration for?

449
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:14,429
Of course it's for me and your uncle-in-law.

450
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:16,829
We won our first battle in the Jiang Kingdom.

451
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:18,259
Once we take down Jiang Kingdom,

452
00:40:18,259 --> 00:40:20,429
Cheqi Kingdom will be next.

453
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:23,139
After that, the Imperial Capital.

454
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:26,519
Aunt Hong Fen, the Imperial Capital is mine.

455
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:30,359
"The Imperial Capital is mine."

456
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:36,429
You just managed
to kill some of the righteous sects'

457
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:38,989
Qi Refining Stage sect members
at Bloody Trial Ground.

458
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:40,869
Look at how smug you are.

459
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:42,699
You command 50,000 elite troops.

460
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:44,829
You begged and scraped and nearly killed yourself

461
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:46,389
just to win this one battle.

462
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:48,249
And now, you're actually holding a celebration?

463
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:51,949
When it comes to being thick-skinned,

464
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,249
Aunt Hong Fen, I'm indeed no match for you.

465
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:59,029
Hong Fen! Don't be angry.

466
00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:00,869
Your nephew doesn't harbor any ill intentions.

467
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:02,959
Indeed.

468
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:05,989
By the way,

469
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:09,649
I heard that you've been visiting
the Yan Clan Stronghold quite frequently.

470
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:14,099
No wonder you're so bent
on getting the Imperial Capital.

471
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,219
Don't tell me you fell
for the clan leader's daughter.

472
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:19,259
And that you want to marry into their clan

473
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:21,519
and become a live-in son-in-law.

474
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:26,579
How did she find out about
what I did at the Yan Clan Stronghold?

475
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:27,989
Young Master, please calm down.

476
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:30,429
Your aunt has spies
all across the Tiannan Continent.

477
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:31,869
She would've found out eventually

478
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:33,509
even if we kept the news from her.

479
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:34,869
Indeed.

480
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:36,359
Fine, fine.

481
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:38,659
I understand.

482
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:42,509
But you see, I have a mouth too.

483
00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:44,349
Can you let me break the news personally
in the future?

484
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:46,659
Just remember to keep your mouth shut.

485
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:50,789
- Yes, Young Master.
- Indeed.

486
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:53,179
And, can you two learn

487
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,619
how to speak formally, even just a little?

488
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:56,909
When I bring you two to the Yan Clan Stronghold,

489
00:41:56,909 --> 00:41:58,399
you speak with a weird dialect

490
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,709
while yours is even weirder.

491
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:05,399
You must be kidding me.

492
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:30,129
 The Violet Monkey Blossom is finally ripe. 

493
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:38,989
I have enough herbs for the formula.

494
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,209
I have the formula for the Foundation Pill too.

495
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:46,030
With these, I have enough
to create over ten Foundation Pills.

496
00:42:57,099 --> 00:42:59,829
I've finally reached Tier 13.

497
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:01,729
Now, I just need to reach
the Foundation Establishment Stage.

498
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,762
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

499
00:43:23,762 --> 00:43:29,673
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

500
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:33,120
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

501
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,585
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

502
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:38,946
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

503
00:43:38,946 --> 00:43:43,720
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

504
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:50,440
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

505
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,171
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

506
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:59,682
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

507
00:43:59,682 --> 00:44:02,160
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

508
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,280
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

509
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,721
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

510
00:44:09,721 --> 00:44:12,842
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

511
00:44:12,842 --> 00:44:15,366
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

512
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:18,329
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

513
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:22,200
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

514
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,640
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

515
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,843
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

516
00:44:28,843 --> 00:44:32,084
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

517
00:44:32,084 --> 00:44:36,240
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

518
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,680
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

519
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,800
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

520
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,920
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

521
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,160
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

522
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,040
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

523
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,160
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

524
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,652
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

525
00:45:02,652 --> 00:45:06,000
 ♫ we call eternity ♫ 

526
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,932
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

527
00:45:11,932 --> 00:45:15,720
 ♫ called eternity ♫
