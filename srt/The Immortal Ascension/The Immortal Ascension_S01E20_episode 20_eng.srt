1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,465
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:27,115
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,184
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,569
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:36,179
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,920
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,014
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:46,510
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,008
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:56,229
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,297
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:05,777
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:10,256
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:13,697
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:15,803
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:18,040
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,120
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,800
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,991
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,480
 

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,710
Ni Chang, why stop me from leading the disciples?

25
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,190
Do you really think if we don't fight back,

26
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,130
the demonic sects will spare us?

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,328
Look at you. You're good at everything,
except knowing when to quit.

28
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:53,800
The Six Demonic Sects are too powerful.

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,959
We, the Seven Sects, can't compare.

30
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,689
Even if we give it our all,

31
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,369
we still won't stand a chance.

32
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,799
Better to hold our ground
and preserve our strength.

33
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,249
They're after cultivation resources.

34
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,959
They likely won't come after us.

35
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,599
Ni Chang, if they take the Yue Kingdom

36
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,489
and start rounding up
spirit-rooted mortals, then what?

37
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:15,680
I don't know if that counts as resources,

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,999
but I do know we can't just stand by.

39
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,719
Aren't you afraid that if we go too far,

40
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,039
some Nascent Soul elder will step in

41
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,129
and get someone you care about killed?

42
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,639
That won't happen.

43
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,889
When in doubt, retreat first.

44
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:31,679
Besides, most Nascent Soul cultivators

45
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,249
don't bother with worldly affairs.

46
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:36,059
They won't waste time coming after us.

47
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,639
Since logic won't work, I'll just tell you.

48
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,409
The demonic sects run wild.

49
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,049
But do you know why
none of the Nascent Soul elders

50
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:44,329
from the Seven Sects are stepping in?

51
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,939
Simple.

52
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,299
They know they'll lose.

53
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,520
In the cultivation world, strength rules.

54
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,240
Below Nascent Soul, we're all ants.

55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Our elders once fought Grandmaster Yun Lu

56
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,440
of the Six Demonic Sects.

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,010
They lost.

58
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,010
To avoid a larger war,

59
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,520
they cut a deal and both sides agreed that

60
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,380
no Nascent Soul cultivators can join this war.

61
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,981
So it's true.

62
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:20,988
I thought the war had just begun,

63
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,830
but it was already over.

64
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,880
Peace lasted too long.

65
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,410
We're like kids flashing treasure,

66
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,360
just asking to get robbed.

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,320
It's not just the demonic sects.

68
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Even the Righteous Alliance is eyeing us.

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,520
They're all waiting for the demonic sects
to invade Yue,

70
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,940
so they can swoop in while we bleed.

71
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,360
Ni Chang,

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,350
are you really
going to watch as Yue Kingdom burns?

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
I knew you'd say that.

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,410
So, I'm giving you one year.

75
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,658
One year?

76
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:58,440
For one year, whatever you want to do,

77
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,130
slay demons or save mortals,

78
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,440
I won't interfere.

79
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,250
But, the sect won't offer much support.

80
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,920
The Grand Elder made the decision.

81
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,820
I can't go against it too far.

82
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,310
Your words are more
than enough for me.

83
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,700
Take care of yourself.

84
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,920
If the outcome is already set,

85
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,040
then my duty is to save as many as I can.

86
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,150
Ni Chang, I'll make the most of this year
you've given me.

87
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,370
 

88
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,760
The Seven Sects are getting cocky lately.

89
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,480
This month alone, we've lost over 20 men.

90
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,130
Eyes wide, all of you.

91
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,310
Don't walk into their ambushes!

92
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,040
No way.

93
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,790
In broad daylight?

94
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,430
 ♫ Heaven and Earth, the sacred path,
the root of all creation ♫ 

95
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,030
 ♫ Through endless trials I train,
to awaken my true power ♫ 

96
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,710
 ♫ Within and beyond all realms,

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,310
 ♫ Golden light surrounds me,

98
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,910
 ♫ It can't be seen, it can't be heard ♫ 

99
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,550
 ♫ It holds the world, and gives life to all ♫ 

100
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,190
 ♫ Chanted a thousand times,
it makes my spirit shine ♫ 

101
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,190
 ♫ The Three Realms guard my path,

102
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,830
 ♫ All the immortal bow,

103
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,750
 ♫ All the immortal bow,
even thunder serves me ♫ 

104
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,510
 ♫ Demons tremble in fear,
spirits are out of my sight ♫ 

105
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,150
 ♫ Demons tremble in fear,
spirits are out of my sight ♫ 

106
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,750
 ♫ Thunder resides in me,

107
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,390
 ♫ Wisdom flows through me,

 ♫ Golden rays blaze out,

 ♫ But who can see the truth? ♫

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,510
 ♫ I won't let the world decide ♫

 ♫ What I must look like ♫ 

116
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,910
 ♫ I'll show what I'm made of ♫

00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,070
 ♫ And break through every trap ♫ 

118

 ♫ My will stays unshaken ♫

 ♫ The road is full of perils... ♫ 

121
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,200
 What's with the demonic sects? 

122
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,710
 Lately, the ones they send are all nobodies. 

123
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,430
 ♫ Leave behind a fearless soul ♫ 

124
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,230
 

125
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,870
 ♫ Through endless trials I train,

126
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,510
 ♫ Within and beyond all realms,
only the Dao stands above ♫ 

127
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,110
 ♫ Golden light surrounds me,
wrapping me in its glow ♫ 

128
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,750
 ♫ It can't be seen, it can't be heard ♫ 

129
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,110
 ♫ It holds the world, and gives life to all ♫ 

130
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,200
 Since the Yan Clan Stronghold incident, 

131
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,910
 this war has been going on for a year. 

132
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:41,813
 The battles have shifted from large-scale attacks 

133
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:44,233
 to a prolonged stalemate. 

134
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,130
 Once the Seven Sects moved to defense, 

135
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,800
 many former rear-line regions 

136
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,580
 were exposed to fierce assaults
by the demonic sects' forces. 

137
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,240
 Compared to their endless waves of troops, 

138
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,770
 our reinforcements are far fewer. 

139
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,280
 Mostly Foundation Establishment 

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,770
 and Qi Refining Stage cultivators. 

141
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,240
 Core Formation cultivators on both sides 

142
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,920
 seem to be staying out of it. 

143
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,210
 But sneak attacks, duels, and even assassinations 

144
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,140
 among disciples are nonstop. 

145
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,000
 All my seniors fought in the big battle
early this year. 

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,220
 Making it out alive was no small feat. 

147
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,160
 To me, this is a good chance 

148
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,400
 to stabilize my cultivation and sharpen my skills. 

149
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,570
 I even picked up some gems and artifacts. 

150
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,409
 But fighting like this, 

151
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,479
 will it really lead anywhere? 

152
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,920
Remember the royal heirs

153
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,800
from the Jiang and Cheqi Kingdoms?

154
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,530
I've arranged a way out for them.

155
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,210
Now it's up to you to escort them somewhere safe.

156
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,530
Where are we taking them?

157
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,110
To the Nine Kingdoms Alliance.

158
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,580
So you already found an escape route for our sect?

159
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,040
Only moving forward and never retreating,

160
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,790
that'll cost us dearly.

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,690
 You think one step back leads to peace? 

162
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,840
 For the Seven Sects, it means nothing but ruin. 

163
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,000
 Those old geezers
probably secured their own exit long ago. 

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,640
 It's just a shame the ordinary disciples 

165
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,780
 are dying on the front lines for nothing. 

166
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,480
 Moonshadow Sect will survive 

167
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,570
 under the Sect Leader's guidance. 

168
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:35,210
 But me, I'm just a noisy bird, chirping away 

169
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,680
 yet unable to change anything. 

170
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,910
 I can't save anyone either. 

171
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:47,962
Han Li...

172
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:54,544
I shouldn't be thinking of him.

173
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,290
 Where did you run off to? 

174
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,170
 Where were you? 

175
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,690
 We're still in the middle
of a war, yet you lofty types 

176
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,840
 just vanish? 

177
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,020
 I've held this in for so long. 

178
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,410
 Since we'll never meet again, 

179
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,230
 I might as well get it off my chest. 

180
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:13,931
 You're finally willing to talk to me? 

181
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:17,410
 As long as you're willing to speak, 

182
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,830
 I don't care what it's about. 

183
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,640
 Before the war started, 

184
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,710
 the Seven Sects and the demonic sects
signed a secret deal. 

185
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:28,540
 Don't say stuff that sensitive out loud. 

186
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,090
 At this point, the whole war
is following that deal. 

187
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,900
 The Seven Sects surrendered. 

188
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,620
 Gave in before the fighting even started? 

189
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,170
 That's not like you. 

190
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,050
 The agreement states only cultivators
below Nascent Soul can take part in this war. 

191
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,410
 Which means I can't save everyone. 

192
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,970
 We low-level disciples
are still fighting like fools. 

193
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,780
 People die every day. 

194
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,210
 And you already knew how it would end? 

195
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,990
 It's just not fair! 

196
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,110
 War isn't a game for low-level disciples, 

197
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,900
 yet they always pay the price. 

198
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:11,290
 I've lived for 300 years, 

199
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,020
 and I still don't understand it. 

200
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,470
 It's pathetic. 

201
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,000
 Don't cry. 

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,540
 You did nothing wrong. 

203
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,240
 I couldn't stop it. 

204
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,500
 I couldn't stop anything. 

205
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,840
 Don't cry. 

206
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,200
 I'm here. 

207
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,260
 Where are you? 

208
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,560
 Right here. 

209
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,180
 Right here? 

210
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,110
Grandmaster, you haven't moved for three days.

211
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:33,810
Are we almost there?

212
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,660
One hour to Golden Drum Plains.

213
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,840
Elder Chen, this stuff was left behind

214
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,210
by the Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator

215
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,230
that we three took down today.

216
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,050
He was cunning, and almost got away.

217
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,720
Luckily, the three of us
worked seamlessly together.

218
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,760
That's right.

219
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,240
We just got lucky, finding one traveling alone.

220
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,330
Last time I went solo,

221
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,570
I had to take on several demonic cultivators.

222
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,970
This is our first time here.

223
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,660
Let's all keep a low profile.

224
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,300
Why is she everywhere?

225
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,750
Han Li!

226
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,380
Long time no see!

227
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,420
Han Li,

228
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,190
did you bring me another round of generous gifts?

229
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,600
Nice job. In just three days,
you crushed five Qi Refining ones,

230
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
and a Foundation Establishment one,

231
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,470
all from the toughest Demonic Flame Sect.

232
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,290
Here, this is your merit jade slip.

233
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,840
Are you using your war credits

234
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,970
to trade for ancient texts again?

235
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,380
Appreciate it.

236
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,230
Han,

237
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,450
long time no word from you.

238
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,690
Didn't expect to see you here.

239
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,000
It's been years, Senior Chen.

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,710
Hope you've been well.

241
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,570
You too.

242
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,410
Your cultivation's clearly come a long way.

243
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,450
Congrats on taking down a Foundation
Establishment demonic cultivator.

244
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,810
I just got lucky.

245
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,750
At least I didn't come back empty-handed.

246
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,450
That's the second time
I've taken down someone at my level.

247
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,290
Congrats.

248
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,260
I've got things to do. Excuse me.

249
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,810
Why do I feel like Han Li's not the same guy
he used to be?

250
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,840
Feels like he looks down on us now.

251
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,330
Well, he's following Mentor Li now.

252
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,230
Of course he won't bother with us.

253
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,290
Mentor Li has always taken in

254
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,240
those rootless disciples like him.

255
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,570
- Weird old man.
- Enough already.

256
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,210
Where are your manners?

257
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,690
I didn't mean it like that.

258
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,520
I just meant that the guy

259
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,480
was acting all high and mighty.

260
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,052
But he's no different from us,

261
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,960
just killed a Foundation Establishment
demonic cultivator.

262
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,980
What's there to brag about?

263
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,840
Here's your war credit record.

264
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,210
Take it and go.

265
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,900
You're just making a scene.

266
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,627
Elder Chen, you're a Chen family elder.

267
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:29,050
Why are you treating outsiders better than us?

268
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,840
Don't tell me he killed
a Core Formation cultivator?

269
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't be ridiculous.

270
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,728
He clearly took out someone on our level.

271
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:40,090
Then, why are you all warm smiles to him?

272
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,600
And cold glares to us?

273
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,360
That's Han Li's 17th
Foundation Establishment-level kill.

274
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,240
His war record is outstanding.

275
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,840
17 kills?

276
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,970
No way!

277
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,290
You three just got your second one,

278
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,450
and it took all three of you.

279
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,120
Still yapping?

280
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,760
Thick-skinned, aren't you?

281
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,450
Bro... No way.

282
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,543
Qiao Qian, if you ask me,

283
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:10,760
Han Li's got solid skills
and knows when to hold back.

284
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,040
He's got a bright future.

285
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,930
If you've got any ties to him, don't let go.

286
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,530
Recruit more talents like him.

287
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,700
They'll be a great asset to our family.

288
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,950
Got it, Elder Chen.

289
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,520
 I haven't even tried out the high-grade furnace
I traded for last time. 

290
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,870
 Time to give it a go. 

291
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,650
Lust Powder...

292
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,315
Soul-Stealing Incense...

293
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,710
What twisted demonic recipes!

294
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,410
Ageless Pill?

295
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,480
Keeping you young and never aging.

296
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,070
Now that one may be worth a try.

297
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,780
Han.

298
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,580
It's much easier to talk like this.

299
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,850
Congrats. You've earned a mountain of war credits.

300
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,540
I'm genuinely envious.

301
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,260
If I remember right,
we joined the sect around the same time.

302
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,320
But in terms of cultivation,

303
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,130
you're way ahead of me now.

304
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,410
Still regarding you as my junior

305
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,580
feels a bit off, doesn't it?

306
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,130
It's fine.

307
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,130
I'm used to it anyway.

308
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,720
Once you break through again,
then I can change it.

309
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,410
Call me however you like, Senior.

310
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,690
I don't mind.

311
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,480
Did you need something here?

312
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,850
Han, are you aware of our Chen family's standing?

313
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,650
I'd like to invite you
to serve as our guest elder.

314
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,690
Here's the deposit.

315
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,170
You'll also get annual tribute later on.

316
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,970
Senior, I can't accept that.

317
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,970
My cultivation is still low, and my talent's poor.

318
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,690
Though I've luckily reached
Foundation Establishment with fake spirit roots,

319
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,412
if anything major comes up,

320
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:50,910
I may drag your clan down.

321
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,720
Senior Chen, I don't think I'm qualified

322
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,800
to serve as a guest elder.

323
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,540
And I can't accept these gems.

324
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,060
 Wait, it's her? 

325
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,580
Han.

326
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,610
Take it.

327
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,820
- You should keep it!
- I really can't.

328
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,910
Just keep it!

329
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,480
Young Master, you're truly wise and valiant,

330
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
brilliant beyond compare,
sharp-eyed and strategic,

331
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,210
always scheming, meticulously plotting...

332
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,710
Shut your mouth.

333
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,610
Any news on that person?

334
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,890
Reporting, Young Master.

335
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,760
He's gone.

336
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,040
Gone?

337
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,480
Gone!

338
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,410
Well, I mean, who knows exactly where he's gone!

339
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,500
No need to worry, Young Master.

340
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,260
I'm not worried?

341
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,780
Then you're going to worry for me?

342
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,970
 What's beyond the sea? 

343
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,500
 Aren't you curious? 

344
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,650
 The world across the sea? 

345
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,080
 I've looked into it for ages, 

346
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,230
 but I still can't figure out
where that array leads. 

347
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,850
He's over there.

348
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,020
Han! We're here!

349
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,820
Han!

350
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,240
Impressive!

351
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,650
Seniors, it's been a while.

352
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,100
Who says we missed you?

353
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:53,520
Han, if you've got no feelings for Dong Xuan Er,

354
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,580
then let her go to Wu Xuan.

355
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,970
You idiot.

356
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,890
You can't "let go" of someone you like.

357
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,800
Han, don't blame him.

358
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,860
He's upset probably because
Xuan Er gave him the cold shoulder.

359
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,580
Dong's here too?

360
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,850
Xuan Er told me not to tell you.

361
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,300
She's been grounded
by Mentor Hong Fu for quite a while now.

362
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,910
Why'd you suddenly bring her up?

363
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,100
Wei Niang, stop teasing fellow disciples.

364
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,170
Han, it's not just us who came,

365
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,850
our master is here at Golden Drum Plains too.

366
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,780
He's looking for you right now.

367
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,450
Senior, did Master mention the reason?

368
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,930
Not exactly.

369
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,190
He just said it's something important.

370
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,500
You'd better go.

371
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,850
 Even someone like Master,
a Core Formation cultivator, 

372
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,636
 came here personally to hold the line. 

373
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:59,040
 And he brought so many elite disciples too. 

374
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,410
 Looks like things here are getting worse. 

375
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,320
 This place won't stay safe for long. 

376
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,990
 I need to start planning ahead. 

377
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,390
Young Master, your concerns are perfectly valid!

378
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,370
Stupid rock! Evil rock!

379
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,430
You tripped our Young Master again...
Get over here!

380
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,280
Young Master, let's pull back.

381
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,850
We've already captured a few from the Seven Sects.

382
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,910
We may get that brat's location out of them.

383
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,900
It's her...

384
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,170
It really is you!

385
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,695
What a coincidence.

386
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:59,685
Look, of all the places,

387
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,520
we ran into each other.

388
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,670
You're really here for me?

389
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,390
Let me take a good look at you.

390
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,800
Don't give me that look.

391
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,630
Your enchantment doesn't work on me anymore.

392
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,970
Let me really get a good look.

393
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,780
Not bad.

394
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,390
Really not bad.

395
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,990
"Yun"...

396
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,000
Isn't it funny how good my instincts are?

397
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,100
From the moment I saw you, everything clicked!

398
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,950
Why aren't you saying anything?

399
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,890
Oh, yes. Speak up.

400
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,760
You freak, drop your spell and let me go now!

401
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,850
Wow, that mouth of yours.

402
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,430
Who are you calling a freak?

403
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,000
Technically, you should call me cousin, you know?

404
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,410
Back at Yan Clan Stronghold,

405
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,410
if that guy hadn't shown up,

406
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,410
I would've already claimed you.

407
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,560
Who wants to be family with a freak like you?

408
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,720
My master is Fairy Hong Fu,

409
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,610
the top Core Formation cultivator
in Yellow Maple Valley!

410
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,820
Hold up... Fairy Hong Fu?

411
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,590
She's your master?

412
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,990
Guess I hit a nerve.

413
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,290
So Fairy Hong Fu never told you about him?

414
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,560
She said nothing but still had you wear this.

415
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,890
That means, after all these years,

416
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,190
she still can't forget him.

417
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,480
She really had something with that guy.

418
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,930
What are you mumbling about?

419
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,320
I don't understand a word.

420
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,760
Let me go already!

421
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,750
No can do.

422
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,130
Joyful Union Sect owed
Ghost Spirit Sect a big favor.

423
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,910
What exactly are you planning?

424
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,950
Taking you to meet your kin.

425
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,780
Let's go.

426
00:25:57,901 --> 00:25:59,410
Let me go! You freak!

427
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,190
Where are you taking me?

428
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:09,920
Wang Yu, you're such a shameless rip-off!

429
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,052
Throwing your weight around!

430
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:14,410
Your Treasure House has branches everywhere,

431
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,650
yet you're squeezing us over a few war credits?

432
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,130
Also, that Freezing Talisman?

433
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,130
Come on, that thing's everywhere!

434
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,800
- It's barely worth two gems!
- Two gems!

435
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,480
You know how much he charged? 20!

436
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,410
- See that?
- Total rip-off!

437
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,210
- See what you've done?
- Who's the rip-off?

438
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,500
Say that again?

439
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,930
We're at war.

440
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,610
Gems are in short supply.

441
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,170
Prices had to go up.

442
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,630
That takes money.

443
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,850
Moving supplies to the front?

444
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,320
That takes money too.

445
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,370
Even the demonic sects come to my shop

446
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,970
to snatch up supplies.

447
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,000
We're way past talking about just cost price.

448
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,320
You two get that?

449
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,450
Get it?

450
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,040
You blockheads.

451
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,812
Hey, you...

452
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:59,210
Easy for you to say!

453
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:03,410
Besides, you're using war merits
to trade for my stuff.

454
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:07,800
You said you'll pay up
after beating the demonic sects.

455
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,170
Who's buying that crap?

456
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,280
- We'll settle it...
- Yeah? When?

457
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,080
In the next lifetime?

458
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,040
So yes, I run a proper business.

459
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,560
Fair trade.

460
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,720
And now I'm asking you two.

461
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,020
- Do you get it?
- Yes.

462
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,130
- Why can't we ever win an argument with him?
- You never do.

463
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,760
- I just didn't bring my A game today.
- A game?

464
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,690
You've got such a clumsy mouth,

465
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,800
and you think you can out-argue me?

466
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,480
You've got guts!

467
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,650
Hey!

468
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,930
Forget it! Wait!

469
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,480
Fine. Business is business.

470
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,540
But doesn't the bond we share mean more than that?

471
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,720
Ugh, why did you spit?

472
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,800
What's with the attitude?

473
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,000
Have you forgotten? Back when
Treasure House first opened,

474
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,320
we were the ones who helped fund it!

475
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,690
- Exactly!
- You're being ungrateful!

476
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,930
And another thing.

477
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,540
Hong Fu!

478
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,750
Why are you just staring?

479
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,630
We're talking to you!

480
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,040
If she hadn't given you
those two Foundation Pills back then,

481
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
could you have broken through?

482
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,320
- Exactly!
- Yeah.

483
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,800
We agreed that
helping fellow disciples comes first.

484
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,090
Money comes second!

485
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,320
- And now...
- Yeah!

486
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,410
You've really changed!

487
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,710
Exactly! Totally changed!

488
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,720
Not completely rotten.

489
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,650
- You've got a point.
- So, you can't forget your promise, right?

490
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,080
- Am I right?
- Your promise!

491
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,850
What happened to your promise?

492
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,930
I lost everything on this.
And you're still talking promises?

493
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,500
You really have the nerve to talk about promises?

494
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,800
Back then, I couldn't even afford pills.

495
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,320
I got stuck at Foundation Establishment,

496
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,610
while you two made it to the Core Formation Stage.

497
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,080
Core Formation cultivators like you

498
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,480
don't understand what low-level cultivators
have to go through.

499
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Speak only when you know the struggle.

500
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,560
Understand?

501
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,610
Or not?

502
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,860
No!

503
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,890
You dare say you've suffered
as a low-level cultivator?

504
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,970
I do.

505
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,080
Add up everything you own!

506
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,760
You're richer than all of Yellow Maple Valley!

507
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,800
That's mine.

508
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,280
Enough to buy two Clear Void Sects!

509
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,800
Exactly!

510
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,560
Look at you, "exactly," huh?

511
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,780
Figure out a way or give it up.

512
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,470
Oh yeah!

513
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,610
- I can't take it anymore. And you?
- I've been done with him!

514
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,480
Fine.

515
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,450
Today, I am going to bully you.

516
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,560
I'll show you what real hardship feels like
for a cultivator!

517
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
- Core crushing Foundation!
- Get back here!

518
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,610
- Core crushing Foundation!
- Stop right there!

519
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,280
- Don't run!
- Core crushing Foundation!

520
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,320
Quit running! Face me!

521
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,720
- Where's your honor?
- Enough!

522
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,670
Hua Yuan, show some dignity.

523
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,760
Hong Fu's right. Dignity matters.

524
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,500
- She meant you!
- She meant both of you.

525
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,320
Fine, we won't bully you.

526
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,000
How about a little friendly match?

527
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,610
If we win, you give us
those supplies at half price.

528
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,020
What kind of match?

529
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,410
Mahjong?

530
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,760
Wait.

531
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,520
Are we still using that same old set?

532
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,000
- No, not anymore.
- Good.

533
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,240
This one's even better.

534
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,920
It's made from a Tier Four beast shell,

535
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,470
expertly crafted over six months
by our sect's top artisan.

536
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,582
Not only insanely durable,

537
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:36,480
but also completely blocks spirit sense detection.

538
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,800
That's amazing!

539
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,410
But I just did a little divining.

540
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,930
Today's not my lucky day.

541
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,930
I'll lose. Sorry, I'm off now.

542
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,200
Hey, Fu Yun Zi!

543
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,373
Fu Yun Zi!

544
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:48,890
We're one short!
How can we play mahjong like this?

545
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,410
- Bad hand!
- You always win. Why are you running?

546
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,760
- He's always like this.
- Bad hand!

547
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,850
And you'd sided with him against me!

548
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,340
Why?

549
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,190
Don't even bring him up. You're worse than he is!

550
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,520
All right then.

551
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,890
Let's play.

552
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,230
We're still one short. How?

553
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,220
 Wait, it's him? 

554
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,970
My name is Wang Yu,
the shopkeeper of Treasure House.

555
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,410
You can call me Li Fei Yu.

556
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,000
 With all the disguise I wore that day 

557
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,800
 and using the name Li Fei Yu, 

558
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,440
 he probably won't recognize me. 

559
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,740
 I'd better go. 

560
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,230
Kid!

561
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,580
Get over here!

562
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,370
- Forgot how to play already?
- You even know how to play?

563
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,890
Once we start, I'll use Telepathy.

564
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,480
Just pass me whatever tile I want.

565
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,100
- Master...
- Let's go.

566
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,610
We've got all four now.

567
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,450
Greetings, Mentor Hong Fu.

568
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,100
This is my disciple.

569
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,390
My name is Han Li,
"Li" as in setting up a monument.

570
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,480
This is Wang Yu, "Wang" as in forgetting.

571
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,470
He's the owner of Treasure House.

572
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,930
Enough talk. We've got four now.

573
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,390
Deal's still on. If I win, sell me
those talismans at half price.

574
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,650
Go ahead!

575
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,860
Shuffle the tiles!

576
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,560
Xuan Er?

577
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,020
Xuan Er?

578
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,410
- Xuan Er?
- Senior Wu!

579
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,520
Have you seen Xuan Er?

580
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,750
- I'm looking for her.
- No.

581
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,020
It's from Xuan Er...

582
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,750
Too bad.

583
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,500
Pung!

584
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,780
Chow!

585
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,760
Han Li, it's only been a year,

586
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,930
and you're already at Mid Foundation Stage?

587
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,410
Your cultivation has grown this fast.

588
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,370
You flatter me, Mentor.

589
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,890
It was pure luck.

590
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,780
I got my hands on a few enhancement pills.

591
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,890
However, my foundation's still unstable.

592
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,760
I've got to keep training hard.

593
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,210
See? I told you this kid's lucky,

594
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,280
knows how to pick his moments.

595
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,820
He's just like me, matured and composed.

596
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,820
- Draw.
- Why are you laughing?

597
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,860
Oh...

598
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,970
That's not true.

599
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,130
What's that supposed to mean?

600
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,850
Just luck alone already makes him better than you.

601
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,190
Much better.

602
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,690
Hu!  

603
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,000
You rip-off!

604
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,370
Can't you give it a rest?

605
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,850
How are you winning again?

606
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,760
The three of you keep passing tiles,
passing and passing!

607
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,930
Aren't you done messing around?

608
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,760
You think I can't see that?

609
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Who passed tiles? Who did that?

610
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,480
Come on, deal the next round!

611
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,539
We didn't even get the price down.
You're not going anywhere!

612
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:21,130
Just for saving a few gems,
you really don't value your life, huh?

613
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,605
- I can't just back out now!
- Fine! Half price!

614
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:24,720
- What?
- No joke?

615
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,770
Half price for you.

616
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,150
Seriously?

617
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:30,210
- You better not go back on your word!
- Go back on what?

618
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,310
I said half! You'll get half off!

619
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,930
- Now that's more like it.
- Using Telepathy, huh?

620
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,580
You're way too obvious with the cheating.

621
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:55,630
Honestly, I kind of envy you.

622
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,710
I may be a Core Formation cultivator now,

623
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,812
but I still can't act on every whim or desire,

624
00:35:02,812 --> 00:35:04,890
or make peace with myself.

625
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,000
What's the point of all this cultivation

626
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,610
if I can't follow my heart?

627
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,930
Look at you, all that sighing and glooming around.

628
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,850
What's the point?

629
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,800
Focus on something real.

630
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,650
Your feelings for Hong Fu
are written all over your face.

631
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,000
Even louder than that Telepathy of yours!

632
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,520
You should go after her!

633
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,950
Chase hard!

634
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,820
Who knows when we'll get another round like this?

635
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,780
Maybe centuries from now.

636
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,000
All right.

637
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,340
I'm off.

638
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,860
Keep your eyes open on the battlefield.

639
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,520
I said I'm leaving.

640
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,200
Aren't you going to see me off?

641
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,290
You already got the price down.

642
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,520
What's left to see off?

643
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,070
Take care, then!

644
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,230
You old gambling addict.

645
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,040
Mentor.

646
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,510
Master asked me to see you off on his behalf.

647
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,890
I won't let you leave empty-handed.

648
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,070
Here.

649
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,340
This is a VIP token for Treasure House.

650
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,280
With this, you get 10% off
any treasure in our shops.

651
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,700
Thank you, Mentor!

652
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:35,843
 Look at me. 

653
00:36:37,534 --> 00:36:40,514
 Li Fei Yu! 

654
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,560
 I didn't expect this. 

655
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,810
 You already reached Mid Foundation Establishment 

656
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,370
 after all these years apart? 

657
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,970
 Not bad at all. 

658
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,330
 Still, in cultivation, you can't rush the process. 

659
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,710
 You have to lay a solid foundation. 

660
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,560
 No worries. 

661
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,930
 Who doesn't have a few secrets? 

662
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,370
 Next time you come across rare spirit herbs, 

663
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,380
 always trade with me. 

664
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,680
 Old gambling addict! 

665
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,000
 It's my first time meeting your disciple today. 

666
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,810
 I actually like him! 

667
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,480
 Following you around won't get him far. 

668
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,850
 Why not let him work in my shop as an apprentice? 

669
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,570
 What do you say? 

670
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,250
 You rip-off! 

671
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,600
 Now you're trying to poach my disciple? 

672
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,890
 Get lost! 

673
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,120
 Don't let me see your face again! 

674
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,670
 So stingy! 

675
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,080
That Wang Yu guy is really shameless.

676
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,760
Core beating Foundation?

677
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,120
Weaker or not, I'd still beat him.

678
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,530
The worst part is, he had
the nerve to hide behind you!

679
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,830
Seriously!

680
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,120
All I know is, if I drag him to the mahjong table,

681
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,400
he's going down!

682
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,850
Wake up! Who lost?

683
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,850
It was the three of us who lost!

684
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,160
He gave us a discount.

685
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,320
He's the real loser.

686
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,050
That guy's got heart.

687
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,560
He didn't have to do that.

688
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Right! That rip-off was pretty decent this time.

689
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,120
With this new batch of supplies,

690
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,810
our disciples' survival rate will go way up.

691
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:17,010
Exactly. Even basic Freezing Talismans

692
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,720
can save a life in the right moment.

693
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,760
Yeah!

694
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,810
So we owe him big now.

695
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,150
And you didn't even bother to see him off?

696
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,810
I tried. He wouldn't let me.

697
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,680
And you just gave up?

698
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,680
Next time we see him may be centuries from now.

699
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,200
You said that too?

700
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,265
That's exactly what he said.

701
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:38,450
Who knows how many centuries until the next game?

702
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,160
Can you all stop saying stuff like that?

703
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,720
It just doesn't sit right.

704
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,490
Let's hope the war ends soon.

705
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,810
Then, we can invite Wang Yu and Fu Yun Zi

706
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,420
to Yellow Maple Valley for a proper gathering.

707
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,981
- Sounds good.
- You're agreeing?

708
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,840
Of course I am!

709
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,441
That sneaky brat Wang Yu, seriously!

710
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:01,040
He had the nerve to say

711
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,120
my feelings were louder than the Telepathy.

712
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,240
Feelings?

713
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,900
What feelings can you possibly have?

714
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,240
What feelings?

715
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,270
I've only ever had one feeling.

716
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,060
Then I already know.

717
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,150
You do?

718
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,540
Achieve true peace.

719
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,056
Something like that.

720
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:28,240
Master! Master!

721
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,040
- What is it?
- Bad news!

722
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,770
- Why the panic?
- Master, Mentor, I found this on the battlefield.

723
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,450
It's Xuan Er's hair ribbon!

724
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,330
What's going on?

725
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,770
She left this morning alone,

726
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,850
and didn't let me follow her.

727
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,490
Several hours passed,
and she still hadn't returned.

728
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,930
I went looking, and found her ribbon.

729
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,810
That area had demonic sect activity.

730
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,540
We can't let Xuan Er fall into his hands.

731
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,160
I'm going after her!

732
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,450
- I'll come with you!
- No! You can't!

733
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,680
Stay and hold the line!

734
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,750
Then... if you need backup, send word right away!

735
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,150
- Don't just stand there. Go with her!
- Yes, sir!

736
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,160
Did you see Wang Yu off?

737
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,760
He's gone.

738
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,220
Did he say anything?

739
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,460
He said he'd miss you all.

740
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,940
That's it?

741
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,600
Oh, and he gave me a token.

742
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,850
With it, we can get 10% off.

743
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,230
Let me see.

744
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,680
Stingy guy.

745
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,290
Only 10%?

746
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,590
Just keep it.

747
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,047
Anyway, I called you here for something else.

748
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:39,160
I need you to go to the capital.

749
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,520
- The capital?
- Yes.

750
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,160
Back when I was your age, I had a senior brother

751
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,770
who once saved my life.

752
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,410
But sadly, he died during a trial.

753
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,770
He left behind a son with no spirit root,

754
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,440
just a mortal.

755
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,480
I swore an oath to ensure that

756
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,160
his family line would always
live in wealth and peace.

757
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,450
Now, they've since settled in the capital.

758
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,380
It should be the fourth generation by now.

759
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,190
Ordinarily, mortal affairs are untouched
by cultivation wars.

760
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,560
But this time is different.

761
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,370
The demonic sects have already attacked
Jiang and Cheqi Kingdoms.

762
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:22,710
I'm afraid they'll target
the secular world in Yue next.

763
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,150
And if I recall, you're from Yue Kingdom, right?

764
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,240
Master, I once made a mistake in cultivation,

765
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,820
and lost some of my memory.

766
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,460
I truly don't remember where I was born.

767
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,640
Everyone in the cultivation world

768
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,010
has secrets of their own.

769
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,890
No need to explain too much.

770
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:47,970
Just like your origins, I've never asked about.

771
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,640
Right?

772
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,600
All I'm asking is for you
to go to the capital in my place.

773
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,160
If the demonic sects make a move,

774
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,890
I want you to protect that family.

775
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,560
 Heading to Yue's interior
is a great chance to withdraw from the war. 

776
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,020
 A chance worth taking. 

777
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,600
Here's the Qin family genealogy.

778
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,860
Take it.

779
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,890
This is a personal favor.

780
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,450
Our sect forbids interference in mortal affairs.

781
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,630
You understand what I mean.

782
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,240
Yes, Master. I'll carry out the task in secret.

783
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,790
But...

784
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,240
But right now, the Seven Sects
are standing against the demonic sects.

785
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,490
It's our time to fight for righteousness.

786
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,080
 What's this brat scheming now? 

787
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
 He never acts without a motive. 

788
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,160
 I still haven't spent all my war credits. 

789
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,860
 Leaving now will mean a huge loss! 

790
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,860
I just won't feel right
abandoning my post now.

791
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,600
The Seven Sects are vast.

792
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,040
Even if the battle gets bloody,

793
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,680
they won't miss
one Foundation Establishment cultivator.

794
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,640
But Master, those demonic
bastards are getting bolder.

795
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,720
They think the Seven Sects are helpless!

796
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,890
Enough! You're the most level-headed
of my disciples.

797
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,640
That's why I trust you with this task.

798
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,020
It's settled.

799
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,720
But honestly,

800
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,770
I earned quite a bit of war credits
at Golden Drum Plains.

801
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:18,160
If I stay longer, I'll earn even more merits

802
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,560
and trade them for great rewards.

803
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,070
 He really knows
how to bargain at a time like this... 

804
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,370
Fine!

805
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,560
Here's the deal.

806
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,290
We'll consider this mission an official duty
for the sect.

807
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,970
As for your war credits,
I'll handle it personally.

808
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,080
You'll get your full share.

809
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,300
Happy now?

810
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,290
Master, you're so kind and generous,

811
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,370
and you always keep your word.

812
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,710
I won't let you down!

813
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,450
Look at your little schemes.

814
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,720
But I like that.

815
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,380
That's why I trust you with this.

816
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,970
I'll write a letter.

817
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,040
Give it to the current head of the Qin family.

818
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,750
If anyone asks you anything, don't explain.

819
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,450
You've always been cautious.

820
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,270
I don't need to say much more.

821
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,200
Take this Telepathy Talisman.

822
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,770
If anything happens, send me a message.

823
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:17,680
Nangong of Moonshadow Sect
is passing through the area.

824
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,120
I've already spoken to her.

825
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,460
Take the Celestial Moon Ark with them.

826
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,600
Act alongside them.

827
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,520
It'll help you stay out of sight.

828
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,940
 She... 

829
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:51,025
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

830
00:44:51,025 --> 00:44:56,951
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

831
00:44:56,951 --> 00:45:00,470
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

832
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,922
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

833
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:06,282
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

834
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:11,320
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

835
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:17,840
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

836
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:23,480
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

837
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,000
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

838
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,560
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

839
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,681
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

840
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:36,960
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

841
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,261
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

842
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:42,680
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

843
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,670
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

844
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,750
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

845
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,030
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

846
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:56,160
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

847
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,520
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

848
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,441
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

849
00:46:03,441 --> 00:46:07,000
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

850
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,150
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

851
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,160
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

852
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,600
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

853
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,359
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

854
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:26,480
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

855
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,300
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

856
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,320
 ♫ we call eternity ♫ 

857
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:39,252
 ♫ In a fleeting moment ♫ 

858
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:43,040
 ♫ called eternity ♫
