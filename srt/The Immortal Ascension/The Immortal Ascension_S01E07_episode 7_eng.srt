OST credit

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,505
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

4
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:27,120
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,445
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

7
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:36,140
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,040
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,000
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,520
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,000
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,945
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,280
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

14
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,660
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,280
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,620
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

17
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,800
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,960
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,160
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,515
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,920
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,480
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,960
Title

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,840
 

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,860
Master.

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,000
What unruly creature dares to cause trouble here?

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,030
We'd better move.

28
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,160
If we don't leave now,
a Core Formation cultivator might show up.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,920
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,310
You're spared for now.

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,390
 How could such a fiend
appear among rogue cultivators? 

32
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,560
 Could this be the work
of those demonic sects again? 

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,460
 That young man should
count his blessings. 

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,960
 I've been saved. 

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,640
 A high-level cultivator must have stepped in. 

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,121
 I escaped by the skin of my teeth. 

37
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,510
 It seems being a rogue cultivator
means hardship at every turn. 

38
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,960
 If I want to survive,
I'll have to join a worthy sect. 

39
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,480
What's going on?

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,200
Where is Wu Jiu Zhi's body?

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,000
It's gone.

42
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,460
 

43
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,800
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream... ♫ 

44
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,240
 Let me tell you something, Han. 

45
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,080
When it comes to cultivation in the Yue Kingdom,

46
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,280
I know everything there is to know.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
Ask me anything you want.

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,840
I learned a lot from you yesterday.

49
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,590
We rogue cultivators are like one big family.

50
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,900
Living free and easy as a rogue cultivator
for life doesn't sound so bad.

51
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,002
 ♫ Too hard to forget, easier just to miss ♫ 

52
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:22,762
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke... ♫ 

53
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,940
 
 Once I reach Yellow Maple Valley, 

54
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,150
 
 I will leave behind the world of mortals. 

55
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,840
 Worldly ties will no longer concern me. 

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,780
 Before I go, I should head home one last time. 

57
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,030
Third uncle came. He's here to take you
to the Seven Mysteries Sect entrance exam.

58
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,240
Father borrowed three big bowls of noodles

59
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,120
from the sixth uncle, Madam Zheng, and Gou Sheng's families,

60
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,360
just to send you off.

61
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,810
He even had me pull up some scallions.

62
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,940
 Before I knew it, Xiao Mei was already of marrying age. 

63
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,880
 Father. 

64
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,420
 Mother. 

65
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:03,280
Li, do you think you can pass
the Seven Mysteries Sect exam?

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,650
Yes. I'll definitely pass.

67
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,750
My brother said he'll pass the exam!

68
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,960
My eldest grandson will surely make it.

69
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,770
Without a doubt.

70
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,740
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

71
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,400
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

72
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,200
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

73
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,119
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days... ♫ 

74
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:35,080
 Grandfather, Brother, Xiao Mei. 

75
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,955
 I'm glad I got to see you all
before I set off on this long journey. 

76
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,640
 

77
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,040
I pluck a piece of cloud to send home, to let them know I am safe.

78
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,080
Show-off.

79
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,000
- Yan Ru Yan!
- What's wrong?

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,680
Yan Ru Yan!

81
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,950
The entrance to Yellow Maple Valley should be around here.

82
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,150
Where exactly is it?

83
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,010
Come back!

84
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,880
Come back!

85
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,520
Get back here!

86
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,440
 

87
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,510
A sky full of yellow maple leaves.

88
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,880
Is this Yellow Maple Valley?

89
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,590
What's this?

90
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,800
 

91
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,660
 

92
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,410
That's mine...

93
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,620
Fu Yun Zi.

94
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,370
Remember these tiles?

95
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,270
 
Show-off.

96
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,960
Is today not the day new disciples are admitted?

97
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,980
Shouldn't you be somewhere else
rather than playing mahjong here?

98
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,080
 
Of course.

99
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,510
But you know the rules of Yellow Maple Valley.

100
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,740
When it is time for new disciples to enter,

101
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,750
I open betting pools.

102
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,040
It helps liven things up, you know?

103
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,750
Of course. Absolutely.

104
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,480
You came at the right time.

105
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,500
The first round shall begin now.

106
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,750
Great!

107
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,930
Left is odd.

108
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,240
Right is even.

109
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,420
- Place your bets. No changes after this.
- Come on.

110
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,140
A hundred-year lingzhi.

111
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,120
- I bet on odd.
- Odd for me too.

112
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,320
Me too.

113
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,910
I bet on even.

114
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,400
Here.

115
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,510
Wouldn't want you to say I cheated.

116
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,300
Show us the results.

117
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,910
One, two.

118
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,870
Five, six.

119
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,060
Seven. Eight.

120
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,310
16.

121
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,500
16 is even, right?

122
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,930
- Is 16 even?
- Yes, Grandmaster.

123
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,240
It is even!

124
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,600
Collect them!

125
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,670
Collect them all!

126
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,300
My talisman!

127
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,080
Take them. What's all the fuss about?

128
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,600
There are wins and losses in gambling.

129
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,245
- That's right.
- Accept your loss.

130
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,480
- Don't be a sore loser.
- Good.

131
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,510
Hua Yuan, boys, we will end here for today.

132
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,900
I bid you goodbye.

133
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,600
- Mentor Fu Yun Zi.
- Liu.

134
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,780
Master, I have something important to report.

135
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,400
What is it?

136
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,690
A young man holding an Ascension Token has arrived in the valley.

137
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,460
Ascension Token?

138
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,910
 

139
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,720
I haven't seen this thing
in over 400 or 500 years.

140
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,510
Indeed.

141
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,090
This is a rare item.

142
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,510
Indeed. This...

143
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,930
Wait a minute.

144
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,170
How many were there just now?

145
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,530
- 16.
- 16.

146
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,790
Add this one and...

147
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,970
What's 16 plus 1?

148
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,900
18.

149
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,320
Fu Yun Zi.

150
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,410
I have seen cheating,
but never someone this shameless!

151
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,500
Isn't it 18?

152
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,750
It's 17!

153
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,670
Give me that!

154
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,000
- Get it!
- Hurry!

155
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,790
- Quickly!
- Whose is this?

156
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,630
- Oh, you.
- My talisman!

157
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,510
This token couldn't have come at a better time.

158
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,650
I'll remember you.

159
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,870
This is yours.

160
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,810
Hold up.

161
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,200
My talisman.

162
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,210
- Where is he?
- At the bottom of the north valley.

163
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,940
Mentor. What precious
possessions have you brought today?

164
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,870
 

165
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,600
 
Snow Mountain Ice Lotus.

166
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,770
Paired with hundred-year banana leaf you brought,

167
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,620
it balances cold and heat. Nourishes the spirit root.

168
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,240
Excellent.

169
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,740
Wu. What about you?

170
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,200
 
What I brought is nothing

171
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,840
compared to what you all have.

172
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,270
- That's a fine item.
- Nine Heavens Mystic Cicada.

173
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,550
Gentlest of all.

174
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,400
Please.

175
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,280
What tea are we having today?

176
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,730
Let's enjoy some fine tea.

177
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,750
Allow me.

178
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,450
Watch this.

179
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,210
Excellent tea.

180
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,300
Enjoy.

181
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,550
Having tea without me?

182
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,620
Here comes the tea moocher.

183
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,560
Quick! Finish the tea!

184
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,550
I hope the tea scalds you, you money-grubber.

185
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,610
Who says I am mooching tea?

186
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,960
Look.

187
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,260
I brought something.

188
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,840
A hundred-year spirit herb.

189
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,730
Excellent choice.

190
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,830
Hong Fu, I brought it just for you.

191
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,080
Everyone, today Yellow Maple Valley
welcomes a rare guest.

192
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,750
Someone who's the likes of whom
we haven't encountered in a hundred years.

193
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,030
Come and have a look at this.

194
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,660
What is it?

195
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,550
I'm Song Meng, a Foundation Establishment disciple
of Yellow Maple Valley.

196
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,150
This is my sixth junior brother, Wu Xuan,
and this is our seventh junior sister.

197
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,440
So he is the one who brought the Ascension Token?

198
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,130
That is right.

199
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,950
What is your name?

200
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,820
My name is Han Li.

201
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,400
Why is he here?

202
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,320
That guy has the Ascension Token?

203
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,200
That guy?

204
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,790
No way.

205
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,530
Someone with a fake spirit root
couldn't possibly have an Ascension Token.

206
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,630
They say anyone who enters with an Ascension Token

207
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,630
receives a Foundation Pill by default.

208
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,520
Why?

209
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,360
Because their ancestors rendered great service
in the past.

210
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,790
He doesn't look like someone
from a meritorious bloodline.

211
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,430
A mere mortal trying to sneak
into the cultivation world.

212
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,000
Their ancestors did great service?

213
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,890
Cultivation clans use their most precious
resources

214
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,860
on their own descendants.

215
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,390
Even I had to fight for my life at Tianwu Arena

216
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,510
just to earn the right to a Foundation Pill.

217
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,020
What gives him the right?

218
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,660
Enough. We are here to cultivate, so let us focus on that.

219
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,050
Do not judge others.

220
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,120
- Understood.
- Got it.

221
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,720
Qiao Qian is right.

222
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,264
We came here to become cultivators,

223
00:15:44,264 --> 00:15:46,870
unlike someone who came to be a toad
lusting after a swan.

224
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,080
Right.

225
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,010
Pay no mind to their comments.

226
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,320
Four of the five elements spirit roots,
all at once.

227
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,030
You could not ask for worse.

228
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,360
Indeed. And a fake spirit root at that.

229
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,620
Indeed.

230
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,520
Which clan would waste an Ascension Token on someone this useless?

231
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,760
If I remember correctly,

232
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,870
sect rule 23 states that
anyone bearing the Ascension Token

233
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:21,630
must be accepted without questioning
their background or aptitude.

234
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,790
That is right.

235
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,470
And by the rules, he should be given one Foundation Pill as well.

236
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,050
What? Giving him a Foundation Pill is such a waste.

237
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,690
What about my disciples then?

238
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,670
Yellow Maple Valley
has already done him a huge favor

239
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,390
by accepting this fake spirit root.

240
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,140
Must we give him a Foundation Pill too?

241
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,860
What is owed must be given.

242
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,580
- We can't break the rules over one pill. 
 - Indeed.

243
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,250
If word gets out, we'll become the target of mockery
from the other six sects.

244
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,080
Indeed.

245
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,510
He's right.

246
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,700
Regardless of his talent, he should be accepted
into the sect.

247
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,980
The Foundation Pill should be given too.

248
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,570
However...

249
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,510
However what?

250
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,080
The Foundation Pill quota
is set in advance every year.

251
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,690
This year, we only prepared one, for the champion of the Tainan Bazaar.

252
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,000
If we give it to this newcomer,
then the champion will not get one.

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,060
Then so be it.

254
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,600
My suggestion is
that we temporarily replace it with gems.

255
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,130
After all, the champion
will surely qualify next year.

256
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,920
Well. It's settled then.

257
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,900
It's settled then.

258
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,380
Wu, go and welcome him into the valley.

259
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,930
Yes, Sect Master.

260
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,930
Hong Gu, please.

261
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,490
 You brat, I just repaid
that gambling favor earlier. 

262
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,990
Let's have some tea. Come.

263
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,660
Lovely tea.

264
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,510
Sect Master Zhong, where's my cup?

265
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,510
Here you go.

266
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,040
No tea for latecomers.

267
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,700
The tea's rather ordinary.

268
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,750
It's good.

269
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,900
There's more.

270
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,730
Really?

271
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,560
Senior Wu.

272
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,520
Senior Wu.

273
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,600
You are the one who brought the Ascension Token?

274
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,910
Yes.

275
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,730
My name is Han Li.

276
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,910
The Ascension Token is a rare item.

277
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,790
Even I have never seen one before.

278
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,080
How did you come by it?

279
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,720
It was passed down from my ancestors.

280
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,680
Are you perhaps from a cultivation clan?

281
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,900
Or do you have a senior family member working in one of the seven sects?

282
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,880
I come from the mortal world.

283
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,090
I am not from a cultivation clan.

284
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,400
No matter.

285
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,350
The Ascension Token is rare.

286
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,690
The fact that you received one means
you have fate with Yellow Maple Valley.

287
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,030
My surname is Wu.

288
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,690
From now on, you may call me Mentor Wu.

289
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,480
Welcome to Yellow Maple Valley.

290
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:43,732
I am officially a disciple of Yellow Maple Valley now.

291
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,490
Thank you, Mentor Wu.

292
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,310
For today, I will act as your guide

293
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,920
and help you understand
the basic rules of the valley.

294
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,530
Follow me.

295
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,820
Mentor, watch your step.

296
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,160
That is the Qianji Library.

297
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,640
It holds basic cultivation manuals
and alchemy recipes.

298
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,070
You can borrow them by paying gems.

299
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,740
I also work there.

300
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,830
To the west
is where Qi Refining Stage disciples live.

301
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,240
Aside from being hot like a steam furnace,
it is not too bad.

302
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,780
If you have enough gems, you can apply to move to the rear mountain,

303
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,510
where the accommodation is better.

304
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,090
Move aside.

305
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,030
Otherwise, you will have to wait
until you reach the Foundation Establishment.

306
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,540
- Thank you.
- And establish your personal abode.

307
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,300
There are many things
that require gems in the valley.

308
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,810
How can I earn them?

309
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,000
You can go to Baiji Hall and take on tasks
to earn gems.

310
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,400
What kind of tasks?

311
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,160
Tasks such as caring for spirit beasts
in the valley,

312
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,450
supervising mining operations at the quarries,

313
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,240
or instructing new disciples in basic techniques
at the Chuangong Pavilion.

314
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,010
Each task pays a different amount
depending on its difficulty.

315
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,110
Baiji Hall is overseen by Mentor Ye.

316
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,830
He has a rather eccentric temperament, so stay sharp around him.

317
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,790
This is the Alchemy Room.

318
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,970
Once you've saved up enough gems,
you can come here.

319
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,690
Ye. What are you doing so early in the morning?

320
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,780
I brought a new disciple
to pick up his entry supplies.

321
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,920
Didn't someone just come earlier?
Why are we doing this again?

322
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,240
Greetings, Mentor Ye.

323
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,160
You must be the one with the Ascension Token?

324
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,750
Even you've heard about it.

325
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,400
These youngsters have no interest in learning,

326
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,140
but they are all experts when it comes to gossip.

327
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,030
You may not have much talent,
but you sure are lucky.

328
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,980
Wait here.

329
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,210
Don't touch anything.

330
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,420
Come here.

331
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,780
 

332
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,140
This is the Yellow Maple Valley entry token.

333
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,450
Draw a strand of spiritual power
and inject it to activate it.

334
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,450
After that, it will be bound to you.

335
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,610
Go ahead and infuse your spiritual power.

336
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,960
A tenfold mystic pouch, one Cultivation Basics,

337
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,310
a set of daily refining tools,

338
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,930
the Solarflame Sword and Cold Moon Blade,

339
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,800
and a yellow entry robe.

340
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,830
You will take tasks to earn gems,

341
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,670
and spend them on gear and tools here with me.

342
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,770
Come back when you have more gems.

343
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,340
Thank you, Mentor Ye.

344
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,440
Well? Does the Yellow Maple Valley
disciple's robe not look flawless?

345
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,480
It does.

346
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,310
It is the first time in my life
I have seen a robe without stitching.

347
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,260
Walk with me.

348
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,600
That is about all you need to know
about the valley for now.

349
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,380
According to sect rules, anyone entering with an Ascension Token

350
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,240
is to receive a Foundation Pill in advance.

351
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,920
This one is yours.

352
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,960
Take it.

353
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,030
A word of advice.

354
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,480
There are many who covet Foundation Pills.

355
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,210
Keep it safe.

356
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,870
If you lose it, no amount of gems
will get you another.

357
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,110
Thank you, Mentor.

358
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,240
I am responsible for teaching
the disciples basic cultivation techniques.

359
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,740
If you ever encounter difficulty
in your cultivation, come find me anytime.

360
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,043
I will never forget your guidance

361
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:09,030
when I succeed
in reaching the Foundation Establishment.

362
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,560
Don't worry
about Foundation Establishment just yet.

363
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Regardless of whether you succeed,

364
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,330
this pill must be carefully safeguarded.

365
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,310
I'll remember that.

366
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,400
Hurry back to your quarters.

367
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,410
 Even if they gave me a Foundation Pill, 

368
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,100
 with a fake spirit root like mine, 

369
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,620
 I'll never reach the Foundation Establishment. 

370
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,240
 That must be what he meant. 

371
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,620
Don't give me that look.

372
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,720
Wasted on the undeserving.

373
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,160
Like giving a lamp to a blind man.

374
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,170
An absolute waste of resources.

375
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,810
Look at that snow. So white.

376
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,550
Hey, it's Ascension Token!

377
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,170
Ascension Token!

378
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,160
My name is Han Li.

379
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,270
"Han Li" doesn't sound
nearly as impressive as "Ascension Token."

380
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,480
Why not just rename yourself?

381
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,440
You can be "Ascension Token" from now on.

382
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,630
You two, that's enough.

383
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,070
Grandmaster Hong Fu.

384
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,850
Choose a leaf you like.

385
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,230
You will ride it through the skies.

386
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,400
Yellow Maple Valley's expanse is such that,

387
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,010
you wouldn't cover it in ten days
using just your legs.

388
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,820
If you can't fly,
you'll never find your place here.

389
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,590
Most of you have only taken flight in your dreams.

390
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,540
Some are too timid to even dare dream of flying.

391
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,170
Those people will never leave the ground.

392
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:31,450
Cultivation begins
by breaking past the limits in your heart.

393
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,270
If the Kunpeng can soar, so can people.

394
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,180
Harness the power of Heaven and Earth,

395
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,508
command the six energies,

396
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,650
and fly upon the wind through the void.

397
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,440
Grandmaster, are you saying that if we believe, we can fly?

398
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,960
Then what does that make us cultivators?

399
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,010
Fools chasing dreams?

400
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,270
Whether something is possible is one thing,

401
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,510
but whether you can do it is another.

402
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,110
Just because others can doesn't mean you can.

403
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,280
Just because others cannot
doesn't mean you cannot.

404
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,780
Remain steady in both praise and shame,

405
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,300
and let your heart guide your every move.

406
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,790
This is the state that cultivators seek to attain.

407
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,110
All right.

408
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,570
I've explained what needs to be explained.

409
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,960
Fly beyond the mountain ahead,

410
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,550
and you will be formally inducted
as disciples of Yellow Maple Valley.

411
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,970
Any other questions?

412
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,920
Grandmaster Hong Fu, we just need
to fly over the mountain.

413
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,030
We don't need to use these leaves, do we?

414
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,250
The choice is yours.

415
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,070
I will be waiting on the other side.

416
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,590
I don't need this lousy leaf!

417
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,820
- Come on!
- Come on!

418
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,810
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

419
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,630
How did this turn into tug-of-war?

420
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,020
Harness the power of Heaven and Earth.

421
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,250
Command the six energies.

422
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,080
Here I go!

423
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,110
With the Kunpeng in my heart,

424
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,100
I will surely take flight.

425
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,350
This is too slow.

426
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,960
This is no Kunpeng.

427
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,260
This is a bug.

428
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,867
What do you think?

429
00:32:46,867 --> 00:32:49,440
When did you learn this spell?

430
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,240
While the flowers of April
fade in the mortal realm,

431
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,040
peach blossoms bloom anew at the mountain temple.

432
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,300
It's just a small trick of mine.

433
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,240
Don't let Xuan Er see you using this.

434
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Seeing all these flowers and plants

435
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,240
will only distract her more from her cultivation.

436
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,270
You're right.

437
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,410
One moment.

438
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,720
There.

439
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,880
No more of that.

440
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,020
I'll never use that again.

441
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:33,640
Hong Fu, why are this year's new disciples
so untalented?

442
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,350
They're the worst group I've ever seen.

443
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,530
That's not entirely true.

444
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,270
What about the disciple with the Ascension Token?

445
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,550
Surely, his possession of such a rare item

446
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,950
indicates that there is something
exceptional about him.

447
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,900
It is a waste of a Foundation Pill.

448
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,590
Still, he is not without merit.

449
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,140
Maybe because he knows he is mediocre,

450
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,340
he has a good attitude and strong will.

451
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,650
A human life is short, like trees in autumn.

452
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,580
With a talent like his,
I fear he might grow old and die

453
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,290
before he ever uses that Foundation Pill.

454
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,590
What was that for?

455
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:45,830
I gave him some wind to wield.

456
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,790
Let us see if he is a sparrow

457
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,820
or a great swan.

458
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,860
 ♫ Chasing wind  I set out afar ♫ 

459
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,560
 ♫ The road ahead lost My voice unheard ♫ 

460
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,520
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

461
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,860
 ♫ Laying low I plan every move ♫ 

462
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,560
 ♫ With a mortal heart And lingering ties  

463
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,000
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

464
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,400
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

465
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,860
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

466
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,420
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

467
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,580
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

468
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,380
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

469
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,860
 ♫ I fight alone As chaos shakes the world ♫ 

470
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,460
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

471
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,001
 ♫ Kind at heart Ruthless when I must be  ♫ 

472
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:06,040
 ♫ Forged by trial I rise through three realms ♫ 

473
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,322
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

474
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,110
From today onward,

475
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:16,030
you are officially disciples
of Yellow Maple Valley.

476
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,320
As your Sect Master, I have only one request.

477
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,360
Focus on your cultivation
and avoid causing trouble.

478
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,840
Your purpose here is cultivation.

479
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,220
The first major milestone in cultivation is the Foundation Establishment Stage.

480
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,400
- Once you reach the Foundation Establishment...
- Want some?

481
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,450
I'm fine. Thank you.

482
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,410
You can absorb the essence
of the sun, moon, earth, and heavens.

483
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,800
You will no longer need to consume food
or take in worldly impurities.

484
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:48,300
So, even if you are still
in the Qi Refining Stage,

485
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,930
you should already begin practicing fasting.

486
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,440
You should eat later.

487
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,380
It's fine.

488
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,220
I can eat while he talks.

489
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,070
I can understand if it takes time

490
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,760
to let go of gourmet food.

491
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,090
But if you can't even
put down a piece of flatbread,

492
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,010
how will you ever succeed in cultivation?

493
00:37:37,023 --> 00:37:40,030
Who says cultivating means you can't eat?

494
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,700
My family told me

495
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,660
there's a Core
Formation Grandmaster who loved eating.

496
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,670
They carry all their utensils with them.

497
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,970
What's wrong with me eating a flatbread?

498
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,380
It's better than starving.

499
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,330
Bad examples shouldn't be followed.

500
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,970
Is there really a Core Formation Grandmaster
that greedy?

501
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,180
Indeed.

502
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,820
Don't listen to his nonsense.

503
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,000
What a joke.

504
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,900
 Is there really
such a gluttonous Core Formation cultivator? 

505
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,610
The rule of the Ascension Token
was set by our ancestors.

506
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,180
It's not something that can be changed.

507
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,360
If you work hard and make good progress with your variant spirit root,

508
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,730
the Valley may grant you another Foundation Pill as a reward.

509
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,390
Another one?

510
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,090
These 300 gems are compensation for you.

511
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,660
Sect Master, I was the champion
at the Tianwu Arena.

512
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,180
According to sect rules,
I should receive a Foundation Pill.

513
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,220
You were simply unlucky.

514
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,340
By the sect's rules,

515
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,740
the Foundation Pill must go to him first.

516
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,140
That is a rule we cannot alter.

517
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,820
Sect Master, I cannot accept this!

518
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,650
Enough.

519
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,860
Just accept your loss and move on.

520
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,780
Did you not hear what the Sect Master said?

521
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,130
The Foundation Pill
goes to the Ascension Token holder first.

522
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,110
- But...
- You are engaged

523
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,570
to the daughter of the Chen family.

524
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,060
The Chen family has plenty of Foundation Pills.

525
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,010
What's the matter?

526
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,110
Too proud to ask them for one?

527
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:19,660
If you want to blame someone,
blame the one with Ascension Token.

528
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,920
Watch closely.

529
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,410
Did everyone understand?

530
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,393
Is there learn a specific technique
you wish to learn?

531
00:39:40,393 --> 00:39:43,530
- Mentor.
- Mentor.

532
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,690
You, over there, go first.

533
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:51,416
 ♫ We made a promise to reunite ♫ 

534
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:55,520
 ♫ And walked into the unknown ♫ 

535
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,490
 ♫ But now that we've met again... ♫ 

536
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,480
I want to learn

537
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:03,360
Aura Concealment.

538
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,740
A fake spirit root wants
to learn Aura Concealment?

539
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,570
What aura do you have to hide?

540
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,380
Aura Concealment, as the name suggests,

541
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,380
uses spiritual aura
to isolate yourself from the outside world.

542
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:21,900
If done well, it can hide your
presence and actions from others.

543
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,780
Observe.

544
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,580
 ♫ Never let yourself become a hollow husk
of what you once were... ♫ 

545
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,510
What?

546
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,000
Where is he?

547
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,860
Where did he go?

548
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,480
- Where's Mentor Wu?
- He vanished in an instant.

549
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,130
Amazing.

550
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,710
- Come.
- No wonder they call it Aura Concealment.

551
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,560
Now, you give it a try.

552
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,420
 ♫ We're just fleeting mortals ♫ 

553

 ♫ Time slipped by before we knew ♫ 

554
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,620
 ♫ Yet we burn that spark of light ♫

00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:01,720
 ♫ Into this starry sky ♫

 ♫ Starlight fades into the Milky Way... ♫ 

557
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,510
He didn't conceal anything.

558
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,430
What did you even conceal?

559
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,940
Mentor Ye.

560
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,500
Today's lesson is on talisman crafting.

561
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,520
 ♫ Each step of fate's game unclear ♫ 

562

 ♫ Who can guess the ending? ♫

 ♫ But my heart has never rested ♫

 ♫ Ever chasing, still searching on... ♫ 

565
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,180

00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,280
 ♫ Through all the joy and sorrow ♫ 

567
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,440
 ♫ How do I choose the way? ♫ 

568
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,560
 ♫ Now we part, so far apart ♫ 

569
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,380
 ♫ We walk our separate paths ♫ 

570
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:30,880
 ♫ Just as I rise to compete,
the years have already fled... ♫ 

571
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,940
The morning glow really does feel better
than the evening glow.

572
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,740
 ♫ To be one who stands tall
between heaven and earth ♫

 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫

 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

578

 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫

 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

581

 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫
