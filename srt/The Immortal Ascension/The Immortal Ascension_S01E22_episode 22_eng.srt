1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,505
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:27,115
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,153
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,153 --> 00:00:32,538
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:36,140
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,880
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,990
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,471
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:50,960
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,257
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:01,211
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:05,691
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:10,233
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:13,620
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,780
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,100
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,300
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,980
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,955
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,080
 

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,240
I'm willing to offer it up with both hands.

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,395
 A smooth talker. 

26
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,556
 Clearly used to dealing in the mortal world 

27
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:49,430
 and very street smart. 

28
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,500
 Quite impressive. 

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,000
Didn't expect you to be this sensible.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,030
I am not one to take by force.

31
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,670
Your Fire Control Technique may be minor,

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,700
but it's rather interesting.

33
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,960
I can offer some spells and pills in exchange.

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,640
Think carefully.

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,250
What do you want in return?

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,300
 

37
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,700
Please, have some tea.

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,950
If you're still pleased, then I'd like to ask,

39
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,590
if I may, for a pill to help break through.

40
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,180
I hope you'll grant this favor.

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,760
I have two bottles of Yellow Dragon Pills.

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,090
You know what they're good for.

43
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,260
Take them.

44
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,350
Are you sure you're not with those two?

45
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,310
Those two?

46
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,130
Who're you talking about?

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,060
In any case,

48
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,840
I do have one more favor to ask.

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,950
If you can do it, our Spirit Beast Mountain

50
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,130
will reward you handsomely.

51
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,750
So, you're a senior from Spirit Beast Mountain!

52
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,910
Senior, if you ask, how could I possibly refuse?

53
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,190
However, I must admit, my skills are limited.

54
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,650
I worry I may ruin your plans.

55
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,370
It's nothing grand.

56
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,520
It's something about your disciple,
the Young Prince, and Steward Wang.

57
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,140
I suspect they're colluding
with the demonic sects.

58
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,620
Will you keep an eye on them for me?

59
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,970
Are you willing?

60
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,150
 This is a fine warding artifact. 

61
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,310
 Hold on to it. 

62
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,120
 If the task is done, there'll be more rewards. 

63
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,220
Rest assured, I won't let you down.

64
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,400
 

65
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,960
As long as this blood curse's still on us,

66
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,240
we're stuck working for them.

67
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Talking won't help.

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,150
We might as well catch a few more rogues!

69
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,710
Catch? You think we're catching rats here?

70
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,000
He wanted three today, maybe five tomorrow.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,560
Most of the lone rogue cultivators
have already scattered!

72
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,400
At this rate, Er,

73
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,800
why don't you throw us in with them too?

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,630
- Am I wrong?
- Si!

75
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,630
Say that again!
Go on, say that again!

76
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,190
Am I wrong, huh?

77
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,080
Don't listen to his nonsense.

78
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,650
What happened to San hurts all of us.

79
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,630
I want to write a letter

80
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,800
to that immortal from Clear Void Sect.

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,630
If they're willing to help,
maybe this whole thing...

82
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,030
The Seven Sects?

83
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,470
Da, they're busy fighting the demonic sects.

84
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,000
Even in peacetime,

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,650
have they ever cared
about rogue cultivators like us?

86
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,590
No matter what, I will save San.

87
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,690
Even if you won't, I will have to go alone!

88
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,140
Er!

89
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,820
Da.

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,900
We grew up with San...

91
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,160
There's no way we're leaving her behind!

92
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,680
But now's not the time.

93
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,380
And I won't let you go alone!

94
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,360
Da.

95
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,630
If you ask me,
the Seven Sects are losing ground fast.

96
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,190
They can barely take care of themselves.

97
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,630
We might as well join the Black Fiend Cult.

98
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,340
Safer that way.

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
She's just a mortal.

100
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,870
Yeah, a mortal.

101
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,460
What's the problem?

102
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,800
I may be young, but I'm not a clueless kid!

103
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,040
If you want to fool someone,

104
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,750
at least don't use a mortal to brush me off.

105
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,600
Sure, you're a cultivator.

106
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,720
But right now,

107
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,950
you're only at the Tier Five of Qi Refining.

108
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,160
In front of me, or those villains,

109
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,800
you're not much different from a mortal.

110
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,900
So why look down on them?

111
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,390
Anyway, your personal life
has nothing to do with me.

112
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,020
If you want to go, I won't stop you.

113
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,600
Miss Mo here is an old friend of mine.

114
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,830
She has some ties to Steward Wang at the estate.

115
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,170
She's been investigating in secret
for a long time.

116
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't underestimate her.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,700
She's tougher than she looks.

118
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,190
Your Fragrance Pellets are great.

119
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,750
I even brought my sister to buy some.

120
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,190
Thanks! Next time,
I'll give you both a bigger discount.

121
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,610
Sounds great.

122
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,480
 

123
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,130
Snow-Petal Skincare...

124
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:02,950
Li.

125
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,000
Miss Mo.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,970
Your clinic is really something.

127
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,600
How are you selling more cosmetics than medicine?

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,750
Li, don't tease me.

129
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,240
It's all because of the Fragrance Pellet

130
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,510
you taught me to make.

131
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,270
The ladies in the capital love it.

132
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,380
They're always begging me to make more.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,310
One thing led to another,

134
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,750
and now the clinic
barely feels like a clinic anymore.

135
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,600
Still, it's opened some doors

136
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,780
for gathering information.

137
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,940
Li, please.

138
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,240
I know your personality.

139
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,610
Dealing with those people must be tough for you.

140
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,830
From now until this is all over, Miss Mo,

141
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,510
you must stay away from Steward Wang.

142
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,500
Quickly erase any signs
of your prior investigations.

143
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,360
Don't worry, Li.

144
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,120
I know what's at stake.

145
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,310
This time,

146
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,680
I'm just trying
to track down the missing cultivators.

147
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,410
I won't attempt to assassinate him again.

148
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,190
Lately, several supply runs

149
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,190
have gone through different estates
under Steward Wang's command.

150
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:47,070
Although they've been careful,
keeping things spread out.

151
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,160
I have a few reliable contacts
in and out of the estate.

152
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:58,000
Piecing together what I've learned,
I suspect those missing cultivators

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,270
are being held in a few specific places.

154
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,500
Give me a moment, Li.

155
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,270
Li, look.

156
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,720
This is the east side of the city,

157
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,600
too crowded with shops and people.

158
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
Not a good place to keep anyone.

159
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,870
The west side's near the palace,
with guards all over.

160
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,120
Hard to move there.

161
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,960
- Not ideal either.
- It should be...

162
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,150
This spot!

163
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,790
We should check out all these places.

164
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,150
Aren't you quite smart?

165
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,320
Come on, let's hear your thoughts.

166
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
Earlier, that Li fellow went missing

167
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,270
near a base in the south of the city.

168
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,670
And Miss Zhao too.

169
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,240
They both vanished on the way back
through the South Gate.

170
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,030
So I think every one of these spots
needs checking!

171
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,150
You really know a lot for someone so young.

172
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,050
You're amazing.

173
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,840
Someone's right too.

174
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,380
You're a pretty sharp lady.

175
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,630
Miss Cui Er, let's talk inside.

176
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,030
Come.

177
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,410
Let's go.

178
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,620
 Those two hit it off. 

179
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:19,189
 No need to worry there. 

180
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,380
 I once dreamed of running a clinic like this. 

181
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,100
 The simple life of a mortal isn't so bad. 

182
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,480
Li, here's the rouge you asked for.

183
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,840
Thanks. How much silver?

184
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,630
I'll have Qin Gui send it over.

185
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,030
Come on, don't be so formal.

186
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,810
We're friends, aren't we?

187
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,720
Still,

188
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,670
this is women's stuff.

189
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,020
Is it for that Miss Xuan Er we saw last time?

190
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,790
You've got it wrong, Miss Mo.

191
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,030
It's for a senior sister of mine.

192
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,020
She's really into this kind of thing.

193
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,150
 Senior Zhong's gotten me in trouble! 

194
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,860
 I'm never shopping for her again. 

195
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:36,530
Li, you sure have a lot of
senior and junior sisters.

196
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,440
Come look!

197
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,650
This herb is so pretty!

198
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,240
She's got talent, but she's still too naïve.

199
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,120
If no one guides her, I worry

200
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,440
she'll get herself into trouble.

201
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,670
I still need to do some digging.

202
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,475
I may need you to look after Cui Er.

203
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:20,945
Sure.

204
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,530
Li,

205
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,750
I know what you're really thinking.

206
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,030
You said I should look after her, but in truth,

207
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,290
you want her to protect me, right?

208
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,720
Don't worry.

209
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,260
I can take care of myself.

210
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,150
And of course, I'll keep an eye on Cui Er too.

211
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,220
I'll make sure she doesn't get in your way.

212
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,670
Here, take this talisman.

213
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,910
Keep it on you.

214
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,980
If you're in danger, it'll trigger on its own
to save your life.

215
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,120
Hopefully, you'll never need it.

216
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,530
Time to go.

217
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,020
Li!

218
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,020
 Will I see you again? 

219
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,450
He's gone?

220
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,980
Thank goodness!

221
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,080
On the seventh day of the seventh month,

222
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,150
a unit of a hundred men from Saber-Shearing Sect

223
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,510
was ambushed at Yanliang Mountain.

224
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,120
More than half were killed or wounded.

225
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,780
After years of fighting,
is there not any good news?

226
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,360
Wan.

227
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,720
Ni Chang?

228
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,840
Weren't you headed
to Tiandu Kingdom for reinforcements?

229
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,150
Why are you here?

230
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,960
Did something major happen at the front?

231
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,000
It's good news.

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,550
A victory report just came in.

233
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,120
Spirit Beast Mountain
and Skyfort Castle won a big battle.

234
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,840
Elder Han led the charge and managed to trap

235
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,000
over a hundred Foundation cultivators
from Beast Taming Sect.

236
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,840
They even killed
two Core Formation demonic cultivators.

237
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:37,000
But, didn't our people find out before

238
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,840
that Elder Han was in close contact
with the demonic sects,

239
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,790
even exchanging letters?

240
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,000
Is the report reliable?

241
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There was contact, sure,

242
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,320
but it was all part of Elder Han's ruse.

243
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,630
She pretended to defect to gain their trust.

244
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,840
If we hadn't already learned
Beast Taming Sect's route,

245
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,900
this surprise attack wouldn't have worked.

246
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,240
Still, something feels off.

247
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,150
If Spirit Beast Mountain
can fool the demonic sects,

248
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,240
what's stopping them from fooling us too?

249
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,750
Wan, it's good to be cautious.

250
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,360
But this victory is real.

251
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,750
Many disciples saw it firsthand.

252
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,720
Some Core Formation cultivators

253
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,150
even fell in the battle.

254
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,510
Even if the demonic sects

255
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,790
and Spirit Beast Mountain were colluding,

256
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,870
they wouldn't throw away

257
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,240
Core Formation cultivators' lives

258
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,930
just to keep up appearances.

259
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,290
This is a much-needed win

260
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,900
after all those bitter fights
against the demonic scum!

261
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,290
Not bad at all!

262
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,290
Once the dust settles,
I'll go learn from Elder Han.

263
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,480
These past days, I've been feeling low.

264
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,860
You've been shouldering
the burden of battle command.

265
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,570
It's my fault
for dragging down the Golden Drum Plains campaign.

266
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,440
Hong Fu, still no word on Xuan Er?

267
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,390
That demon keeps moving around.

268
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,320
We have no idea where he's hiding her.

269
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,510
No matter.

270
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,960
Clear Void Sect and Spirit Beast Mountain

271
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,720
will meet up with us in a few days.

272
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,000
Once the main forces gather, I'll send more people

273
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,840
to expand the search.

274
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,570
We'll find her for sure!

275
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,670
Wang Chan of Ghost Spirit Sect

276
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,790
seeks an audience with Grandmaster Yun Lu!

277
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,110
Please announce him!

278
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,380
You brat's here.

279
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,390
What now? Come begging for medicine?

280
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,240
So young and already sick?

281
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,630
Or is it for your father?

282
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,870
You jest, Grandmaster.

283
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,631
I recently came across a rare item,

284
00:17:56,631 --> 00:18:00,000
and thought it might be of interest to you.

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,360
So I made a special trip to present it!

286
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,630
A rare item?

287
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,870
Let's see it.

288
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,840
Please, Grandmaster.

289
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,410
Take a look!

290
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,080
Wang Chan of Ghost Spirit Sect

291
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,290
greets Grandmaster Yun Lu!

292
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,370
Unbelievable...
 

293
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:06,240
How's your mother?

294
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,090
Is she doing well?

295
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,460
My mother...?

296
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,870
Time flies.

297
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,940
You've grown so much already.

298
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,000
What's your name?

299
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm Dong Xuan Er.

300
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,310
Still so stubborn.

301
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,160
My master is supposed to be righteous!

302
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,920
How would she side with you demonic lot?

303
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,310
Righteous?

304
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,550
Demonic?

305
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,550
Who filled your head with such outdated nonsense?

306
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:57,550
The so-called Seven Sects
were all born from the Six Demonic Sects.

307
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,920
A few centuries ago,

308
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,000
the Righteous Alliance
and the Grassland Clans invaded.

309
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,790
They took advantage of the chaos and broke away.

310
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,510
They act all high and mighty,

311
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,130
but they're just a bunch
of self-righteous fame chasers.

312
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,570
I've never heard any of that before.

313
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,130
Someone like Grandmaster
Yun Lu has no reason

314
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,050
to lie to you.

315
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,980
Moonshadow Sect came from Joyful Union Sect.

316
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,160
Spirit Beast Mountain was born
of Beast Taming Sect.

317
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
And now, even Yan Clan Stronghold

318
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,070
has returned to Ghost Spirit Sect.

319
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,780
The Seven Sects

320
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,420
are already on the verge of collapse.

321
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,020
Is that so?

322
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,130
Maybe it's time

323
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,420
your father here gave you a real education.

324
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,440
Father?

325
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,940
A tiger's cub

326
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,740
should never live among sheep.

327
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,220
Xuan Er,

328
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,110
from this day on, you are my direct disciple.

329
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,960
You are no longer allowed

330
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,000
to practice anything from Yellow Maple Valley.

331
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,480
With your gift of enchantment,

332
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,260
you should cultivate
the ultimate art of Joyful Union Sect.

333
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,830
I told you, you owe me a thanks.

334
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,370
Now go on, acknowledge your kin
and call him Master.

335
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,880
So this man is really my father?

336
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,290
I never knew.

337
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,000
Congrats, Grandmaster!

338
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,920
Today, you're finally reunited
with your dear Xuan Er.

339
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,570
I won't forget this great
favor from Ghost Spirit Sect.

340
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,240
But tell me, how did you and Xuan Er meet?

341
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,350
When you brought her here,
didn't her mother stop you?

342
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,790
 My mother... Could it be Master Hong Fu? 

343
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,090
 Is she really my mother? 

344
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,640
Reporting, Xuan Er and I first met
at Yan Clan Stronghold.

345
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,460
Even back then, I could tell
she carried a powerful legacy.

346
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,440
Honestly, Yellow Maple Valley
is rotten from top to bottom.

347
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,030
They even had male and
female disciples train together.

348
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,890
They clearly wanted them to pair off.

349
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,030
I've seen Xuan Er blushing like crazy.

350
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,920
You'd better be careful,

351
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,830
or some sleazy guy may trick you,

352
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,740
and mess with your cultivation.

353
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,460
That's enough nonsense!

354
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,850
Is that true?

355
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,180
What's that guy's name?

356
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,590
Just some nobody, not worth mentioning.

357
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,050
He's Li Fei Yu.

358
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,160
Of course, if you hadn't asked, that name

359
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,320
wouldn't be worth speaking in your presence.

360
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,480
You're the one not worthy!

361
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,860
I am!

362
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,860
 

363
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,790
 This ancient book isn't ordinary. 

364
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,510
 Too bad I only understand the intro,
some Aura Concealment Technique. 

365
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,920
 The rest is hard to decipher. 

366
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,810
 I'll find someone to translate it later. 

367
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,260
 It's been days now, and still no sign. 

368
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,000
 I can't sense Wu San Xing's spirit at all. 

369
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,180
 Maybe... he's been killed? 

370
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,270
- Come on, let's go!
- That's enough!

371
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,590
Move! Move, Wu!

372
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,940
Let's go!

373
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,310
 Poor Wu. 

374
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,200
 They got him in the end. 

375
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,920
 But those guys who buried him look so familiar. 

376
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,440
Da, are they gone?

377
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,590
- Yeah, they're gone.
-  So it really was them. 

378
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,930
That's just despicable.

379
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,200
Wait.

380
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,310
Where are you all headed?

381
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,850
Shall I send you off myself?

382
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,200
Who's that?

383
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,270
Who are you?

384
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,310
Say your name!

385
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,550
Hiding your face like that!

386
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,380
- What kind of coward are you?
- Yeah!

387
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,370
Hang us longer, and our heads are going to burst!

388
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,880
The gang of us doesn't
ask to be born the same day!

389
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,640
Only to die the same day!

390
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,750
If you want to kill us, make it quick!

391
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,880
Yeah, make it quick.

392
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,640
Ow!

393
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,355
Weren't there five of you?

394
00:26:09,355 --> 00:26:10,956
Where's the last one?

395
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:12,830
How'd he know that?

396
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,110
Are we famous now?

397
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,020
Our name's finally out there!

398
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,960
Where's the last one?

399
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,270
San? She's been taken.

400
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,500
San's been kidnapped.

401
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,020
Da!

402
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,720
That's a Wind Barrier spell.

403
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,220
You won't break through.

404
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,130
Da, he's over there!

405
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,830
Spill everything you know.

406
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,850
Right now.

407
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,530
No?

408
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,500
Then rot in there.

409
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,960
- Please!
- Senior!

410
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,200
- Please, Senior!
- Senior!

411
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,267
We're just victims too!

412
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:11,480
- Yeah, we're the pitiful ones!
- We were cursed and bound by a spell!

413
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,440
- We...
- Who cursed you?

414
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,510
Black... Black Fiend Cult!

415
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,640
Why?

416
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,350
They controlled us.

417
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,640
They made us help them

418
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,120
lure and capture rogue cultivators
around Yue Kingdom.

419
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,200
Where are those rogue cultivators now?

420
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,700
The rogues... We don't know.

421
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,400
So basically, you've all got blood on your hands.

422
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,720
Blood?

423
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,960
We'd never dare kill cultivators!

424
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,240
- Yeah!
- We kept our hands clean!

425
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,400
Then who killed the ones you buried?

426
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,750
It... it wasn't us!

427
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,030
Steward Wang of Prince Xin's Mansion
told us to bury them!

428
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:52,310
- And the others?
- Those cultivators weren't killed.

429
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,310
The Black Fiend Cult just hid them away somewhere!

430
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,692
- Where are they hidden?
- They're hidden at... at... at...

431
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:00,660
We really don't know.

432
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,400
Senior! We do know!

433
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,240
- We know! We'll take you there!
- Senior!

434
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,240
Are you with the Seven Sects?

435
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,370
Seven Sects?

436
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,960
Senior, I once met Elder Liu from your side.

437
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,110
He's our second uncle.

438
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,230
- No, our eldest uncle.
- Yeah, eldest.

439
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,360
- Eldest or second, uncle's still uncle.
- Right.

440
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,920
Senior, please help us break the blood curse

441
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,830
and lift the restriction spell.

442
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,960
We swear to aid you in wiping out
the Black Fiend Cult and restoring justice!

443
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,290
- Even if it costs us our lives!
- The Five Meng is known for our loyalty!

444
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,561
The Five Meng? What a joke!

445
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:54,220
They can't do anything right,
only good at screwing things up!

446
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,350
They're just outer disciples

447
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,960
who never passed the sects' entrance trials.

448
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,780
The Master already put a blood curse
on them long ago.

449
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,460
Good thing you were sharp enough.

450
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,115
Now those losers
won't be blabbing anymore.

451
00:29:16,115 --> 00:29:20,135
That Wu San Xing guy clearly had backup.

452
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,370
But that may not be a bad thing.

453
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,830
The Master happens to need Foundation
Establishment Stage blood for his cultivation.

454
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,980
This guy may be just what he needs.

455
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,440
If anyone else starts asking questions
like Wu did,

456
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,720
they're probably connected to him.

457
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,980
We can capture them too and offer them to Master!

458
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,160
 

459
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,510
- San!
- San!

460
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,940
San!

461
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,200
San!

462
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,359
- Da, Er.
- San!

463
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,060
You're finally back!

464
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,640
Master, you lifted the spell on us

465
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,550
and rescued our sister too.

466
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,660
This is a debt we'll never forget!

467
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,740
Enough. Get up, all of you.

468
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,700
Get up.

469
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,000
Since the five of you were forced into it,

470
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,660
I won't report this to the sects.

471
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,550
However, if you're truly turning over a new leaf,

472
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,510
you'd better make up for what you've done.

473
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,350
Master, whatever you need, just say the word!

474
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,270
How many strongholds
does the Black Fiend Cult have in this city?

475
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,750
You have one day to find out and report back.

476
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,330
Understood!

477
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,250
Miss Mo.

478
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,000
We're closed for the day.

479
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,440
All of you, head home for now.

480
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,260
Got it, Miss Mo.

481
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,700
 

482
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,350
These are the transport records.

483
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,590
All supplies like food and weapons.

484
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,760
Enough to support several dozen people.

485
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,750
Looks like these places really are their bases.

486
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:46,750
Quick! Let's go!

487
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,330
- Hurry!
- Move!

488
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,830
Thank you, Master, for saving us!

489
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,780
This way!

490
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,839
Hurry!

491
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,720
- Cui Er!
- Grandpa!

492
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,130
Cui Er!

493
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,500
Thank goodness!

494
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,660
A family should always stay together.

495
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,780
Wu recognized him too.

496
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,960
I recognized him at first glance.

497
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,000
Wait, was that your secret signal?

498
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,290
Remember the Tainan Bazaar?

499
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,890
I'll trade two strengthening pills

500
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,680
for your book.

501
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,530
- That's loyalty for you!
- Well then, farewell!

502
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,350
Wait, I remember now.

503
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,480
It was him!

504
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,680
Yeah, it was him!

505
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,000
That's right! Back at the Tainan Bazaar,

506
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,400
he was just a rogue cultivator

507
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,350
at Tier Seven or Eight of Qi Refining.

508
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,400
Yeah.

509
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,160
His cultivation was even lower than mine.

510
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,550
But now he's so powerful!

511
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,640
Who cares his past?

512
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,020
Anyway, he's a Foundation
Establishment cultivator now!

513
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,240
He's an old acquaintance!

514
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,932
I'll go say hi, and...

515
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:20,960
Hey, what are you doing?

516
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,160
Where are you going?

517
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,830
He clearly doesn't want to be recognized.

518
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,960
If he did, he would've said something.

519
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,830
That's basic etiquette in the cultivation world.

520
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,420
Do you get it?

521
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,920
Let's lie in ambush!

522
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,020
Let them fall into our trap!

523
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,440
If we follow him,

524
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,660
we're bound to catch the other one too.

525
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,260
Wu!

526
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,000
We've waited so long.

527
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,400
Will he be back?

528
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,780
Enough with the nonsense. Just wait!

529
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,110
Master!

530
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,280
Master!

531
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,590
Where is he?

532
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,620
It really is him!

533
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,320
Master, these people are right here!

534
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,260
Yeah, this is the place!

535
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Just a basic earth-element array.

536
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,070
Nothing to worry about.

537
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,510
We can smash through it.

538
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,920
But we're guests.

539
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,880
Let's be polite.

540
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,660
I'll knock first.

541
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,490
Master, you think there may be an ambush?

542
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,300
Well, you've finally shown yourselves.

543
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,280
 

544
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,100
Sir, that's the one who raided our branch outpost!

545
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,150
Take him alive!

546
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,620
Form the array!

547
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,230
A mid-Foundation cultivator?

548
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,510
I'll need to go all out!

549
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,740
Good luck, everyone!

550
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,590
Wu!

551
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,840
Wu!

552
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,440
Wu!

553
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,550
Wu!

554
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,630
- What's wrong?
- What's going on with Wu?

555
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,970
- Master!
- Wu is... She is...

556
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,700
Hey... Oh.

557
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,180
Charge!

558
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:51,580
Wu! Wu!

559
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,710
We can't stop her!

560
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,010
I'll...

561
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,840
What did you do?

562
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,580
Someone stay and watch her.

563
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,760
You're in trouble now!

564
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,290
I...

565
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,540
Wu!

566
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,190
That hide is tough!

567
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,890
Looks like we won't break through anytime soon.

568
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,780
Wait!

569
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,360
I'm Prince Xin's son!

570
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,670
The Seven Sects made a pact.

571
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,550
Cultivators aren't allowed
to harm royal bloodlines!

572
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,670
Their rules don't apply to me.

573
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,510
If you're not one of the Seven Sects,

574
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,010
then why get involved?

575
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,490
Because I feel like it.

576
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,220
Watch him. Don't kill him!

577
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,630
Master!

578
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,960
Master! It was the Black
Fiend Cult who set you up!

579
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,480
It was all them!

580
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,510
I was forced into this!

581
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,030
I've never had a personal grudge with you!

582
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,110
If you let me go today,
I'll reveal every secret I know

583
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,660
about the Black Fiend Cult.

584
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,150
I heard you're from Lanzhou.

585
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,330
Do you know someone named Mo Ju Ren?

586
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,000
Master,

587
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,260
what's your grudge with him?

588
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,290
That man once tried to kill me and failed.

589
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:15,180
So in a way, I helped you get revenge.

590
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,180
I wiped out his entire clan.

591
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,190
You're on the path to immortality,

592
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,370
so why target a mortal family?

593
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,280
Just a bunch of mortals.

594
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,030
So what if they're dead?

595
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,320
He dared to rival me once.

596
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,260
That was enough.

597
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,291
I was going to ask
about your demonic transformation technique...

598
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,070
Master, if you'll spare my life,

599
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:52,060
I'll give you the technique willingly!

600
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,010
Forget it.

601
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,756
Scum like you should just die.

602
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:43,021
