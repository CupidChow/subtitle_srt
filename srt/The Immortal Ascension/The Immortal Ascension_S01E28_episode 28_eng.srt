1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,760
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,120
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,160
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,545
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:36,140
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,880
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,007
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:45,820
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:50,960
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,920
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,289
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,769
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,718
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:15,760
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,080
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,160
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,840
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,000
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,020
Up there!

25
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,600
It's Demonic Flame Sect's Skyfire Spell.

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,520
Each drop of lava
hits like a Foundation Stage strike.

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,700
Everyone, defend together!

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,320
Hold your ground.

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,470
With the Mist of Camouflage up,

30
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,430
they won't be able to track us.

31
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,300
They'll leave soon.

32
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,730
Just as I expected.

33
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
Li Hua Yuan greets Grandmaster.

34
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,080
Hua Yuan.

35
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,340
Come over.

36
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:54,310
Sit and have some tea.

37
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,800
No need for tea.

38
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,490
My Senior Hong Fu...

39
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,020
Grandmaster...

40
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,750
Was that person just here?

41
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,140
You're a clever man.

42
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,580
Why bother asking?

43
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,340
Then I'll take my leave.

44
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,870
Hua Yuan.

45
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,190
Do you remember

46
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:31,000
the first lesson I gave you
when you joined the sect?

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,410
I do.

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,630
The highest state of cultivation

49
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,030
is absolute detachment.

50
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,400
It lies in letting go of desire.

51
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,680
It lies in learning to give up.

52
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,070
It lies in...

53
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,328
I remember it all.

54
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:53,910
I also remember another thing you once told me.

55
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,910
If you can't even clear your own thoughts,

56
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,400
what's the point of cultivating at all?

57
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Exactly.

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,543
Yet after all I said,

59
00:05:03,543 --> 00:05:05,800
you didn't take in a word, did you?

60
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,630
If you had, would we be under siege like this?

61
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,000
Your criticism is fair, Grandmaster.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,680
Sacrifice a little to preserve our sect.

63
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,240
It's the best we can do now.

64
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,620
Do you have a better plan?

65
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,530
No, of course not.

66
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,030
This strategy truly took everything.

67
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,280
It's brilliant and exhausting.

68
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,090
I couldn't have pulled it off.

69
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,400
That tongue of yours...

70
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,020
You think I can't hear the sarcasm in your voice?

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,020
Grandmaster,

72
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,240
I just want to know one thing.

73
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,050
Does my Senior Hong Fu and my disciple Han Li
know about this?

74
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,340
Well...

75
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,120
Then I'll ask Senior Hong Fu myself.

76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,500
Let's see if she's willing.

77
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,359
You handed her over to Yun Lu!

78
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:36,480
That fiend slaughters innocents

79
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,310
and plans to destroy Yellow Maple Valley!

80
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,097
If she falls into his hands,

81
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:44,830
she'll die before she gives in!

82
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,479
It was a trade.

83
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,113
Not a betrayal.

84
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,484
Thanks for clarifying, Grandmaster.

85
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,360
 Their main force is Mid Foundation cultivators. 

86
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,270
 A few are early stage. 

87
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,720
 What rotten luck! 

88
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,804
 We ran into the elites. 

89
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:18,500
 But the real trouble are the two leading them. 

90
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,525
Hong Fu of Yellow Maple Valley is here.

91
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,945
Who wishes to face me?

92
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:29,306
Oh, I thought you'd be some sweet young lady.

93
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:32,080
But you're already so old.

94
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,441
And not even that good-looking.

95
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:35,931
Right?

96
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,680
Your figure's not much either.

97
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,020
What on earth does the Grandmaster see in you?

98
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,650
You insolent fool!

99
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:55,430
Mrs, always rushing to fight the moment we meet.

100
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,552
That's a nasty habit!

101
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:00,182
Two Core cultivators.

102
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:02,987
I am from the Ghost Spirit Sect.

103
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:06,190
They call me Skull.

104
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,120
You seem to be in a hurry.

105
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,460
Where are you headed?

106
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:14,726
I can sense Fu Yun Zi's aura on you.

107
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:17,263
You mean that old Daoist?

108
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:20,723
He turned out to be quite the worthy opponent.

109
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,500
In that case,

110
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,210
this item...

111
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,630
 Mentor Fu Yun Zi's relic! 

112
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,900
I now return it to you!

113
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:41,613
For returning a fallen friend's keepsake,

114
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,920
I'll overlook your earlier offense.

115
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,190
But I'm taking these disciples.

116
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,580
I hope you two won't stop me.

117
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,750
You dumb woman, are you slow in the head?

118
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,040
Don't you get it?

119
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,560
We came for you.

120
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,800
These disciples are just extras.

121
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,410
The real prize is you!

122
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,928
Mrs, Grandmaster Yun Lu requests your presence.

123
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:18,600
Please come with us.

124
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,790
As for these disciples, since we are at war,

125
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,150
I can't let them go.

126
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,740
Apologies.

127
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,370
 In that case, let's fight! 

128
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,000
 Break out the moment battle starts. 

129
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,480
 Whoever escapes, escapes. 

130
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,670
 Meet at the spot marked by the Soul-Burning Spell. 

131
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,530
 Grandmaster! 

132
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,550
 Go now. 

133
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,480
 This fight isn't for you! 

134
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,750
 Move! 

135
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,500
Qu Hun, move!

136
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,380
Trying to run?

137
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,900
Your opponent is here.

138
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,030
Is this where it all ends?

139
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,500
I hope Han Li and the others got out.

140
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,120
We're almost there.

141
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,780
We'll be safe once we're there.

142
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,500
Han!

143
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,600
 Something's off. 

144
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,810
Be careful!

145
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,440
This is clearly the meeting spot.

146
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,360
Why are the demonic cultivators here?

147
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,480
Where's the person sent to pick us up?

148
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,030
There won't be anyone.

149
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,450
Come with me!

150
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,980
 It's him! 

151
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,790
Oh, isn't that Li Fei Yu?

152
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,220
No.

153
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,150
You're not Li Fei Yu.

154
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,530
Your name is... Han Li.

155
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,740
No wonder I couldn't track you down.

156
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,620
 How did he know I'd be here? 

157
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,880
Not bad.

158
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,980
You've got some skills.

159
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,020
This makes killing you way more fun!

160
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,810
A Core cultivator is here...

161
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,030
Master!

162
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:54,747
You're a lucky one, kid.

163
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,900
You made me work so hard just to find you.

164
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,810
Master, I finally found you.

165
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,000
Where's your Mentor Hong Fu?

166
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,120
She told us to meet here.

167
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,480
And she stayed behind
to stall those demonic cultivators.

168
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,900
Didn't expect we'd get ambushed too.

169
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,620
I see.

170
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:26,441
You've done well.

171
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,220
Here.

172
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,810
Take this.

173
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,440
Some supplies and gems.

174
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,960
If you run into your senior brothers and sisters,

175
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,530
share these with them for me.

176
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,450
Also this.

177
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,334
This one is for you to keep.

178
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:48,400
 

179
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,550
There are some insights from me.

180
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,810
Read them when you're breaking through.

181
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:56,150
Thanks for your guidance, Master.

182
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,020
But I can't accept

183
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,620
this mystic pouch.

184
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,360
Please, give it to the others yourself

185
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,780
once you return safely.

186
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,080
What are you talking about?

187
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,600
It's just some travel funds.

188
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,000
Alright, enough.

189
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,390
Next up is a battle between Core cultivators.

190
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,600
With your current level,

191
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,080
you won't be able to help at all.

192
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Hurry up and focus on healing.

193
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,000
Remember, once you leave Yue Kingdom,

194
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,750
the demonic sects won't be able to reach you.

195
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,140
Got it?

196
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,860
Master...

197
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,390
do you really have to go?

198
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,000
What?

199
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,450
Go where?

200
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,510
From what those demonic guys said,

201
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,670
they may not want to kill Senior Hong Fu.

202
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,530
They seem to have a hidden motive.

203
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,140
Please be extra careful.

204
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,550
You... I can't hide anything, huh?

205
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,620
Come on. Get up.

206
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,750
Han Li,

207
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,030
you haven't been here long, but you're smart,

208
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,600
cautious, and know how to keep a low profile.

209
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,620
One day, you may even surpass me.

210
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,840
I know full well,

211
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,200
this mission is incredibly dangerous.

212
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,630
Odds are I won't make it back.

213
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,500
But I have my reasons.

214
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,000
The longer one lives, the more one realizes

215
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,570
some things in this world
matter more than your own life.

216
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,860
Like...

217
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,170
Certain people.

218
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,230
Give me your hand.

219
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:57,015
I'll remove the Soul-Burning Spell for you.

220
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:59,345
This settles our sect's debt to you.

221
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:01,554
Alright.

222
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,330
Leave Yue Kingdom quickly.

223
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,590
There are many beautiful sights out there.

224
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,090
Go see them for me.

225
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,100
That's enough. I'm off now.

226
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,020
We're alive?

227
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,750
Where even are we?

228
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,550
That guy's insane.

229
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,550
Stick with him,
and you'll end up dead sooner or later.

230
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,590
What did you say?

231
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,830
I didn't say anything!

232
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,570
Just spitting out some sand.

233
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:23,030
I meant, congrats, Young Master!

234
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,350
You made it out alive against a Core cultivator!

235
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,350
You're destined for great things!

236
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,590
Any plans now?

237
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,960
What plans can I have?

238
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,003
Oh, I've got loads of ideas,

239
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:36,160
but the big calls are up to you.

240
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,290
You give the word, I'll follow.

241
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,110
We'll head to Yellow Maple Valley

242
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,480
and regroup with the Grandmaster.

243
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,220
Han Li... I swear I'll kill you myself someday!

244
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,570
What's wrong with you?

245
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,601
You truly are the strongest
woman of Yellow Maple Valley.

246
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:18,550
Your strength is remarkable.

247
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,390
Seems I'll have to give it everything I've got!

248
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,470
Let's grab that woman first,

249
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,510
then kill off the weaklings.

250
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,310
Just leave her face intact.

251
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,435
An arm or a leg missing doesn't matter.

252
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:34,775
As you wish, my dear!

253
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,200
You're strong enough, but unfortunately...

254
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,110
this battle will be your last!

255
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,220
Senior, I'm here with you!

256
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,000
Senior, sorry, I'm late!

257
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,940
Hurry, take this pill and start healing.

258
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,750
This is high-grade stuff from Wang Yu?

259
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,200
Yeah! One pill costs 2,000 gems!

260
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,130
Like swallowing money!

261
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,000
I sent Han Li and the others ahead.

262
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,720
- I wonder how they're doing...
- I just saw him.

263
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,290
Don't worry. That kid is not dying anytime soon.

264
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,750
What about the other disciples?

265
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,020
Did they all make it out of the valley?

266
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,070
Grandmaster likely got them out.

267
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,110
That guy met with Grandmaster.

268
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,000
This was all part of their plan.

269
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,710
Even the Soul-Burning Spell on us was part of it.

270
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,000
I see...

271
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,700
That's exactly his style.

272
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Still, trading me alone

273
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,720
to save all of Yellow Maple Valley,

274
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,700
that's a deal worth making.

275
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,000
Senior, doesn't this feel

276
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,400
just like when we first joined the sect?

277
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,680
We snuck into Clear Void Sect for spirit herbs,

278
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,750
and they sent a whole squad after us.

279
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,850
The whole place was chaos!

280
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,400
I still remember it clearly.

281
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,590
There were also Junior Lei and Wang Yu.

282
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,550
We even knocked over a whole pot of pills

283
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,500
Fu Yun Zi was refining.

284
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,685
Fu Yun Zi cried over it for days!

285
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,640
Like, hiding-under-the-blanket sobbing!

286
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,890
That old gambling addict!

287
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,330
This was from that fiend earlier.

288
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,890
I think Fu Yun Zi would want you to keep it.

289
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:40,994
We messed around all our lives.

290
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,850
But I doubt I'll ever get the chance

291
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,370
to repay that favor.

292
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,050
The Mountain Barrier's down...

293
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,610
Yellow Maple Valley has fallen.

294
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:06,554
You both aren't getting away either!

295
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,510
Senior, do you think we'll get out of this one

296
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,330
like we used to?

297
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,880
These punks aren't even worth the effort!

298
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,980
Junior, don't you dare steal my kills!

299
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,500
It's a shame the sect's gone.

300
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,370
As long as we live, the sect lives on.

301
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,500
These bastards are noisy.

302
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,830
Let Li Hua Yuan here clear the path for you.

303
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,610
Time to go home!

304
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,635
Congrats, Grandmaster.

305
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:10,335
You finally wiped out Yellow Maple Valley.

306
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,790
My Herbs Garden...

307
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,110
That hasn't been yours for a long time.

308
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,000
Everything below us now is dead.

309
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,960
Besides, you've already joined our sect.

310
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,780
You should've let go of these things long ago.

311
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,590
If all that's left is scorched earth,

312
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,780
what's the point of conquering it

313
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,720
for the Joyful Union Sect?

314
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,440
I've done as you asked

315
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,400
and gave them as much mercy as I could.

316
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,330
Wang Chan will handle this place.

317
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,270
Grandmaster, I won't disappoint you!

318
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,240
One more thing.

319
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,700
Did you catch that leftover from the Seven Sects?

320
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,070
Grandmaster,

321
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,110
that brat's too lucky.

322
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:17,700
I didn't expect he'd be rescued
by a Core cultivator from Yellow Maple Valley.

323
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,480
Even in a death trap like that, he still got away.

324
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,370
Maybe his fate really hasn't run out yet.

325
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,020
Does that mean...

326
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,720
I'll have to deal with him myself?

327
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,160
Grandmaster, please, there's no need for that!

328
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,830
In cultivation, you need
something to sharpen yourself.

329
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:50,330
That boy is still yours to face.

330
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,890
Rest assured, Grandmaster.

331
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,290
He won't get far.

332
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,070
 I hope Han Li will make it out alive. 

333
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,780
 I hope you won't get yourself killed. 

334
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,270
Looks like he's become your inner demon.

335
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,130
That'll seriously hinder your cultivation.

336
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,520
Father, please don't kill him.

337
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,040
Let him fight Wang Chan.

338
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,810
Hubby...

339
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,660
Darling!

340
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,310
Our grandmaster's here.

341
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,050
You're dead now!

342
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,790
Grandmaster, that's the one who saved the boy.

343
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,030
A Core cultivator from Yellow Maple Valley.

344
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,940
Master... Mentor...

345
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,780
Come back with me.

346
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,560
Junior, go on ahead.

347
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,690
At this point, death's the only outcome.

348
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,960
Li Hua Yuan of Yellow Maple Valley is here!

349
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,929
Let's see what Yun Lu has to teach me!

350
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:08,949
How foolish.

351
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,866
Yellow Maple Valley is finished.

352
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:16,350
But I'll honor my pact with Ling Hu.

353
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,510
Hong Fu stays.

354
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,440
Everyone else must leave.

355
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,330
Not leaving!

356
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,624
You, a mighty Nascent Soul cultivator,

357
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,594
won't even duel me one-on-one?

358
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,310
Yun Lu...

359
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,660
- Junior!
- Let's make a wager!

360
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,400
If I can force you to make a move, then I win!

361
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,530
And you'll have to let my senior go!

362
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,680
Junior, don't be stupid.

363
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,460
You're no match for him.

364
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,780
My turn.

365
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,050
Junior!

366
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,220
Worthy of a Nascent Soul cultivator...

367
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,200
After all these years,

368
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,440
you're still cold as ever
and won't change your mind?

369
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,155
After all these years, you're still so arrogant.

370
00:33:34,155 --> 00:33:38,175
As if the world belongs to you alone.

371
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,310
She's right.

372
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,500
Dead right.

373
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,440
People like you destroy homes and kill loved ones

374
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,570
all for your own gain,

375
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:56,070
then pretend you've done nothing wrong.

376
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,570
Shameless!

377
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,160
Mentor! Stop fighting!

378
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,270
Mentor Li!

379
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,720
Please!

380
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,400
Please stop!

381
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,050
Master...

382
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,130
My mother will be okay.

383
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,050
You have to treat your wounds now,
before it's too late!

384
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,090
Xuan Er, honestly...

385
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,810
You looked better in your old clothes.

386
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,130
Mentor...

387
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,550
Back in the day, there was this crusty old man.

388
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,350
On my very first day in the sect,

389
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,880
he taught me something.

390
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,750
He said, in this world,
the weak must bow their heads,

391
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,780
but only the strong get to take what they want.

392
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:56,000
Whether it's status, power, strength,

393
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,440
or even someone else's life,

394
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,680
if they want it, they take it.

395
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,240
That's the iron law of this world.

396
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,050
If you want to live long,
you'd better understand that.

397
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,020
But if that's all this world is,

398
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,460
what's the point?

399
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,110
He's shattering his own core

400
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,400
to forcibly boost his power.

401
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,820
Is he insane?

402
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:59,230
For Yellow Maple Valley,
take one more strike from me!

403
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,620
You old bastard!

404
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,230
Yun Lu!

405
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,330
I finally forced you to fight back!

406
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,660
I win!

407
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,740
Junior!

408
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,450
Senior.

409
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,290
We won.

410
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,700
We can finally go home.

411
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,450
Junior...

412
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,440
My name's Hong Fu.

413
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,180
From now on, you better call me Senior.

414
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,360
I'm Li Hua Yuan.

415
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,140

you've grown up.

433
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,330
From now on, you'll have to walk your path alone.

434

Urgent news from the outpost.

495
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,110
Yellow Maple Valley has fallen
to the demonic sects.

What's the casualty report?

Grandmaster Ling Hu
has already retreated with the elite disciples.

- What's wrong?

Master gave me an order yesterday.

You played a major role
in this war against the demonic sects.

505
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,150
But now, your injuries haven't healed.

506
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:26,040
She asked me to tell you
not to wear yourself out over such matters again.

507
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,370
So, Senior is set on making peace
with the demonic sects?

508
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,660
Fine.

509
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,320
What about the Foundation disciples

510
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,110
and Qi Refining disciples
from Yellow Maple Valley?

511
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,880
Do we know where they are?

512
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,960
During the retreat,
they split into several groups.

513
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,150
One of them was led by Hong Fu.

514
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,190
But along the way,

515
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,270
they were ambushed by the demonic sects.

516
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:56,010
Almost all of them were wiped out.

517
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,590
Wiped out?

518
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,110
No survivors?

519
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,960
That's just a rumor.

520
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,490
I'm not sure of the details.

521
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,780
 So... it's really time to build your monument? 

522
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,000
Spread the word.

523
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,190
If any disciple of Yellow Maple Valley
needs help,

524
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,930
Moonshadow Sect will offer aid.

525
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,150
I'll be going into secluded cultivation.

526
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,630
No one is to disturb me without my permission.

527
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,700
Yes, Grandmaster.

528
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,360
 If that brat really dies like this, 

529
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,270
 it's too good for him. 

530
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,890
 I need to go see for myself. 

531
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,955
 Too bad... That's the power of a Core cultivator. 

532
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:49,916
 Just a touch of that red mist, 

533
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:51,576
 and I'm already injured inside. 

534
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,773
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

535
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:31,660
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

536
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,100
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

537
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,507
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

538
00:45:37,507 --> 00:45:40,905
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

539
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:45,680
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

540
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,540
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

541
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:58,160
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

542
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,678
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

543
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:04,120
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

544
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,240
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

545
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,680
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

546
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,906
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

547
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,415
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

548
00:46:17,415 --> 00:46:20,440
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

549
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,380
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

550
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,920
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

551
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,800
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

552
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,160
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

553
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,320
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

554
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,640
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

555
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,200
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

556
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,280
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

557
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,240
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

558
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,000
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

559
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,080
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

560
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:07,828
 ♫ In a fleeting moment we call eternity ♫ 

561
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:15,459
 ♫ In a fleeting moment called eternity ♫
