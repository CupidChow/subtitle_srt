1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,505
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:27,080
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,169
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:32,560
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,140
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,880
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,000
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,920
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,320
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,273
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:05,753
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,249
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:13,680
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,840
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,100
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,300
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,980
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,968
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,400
 She's seriously injured. 

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,720
 I'm here. 

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,500
 I won't let you die. 

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,230
You... Stop hugging me so tightly.

28
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,810
I can't breathe.

29
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,030
My spiritual power...

30
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,010
You're taking my spiritual power.

31
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,360
Wake up!

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,721
Wake up!

33
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,501
Wake up!

34
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:26,590
Five Phases Array.

35
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,820
Now!

36
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,070
Give me something useful.

37
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,930
Hurry.

38
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,220
She bites as well?

39
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,160
 Forget it. 

40
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,470
 Consider this my payment 

41
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,580
 for what I received from you that day. 

42
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,830
It's him?

43
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,860
How come he has no power left?

44
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,430
 Oh, no. 

45
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,880
 As my cultivation core was damaged,
I used Rebirth Art. 

46
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,960
 I absorb power from whoever touches me. 

47
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,560
 This is so embarrassing. 

48
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,280
 I need to make sure he doesn't know I did it. 

49
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,970
 Perhaps I can run away? 

50
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,710
 But he did save me. 

51
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,190
 If he tells everyone... 

52
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,460
 Whatever. I'll just kill him later. 

53
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,000
 He sure has many artifacts to save his life. 

54
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,520
 That joke somehow became a reality. 

55
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,900
 I wonder if this is fortune or misfortune for him. 

56
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,310
Master.

57
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,680
Where am I?

58
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,430
Is this a dream?

59
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,700
Don't you always have a way
to keep yourself alive?

60
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,290
Why did you get yourself into this state?

61
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,240
Master, I'm fine.

62
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,020
Stop acting tough.

63
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,390
How old are you again?

64
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,270
You're acting tough like a grandfather.

65
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,260
What if you can't find a partner because of this?

66
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,800
You don't have a partner either.

67
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,260
Excuse me?

68
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,680
I see you've grown bold.

69
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,270
I learned it from you.

70
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,090
Brat.

71
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,120
Master.

72
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Who would have known

73
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,485
that the one who understands me the most
would be you?

74
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:12,875
My last disciple.

75
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,605
Something is bothering you.

76
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:18,160
Tell me now.

77
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,380
What do you think
is more important than one's life?

78
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:31,182
Our cultivators look for enlightenment
to achieve immortality.

79
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,405
How should I put this?

80
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:42,456
Everything in this world has a purpose.

81
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:45,626
The sun and the moon can exist for eons,

82
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:48,814
yet tiny creatures live and die within a day.

83
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:51,422
Enlightenment is formless.

84
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:54,322
It doesn't have one true answer.

85
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,250
For me, enlightenment
is achieving true peace with myself.

86
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,568
Fu Yun Zi wants to see good in everything.

87
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,984
Liu Jing wants absolute justice.

88
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:15,354
Our enlightenment is defined by ourselves.

89
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,789
That's why they say if they find
enlightenment in the morning,

90
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:25,049
they are content to pass away in the same evening.

91
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,190
That's right.

92
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,000
You can enjoy your long life,

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,231
but don't lose yourself to time either.

94
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:39,381
Remember who you are and your purpose.

95
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,900
Kid,

96
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,830
don't you still have many things to do?

97
00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:00,123
Don't dally here.

98
00:09:01,223 --> 00:09:02,773
Go now.

99
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:24,954
 The world has many breathtaking views. 

100
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:29,044
 Do admire them on behalf of me. 

101
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,220
Qi Refining Stage?

102
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,080
What's happening?

103
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,930
Why is this happening?

104
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,650
You're awake.

105
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,630
Senior Nangong, I saved you.

106
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,690
Why did you take my spiritual power?

107
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:19,870
What?

108
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,390
Who took your spiritual power?

109
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,440
You, Nangong Wan.

110
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,260
Nangong Wan?

111
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,690
You think I'm Nangong Wan?

112
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,780
You mistook me for my cousin.

113
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,810
I'm not Nangong Wan.

114
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,410
Who are you then?

115
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:48,267
I am Nangong

116
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,250
Ping.

117
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,690
Nangong Ping.

118
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:01,229
You must be the man from Yellow Maple Valley.

119
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:03,919
Nangong Wan told me everything.

120
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,870
Every... Everything?

121
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,080
Yes. Everything.

122
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,510
Not even a thick book

123
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,630
can contain the sins you've committed.

124
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,480
And the worst thing you did

125
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,790
is to give her an Ageless Pill.

126
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,600
Why? Are you calling her old?

127
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,670
When I heard that,
the first thing that came to my mind

128
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,020
was to capture you
and feed you to a spiritual beast.

129
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,370
So you repaid my kindness with vengeance,

130
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,030
and took away my spiritual power?

131
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,390
You reap what you sow.

132
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,290
You did bad things, so it's on you.

133
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,650
This is just a lesson.

134
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:51,143
Don't play hero again
and save a damsel in distress.

135
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,650
 Her family shares the same complicated temper. 

136
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,480
 But she's right. 

137
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,450
 I can't be reckless. 

138
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,860
Senior, if you're her cousin,

139
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,360
then I suppose by saving her,

140
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
I have returned her the favor.

141
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,140
Please put your mind at ease.

142
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,005
But I'm still a learning cultivator.

143
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,796
Whatever progress I made is gone.

144
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:31,336
I don't know when my power will come back.

145
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,910
Well, you aren't that bad.

146
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,980
You're quite smart.

147
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:48,360
You intervened yesterday

148
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,360
because you thought I was Nangong Wan.

149
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,290
Nonetheless, you came to my aid.

150
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,780
I will repay this favor in the future.

151
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,930
Thank you.

152
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,570
I feel dizzy.

153
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,020
He fainted again?

154
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,838
I'm hungry.

155
00:15:41,838 --> 00:15:45,378
I slept for a few days, and my tummy is grumbling.

156
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,630
Is there any food here?

157
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,240
It's empty here.

158
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,050
Isn't there anything at all?

159
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,530
Do you

160
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:02,153
always bring these with you?

161
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,610
Thank you.

162
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,910
I have heard that there was a gluttonous
Core Formation Stage cultivator

163
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,390
who always brought cooking utensils with her.

164
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,650
It's her then?

165
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,064
 I'm safe now. 

166
00:16:41,064 --> 00:16:43,564
 However, my progress has regressed
to the Qi Refining Stage. 

167
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,320
 Regardless, 

168
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,200
 it complements
the Triple Cycle Core Rebirth nicely. 

169
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,550
 I guess it's meant to be. 

170
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,750
 Alas, I have to do the same thing two more times 

171
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,980
 to reach the Core Formation Stage. 

172
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,840
 What is that idiot cooking? 

173
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,530
 It smells good. 

174
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,330
 He can cook. 

175
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,440
 What? 

176
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,100
 Is he eating alone? 

177
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:51,747
 He won't invite me? 

178
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,030
Senior Nangong.

179
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,361
This is an invigorating broth

180
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:07,720
made from spirit water and herbs.

181
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,290
Enjoy while it's warm.

182
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,211
What is this?

183
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:30,541
Flatbread.

184
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Is it good?

185
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,150
It's my favorite.

186
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,650
I want one too.

187
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,790
I only made one.

188
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,220
Let me have a bite.

189
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,617
The mortals believe cultivators don't need food.

190
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:06,549
We only take from nature.

191
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:10,920
Little do they know, by combining
matching spirit water and herbs

192
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,945
and cooking them over low heat,
we make a gourmet meal.

193
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,005
I didn't know you could cook.

194
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,195
You must have cooked a lot.

195
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,500
I'm glad you like it.

196
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,270
Speak.

197
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,395
Why are you here?

198
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:36,655
What are you going to do next?

199
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:43,610
 If she's not Nangong Wan, I can't tell her
about the teleport array yet. 

200
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,530
Yellow Maple Valley

201
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,913
has fallen into the demonic sects' hands.

202
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:53,478
I can't return.

203
00:19:53,478 --> 00:19:58,410
Earlier, I learned that there is a gem quarry here
owned by the demonic sects.

204
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,550
However, it has weak security.

205
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,080
I wanted to earn some easy gems

206
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,520
and go somewhere remote and peaceful
for my cultivating.

207
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,070
But after this debacle, my progress faded.

208
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,090
I'm afraid my plan will go to waste.

209
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,110
 Is he trying to ask a favor from me? 

210
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,350
 Fine. 

211
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,880
 He did help me. 

212
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,680
 I'll give him a second chance. 

213
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,980
While it is indeed easy gems,

214
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,245
we're inside the demonic sects' territory.

215
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,105
You shouldn't take the risk.

216
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,420
You know what?

217
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,640
I can give you two options.

218
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,880
One, I'll give you some gems and useful resources

219
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,850
to make up for your lost progress
and your timely intervention.

220
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,646
Two...

221
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,350
You come to the Moonshadow Sect with me.

222
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,129
Go to Moonshadow Sect with you?

223
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:02,463
Don't get the wrong idea.

224
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:07,110
I'm just thinking that if you study
under our Core Formation Stage cultivators,

225
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,550
you may recover your progress faster.

226
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,200
Our sect has a legacy
of more than a thousand years.

227
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,480
We have secret arts that outsiders do not know.

228
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,700
The technique I used
to absorb your power yesterday is one of them.

229
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,750
Since you've helped me,

230
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,480
I'll put in some good words
for you in front of Nangong Wan.

231
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,530
She won't object to this.

232
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,270
 One option is so much better than the other. 

233
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,600
 Does she want me to go with her on purpose? 

234
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,030
 But to become her subordinate is... 

235
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,110
So?

236
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,810
Have you made your decision?

237
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,640
Yes.

238
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,310
I appreciate your offer.

239
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,440
I'm used to autonomy,
so I'll have some gems with me.

240
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,245
As for my progress,
I will find a way to recover it.

241
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:04,315
Don't worry.

242
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,700
 That's a lot. She sure is generous. 

243
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,000
All right.

244
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,440
It's too late for you to change your mind.

245
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,920
You've made up your mind.

246
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,880
I don't want to force you.

247
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,330
Just make sure you won't regret
the decision you made today.

248
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,950
In that case, I shall take my leave.

249
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,600
Wait.

250
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,660
You're leaving like this?

251
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,160
Well, you're weaker now.

252
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,180
You won't be able to fend
those demonic cultivators off.

253
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,400
Let me eliminate them first before you leave.

254
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,880
This array is decent.

255
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,030
You can trap enemies, hide away,
and do many things.

256
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,600
But you need something more offensive.

257
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,160
Thank you for the compliment.

258
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,420
It's made by a friend of mine.

259
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,485
That friend of yours

260
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:35,505
is probably a woman who hates fighting.

261
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,190
Kid, I'll leave now.

262
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,140
Qi Refining Stage...

263
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:53,332
I have no choice but to go somewhere.

264
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,470
Young Master,

265
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,550
the fire in the stove was put out a while ago.

266
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,470
They must be far now.

267
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,520
How annoying.

268
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,500
That woman from Moonshadow Sect
recovered so quickly.

269
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,360
She even had time to have a meal here.

270
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,840
She's mocking us.

271
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,880
How humiliating.

272
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,880
And I swear I knew that masked man

273
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,160
who snuck into our team that day from somewhere.

274
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,600
Find out where he came from.

275
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,470
Young Master, I observed his technique

276
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,790
but I'm not sure what it was.

277
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,400
It's as if he knows a bit of everything.

278
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,790
But why did Miss Xuan Er help them?

279
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,740
Did she know them?

280
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,010
She knew them?

281
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,680
Moonshadow Sect.

282
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,490
Yellow Maple Valley.

283
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,250
Could it be

284
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:37,191
Han Li?

285
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,790
I knew it.

286
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,200
It's him.

287
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,700
That accursed man!

288
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,070
Young Master, but you said that Han Li had fled.

289
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,640
Why did he come back here?

290
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,790
I should have known that he was close to that girl

291
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,550
from the Yan Clan Stronghold.

292
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,770
The Moonshadow Sect is meddling in now.

293
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,360
It's been a while.

294
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,640
And he's as cunning as ever,

295
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,980
sneaking around under my nose!

296
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,850
How perceptive of you, Young Master.

297
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,470
Think about it.

298
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,440
He came alone.

299
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,920
It'd be like catching an easy prey.

300
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,250
Congratulations, Young Master. You finally did it.

301
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,140
No, your dream has finally come true.

302
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,640
He fled before me today.

303
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,550
Do you find it funny?

304
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,900
No.

305
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,270
Tell everyone to search for him within 500 li.

306
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,360
Dig deep underground if they have to

307
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,180
but I want him before me!

308
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,120
He has become my inner demon.

309
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,490
I need to torture him,
or I can't have peace of mind.

310
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,485
 They won't expect me
to return to where it happened. 

311
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:48,509
 Now that I'm in the Qi Refining Stage, 

312
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:50,400
 I need to repair the array quickly 

313
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,530
 before any undesirable changes take place. 

314
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,840
 I should make it quick. 

315
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,180
 Let's go. 

316
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,700
 It doesn't work. 

317
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,018
 Perhaps it lacks charge? 

318
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,050
 All energy has been drained. 

319
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,900
Seems like you have a big appetite too.

320
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,710
 Forget it. 

321
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,290
 It's an emergency. 

322
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,470
Young Master, we have searched everywhere
within 500 li.

323
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,960
This quarry is the only place left.

324
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,470
Young Master.

325
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,680
Young Master, it's him.

326
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,710
He's there.

327
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,840
Han Li!

328
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,880
- Young Master.
- This is risky.

329
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,030
If I'm not wrong,
that is an ancient teleport array.

330
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,740
Indeed.

331
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,790
Congratulations, Young Master.

332
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,920
Every sect is coveting
that ancient teleport array.

333
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,140
Offer it to the sect master
and you'll be rewarded.

334
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,010
So he is a blessing in disguise.

335
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:32,360
You two.

336
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,052
Go.

337
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,070
Take him down.

338
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,680
Don't damage the teleport array.

339
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,010
Yes.

340
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,330
Qu Hun.

341
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,700
We're leaving now.

342
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,900
 It's him again. 

343
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,960
Qu Hun.

344
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,420
Protect the array.

345
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,160
Careful.

346
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,680
Don't damage the array.

347
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,380
- Of course.
-  Core Formation Stage cultivators. 

348
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,220
Qu Hun, offer your energy to the array!

349
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,920
What's taking them so long?

350
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Young Master, he has an array.

351
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,200
It can take hits
from Core Formation Stage cultivators.

352
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,840
Don't just stand there.

353
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,660
Break the array!

354
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,750
 Desperate time calls for desperate measures. 

355
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,220
 I'll use everything. 

356
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,440
Arrays.

357
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,250
Puppets.

358
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,990
I didn't expect him to have so many tricks.

359
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:26,030
If he doesn't die, he'll be a great threat.

360
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,310
Don't hold back.

361
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,330
Break the array immediately!

362
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,765
Qu Hun! Charge the array!

363
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:48,385
Why did you stop?

364
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,920
Have we run out of gems?

365
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,400
Have we run out of gems?

366
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,850
Gems...

367
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,770
It's finally moving.

368
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,370
Young Master, his array
can't hold on for much longer.

369
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,060
Han Li, your journey ends here!

370
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,720
Young Master, don't damage the teleport array.

371
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,290
Shut up.

372
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:03,180
Die!

373
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,340
Teleport!

374
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:20,830
Azure Drake Banner.

375
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,020
Go!

376
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,860
 ♫ Chasing wind ♫ 

377
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,280
 ♫ I set out afar... ♫ 

378
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,220
Cyan Sword Technique.

379
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,740
 ♫ My voice unheard ♫ 

380
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,740
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

381
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,940
 ♫ Laying low ♫ 

382
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,220
 ♫ I plan every move ♫ 

383
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,140
 ♫ With a mortal heart ♫ 

384
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,900
 ♫ And lingering ties ♫ 

385
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,640
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

386
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,700
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

387
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,000
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

388
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,240
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

389
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,520
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink... ♫ 

390
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,525
 This isn't over yet. 

391
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:10,260
 I will be back one day. 

392
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,980
 ♫ As chaos shakes the world ♫ 

393
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:17,580
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

394
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,380
 ♫ Kind at heart ♫ 

395
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,140
 ♫ Ruthless when I must be ♫ 

396
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,080
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath... ♫ 

397
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,804
Han Li!

398
00:39:25,804 --> 00:39:27,645
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

399
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:30,285
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

400
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,280
 ♫ Forged by trial ♫ 

401
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,540
 ♫ I rise through three realms ♫ 

402
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,980
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

403
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,360
 ♫ Drunken steps, high song
over ocean and mountaintop ♫ 

404
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,805
 ♫ The celestial gourd bears dew,
the Golden Core takes shape ♫ 

405
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:54,280
 ♫ Deep in the night, the crane
soars through autumn's clear sky ♫ 

406
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,020
 ♫ Across endless western winds
cuts a lone sword, cold and true ♫ 

407
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,700
 ♫ A lone sword, cold and true ♫ 

408
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,408
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

409
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,980
 ♫ I fight alone ♫ 

410
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,780
 ♫ As chaos shakes the world ♫ 

411
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,280
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

412
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,040
 ♫ Kind at heart ♫ 

413
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,840
 ♫ Ruthless when I must be ♫ 

414
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,480
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath... ♫ 

415
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:25,832
Oh, you old gambler.

416
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:28,225
Your disciple

417
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,410
has reached heaven.

418
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,740
 

419
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,240
 

420
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,400
 

421
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,400
 

422
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,827
 ♫ That day I first saw you ♫ 

423
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:10,547
 ♫ We held close, hearts full of joy ♫ 

424
00:41:11,632 --> 00:41:15,750
 ♫ We made a promise to reunite ♫ 

425
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,890
 ♫ And walked into the unknown ♫ 

426
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,430
 ♫ But now that we've met again ♫ 

427
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:27,310
 ♫ Only silence fills the space as we lock eyes ♫ 

428
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:31,588
 ♫ We cherished each moment... ♫ 

429
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:35,048
 Is this the new world? 

430
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,240
 ♫ I chase the years, but youth is long gone ♫ 

431
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,429
 ♫ So be it, I set myself free ♫ 

432
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:49,600
 ♫ To be one standing tall and proud ♫ 

433
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,326
 ♫ Never become a hollow shell... ♫ 

434
00:41:53,326 --> 00:41:56,747
 I quite like the view here. 

435
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:01,868
 

436
00:42:01,868 --> 00:42:06,280
 ♫ Even as cold winds blow ♫ 

437
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,680
 ♫ Even though it mocks loudly ♫ 

438
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,600
 ♫ We're just fleeting mortals ♫ 

439
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,560
 ♫ Time slipped by before we knew ♫ 

440
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,926
 ♫ Yet we burn that spark of light ♫ 

441
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:26,100
 ♫ Into this starry sky ♫ 

442
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,280
 ♫ Starlight fades into the Milky Way ♫ 

443
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,483
 ♫ While the mayfly dies in the whirlpool ♫ 

444
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:38,599
 ♫ Fate raises a toast with song ♫ 

445
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,554
 ♫ Playing the fleeting game of life ♫ 

446
00:42:42,554 --> 00:42:46,755
 ♫ Each step of fate's game unclear ♫ 

447
00:42:46,755 --> 00:42:50,919
 ♫ Who can guess the ending? ♫ 

448
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:55,030
 ♫ But my heart has never rested ♫ 

449
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,520
 ♫ Ever chasing, still searching on ♫ 

450
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,360
 ♫ Through all the joy and sorrow ♫ 

451
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,560
 ♫ How do I choose the way? ♫ 

452
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,800
 ♫ Now we part, so far apart ♫ 

453
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,840
 ♫ We'll walk our separate paths ♫ 

454
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:55,121
 ♫ I chase the years, but youth is long gone ♫ 

455
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:59,000
 ♫ So be it, I set myself free ♫ 

456
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,200
 ♫ To be one standing tall and proud ♫

 ♫ Never become a hollow shell ♫ 

458
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,480
 ♫ The ones before once told me ♫ 

459
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,640
 ♫ There's still hardship ahead ♫ 

460
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,840
 ♫ Even as cold winds blow ♫ 

461
