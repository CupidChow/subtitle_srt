1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,505
 ♫ Chasing wind, I set out afar ♫ 

2
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:27,115
 ♫ The road ahead lost, my voice unheard ♫ 

3
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:29,146
 ♫ I've tasted joy and sorrow ♫ 

4
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:32,531
 ♫ Laying low, I plan every move ♫ 

5
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:36,162
 ♫ With a mortal heart and lingering ties ♫ 

6
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:37,571
 ♫ I'm roaming far and wide ♫ 

7
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:41,983
 ♫ A twist of fate in desperate times ♫ 

8
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:46,533
 ♫ A bond that outlives the dust of life ♫ 

9
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:50,976
 ♫ Still chasing what immortality means ♫ 

10
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:56,143
 ♫ Even eternity flashes by in a blink ♫ 

11
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:01,305
 ♫ Don't mock my ordinary life ♫ 

12
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:05,785
 ♫ I fight alone as chaos shakes the world ♫ 

13
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:10,296
 ♫ Don't scorn my humble roots ♫ 

14
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:13,620
 ♫ Kind at heart, ruthless when I must be ♫ 

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,647
 ♫ Fate stirs with joy and grief beneath ♫ 

16
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:17,959
 ♫ I hold the tide between life and death ♫ 

17
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,049
 ♫ Faith carries me through endless dark ♫ 

18
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,729
 ♫ And I return with a heart refined ♫ 

19
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:29,923
 ♫ Forged by trial, I rise through three realms ♫ 

20
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,580
 ♫ Reborn in the wheel of fate ♫ 

21
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,780
 

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,020
 

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,740
 

24
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,180
Wei Niang!

25
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,020
Jing!

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,510
 Blood Cocoon? 

27
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,170
 Another fiend cultivator! 

28
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,035
Run!

29
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,335
Move!

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,870
Jing!

31
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,810
Jing!

32
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,930
Brother, let me help you one last time.

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,200
Don't worry.

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,460
None of them will get away!

35
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,920
That's too bad.

36
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,280
His spiritual power is still rising!

37
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,480
You guys, leave now!

38
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,840
- No!
- No!

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,230
I'm staying with you!

40
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,400
Go set the array in the bamboo grove.

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,590
I'll lure him over.

42
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,730
Go!

43
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,010
All right! Move!

44
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,760
 We can't afford more deaths. 

45
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,150
 Or I won't be able to explain to the sect. 

46
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,000
 Our next move needs time. 

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,820
 I'll just have to stall him for now. 

48
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,885
I underestimated you.

49
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:05,225
Had I known, I would've dealt with you first!

50
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,340
But now, it's not too late.

51
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,360
 What was that just now? 

52
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,560
 That was close. 

53
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,340
 I almost died! 

54
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
You're only at Mid Foundation Stage,

55
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,930
yet your cultivation core runs this deep?

56
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,750
Truly intoxicating.

57
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,240
You brat from Yellow Maple Valley,
what's your name?

58
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,360
When you killed those rogue cultivators,

59
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,150
did you ask for their names too?

60
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,470
That's right.

61
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,280
You must've seen the names on that tower!

62
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,180
I carved each one myself!

63
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,560
They're merely part of me.

64
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,930
Just stepping stones on my path
to my grand ambition!

65
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,150
The bamboo grove Han mentioned
should be right here.

66
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,410
Wei Niang, Senior Song, I need your help.

67
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,230
That Black Fiend Cult Master
is nearly at peak Foundation Establishment Stage.

68
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,720
Will this array really work on him?

69
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,420
At this point, we can only trust Han.

70
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,790
Let me keep talking to him.

71
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,010
They need more time to finish the array.

72
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,230
You're already a king in the mortal realm.

73
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,870
What ambition can drive you so far?

74
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,550
A king?

75
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,870
What king?

76
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,840
In the eyes of you lofty cultivators,

77
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,720
we're just worthless ants!

78
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,040
 Keep him talking. 

79
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,310
 Stall him a bit longer. 

80
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,520
When this city was built,

81
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,452
we mortals were nothing

82
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:24,530
but livestock in your eyes.

83
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,280
You preach your immortal ideals day after day,

84
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,600
but you have never once cared about the bones

85
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,190
buried beneath the mountains!

86
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,520
Mortal kings can't cultivate.

87
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,840
That's the rule set by your Seven Sects.

88
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,080
What a shame.

89
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,750
My brother and I were born with spirit roots,

90
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,725
but could only turn
to this demonic blood sacrifice!

91
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:55,535
All because

92
00:07:56,203 --> 00:08:00,103
we refused to stay your puppets!

93
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,310
 Keep him talking. 

94
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,230
You didn't want to be a puppet,

95
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,310
yet you used those rogue cultivators
as your stepping stones.

96
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,840
You want to live forever,

97
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,525
so let your brothers die for it?

98
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:16,016
In my eyes, you're nothing but a vile demon!

99
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:17,916
A disgrace to your family!

100
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,420
I almost fell for your tricks.

101
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,920
You really know how to piss me off.

102
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,280
 They should be ready now. 

103
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,840
Fine.

104
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
Let's fight.

105
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,860
Let's see who's truly in the wrong!

106
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,530
Despicable scum!

107
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,670
- Han!
- Han!

108
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,840
You're hurt. Are you all right?

109
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,260
I'm fine.

110
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,380
He's coming!

111
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,790
So arrogant.

112
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,110
I'm not stepping into your array.

113
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,180
What can you do about it?

114
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,520
 You think staying out of the array keeps you safe? 

115
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,400
 From the moment you caught up, 

116
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,420
 you were already trapped. 

117
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,600
Come on.

118
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,330
It's my turn!

119
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,300
Such a cheap trick.

120
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,060
 

121
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,900
 

122
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,020
 

123
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,560
 

124
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,430
Master!

125
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,590
Master!

126
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,550
You fiend, stop right there! Wu Xuan is here!

127
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,950
Don't leave us behind!

128
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,550
Master!

129
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,640
- Master!
- Stop!

130
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,710
Save us!

131
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,790
- Master!
- How could you be so heartless?

132
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,721
- Master!
- Save me, Master!

133
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:27,790
- Wu Xuan is here!
- Master!

134
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,400
- You fiend, stop right there!
- Don't leave us!

135
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,040
Foundation Establishment... Core Formation...

136
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,520
The path to immortality... All a lie?

137
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,830
Let go!

138
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,540
Let go of me!

139
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,640
I said, let go!

140
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,550
You're nothing more than shells

141
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,240
I raised to make spirit pills.

142
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,690
And you dare dream of immortality?

143
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,700
Save us!

144
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,520
- You fiend!
- Or dream of eternal life?

145
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,950
If you don't die, how can I achieve eternal life?

146
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,550
How can I rule for all eternity?

147
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,000
Fiend!

148
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,490
Master!

149
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,120
Brother, why do I have
to die for your immortality?

150
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,830
- Why don't you go die yourself?
- You fiend!

151
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,120
Why?

152
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,240
- Don't leave me!
- Master!

153
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,430
Save us!

154
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,120
Save us!

155
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,310
You fiend, stop right there!

156
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,970
Master! Take me with you!

157
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,760
Save us!

158
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,850
Master!

159
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,460
 

160
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,550
Grand ambition?

161
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,590
In the end, you're
just a selfish coward.

162
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,190
You're playing tricks.

163
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,180
Die!

164
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,520
You're just a selfish coward.

165
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,790
You're just a selfish coward!

166
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,330
You're just a selfish coward!

167
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,060
You can't trap me forever!

168
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,310
Come out!

169
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,450
Come out!

170
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,090
Come out!

171
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,210
Come out!

172
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,760
Han, is he insane?

173
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,550
He's consumed by obsession.

174
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,470
Come out!

175
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,120
Han's array is truly incredible!

176
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,490
From now on, I'll never dare cross him again.

177
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,950
But this array can only hold him for a while.

178
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,090
We'll still need a talisman to finish him off.

179
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,860
 What's he trying to do now? 

180
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:29,210
I didn't expect you'd force me to use this.

181
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,420
Han, let's take him down together!

182
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,640
Didn't think
you can use a talisman this recklessly.

183
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,510
Han, you really don't hold back.

184
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,880
 It's not like I want to. 

185
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,860
 The sect never covers my costs anyway. 

186
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:54,560
 He should've been turned to dust. 

187
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,340
 So why can I still sense his aura in the array? 

188
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:09,250
Never thought your array would have
such rich elemental diversity!

189
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,880
It actually helped me find a breakthrough.

190
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,530
As long as I can regenerate with blood,

191
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,230
as long as my soul remains,

192
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,400
you'll never be able to kill me!

193
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,600
This is the perfect place to refine my power

194
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
and forge a baleful core!

195
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,400
Later, I'll kill you!

196
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,750
That fiend is terrifying.

197
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,270
He's even turned Han's array to his advantage.

198
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,112
If we don't end him here and now,

199
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:43,470
he'll become a disaster.

200
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,010
All right, Han.

201
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,180
I'll take it from here.

202
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,030
Wei Niang, no!

203
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,360
That was left to you by Jing.

204
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,030
Wei Niang, did you already activate it just now?

205
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,920
This talisman and the one from Senior Liu
are a matching pair.

206
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,940
Sharp eyes, Han.

207
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,950
They're called Phoenix Talismans.

208
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,490
Both were forged from the same treasure.

209
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,860
Jing got it back in the day,

210
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,660
and gave one to me.

211
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,840
That fiend can regenerate from blood.

212
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,230
He's nearly impossible to kill.

213
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,567
If we don't burn him to ashes,
there's no other way!

214
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:52,737
Han, please, open the array!

215
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,730
Wei Niang...

216
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,380
No way...

217
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,050
I'm not ready to let go!

218
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,320
Jing, look.

219
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,052
Even this fiend's blood can burn so beautifully.

220
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,230
 These are the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills 

221
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,160
 he sacrificed everything to obtain. 

222
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,880
 There are also this hidden weapon that wounded me, 

223
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,270
 and all these treasures. 

224
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,470
 Even after repeated blasts from talismans, 

225
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,320
 they're still intact. 

226
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,250
 Clearly, none of them is ordinary. 

227
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,610
Han,

228
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,680
I've already informed the sect.

229
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,440
The Discipline Hall will take over the aftermath.

230
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,960
As for Emperor Yue's involvement,

231
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,960
they'll likely make up a cover story.

232
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,460
Everything will return to how it was.

233
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,850
One more thing.

234
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,550
Just now,

235
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,110
in a hidden chamber where the emperor was hiding,

236
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,570
we found Wu Xuan's body.

237
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,622
Judging by the looks of it,

238
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:10,660
he must've suffered immensely.

239
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,050
Oh, Han,

240
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:47,180
we found this book in that fiend's place as well.

241
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,680
In this battle, you saved me, Wei Niang, and Chen.

242
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,090
I thought about it,

243
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,960
and I think it should be yours to deal with.

244
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,510
The techniques in here are dark and twisted.

245
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,510
 
You may study a little,

246
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,610
but don't ever fall into its path.

247
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,920
 Demonic Transformation, 

248
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,720
 Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills 

249
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,940
 and the Avatar technique... 

250
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,740
 So this is where the Black Fiend
Cult's powers come from. 

251
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,020
Thank you, Senior.

252
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,160
As for this book, I will destroy it in due time.

253
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,290
I won't let its poison spread.

254
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,020
Our Master once said,

255
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,810
no technique is inherently good or evil.

256
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,460
Good or evil lies in the heart.

257
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,810
Don't worry, Senior.

258
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,130
All right.

259
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,440
Let's go.

260
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,780
Time to head back.

261
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,740
 

262
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,020
 

263
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,635
 Senior Chen has set off
to report back to her clan. 

264
00:27:54,635 --> 00:27:59,976
 After this battle, the always-cheerful her
fell into silence. 

265
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,720
 Senior Zhong will escort Senior Liu's relics home. 

266
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,500
 Naturally, Senior Song went with her. 

267
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,480
 In just a few days, everything changed. 

268
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,633
 If the Seven Sects make it through this crisis, 

269
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:19,133
 we'll reunite at Yellow Maple Valley again. 

270
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,850
Every time I close my eyes now, I see Jing's face.

271
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,270
I grew up with him.

272
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,020
I still can't believe

273
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,790
he's gone.

274
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,030
He once told me

275
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,510
you're the young master of the Song family,

276
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,030
and he was just an orphan.

277
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,130
Yet you always treated him so well.

278
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,440
Young master?

279
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,240
Without him, I wouldn't even be alive.

280
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,810
What "young master"...

281
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,740
Jing once saved your life?

282
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,440
Back then, a dark cultivator
snuck into our family,

283
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,050
pretending to be the accountant.

284
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,830
He discovered that my senior
and I had spirit roots.

285
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,720
He wanted to use us in his experiments.

286
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,500
If not for him,

287
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,790
I'd have been...

288
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,430
- Hold still!
- The monster's lab rat.

289
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:18,105
You bit me?

290
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,235
Drink it!

291
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,931
Drink it!

292
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:24,911
Now!

293
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,310
Let's run!

294
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,875
Ever since that day, his body's been damaged.

295
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,845
He could never reach Core Formation Stage.

296
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,220
What?

297
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,370
So that's why he hated demonic cultivators.

298
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,587
He never told me any of this.

299
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:54,880
Of course he wouldn't.

300
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,091
He always wanted to leave you
with only the best memories.

301
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,250
Fool...

302
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,130
I wish I could hear those words from you myself.

303
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:32,563
Wei Niang.

304
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,013
Don't be sad.

305
00:30:34,704 --> 00:30:37,160
Let's take Jing home together.

306
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,890
I'm sure he misses home too.

307
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,921
Every cloud has a silver lining.

308
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:08,827
 The battle cost me dearly, 

309
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:12,030
 but I broke through because of it too. 

310
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,790
 I've reached the Late Foundation Stage. 

311
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,370
 I also happened to unravel
the secrets within the Mystic Yin Art. 

312
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,440
 Turns out this technique 

313
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,750
 didn't originate from the Tiannan Continent. 

314
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,920
 It's incredibly sinister. 

315
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,680
 Thankfully, I didn't recklessly
take the Blood Condensing Five-Element Pills. 

316
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,790
 This pill feeds on the blood aura 

317
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,550
 of fiend Foundation Establishment cultivators. 

318
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:39,680
 No wonder Emperor Yue gave it to them. 

319
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,680
 Those five likely died without ever knowing 

320
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,660
 they were just the emperor's living incubators. 

321
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,315
 Though it boasts a 30% chance of forming a core, 

322
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,310
 the resulting baleful core is a false one. 

323
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,160
 Not only does it block future breakthroughs, 

324
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,110
 but it's corroded by blood aura, 

325
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,350
 turning the user into a beast. 

326
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,720
 If you lose your humanity, 

327
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,350
 what's the point of living forever? 

328
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:15,160
 Still, the Avatar technique recorded in the book 

329
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,130
 may be worth studying. 

330
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,720
What's this new spell? It's quite interesting.

331
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,050
You brat!

332
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,020
I told you to keep an eye on the Qin family.

333
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,180
And you went and made a mess like this?

334
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,110
Listen up.

335
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,240
The frontlines are in total chaos these days.

336
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,400
Don't come over.

337
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,850
Stay out of it.

338
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,270
Get back to Yellow Maple Valley

339
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,980
and reflect on your mistakes!

340
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,740
When I return, explain properly to me!

341
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,130
He's off?

342
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,270
You were right.

343
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,750
Steward Wang really hid piles of gold and silver.

344
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,480
Cai Huan found it all

345
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,160
and handed it out to the poor in the city.

346
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,830
But Cai Huan said that
those artifacts and talismans

347
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,310
should be handled by you instead.

348
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:19,460
 Looks like they were taken from rogue cultivators. 

349
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:24,850
 Who knows how many were just like Xiao Shan? 

350
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,500
Miss Mo is so thoughtful.

351
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,830
Where is she?

352
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,400
Why didn't she come with you?

353
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,510
Well, one of the rogue cultivators
we rescued was severely injured.

354
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,640
She died giving birth

355
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,240
and left behind a premature baby girl.

356
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,960
Strangest thing, she cries whenever she sees me,

357
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,240
no matter how I coax her.

358
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,740
But once she's in Cai Huan's arms,
she calms right down.

359
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,320
 That's just how she is. 

360
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,170
 All these years, she's never changed. 

361
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,830
Cai Huan is busy looking after Ying Ning.

362
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,460
No time to come say hi.

363
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,000
Ying Ning's the baby girl.
Her mother's surname was Li.

364
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,090
Looks like she'll be raised by Cai Huan.

365
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,680
You've done a lot this time.

366
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,640
Go on, what reward do you want?

367
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,270
There really is a reward?

368
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,590
I can ask for anything?

369
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,130
You'll agree to anything I say?

370
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,240
Come on, tell me.

371
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,130
Do you want pills, artifacts,
or advanced talismans?

372
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,330
Then what do you want?

373
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,110
I want to become your disciple!

374
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,610
Master, please accept my respect!

375
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,720
Don't kneel.

376
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,110
You can speak to me standing up.

377
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,740
Stand up and speak properly.

378
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:00,528
Li, do you think I'm not talented enough?

379
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:02,745
I know I'm reckless and hot-headed,
and way too full of myself.

380
00:35:02,745 --> 00:35:04,806
I'm not like those elite disciples
from the Seven Sects.

381
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:07,240
But I really, truly, want to learn from you.

382
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,110
I swear I'll never be rude to you again.

383
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,200
I'll massage your shoulders, serve you tea!

384
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,880
Whatever you need, every single day!

385
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,590
I just have this one tiny wish.

386
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,220
Please take me in!

387
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:19,158
 This girl's really persistent. 

388
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,510
All right, if you keep going like this,

389
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,960
you'll lose all your rewards, I promise.

390
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,160
As for me, I never planned on taking a disciple.

391
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,530
But I do have something that may help you.

392
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,780
 

393
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,000
You've got good potential,

394
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
but I'm not taking disciples.

395
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,400
Take this jade token, go to Yellow Maple Valley,

396
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,760
and find a senior surnamed Ma.

397
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,060
Got it?

398
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,450
 Miss Mo, if you're reading this. 

399
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,960
 I'm sorry for saying goodbye this way. 

400
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,400
 This bottle of pills is called Ageless Pill. 

401
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,805
 It can preserve youth and beauty. 

402
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,505
 Make sure to take it yourself. 

403
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,800
 And here are some recipes to strengthen the body, 

404
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,000
 
 so you can make pills and sell them. 

405
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,850
 I hope they help your business. 

406
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,960
 I will soon be far away. 

407
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,400
 The journey is long. 

408
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,510
 I don't know when I'll return. 

409
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:06,140
 Miss Mo, please try to forget me. 

410
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,190
Mr. Han! Mr. Han!

411
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,370
Mr. Han! Wait!

412
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,000
I finally caught up with you!

413
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,110
Qin Gui, what are you doing here?

414
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,490
Mr. Han,

415
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,320
you may not know this.

416
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,230
But those filthy gossips in the manor

417
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,710
are saying you got driven out of the capital.

418
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,840
But I know that's not true.

419
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,590
I saw it myself the Master adored you.

420
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,230
And you even cured Young Master's illness.

421
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,320
Such generosity is far beyond any man.

422
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,720
And I know you're no ordinary man.

423
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,528
When I heard you were leaving,

424
00:38:11,528 --> 00:38:17,140
I had my wife cook a few hometown
dishes just for you!

425
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,360
I also brought some fine wine too!

426
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,760
You have to eat before you go!

427
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,220
Come on!

428
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,150
Sir, you must return someday!

429
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,840
I'll take good care of this business for you.

430
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,140
You must come back and inherit it!

431
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,540
Get up.

432
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:50,205
What kind of man do you think I am?

433
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,780
What's that?

434
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,070
Sir... Sir?

435
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,510
Sir?

436
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,840
Sir?

437
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,960
Oh... No... Immortal!

438
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,800
Immortal Han!

439
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,880
Immortal Han!

440
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,510
I failed to recognize your greatness!

441
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,030
Immortal Han! I, Qin Gui,

442
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,920
 
will build a shrine in your honor!

443
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,510
 
I will build your shrine!

444
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,320
Immortal Han, I will build your shrine!

445
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,260
Immortal Han, I will build your shrine!

446
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:36,110
 All cunning schemes and noble dreams undone 

447
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,670
 return alike to dust. 

448
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,850
 Only the nature remains unchanged. 

449
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,490
 This journey will really take me a long way. 

450
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,165
 

451
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:54,840
 After all these years, 

452
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,190
 Jiayuan City still looks the same. 

453
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,992
 Where has Qu Hun gone? 

454
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:03,290
 I'll have to find him before returning
to Yellow Maple Valley. 

455
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,360
You lazy bum! Always slacking off!

456
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,030
Is this how I taught you to work?

457
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,070
So clumsy.

458
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,740
You people are just hopeless!

459
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,280
Welcome, sir!

460
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,010
You've come to the right place.

461
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,510
We're famous for food and drink!

462
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,070
Even nobles from the capital

463
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,070
can't stop singing our praises!

464
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,510
Let me introduce our menu.

465
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,590
We've got:

466
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,550
steamed lamb, steamed bear paw, steamed deer tail,

467
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,150
roasted duck, roasted chick, roasted goose,

468
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,400
braised dishes, marinated duck,
soy chicken, smoked meats,

469
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,450
preserved belly, dried sausages...

470
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,740
I'm not here to eat.

471
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Ah, I see. You must be here for information.

472
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,920
Sir, ask away.

473
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,030
In this whole area, there's nothing I don't know.

474
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,400
Go ahead. Ask!

475
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,480
There's no secret in Jiayuan City
that I don't know!

476
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,220
 Just like old times. 

477
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,220
I heard the Mo Residence was taken over
by the Five-Color Sect.

478
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,510
Jiayuan City hasn't had the Mo family in ages.

479
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,000
After their old master passed,

480
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,280
everything went downhill.

481
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,400
Then they crossed the Five-Color Sect
who used to be their allies

482
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,320
and got wiped out overnight.

483
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,920
It was brutal.

484
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,320
Later on, the Five-Color Sect moved out entirely.

485
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,590
Said they pledged allegiance

486
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,070
to some bigwig in the capital.

487
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,440
Anyone from the Mo family still alive?

488
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,000
No one.

489
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,280
Madam Mo and the household
were all slaughtered by those bastards.

490
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,700
We neighbors had to handle the aftermath
in secret.

491
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,550
The dead deserve dignity.

492
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,180
You were righteous.

493
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,000
Waiter!

494
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,880
Coming!

495
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,150
What can I get you, sir?

496
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,540
Here, try this.

497
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,140
Enjoy, sir.

498
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,590
Sir, this item looks quite old.

499
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,880
Is there a story behind it?

500
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,840
Ah, I almost forgot.

501
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,760
I picked it up while helping to collect remains
at the Mo Residence.

502
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,710
I had the appraiser take a look.

503
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,710
They said there's nothing special about it.

504
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,290
So we hung it up like a wind bell.

505
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,805
To be honest,

506
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:11,320
I had some ties with the Mo family back then.

507
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,190
But it's been years.

508
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,010
Everything's changed.

509
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,280
Would you be willing to part with this?

510
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,320
Just something to remember them by.

511
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,550
Sir, I can't possibly charge you.

512
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,960
Back in the day, my friends and I
were often helped by the Mos.

513
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,590
And besides, it's not worth anything anyway.

514
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,070
If you knew the Mo family,

515
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,230
of course it should go to you.

516
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,230
How can I ask for payment?

517
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,304
But if you really want to show appreciation,

518
00:43:39,304 --> 00:43:42,590
how about supporting my tavern?

519
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,110
I'll whip up a few special dishes for you.

520
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,890
Just a moment, don't go!

521
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:01,780
Sir! I've prepared a few of our best dishes!

522
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,850
Sir?

523
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:07,939
What's this?

524
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,480
 This talisman repels evil and clears the air. 

525
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,260
 Do not remove it. 

526
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,360
 Good people are always rewarded. 

527
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,920
 Remember. 

528
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,490
 Remember. 

529
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,360
I'll remember.

530
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,740
I'll remember.

531
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,395
No wonder he looked familiar.

532
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:30,855
I'd like to ask something.

533
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:35,541
He stays youthful for decades.

534
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,180
I must've met an immortal!

535
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,424
From now on, my tavern

536
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:49,866
will be called "Immortal's Blessing."

537
00:44:49,866 --> 00:44:53,316
I'm renaming it to Immortal's Blessing, you hear?

538
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,880
I met an immortal today!

539
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,480
- Sir...
- From now on, this place will be called

540
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,300
Immortal's Blessing!

541
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,540
 

542
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:29,270
 ♫ Shards of dreams inside a dream ♫ 

543
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:35,158
 ♫ A pale moon falls into mirrored skies ♫ 

544
00:45:35,158 --> 00:45:38,669
 ♫ Years slipped by as I lingered on ♫ 

545
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:41,111
 ♫ Old scenes rise again ♫ 

546
00:45:41,111 --> 00:45:44,472
 ♫ Too hard to forget ♫ 

547
00:45:44,472 --> 00:45:49,257
 ♫ Easier just to miss ♫ 

548
00:45:49,257 --> 00:45:55,772
 ♫ They say the past fades like smoke ♫ 

549
00:45:55,772 --> 00:46:01,668
 ♫ But looking back still stirs the ache ♫ 

550
00:46:01,668 --> 00:46:05,268
 ♫ This noisy world, this lonely page ♫ 

551
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:07,690
 ♫ Swept away by time ♫ 

552
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,811
 ♫ Eyes once looked far ♫ 

553
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:15,252
 ♫ Now lost in the shift ♫ 

554
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:18,373
 ♫ Autumn winds stir ♫ 

555
00:46:18,373 --> 00:46:20,734
 ♫ Smoke curls once more ♫ 

556
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:23,899
 ♫ Like clouds on the edge of sky ♫ 

557
00:46:23,899 --> 00:46:27,980
 ♫ Returning to my eyes ♫ 

558
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,260
 ♫ Looking back from the mountaintop ♫ 

559
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,448
 ♫ Time lost its name ♫ 

560
00:46:34,448 --> 00:46:37,689
 ♫ Was it yesterday ♫ 

561
00:46:37,689 --> 00:46:41,610
 ♫ Or tomorrow? ♫ 

562
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,251
 ♫ The world has changed ♫ 

563
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:47,455
 ♫ Beyond recall ♫ 

564
00:46:47,455 --> 00:46:49,331
 ♫ Time will fade ♫ 

565
00:46:49,331 --> 00:46:54,812
 ♫ All the words ever spoken ♫ 

566
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:58,550
 ♫ Only this longing remains ♫ 

567
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:04,655
 ♫ Crossing centuries and days ♫ 

568
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:11,534
 ♫ In a fleeting moment we call eternity ♫ 

569
00:47:11,534 --> 00:47:18,673
 ♫ In a fleeting moment called eternity ♫
